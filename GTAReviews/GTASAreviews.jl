{"product_id": "12120", "page": 2, "page_order": 4, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-02-18", "text": "Despite being 14 years old, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas remains as one of the best games out there. Most people nowadays use San Andreas as meme material for their Youtube videos, and SFMs, but there's more to the game than that. It offers a vast open world with impressive visuals, interesting mechanics, and lots of content. San Andreas is a direct upgrade to Vice City, taking the best things from it, and from GTA 3, in order to make a great game.\nYou play as Carl Johnson, a former Grove Street Families gang member, that ran away from his past after losing some of his friends and family to the cold streets of Los Santos. After moving to the East Cost and staying there for a few years, he recieves a call from his brother Sean Johnson, also known as Sweet. Carl's mother has been murdered in a failed assassination attempt against Sweet. After hearing the terrible news, Carl packs his bags and heads back home. After arriving to Los Santos, he is intercepted by a squad of corrupt police officers, known as C.R.A.S.H. The head of the unit, Frank Tenpenny, personally went after Carl in order to frame him for the murder of a police officer, just to have Carl do his dirty work for him. After C.R.A.S.H is finished with Carl, they uncuff him and ditch him in enemy gang territory. Carl now has to deal with the loss of his mother, do Tenpenny's dirty work, and assist Sweet with whatever he needs so he can prove himself and get back in the gang.\nI'll be honest, the story in this game is great. The characters have emotion, and you actually care for them. And there is a lot of character development, just how it should be. I would be spoiling the game if I discussed this further, so I'll stop and move on to the gameplay.\nIt's fantastic. The open world is huge and full of things to do. There are three major cities in the game, them being Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas. The game has three phases, and you move on to each city after the end of a phase. Each phase has around 20+ missions, with other missions in between said phases. These tend to be around the county in several places of the three major cities, like the forest area of Angel Pine and the other counties, or the Desert section of the game later on. There is a total of 100 missions in the game, 15 of them being optional. So there is a fair amount of content in this game, unlike in other games where most of the content is just side stuff, and the story very short. It's not the case here.\nSan Andreas has some light RPG elements, such as being able to improve your weapon skill, player strength, and getting better stats overall. These aren't too important, and you can easily beat the game playing as a scrawny Carl Johnson. You will sometimes get better at certain things automatically, like using bikes frequently will improve your Bike Skill, or running constantly increasing your Stamina. The only time when a skill is a requirement, is during the mission Amphibious Assault in phase 2 of the game. You need to have a Lung Capacity (upgraded by swimming) of atleast 5% in order to start this mission. If you have a Lung Capacity of zero, you will trigger a\n.\nThis game also has a turf system, in which you can take enemy Hoods for your own gang. Taking over a Hood will open up a constant flow of cash, in which you can reap the rewards straight from your home in Grove Street. However, enemy gangs will also attack your territory, so you need to defend it from time to time. Don't worry though, attacks can only occur when you're in Los Santos, so if you're across the map, you won't need to run back home just to defend your turf.\nThere are a few other major things, but I'd rather not make the wall of text even longer. The shooting and driving are both pretty well designed. Most cars handle really well, and the gunplay is pretty good. The flying, on the other hand, is a complete pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665sometimes. You better be ready to learn to fly, because you'll need it to progress in the story. Don't worry though, that's a little over halfway through the game, so you're safe for a couple of hours.\nIt's very, very,\nimportant that you read this part carefully.\nYou really need to downgrade this game using the following guide:\nRockstar decided to cut some songs from the game because of licensing issues or something, so instead of getting it sorted out they pulled the plug on it. Not to mention the Steam version of San Andreas does not support modding.\n. Even if you don't care about modding or the radio songs, I strongly recommend that you still downgrade the game and mod it with the files in the guide. It will drastically improve the game, and take the best out of all the San Andreas versions out there. The world will look prettier, the HUD will be HD, and there will be countless other fixes. You can skip on some of them, but the majority of it really improves the game.\nPlease don't let this discourage you from purchasing this game, it only takes a few minutes to downgrade the game and install the patches. It's literally just drag and drop, nothing complicated.\nYeah, it's pretty nice. The radio songs are from the 90s, so if that's your thing you'll probably love it. If it isn't, just give it a shot. This game introduced me to some great music.\nNo, you don't, thankfully. You don't have to worry about installing anything else (besides the optional but almost mandatory patches from the guide). Just download and play, as it should be.\nIt's pretty good, I would say. I've never really experienced any problems, just the occasional crashing once in a blue moon. It's an old game, so you should be able to run it on pretty much anything.\nThis game is a must have. It is actually one of the best games out there. Worth absolutely every penny, and you should buy it at full price if you can. There's really not much else to say, it's just amazing. I don't usually rate games with numbers, but I give this a 9/10. Loads of content, took the best out of the previous games and created a masterpiece, great story and memorable characters. Brilliant voice acting and delivery. A worthy sequel to Vice City.\nBuy this game.", "hours": 165.0, "username": "\u2234\u00a0Snake\u00a0\u2234", "products": 116, "early_access": false}

All I had to do was one minor mouse fix & I was set. After I completed it, I couldn't wait till I fire up San Andreas.\nBoy, do I regret that decision.\n- The game crashes at random points, sometimes consecutively about three times, so save scumming was a necessity.\n- Frame rate limiter being off makes the game smoother but breaks fundamental mechanics of the game, like swimming. CJ swims at the same speed regardless if you hold a sprint (or swim faster) button or not. So in this case, you're forced to switch limiter back on. It's still playable but higher frame rate means smoother experience & that's a fact.\n- Due to forced frame rate limiter, aiming with a mouse is less precise & more frustrating. Feels like an input delay.\n- Mouse steering is unbelievably sensitive. You can switch it off but if you have it as an option, then it should work flawlessly.\n- Mouse sensitivity settings don't save at all, making you change it every time you fire up the game, unless I'm missing something here.\n- AI is the most moronic I've seen. Crashes into vehicles & walls (especially on freeways), speeds up unnaturally, recruiting gang members makes no difference in combat considering the fact they are badly programmed, territory take-over was tedium due to enemy AI running away from the battlezone, racing missions are easy since your opponents crash into obstacles, AI sometimes drive into walls indefinitely & there is probably more.\n- Animations are laughably inferior to the previous two titles.\n- RPG system feels pointless. It would be better without it. In fact, one mission forces you to grind swimming skills.\n- Dating mechanic is broken. Heck, dating mechanic shouldn't even exist in the game to begin with. It's nothing but annoyance.\n- Territory take-over is boring & sleep-inducing. 'Our Hood Is Under Attack' can screw right off.\n- Very few characters are interesting. The rest of the crew is dull & nothing interesting.\n- Most of the missions are too long & the fact the game likes to crash, doesn't make it any more enjoyable to play.\nMost of the missions make no sense to the story & feel like filler poop.\n- Huge empty world with very little to explore.\n- Some cars fishtail like crazy regardless if you manage to take control of the vehicle. Probably purposely implemented due to RPG system.\n- Cool features removed from San Andreas that were in Vice City, like pizza boy missions, rampage tokens & helping cops stop the criminal they are chasing after & rewarding you 50 $. If you happen to help a cop, you'll get a one star wanted level. lol ok\n- Most of the side content is repetitive.\n- During some missions, vehicles you'd think to destroy them & try to strategize your escape or something, end up invincible even against explosives.\n- Hit & collision detection are terrible.\nIf you combine all of the above into one package, you can clearly see how bad it is compare to Vice City.\nAnd no, folks. Having more content doesn't automatically mean it's a better game than previous titles.\nDisappointed. Sequel with more content but less polish & lesser quality overall.

It has been famous on \"more bugs, less fix\", due to some fixing on did not appear on Steam. XBox-controller not supported and crash if you mod.\nElse downgrade this before you play:\n[REVIEW]\nPlayed this 2 times on pirated Chinese version, but not 100% completion, only story. Have around 200 hours+ if you want me count. After 4 years, it is time for me to fly back this legal copy. Right now still at San Fierro and trying to plant a bug on a cargo ship.\nGameplay -- 8/10\nGraphic ---- 9/10\n(based on when the game is published, not today standard)\nStory ------ 9/10\nAudio ----- 5/10\nDeveloper & Support --- 5/10\n(Is this game supported on late PC until now, and dev dedication on this old title)\n**I judge this game mainly based on 3D Universe, including 4 titles that involve Liberty City and Vice City.\nNot from HD Universe such as GTA IV & GTA V.**\nPro:\n- Story more interesting than all GTA titles before HD Universe.\n- CJ is a well-developed characters before HD Universe.\n- Stats system that is even absense in GTA IV.\n- Many things to do, even not all of them are perfected, but at least enjoyable and playable. Even GTA IV do not have it.\n- Groove 4 Life. (Brothers forever)\n- Great sense of Humor, I like The Truth, Woozie, Catalina and a vaeirty of jokes.\n- Even some of the characters' vehicles in mission has their own unique License Plate. Lots of things to discover.\n- Best collectibles mechanic in 3D Universe.\n- Map not enough large? Add mod!\n- I do mission not just kill people, but I feel the interactions between human. Unlike Claude and Tommy.\n- GTA title that took place in oldest year. That explains why you see Claude.\n- Can abuse glitch to obtain OP Invicible/unique print vehicle.\n- More in-depth vehicle mechanic. Especially the introduction of proper plane in 3D Universe.\n- World Map updated well according to stories. Ballas now fight along with polices when I am \"not supposed\" to come to Los Santos.\n- Not too pricy nowadays. Worth to buy than other GTA 3D Universe titles.\nNeutral:\n- I am Chinese and I feel offended when they design the Ran Fa Li and Woozie as gangster boss with disabilities. As well as hinting that Chinese only rely on Fortune/FengShui on their rest of their life. But from the other view, Woozie is more interesting guy as how he act like gangster boss, not a super evil, and did not die like the Japanese gangster boss in Liberty City Story. (Idiotic suicide and BS)\n- Collectibles usually appear at where you do missions. But like all 3D Universe, you don't have a clue, and sometimes on weird places. Bully: Scholar Edition did a better job but the location mark maybe too precise.\n- OG Log Rap is funny but weird, annoying.\n- CJ is not a drug addict, not super evil villan unlike the others protagonist in 3D Universe. But Catalina agreed that he is an idiot.\n- Slopes in San Fierro is unatural, but post a challenges in car chasing missions.\nCons:\n- CRASH because of audio on Radio Station, they concern on money and copyright but dunno how to fix PROPERLY (for missing files).\n- CRASH because of someone trying to speak in cutscene.\n- CRASH because of other variety reasons such as not properly exit on a Horse Betting Machine, after a cutscene finish, and etc etc. Sometimes Freeze and xxxx my whole gaming PC. (Pls, no reliable solutions on some of them, Google yourself)\n- 25 FPS with Frame Limiter on. 120 FPS without on and my character die while trying to steal item, due to BS collision. (Solved with Nvidia Inspector, 60 FPS)\n- Default control is weird. You will get furious by the 1st time you perform Low Rider Dance. Set Steer Up to K, Down to I. Special Control to J, L, G, T. And add arrow keys as Alternative.\n- No Windows mode. Troublesome if crash and might force a restart.\n- Idiot AI Driver especially cops that simply force their way out and let you obtain unnecessary 1 star. Can xxxx some of your missions.\n- Getting gold (or even Bronze) in Driver School is too hard. As hard as License Test in Grand Turismo 2 Simulation Mode.\n- No Controller Support...\n- No Official Chinese Language. They have to download pirated one via China websites. Or take the risk to mod.", "hours": 8.4, "username": "PichuYang", "products": 28, "early_access": false}

The Steam version SUCKS.\nI remember when I was a young lad and I used to go over to a friends house. He had this game and we would spend hours just screwing around killing random people to see how high of a wanted level we could get. The cheats were so fun to use during that time and like everyone else we would write them down on paper and keep it inside the game case. Those were amazing times.\nAbout a few years later when I was in middle school, a different friend and I would take turns playing through the story, just as a race to see who could beat it the fastest. He won because I got the Mad Dogg glitch, because I used a ton of cheat codes and it caused the glitch to happen. Though I still restarted the story and finally beat it myself. I sped through the story and still had an amazing time with it, I loved everything about it. All the characters were very memorable, and the protagonist was somehow really relatable.\nRecently I have played through the story in-depth, and I see how much effort Rockstar put into this game, and all the ambition and thought they put into this game. I have a special bias to it because it was a part of my childhood, and one of the few games I enjoy just as much as I did when I used to play it. It was basically Vice City and GTA III polished completely and designed to be timeless. It is the best sandbox experience that GTA offered in the 3D universe. You could blow through the story and still have dozens, if not, hundreds of hours of fun after the game was over. Even after 100%ing the game. The 3d universe single-handedly inspired so many games and pioneered the way people do open world action games. I think this was the biggest reason for it.\nAll those hundreds of hours do not factor in mods, which San Andreas has one of the most active communities for. You can find pretty much anything to mod into your game, and there is even multiplayer modes which make the game more versatile. Vehicle mods for those who want more immersion, and map mods so you dont have to be limited to just San Andreas. The possibilities are completely endless with this game, and thats why it attracts so many people who want to play this for different reasons. Games dream of becoming this well recieved, and Rockstar has done it here. Not just here, but in every generation since the PS2. This game is virtually perfect, whatever flaws it has, they go completely over my head when I play this. It is one of my favorite games.\nLike I say though, the Steam version is trash. Downgrade it. There is a special tool that does it for you, just make sure to back your saves up, and redownload the game so you have a fresh copy. You can thank me later, it will help you so much.", "hours": 61.5, "username": "DD", "products": 155, "found_funny": 8, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 47, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-12-13", "text": "G'day, mates!\nI like this game. It is almost a piece of art, although a rather plain one. I like the invisible goals of this game, as it can make crowds laugh, friendships happen, and love to come forward. There is just one tiny problem with any such game, and that is \"the multiplayer-functionality\". The only problem with any multiplayer game is that they are multiplayer games. I have been stuck in the so-called \"DMG- elo hell\", for half a year. I have been constantly top-fragging, but by a miracle I have far too often somehow been able to lose 14-16 with over 30 frags total and over 15 frags more than anyone on my team. Sure, there are exceptions, such as the game that I won last week with 44 frags and only 1 player on my team getting over 20. We won that game 16-14, by the way. I don't have that many friends who are good in this game, and no one I know trains themselves in the art of eSports. I have dozens of friends who play with me, but lately I've been wanting to play in a more challenging skillgroup, as frustration is salty, toxic and a close neighbour. I wish many more people would like this game and practice so they would get on my level, as it is rather difficult to proceed in life when surrounded by accidents and mistakes, and by that I don't mean people, but rather the actions they take. If only I was a little bit better so that I could teach people how to do stuff correctly, but as I am not good enough, I shall just review this game.\ngrand theft auto san andreas is a classic first-person-shooter. It combines teamwork, intelligence and individual skill to be able to create harmony between victory and loss. The terrorists either plant a bomb or hold hostages, as they are supposed to be the bad guys, and every player in this game gets to be the bad guys as much as they get to be the good guys. The counter-terrorists either defuse the bomb or rescue the hostages, as they are the good guys. Now, let me repeat again what I told you, the reader(s), before. grand theft auto san andreas combines teamwork, intelligence and individual skill to be able to create harmony between victory and loss. Now think about those three for a moment! If any of those three factors are not on par with the others, it will affect the game and the results of the harmony. In other words, if any of those three factors are not on par with the other two, the player's skillgroup and ranking will drop. If one has all three, they will stand on the top. However, if one player alone has to compensate for the whole team's lack of individual skill and intelligence, the teamwork cannot function. I know, I know, this is just me complaining about bad luck and lack of skill, but bear with me! It is difficult to carry games, as many people can imagine, but why would one need to carry if everyone played to win, right? If one goes to a match with a friend and just plays to have fun, others will just suffer. That is a fact, and not a statement. I play to win, but I seem to most usually encounter people who are satisfied with their abilities. I, however, am not satisfied with their abilities, as they will lose unless carried against a worse team.\nI am tired of only being on the top of my team. If you are still reading this, thank you. Like this review if you liked it(obviously), and have a nice day, even if you'd be surrounded by defeat and depression. Keep going! Keep moving on, and emerge victorious in life, in videogames, or in whatever you want to be!

And they were damn right!\nI love this game so much and it is extremely replayable. You can customise CJ - make him wear clothes, make him fat, make him thin, give him tattoos, change his hairstyle. And the attention to detail is incredible. If your CJ is fat and you take money from a pedestrian, he will say things like, 'This'll help keep my belly full!' Similarly, you can customise cars, buy houses, do side missions... It is full of content and could easily compete alongside HD universe games when you ignore the graphics.\nI can say with confidence, this could easily be the best GTA game ever made - better than GTA V - if it were kept exactly the same but with HD graphics and improved vehicle handling.

I go to the gym and then I try to leave. It cuts, I walk out and then I walk back into the gym. I'm thus trapped inside the gym.\n2. I'm doing the 'home invastion' mission for Ryder, I'm creeping along and then I go to pick up a crate, and I die out of nowhere, for no reason.\nI've barely started playing it and it's such a wreck. I DO NOT RECOMMEND buying this, and until they update, that's where I'll stand.", "hours": 4.1, "user_id": "76561198285863966", "username": "goldengrahams", "products": 29, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false}

I was proven wrong.\nGrand Theft Auto : San Andreas is an awesome game. How good is it, though? Well, here's what I want to say.\nThis is my first GTA game at the time of my writing this, and boy, I'm glad I played it. The characters are the first thing I'll talk about here. Carl Johnson, or CJ, is a great character to play as. His backstory is quite compelling in some ways, although there are one or two characters in the series who have better backstories. Throughout the game, he has some great moments, and some hilarious ones. The main people in the Grove Street families, like Sweet (CJ's brother), Ryder and Big Smoke (CJ's old friends), and Kendl (CJ's sister), all have some great moments, especially in the first quarter of the game. Many people know Big Smoke from the well-known giant order scene early in the game, but I feel those people should actually play the game, because there's so many moments that trump that one in terms of comedy or overall greatness. Officer Frank Tenpenny, voiced by the one and only Samuel L. Jackson, is also one of the best villains in video games history. Enough said. There's also many, many other memorable characters in the game, like The Truth, Cesar, Woozie, etc. I won't spoil exactly who they are, but trust me, they are great.\nThe reason I said the first quarter of the game above is because I feel there's four quarters to the game. The first takes place in Los Santos, CJ's home and the home of the Grove Street Families, and a lot of the characters in the game. The second takes place in the rural area outside of Los Santos, where CJ gets into some antics with an unstable woman named Catalina, where he befriends The Truth, and does some other things. Halfway through the game, and most of the third quarter, and, in my opinion, the finest part of the game, takes place in the big city of San Fierro, where CJ meets Woozie and the triads, gets into some crazy stuff with Cesar, and is also home to the most overrated mission in the game, Supply Lines. Honestly, it took me 3 tries, and it was nowhere near as hard as people said it was. The rest of the third quarter takes place in the hot, rural desert area outisde of San Fierro. There, you go to flight school, which is also overrated, and do some flying missions. You also do some missions for The Truth, which are pretty cool. The final fourth quarter, and the second best part of the game, takes place in Las Venturas, where you do stuff for rival Italian gangs, pull off a big casino heist, and a couple other things. Then, you travel back to Los Santos, tie up loose ends, and the game wraps up quite smoothly.\nThe missions start off normal, doing stuff for your homies in Grove Street, like getting more guns, offing rival gang members, but then, it gets awesome, brutal, and ridiculous. Eventually, you rob banks, steal a tanker, kill a bunch of construction workers because they dissed one of your friends, frame a DA, steal some cars, save some refugees on a cargo ship from Vietnamese gangs, break into a secret military base, steal a jetpack, then use the same jetpack to get onto a moving train to steal a weird flask of green goo, ride a motorcycle into a moving jet, then detonate explosive charges to bring down the plane while parachuting down, save a washed up rapper from committing suicide, hijack a jet while it's in the air, steal dynamite from a quarry, pull off a big casino heist, and escaping on the roof while a helicopter chases after you, and finally, ending it all off with battling rival gangs and old friends who betrayed you in a climactic final assault. And that's not all the story has to offer. There are some actually hard missions here, and often times, beating those missions is easier said than done.\nThe radio stations here are all unique, and great to listen to. My favourites are Radio Los Santos, which includes actually good rap with meaning unlike today's mainstream garbage, where all they care about is money, women, and cool cars. Kendrick Lamar is good, though. Favourite songs from there are It Was a Good Day by Ice Cube, and Eazy-er Said Than Dunn by Eazy-E. Radio X, where there's awesome alternative rock, especially the songs Personal Jesus by Depeche Mode, and Cult of Personality by Living Colour. And finally, CSR 103.9, and my favourite song from there is Motownphilly by Boyz II Men. SF-UR is also good, but not as good as those three.\nOverall, what is my opinion on GTA : San Andreas? It's simply fantastic. Great characters, great story, memorable moments and missions, and a great set of radio stations you can listen to while you cruise down the road at high speeds at night.\nFinal score : 10/10.", "hours": 55.1, "user_id": "76561198294574921", "username": "DarkBlueHD", "products": 98, "early_access": false}

Yes, yes it does, hell, i'd give it a 11 out of 10. This game was by far the best in the whole GTA series. It is by far Rockstars master peice.\nHowever, this game is best to be played on a console, NOT A PC. I'll never understand people why that brand the PC the master race. It's not, if there is one thing i've learnt about a PC is that there is always a problem, problems you never get on a console.\nIt broke my heart to see this game have so many problems, crashes and freezing. Sadly old games, even new ones will always have problems. I love this game, but i simply had ugly problems trying to get the game to work and when it did finally work (and save), it will freeze, crash or worse. Legendary games like this do not deserve such horrible problems.\nThis game on the console will get a solid 11 out of 10, but for the PC, it's going to have to get a painful upsetting 3 out of 10.\nThe graphic are lovely, the game play (controller) is decent, the story is brilliant, the map and open world is beautiful, but the problems are simply devistating.

I've played this game since 2006, so when I was a very little kid and I still play it even today. I completed the main storyline about 4 times.\nThe storyline is simply amazing, it keeps you going, it's very easy to mod (you'll need to downgrade your game to v1 version), unlimited character customization, unlimited freeroam, alot of fun mini-games, tons of fun cheat codes, unofficial multiplayer mods (SA-MP/MTA) with many gamemodes which are still popular even today!\nThe graphics may of course be dated, but keep in mind, this is a 2004 game and graphics don't really matter when you have everything else.\nHowever there are few bugs in this game if you play it on modern PCs, most of them can be fixed by turning on Frame Limiter and installing Silent's patch, I'd also recommend Widescreen patches if you want to play true widescreen.\nOtherwise this game is just pure art. There are even more things than I've mentioned, but that's the main things I wanted to say! You won't regret playing this game at all.\nThank you for one of my most childhood memories, Rockstar.", "hours": 47.5, "username": "UnKn0wN \u208d\u208d (\u0e07 \u02d8\u03c9\u02d8 )\u0e27 \u207e\u207e", "products": 185, "early_access": false}

It definitely has a well-sized world and Rockstar's famous do-not-ask-for-logic-and-enjoy-crude-humor is right on spot. The development of the main character is a huge improvement to predecessing games of the series. Nevertheless, I still think this game is way overrated. Besides the points I mentioned in my first review (see below), playing GTA San Andreas some hours more aspects it suffers from:\nDespite the game world being well-sized, it has a poor layout, at least outside of city areas. Roads follow an incomprehensible pattern and getting from A to B is just a chore. This is sad actually, since GTA VC was an improvement over GTA 3, which itself had a strange layout of roads but was easier to navigate due to its smaller size.\nNext, GTA SA suffers from a poor porting to PC, which shows best in change of game physics after frame limiter is enabled. This is actually neccessary to accomplish several missions.\nAt last: This game is just too complex. I can see the idea of having to care about CJ to improve his chances in the world (eat at regular intervals, training muscles to hit harder and increase health, training on treadmill to increase stamina and increase health, caring for his girlfriend, earning respect in the hood, leading a gang and conquering territory, shooting stuff with guns to improve his gun shooting skill, shooting stuff with SMGs to improve his SMG shooting skill, shooting stuff with shotguns to improve his shotgun shooting skill, driving cars to improve his car driving skill, driving bikes to improve bike driving skills) are an interesting addition to the character development and I am glad they kept some of it at least in GTA 5, but damn: This is GTA and not some RPG!\nSo my final verdict: Better skip this one unless you have way too much time on your hands.\nOld review:\nWorse graphics than its predecessors, awkward controls, stupid minigame sidequests. There may be a great story but due to the game's inaccessability, three hours playing made me just want to quit it once and for all. In contrast to every other game of the\nGTA series, this did not catch me in the first place. I honestly do not understand why it is so acclaimed.

Anyways, It was in that year Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas came out. In 200Dickety the video game landscape was such that if a game wasn't Grand Theft Auto it desperately wanted to be Grand Theft Auto, whether or not that fits the tone or setting of the game be damned (see also: Final Fight Streetwise). If 2001's Grand Theft Auto III or 2002's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City didn't already do it, San Andreas was the market title which cemented open world games as the hot new thing to be, in addition to also cementing the tone future open world games from Crackdown to Saint's Row would take. What I'm saying is, in short, that San Andreas the seinfeld of open world games.\nI'm just going to go ahead and say this is more a personal retrospective than a straightforward review - By 2011 the game had sold 21 million copies worldwide and the game recieved essentially uniform critical acclaim upon release, so from a objective standpoint there's little i could say that hasn't been said a billion times before.\nIn terms of setting and gameplay, San Andreas was a bogglingly vast marvel that pushed the PlayStation 2 and it's contemporaries to the limits with impeccable detail and scope; Though the aging Pre-RAGE iterations of Rockstar's mainstay engine and the hardware were starting to show their age in '05 the game managed to pull off a impressive sense of scale and detail. A lot of this is down to clever technical trickery, but even without the creative use of fog and motion blur to make the map seem bigger than it is (try using mods to circumvent the draw distance cab), it's still decently large and very detailed. The game has a breadth and diversity in environments that wasn't seen in III or Vice City and was sorely missing from IV: Gritty graffiti-caked buildings in slums in Los Santos,  Sleepy blue-collar rural towns, sweeping and vibrant city lights in San Fierro, A vast desert that even now practically oozes the harsh baking heat of the real deal, and the glitzy sleazy neon-rimmed sprawl of Las Venturas are some of the environs that await a player. The humanoid characters haven't aged well at all (Rockstar was never really all that great at avoiding the uncanny valley until fairly recently), but the environments are still a pretty superb case of making the most of hardware that seems almost unbelievably quaint these days and was aging even at the time. However, Rockstar was never great at making stable games and San Andreas' raw ambition and scale certainly didn't do it any favors there. Nasty bugs are virtually everywhere - some of which can permenantly end a run more than 2/3rds of the way into the game. Likewise, the engine's FPS limiter (which we'll speak more on later) is bugged and only runs the game at 25fps instead of the intended 30 without end-user modifications.\nThe writing is pretty damn great even if it kind of makes no sense in the big picture, too. The characters all have their quirks and unique personality traits, making them extremely memorable, and they tend to be a lot more well rounded than even most of GTA V's cast. Even the bad guys have their human sides for the most part, and the good...well, good bad guys have connections to other characters and overarching interests that keep them relatable and interesting. The plot is full of twists and turns. Though San Andreas' plot is more full of holes than the pope's cheese plates, it's fast paced enough to keep the player engaged and it doesn't take itself too seriously so i didn't even notice the lack of cohesiveness until i'd already beat it. It's not all sunshine and flowers on the writing end, though - I've always thought the GTA series had something of a south park style \"reactionary\" sense of humor that tries to make anything outside the status quo seem bad. With regards to how it approaches that, San Andreas definitely is a prime example of the aforementioned style. A lot of the humor and jokes are at the expense of LGBT people and other minority groups and done in that signature \"ha ha only kidding\" way; Even if the game came out in 2005 that aspect shouldn't really get a pass. I've always liked the Saints' row games' way of handling that sort of bawdy take-no-prisoners humor more - The audacity and shock factors are maintained, but without being at anyone's expense.\nGameplay is very solid, too; most of the missions and side jobs do a excellent job of showcasing the game's world, inner workings and secrets. It's not - with a few exceptions - overly difficult, and there's enough variety and synergy with the quirky setting to keep most players interested. However, even with everything the game has to offer it falls into the nasty little pitfall known as repetition; A lot of the side jobs like the taxi/paramedic/vigilante missions and the turf wars are very heavy with padding (To the point that some cases, like the taxi missions, require you to service 50 passengers before bestowing a not especially useful buff upon you). In addition to that, each of the three islands also has a unique fetch quest requiring the player to retrieve however many specific trinkets, and this also gets old quick. I almost get the impression Rockstar was trying to make a game that wasn't really supposed to be beaten 100%...which to be fair, is almost certainly the case.\nIn terms of porting quality, the game's PC conversion is great by '05 standards but kind of a bag of hurt on any vaguely modern (i.e. past the Core 1 CPU architecture) system. Adding support for modern gamepads, 16:9 and 21:9 widescreen without stretching the hud, and many other factors is oft left to the end user, and god help anyone who tries turning off the frame limiter. The PC port is very conspicuously a relic of the era when devs didn't bother coding the game to compensate for increased FPS past the 35-45FPS Pentium 4-era hardware would provide over a Playstation 2, Gamecube or Original Xbox, and it shows. The orange, hazy feel of the PS2 port is completely lost and in fact most of the quasi-shaders the original release employed are gone; these can be restored by mods if a prospective player would so wish. There's a lot more that could be said here, but Vadim M. and his narrator SpooferJahk\nthat showcases the shortcomings much better than I could. A picture says a thousand words and that video runs at 30fps, and by my math 30,000 words is a slight increase over...uh, however many i said there. One last note about conversion quality, though - This version didn't get the achievements that were added to the X360 and mobile ports.\nEnough boring tech talk, how does the gameplay hold up? Overall, better than I thought it would. As I mentioned, SA almost manages to feel a bit more spirited than V does at times. For it's shortcomings that have come to surface in the twelve years since the initial release, San Andreas has stood the test of time surprisingly well. Granted, I loved the game as a adolescent in 2005 and i still have a soft spot for it now so i might be a bit biased. Should you get San Andreas? Definitely at base price if you haven't ($12 USD isn't steep at all for what it brings to the plate), and i'd call it a must-have on sale. It'll run on virtually anything going back to a Pentium III, so it's great even if you're stuck with a older laptop or computer by circumstances. Be sure to grab\nand use it once installed; This will reinstate mod support and allow you to automatically install some fanmade patches for proper widescreen support and quashing some decade-old bugs Rockstar never got around to.", "hours": 0.1, "username": "Mr. \"RXJP Y HMB\" Argent", "products": 231, "early_access": false}

If you name it, this game has got it. Every one of these is perfect in arguably every way. Additionally, being a 13 year old game this October, its graphics still hold up pretty well.\nCons: None!\n10/10 game without a question.

During the mid 2000s this was my favorite game for the Ps2.\nI never got bored of it. Sadly the pc port is absolutely terrible. At least for the latest realeases of the game. Thankfully you can downgrade the game so that it can be moddable. Enough with the technical \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t, now its time for the honest review.\nIn my opinion this game is better than GTA V. The reason i say that is because when you ahve too musch realism in a sandbox game, it makes the game to slow. GTA San Andreas has more cheats than GTA V. WHY??, aren't the newer games suppose to surpass anything they had inj the previous titles. The main protagonist in this game has a reason to explore San Andreas. There are many memorable characters in this game. Such as Big Smoke. He has 2 quotes that i can never forget.\nThey are:\n\"All you had to do is follow the damn train CJ\"\nand\n\" I\u2019ll have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda.\"\nThe mods make this game even more funner, and you don't need to pay for any of them either, unlike GTA V sadly.\nIn conclusion, this is always going to be a memorable game to me. Maybe its because i played it alot om my PS2 or maybe  because its better than GTA V.\nFInal Verdict: 10/10", "hours": 39.0, "username": "Solid Noyz", "products": 152, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

It's fun raising chaos in this game, and I could spend hours and hours killing cops and enemy gang members. There are so many things you can do in this game. You can gamble and and get in debt, fly planes, jets, gunships, drive luxury sports cars, tanks, and monster trunks, making this fun to play with your imagination. Fortunately, mods are also allowed for this game, making it even more fun.\nOne problem with the steam version is that completing vigilante missions doesn't improve your armor, however that can also be fixed by mods.\nSound: 7/10\nVoice acting is okay, and weapon sounds are alright. The radio stations in this game also feature greatest music hits from the 70s-90s in all most music genres like Rap, Hip-Hop, and classical rock. Although if you don't want to listen to old hits, you can still put your own music in.\nStory: 6/10\nHas a long story and campaign, but I still wasn't very attached to it, or any of the characters. I was a little attached to Wuzzi though, but that might be because I'm also Asian lol.\nOverall: 7/10\nIt's an old game but still has a very good gameplay.

The game engine is based on RenderWare, developed by the British game developer Criterion Software. Twelve years on, San\ndoesn't have great graphics. It doesn't have great physics. But who cares? A game can't be measured for its graphics and\nis a perfect example of that.\nwill always be the best game of the series. My childhood is all here.\nIf the previous ones GTA's concentrated in one city, this new one take you to play in statewide.\nexpands the series' concept to encompass three entire cities, as well as the countryside between them. The gameplay is similar to the previous ones games, with a packing explosive set pieces and amazing action-movie-like. In fact, it's arguably the best game in the series.\nAs said before, the game occurs in 1992 in the West Coast-themed state of San Andreas, which is heavily based on California and Nevada. San Andreas is an island containing three cities. You'll begin the game in the city of Los Santos, which is based roughly on Los Angeles and consists of a mixture of ritzy downtown areas and the gangland ghettos of South Central. San Fierro is based on San Francisco, reproducing the real city's hilly terrain and ever-present fog. The game's third city is Las Venturas, which is a great take on early-'90s Las Vegas, complete with a strip full of casinos and the surrounding desert. San Andreas is definitely a much larger place than Vice City, and the growth of the player is handled intelligently. There are plenty of things to do both in and out of the cities, and the missions are especially well done and with a nice difficulty level.\nSan Andreas draws its inspiration from the ghetto and gangsta struggle films of the early '90s. And it is the stage for the arrival of the main character of the game, the eternal \"CJ\" - aka Carl Johnson. In San Andreas, you play your role. The game opens with Carl returning to Los Santos after spending the last five years in GTA III's Liberty City. But his homecoming isn't a happy one. He's returning home because his mother has been killed. Carl isn't on the ground for more than an hour before he's picked up by a pair of crooked cops and thrown right back into the middle of the street life he left Los Santos to avoid.\n____\nAs soon as you reach to Los Santos, you have the priority to reestablish the reputation of your gang, the Grove Street Families. The objective is to put your set back on the map. GSF has fallen into disarray over the last five years, and their influence is minimal at best. So you, along with the three other leaders of the gang, the long-winded Big Smoke, the dust-smoking Ryder, and your stubborn brother, Sweet, set out to take back the streets from your rivals, the Ballas, who have turned to dealing crack to earn money and gain influence in the hood. You established a set of missions to take back your territory, starting small with things like spray-painting over other gangs' tags (which is one of the many new types of actions that replace previous GTA games' more-generic hidden package collecting here), but quickly moving up to drive-bys and other acts of extreme gangsterism. But there's a whole lot more in\n.\nis perfect because joined action, comedy and a lot of interesting moments with other characters of the game. And doesn't all in game is about missions of \"CJ\". You'll have the chance to do a lot of other things, such physical activities, minigames, go to shops, or hairdresser/barber, and more. In fact, the game is very well thinking. These extracurricular activities are important to improve CJ's health, that will be central to do future missions.\nThe sights and sounds of San Andreas are incredibly amazing.\nhas improved textures that make the world more vibrant, signs more readable, and characters clearly more reals and less \"caricatured\". However, the framerate looks a little weak, but it's ok, because only really manifesting when the camera is moved around quickly or too many cars are on the road, but it can become distracting when it plays out during action sequences. Lastly, the game has support for control and works perfectly.\nNo more spoilers, now just put your focus on the game or if you played\nbefore, well, do like me, play it again. Believe in me when I say this game is one of the best games till date.", "hours": 1.5, "user_id": "76561198074867492", "username": "Dragon Force", "products": 408, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": false}

This was received in quite a mixed manner and the fact that Rockstar decided to abandon those RPG elements shows that they were a new but not necessarily good design decision back then.\nOn other ends San Andreas also did a lot of things right, for example the addition of the bicycle as well as the different kinds of usable air vehicles (planes, jets, helicopters) were new, just as completely new and crazy missions with never seen before design, save for maybe the infamous train mission that everyone hated.\nAll things considered San Andreas might divide some GTS fans into those who really enjoyed it and those who thought it to be a somewhat unwanted cousin of the main series.

Ending up swimming into a wall, I didn't enjoy it the first time.  I decided to reinstall the game at that point.\n\"An error occurred while updating Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (content file locked):\"\nkys\nSo I decided to give Steam administration abilities and still it didn't solve the issue.  Time to search some forums.\nAfter I did this, I found that people are having luck after checking for disk errors.  Now I'm just having bad luck (and I have tried getting this game to work for more than a hour now).\nOk I'm done screaming, oh wait I mean scanning, and finally\n\"No errors were found\"\nI don't think it's luck anymore.  I think it's just GTA: SA's fault now.  Verifying the game integrity just results with \"All files successfully verified\" even though there is no .exe main file like there was last time.  I'm just going to move on and purchase GTA IV.  Because I want to.\nP.S. I wasn't done screaming.

Seriously play as Fat CJ and try not to laugh, it's impossible!\nThere is also weapon skills which improve how you perform with certain weapons, the biggest ones is with some SMGs, the normal pistol and the Sawn-off Shotgun, where if you increase their levels enough, YOU CAN DUAL-WIELD THEM! HOW COOL IS THAT? It makes you feel like a total badass and you become so much more powerful.\nA fantastic story which I won't spoil, the reasoning of CJ returning to San Andreas abroad is really sad and you want to help him succeed.\nOne of the best cities in gaming, it squishes Vice City when it comes to detail, it crunchs Liberty City when it comes to sheer size, and it even beats HD Los Santos in GTA V due to having more things to do inside the city, I mean yea HD Los Santos is bigger, but the varation of land scapes is very lacking since there's only pretty much Beach, city and then desert for 90% of the map, while San Andreas includes all 3 of them, but also has forests, mountain ranges, casino areas and just much much more, hell you can even learn whole new fighting styles like Karate!\nHonestly this map has been fantastic to play on since day 1 and I can still play on it for years to come.\nLike I said the steam version isn't the same as a retail one, so use a downgrader to use mods.\nSpeaking of the steam version, it's locked at 25 FPS, exceeding that will brake the game sadly, however the older versions didn't have this issue.\nAlso some songs have been removed due to expired contracts, however they remain in the older versions.\nSome missions can cause newer players trouble, like the infamous Train mission and RC missions... which I had no issue on both myself when I started but hey to each their own.\nBest GTA overall, it stands against the test of time with pride and is easily an unforgetable experience that everyone needs to try.\nSo good infact, San Andreas still gets about 1 Million players to this day.", "hours": 9.9, "username": "\u0432\u03b9g\u0432angre\u03c7", "products": 266, "early_access": false}

They are completely irrelevant.\nIf you're a fan of open-world sandboxes, I can't recommend this game enough - especially this game has a special place in your heart from being a kid.\nAfter five years on the east coast, it's time to go home. Play as Carl \"CJ\" Johnson, the brother of Sweet, the leader of Grove Street Families, a dying gang set in Los Santos. With his gang dying and his mother killed by the Ballas, the sworn enemies of the Grove, CJ has to return home to set things right. But things get out of hand fast when he's picked up from the airport by three crooked cops, known as C.R.A.S.H., who used to pick on CJ before he left and made him do their dirty work for him. They frame him for the murder of an officer Pendelbury, a fine man I might add. In return for not arresting CJ for the murder, CJ now works for C.R.A.S.H. and must bend to their every whim.\nIn late 2014, Rockstar had to pull many songs from the game in order to avoid licensing issues, since the game was about to hit its 10th birthday. Additionally, the Steam version has many bugs that the retail (physical disc) edition had fixed with an official downloadable patch. Because of this, it's recommended to either \"downgrade\" (Google for \"San Andreas downgrader\") to convert the Steam version into the retail version, or purchase a physical disc copy from something like eBay or Amazon.

This game is possibly one of the greatest PS2 games i have ever played, and to play it today, around 7-9 years later, is astounding. GTA San Andreas is amazing, without any DLC to make it better. Is even better because there is no DLC so its a one time purchase with no other add ons. Ive heard of mods for this game, however i think to myself, is that necessary? to get things to make the experience better? No. No it is not necessary, so do yourself a pleasure, and buy this game, as there is at least a weeks worth of gameplay to it, and there is enough things/ side activites that you can do if you get bored.

It's a new game, it's something you're probably interested in and it's not half bad! I'm enjoying myself so much. :') The characters are fun, the invasion modes are fun, co-op is fun (I don't think story co-op is a thing but you can basically explore the map and do mini missions or just hang out there's quite a bit to do though, it is indeed seamless).\nPros:\n- Great Audio\n- Great Dialogue\n- Great gameplay mechanics\n- Great animations (those freakin' parkour animations man!)\n- Great story (so far)\n- Very fun (subjective, but heck, I'm sure the 99% of WD2 consumers would agree!)\n- Fast travelling.. MMMMM YES MY BEAUTIFUL FAST TRAVEL FRIEND! <3\n- A male black character that DOESN'T get seen as a crook when he walks around, but rather a stud (in the eyes of civillians since they're very friendly 'n stuff!)\nCONS:\n- There's just \"master volume\" settings for audio? You can't turn down either SFX, Voice or music specifically.. not that I've seen anyway. But heck, I could be blind. Prooooooooobably not though. So yeah, no specific audio volume settings >;c\n- Although the world itself is very live (there's a lot going on and it's LIT AF), along with there being a ton of stuff to do; personally I think there's not enough dialogue with the main crew unless you're interacting with an OP or they let you know about a new OP, like no random chats here n there.. but that's just me I guess, to each & their own.

They don't make good games of the time, they make GOOD GAMES. Sure, theres so much to do on GTA V, but I'm talking about San Andreas and not V, arguably the best game in the 3D Universe. If you want the short version, I highly recommend GTA: San Andreas for its story, tight gameplay, OST, and even its slightly dated visuals. But if you want to hear more, keep reading.\n*NO SPOILERS*GTA: San Andreas follows of the story of Carl Johnson AKA CJ returning to his home of Los Santos, San Andreas, after speding five years getting clean in Liberty City. However, CJ returns to a corrupt city with nearly his entire gang gone, with only his brother Big Smoke accepting his return. Now, its your job to restore the Grove Street Families place as the big gang. The plot and story are absolutely fantastic, with compelling characters, interesting ideas, and all around solid tale.\nGTA: San Andreas, on the PC, has realllllllllllllllllllllly good gameplay. It's tight, fast, and feels smooth, like how it was almost meant to be played. The gunplay is well done and the driving/walking are very comparable to even V, for it's time of course. You can see so much of a prelude to V in SA's mechanics, which are improved upon from III and VC. For example, like in VC you can buy and manage property, change your clothes, and eat for food. However, it is all improved upon here. Eating not only restores your health, but may make you gain weight, meaing you have to keep track of what you eat and how often. You can train yourself, something that was first introduced here, which can help increase your pedalling, melee, etc. In addition, changing clothes is far more improved than in VC, with you being able to fully customize what CJ wears, instead of some pre selected outfits. All this and more make for a lot to do in the game besides the main story.\nThe OST is pretty good. Like other GTA games, there's a large variety for all types of music lovers, but the game carries a very rap-heavy theme to tie into the Gang violence in the story. Plus, while the map/textures aren't BAD, the models haven't aged all to well, but that's nothing a mod can't fix. Speaking of mods, check out the SA multiplayer mod to really amp up the experience.\nIn conclusion, GTA: SA, is still an incredible masterpiece of a title and I would highly recommend it to any fan of the franchise,9/10", "hours": 1.9, "username": "TheMadManSFX", "products": 126, "early_access": false}

For some reason I can't put my finger on, it stands as the best of the series. It has the best missions, the best soundtrack, and the best sandbox world. It is packed full of content that is enjoyable and functional, and at no point does it feel like content has been shoe-horned in to add gameplay time.\nFor some reason Rockstar doesn't maintain their old releases on Steam well, and it shows here. Unexplained crashes, good old blackscreens and simply failing to load all rear their head. There are also a number of music tracks missing (Although I suspect this might be due to licensing issues). It doesnt detract too much, just make sure to save often.\nI can't think of any \"old\" game that I would recommend anyone to play if they haven't already.

The map is large and has alot of places to explore. You can work out, gain fat and lose it and gain muscle and lose it aswell, recruit gang members and go do some drive by's.\nThis game is a great game for modding, but i will say modding is never easy when it comes to installing the ones like superhero mods and stuff like that. The mods you can get come in a HUGE variety from superhero mods,anime mods like dbz mods to little mods like changing textures,showing up food in cj's hand when he eats,and alot more. My only complaint is one of my fav mods is in russian and is a HUGE pain to try and make it to english.\ntl;dr:The base game itself is alot of fun and with mods it becomes alot better,i would recommend. I also recommend using a controller unless your really good on pc controls.\nPros and cons\nPros\n-Great story and gameplay.\n-Lots of things to do and explore,large map.\n-Cheap,affordable price\n-You don't need a titan of a computer to run the game\n-Overall worth my time and i would totally reccomend\n-Also,great mods\nCons\n-No multiplayer (BUT this can be achieved with mods)\n-Despite me saying it had an affordable cheap price for such a good game,i think 15$ is a tad bit much but if you see this game on sale, GET IT.\n-Graphics not too amazing but can get 10x better with mods and just downgrading\nOverall,i'd say this is a MUST have for any fan of gta series and is just a really great game with a great storyline, and lots of things to do.\n10/10", "hours": 1.2, "user_id": "76561198364254898", "username": "Ace", "products": 74, "early_access": false}

Even still, in 2017 - I'll give you five reasons why.\n1) The game boasts a massive open-world map with a variety of different interiors to visit, along with different geographical features that slightly resemble some parts of the real world as we know them. There are numerous land types within the map, such as the forests in Back O Beyond and Flint County, to the more civilised and dense cities like San Fierro or Los Santos.\n2) It's so accessible to all users. Seriously. The graphics are so easy on the eye compared to other previous titles, like GTA III and Vice City which had more vibrance and saturation to all the elements. San Andreas on the other hand, has more realistic-looking graphics, and the GUI in-game is much clearer.\n3) There are so many mods out there, and there's multiplayer! (though you have to downgrade \u2639)\n4) The story is a reasonable length, and there are plenty of side missions to get on with alongside completing the main missions. This gives you plenty of gametime, and honestly, you can even do your own thing and still have fun (I liked getting on top of random people's Picadors and crouching whilst gunning down some Vagos - that's always fun).\n5) The in-game music is nostalgic. Personally, I listen to Bounce FM purely due to memories playing this game as a kid, but the other radio stations are great as well. There's a lot of tracks featured in-game from well-known artists like Ice Cube, Guns 'N' Roses, Rod Stewart and even Willie Nelson - needless to say, there's a music station for everyone.\nHonestly, just get the damn game. It's amazing.\n10/10.", "hours": 83.4, "username": "oaxy", "products": 129, "early_access": false}

Yeah, even after the GTA V PC release. How's that, you may ask? Since when some junk based on the engine dated like 15 years away, is better than all the licked clean and glossy Euphoria engine stuff?\nWell, Euphoria is a good engine, sure, but not perfect. It's great with some physical effects, and all... But some things it can't do, while its competitors - can. Like when you need to exit the car and the doors are blocked, Euphoria still just respawns you outside the car. And Wei Shen from Sleeping Dogs will exit the car like he should - by smashing the front window with a kick and climbing out on the hood! And that's only one example! If you look around, you'll find many cool options that Rockstar haven't implied in their games, and that's really sad!\nBut not when we're talking about San Andreas. For its main selling point at the moment is obviously not the visuals or engine complexity. No, people, it's all about the spirit, the mood that the game is providing. San Andreas - it's a raging youth, a bit crazy but overmighty and unstoppable. GTA 4 and GTA 5 - are quite different, and much more grim and unattractive by the same basis - the mood game's providing. Yeah, Luiz from the \"ballad of Gay Tony \" and Franklin from GTA V are slightly more cheerful guys you'll might even roll with someday... But Niko Bellic, Johnny Klebitz, Michael and Trevor - especially Trevor - they're all so horrid guys that I wouldn't like to walk the same road with. And it's the same thing as with the character from Mafia 1 in comparison with characters from Mafia 2 & 3! I just don't like those guys, I don't feel compassion for them - so I don't like to help them with sorting out their troubles, and so on.\nSo there is the thing why San Andreas is better than GTA V. Compassion. Sympathy. Carl Johnson, being just the same mass murdering criminal as the whole other bunch of Rockstar characters, is still a better person to hang out with.\nAnd, talking about the technical side, San Andreas even by the year of 2004 is tremendously big game. I've played it in 2005, in 2008, in 2011 and only the 4th time through I've found the triathlon event there. Stunning feeling.\nSo, my mark is obvious 10/10, and not of some nostalgia, but just as the feeling after I've made it through GTA V, which I'll mark lower.

You play as Carl Johnson, the first black protagonist in the acclaimed Rockstar series returning home to Los Santos swamped with gang culture and corrupt officials watching his every move. You can customize your character greatly by getting a range of hairstyles, tattoos and clothing from various stores. Another interesting and addictive feature is the ability to work out or just keep eating meals and watch your character become obese! You can train up your stamina, muscle, lung capacity, driving skill, bike skill, boat skill, flying skill, weapon skill... you name it. Also, for the first time in the historic Rockstar series, San Andreas is the first game where you can swim so thankfully no more drowning in shallow swimming pools (we're looking at you Tommy Vercetti)\nOn top of the main storyline, you have various collectibles to acquire, odd jobs, side missions, schools, collecting cars, gun range challenges... among more!

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 238, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-03-06", "text": "This is, perhaps, the best GTA game in the history of the franchise. I think that pretty much anybody who's ever played GTA knows about this game, and I'd dare to say that, in most cases, this is the one people remember the most. While the other games from the 3D era were pretty good as well (I'll always have a soft spot for Vice City, which was my first GTA ever), this one takes the cake. Rather than being limited to a single city, like previous games (or a bunch of cities divided in levels, like the original GTA), this one's set in an entire state, with three large cities (Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas), a bunch of small towns, and lots of countryside to explore.\nThe game feels HUGE. And it's not just a big map that's pretty much empty unless it's a plot-essential area. You can easily go around exploring and find places with great detail (for the time) that are completely irrelevant to the plot; in fact, there's large areas of the map that you'll never go to if you only focus on the story, and this includes some small towns. Still, they're there, to make the world feel alive. When it comes to the main cities, they're pretty good, and, again, there's lots of details here and there to make them feel like scaled-down versions of the real cities they're based in.\nThe gameplay is what you'd expect from GTA. There's shooting, there's carjacking, all the good ol' GTA stuff. However, this game was the first in the series to introduce some light-RPG elements. Not only could you customize the way CJ looked by changing his clothes and haircut, but you could also make him fat, or have him train at the gym making him stronger and learning new combat moves. And his skill with vehicles and weapons could improve as well the more you used them. There's also tons of side missions and activities besides the main plot, including the classic odd jobs like Vigilante on Paramedic, and a few new ones as well.\nThe storyline of the game is great. It begins with CJ returning to the hood after 5 years, and, like many GTA games, it's a story of working your way up from the bottom. However, what makes this one stand out in my opinion is that it isn't only about the rise of a powerful criminal, but it's also about family and friendship. Pretty well written, with some serious moments, along with some great humour. Not to mention a lot of references and callbacks to previous games from the 3D era.\nThe \"soundtrack\", or rather the in-game radio stations are pretty good; there's a wide variety of genres, and the actual soundtrack played during cutscenes and such is good as well. Not to mention that you can add your own music for the radio stations, so you can always listen to something you like while playing.\nWell, I think that's pretty much everything I've got to say about GTA:SA. I really recommend it, as it is one of my favourite GTA games, and the one I played the most (both on the PS2 and on PC).", "hours": 123.9, "username": "\u00a4 \u03b2\u2113\u043e\u043e\u0111\u0447 \u00a4 Nico-Kun!", "products": 797, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

In it's attention for developing an enjoyable experience, and a heartfelt one at that, Rockstar turned the flaws of their games in benefits and values, that are shared perfectly with this example of a game.\nEven when everything in the game feels dated, old, and mechanically flawed, objectively flawed (whatever that means) the game somehow manages to revert difficult and often hateful missions into pieces that conform something bigger, something memorable.\nEven after years from the game's release you can see that people still share their memories trying to beat missions like \"Wrong Side of the Tracks\" a mission that is not only difficult thanks to the \"tight\" controls over your vehicle, but also because of the dependency of the game's a.i.\nAltho as much as I can praise the game's story, the game's incidental experiences that you can get sometimes by simply driving around listening to the incredible selection of songs that are available in the game's radio.\nThere's a significant problem with the game's pc version.\nFor starters, the game is missing a lot of content from the consoles versions of the game, cars, effects, enviroments, textures, etc... There's a lot here that conforms an incredible atmosphere and enhances what is already an excellent game, that's simply missing, with the only ability of instaurating this \"features\" with the use of mods, thanks to the incredible, and still active community that still keeps itself passionate even after 12 years from the games release.\nAs I said, a true testament of the legacy of this incredible game.\nHowever if it wasn't only the missing content there are other issues, the game has problems running at framerates higher than 60 framerates per second, while there are other people that debate the game also has problems while even surpassing 30 framerates per second, either way it's something that I haven't personally experience in my time with the game, that as you may see from the Steam's recorded time, it's not much.\nThis is simply because I have had to \"downgrade\" my game's version from 3.0 to 1.0, the first, and most compatible version with the modifications created by the community now a days.\nIt's been the only wat that i've found myself actually enjoying the game, (as much as I resent the phrase) that the developers intended for me to play.\nIf that wasn't enough, new versions also eliminate certain songs from the different fictitious radio stations in-game. Something that as I said I haven't experienced thanks to the ability to downgrade and mantain the original first game's released version intact by also having to, sadly, move the game away from Steam's game directory.\nAt it's core, I love this game, I have incredible memories with it, and I think it's a game that you owe yourself to play, if you love games, and certainly, if you love Gta, this is a game that in my opinion deserves all the praise and remembrance that it gets even now a days, it's a game that can have frustating missions, repetitive ones at that, other times it can be sad, but for the most part I don't think anyone can't deny the game it's a fun and entretaining time to experience through and through.\nThis in a lot of ways is also the last Grand Theft Auto game released for the Sixth generation of consoles, and similarly to how in a way Grand Theft Auto 5 was that for the Playstation 3, and the Xbox 360, even while they re-release that game for newer platforms, including pc, this is a firm, a departure and a letter of love from Rockstar games towards its fans.\nThe gameplay, the characters, the different places and diverse cities that you encounter while exploring the map, the small fragment of time that the leaved since this game up until Grand Theft Auto 4, was enough for people to show there love as well, sharing experiences, creating mods, and even stories that end up becoming part of videogame's culture.\nGrand Theft Auto San Andreas it's essentially the definition of what, in my opinion, a great game can be, a great game not only in sales, nor in scores, but in heart, and in memories.\nThat's the true definition of a successful game for me, a game that 12 years after release people still talk about, still get involved with, both by playing it, as well as in by creating features for the game.\nI just wish in a way that \"love\" had also been shared at it's fullest with the pc version of the game, altho after all this years, I frankly can say that I just don't care...\nMainly with all the mods that are out there.", "hours": 2.1, "user_id": "76561198126975019", "username": "wolfinston85", "products": 855, "early_access": false}

With three and Vice City, this game game helps form the so called \"GTA3 Trilogy\". If compared to the Man with No Name Trilogy, this one is The Good, The Bad, & the Ugly. The game is another prequel game this time set in the year 1992, six years after Vice City and nine years prior to GTA3. The main protagnogist is Carl Johnson an African American gang member who after residing in Liberty City for five years he returns home to the city of Los Santos a parody of Los Angeles. Upon returning home, he discovers that friends and family were killed off by rival gangs that have taken over the city. To prevent things from getting worse, Carl must gather up the remaining members of his gang and gain alliances with crooked yet reliable individuals in order to make thing right again in Los Santos. This game is more personal than the previous two games, there is still a theme of revenge except Carl Johnson lost family members to the homicide of rival gangs. Loosing people dear to you can cause you to undergoe dramatic stress and you'd see to it that justice is served. If the film \"Boyz n the Hood\" was focused on vengence then this game represents that what if idea. The graphics are once again improved and there is more detail in the characters and locations. The choice of weapons and vehicles have increased, bikes are now a new choice of transportation. The ability to change clothing is a big improvement, now you can select different articles of clothes and when ever you die and respawn, the clothes you currently wear remain on you until you decided to change your clothes. All of the obtain clothes are found in safe houses insteado f being scattered throughout the game. The thing I like the most is that this is the first GTA game where you can customize the body mass and hair styles of the main protagnogist of the game. The landscape of San Andreas is vast and large, Liberty City is like a mini mart compared to San Andreas which has various terrain to travel upon. With so many pros there is very little cons present in this game. All of the cons in the older games were improved like being able to swim and jumping over fences helps out in a lot of situations. The only cons are the plane controls and gang member recruiting command were a little off. But I was able to ignore those issues as this game was loads of fun. San Andreas would leave a lasting impression to both the gaming industry and culture itself. The characters are great and the casting of an all star cast of actors(including THE Samuel L. Jackson) prooves that games can be like an alternate movie experience. Out of the whole GTA3 trilogy this game is no doubt the best of the series.

Sure in some areas it hasn't aged all to well but to put it in perspective, San Andreas was the GTA V of the PS2 era. The story is also pretty good in my opinion, Unlike GTA III and Vice City's more mafia-esq stories, San Andreas put's you in the role of one of the most beloved gangbangers Carl Johnson. After returning from Liberty City, Carl is reunited with old friends and enemies as he tries to get revenge on the people responsible for the death of his mother in a drive-by shooting. With 100 story missions traveling across the entire state of San Andreas, There's no doubt it'll keep you busy for quite some time. The soundtrack is great too, Sure the Steam version is lacking some of the songs from the original release, Granted it isn't really Rockstar's fault licensing ran out, It's still a bummer. As for issues with San Andreas running smoothly, I suggest getting Silent's Asi loader and Silent's patch. The patch fixes numerous graphical and gameplay bugs such as framelimiter be locked at 25 FPS and various fixing lighting and shader issues. Overall, Give San Andreas as shot, It's fairly cheap and is loaded with all sorts of stuff to do.

I mean, it might not have good 2017 graphics. But who'd care about that anyways? The story is great. I wish there was a simple way to explain that without spoiling the whole game, but i'd try not to.\nThis game really works well on a Windows 10 laptop. It might drop alot of frames from time to time, but the FPS will boost its way into your average/favorite regular FPS. Items like cleo, and other types of modification programs for GTA SA, but hey. Atleast you can still mod your GTA3.img.\nThe only thing that i've really disliked about this was the fact of how hard the missions were. I mean of course, who could forget the memorable line, \"All you had to do was follow the damn train Cj!\" but that wasn't really a problem for me. I am talking about the suprisingly really salty deaths that they give you, enemies might sometimes spawn on corners, giving you no time to react whatsoever. And the police officers would be one hell of a grudge on your tail. They wouldn't really care when you have 1 or 2 stars, but by the time when you reach 3-6 that's when they start to care.\nAnyway's it's not like you can wish the Rockstar developers to go back and patch the game, it wouldn't make sense whatsoever. Another thing i'd like to talk about is how rough the start can be. It could be impossible for a person that is new to GTA SA to beat. You'd need to figure out how you'll get all your weapons back without spending a dime! (And no, i am not talking about cheating... >.>) Not to mention what you'd need to do to unlock special needs/items/vehicles. Like how completing the race ring in LS rewards you with a Monstertruck and a racecar. And how completing that one mission in SF that grant's you to custom your vehicle.\nAnd probably the last that i'd want to talk about is, which is probably my favorite. Which is probably random and has nothing to do with this, maybe. But hey, look at the rest of the reviews. Anyways, my favorite thing to do in GTA SA is, towing vehicles. Yes! You've read that correctly, is to tow vehicles. Not to mention that it is pretty fun to throw vehicles all around the place in high speed, and flying a helicopter that can fling the onto unbelieveable heights. Just becareful if you go that fast, it might result in your tow truck being totaled.\nAnyway's that is it for my review. Nobody probably read this, but who cares?! :D (I do... ;-;)\nMy review my GTA SA, I really love this game, it will forever stay in my heart, ever since I was 4 years old.\nSee ya later\n(Probably not, but whatever. :P)", "hours": 147.9, "username": "The Excited Jubei \u2642", "products": 15, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

(In My Opinion)\nI would have more hours on this game but I recently bought this in the Summer of 2016 and transfered my saves over to the steam version.\nPersonally I prefer this map over GTA V's map because it feels A LOT bigger then GTA V although that is only due to the complicated road system that San Andreas had.\nThe Story is pretty good! Takes place in 1992 during the Crack Cocaine epidemic during the 90s and takes real events from the LA Riots and the CRASH Scandle. Although the game seems pretty ghetto, thats only in the VERY beginning and VERY end of the game!\nI also prefer the gameplay over V's gameplay. Carl is more customizable than Michael, Franklin, or Trevor. As Carl, you can upgrade your skills RPG style like getting stronger or if you want to be a fat man then you can be a fat man or if you want to be some buff guy then you can totally be a buff guy. If you want to learn karate then you can learn karate and use that fight style or if you prefer to be a wrestler then you can be a wrestler! There is also Gun stats which increases your accuracy with a all of your guns unlike GTA V where it just says shooting. In this case to increase your stats for guns, you have to use a gun in the same category(e.g. Pistol/Rifle etc) which increases from gangster to hitman. Also, the more you drive, the more the driving stat goes up making it easier to drive and deducing the percentage of not colliding into other cars/objects(Same goes for bikes and planes).\nI don't think we need to talk about graphics.\nOne last thing... a few years back, Rockstar made a patch removing songs and deleting old saves. This can all be fixed from downloading a downgrader patch which doesn't only fix the songs but also lets you install mods again.\nOh... And One Last Note.

HOWEVER, this is the game that no one will ever forget it, of how great this is. When I was at 4th grade my friends and classmates would never stop talking about this game. We used to have cheats on a piece of paper, good ol' days. Some homies I know still play it. I never get it finish it though. Right now I am!\nThis is the best, fully gangsta type game ever.\nGOOD:\n- So many clothes to wear!\n- Exercises makes you buffer and stronger, while eating more makes you fatter, neither those will make you skinny. Even GTA IV/V don't have this feature anymore! What happened!? This is so realistic!!\n- Minigames\n- Memorable characters\n- Perfect story\n- Really long story. Seriously! I thought one more mission then I could finish the game but NOPE I'm still at the 6/7th one! I never completed the game even now!\n- 8 Major gangs. This so great. You start with Gang Street Families, but unfortunately you cannot be other factions, but it's fun to stay with the story.\n- That camera that takes pics into real files. I loved that one!\n- Memorable moments / quotes\n- Very fun screwing around the lively city of Los Santos.\n- Story about gangsters/blacks. Nowadays I feel like black people in video games don't care about anything, like Franklin. God, he's so boring. I felt CJ is more funnier and dramatic person he is.\nBAD:\n- Updates that removed so many good content and also breaks the mods\n- Terrible controls. Ever since I was a kid, why the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 would anyone bind sprint as SPACE, jump as SHIFT, ENTER to exit menus and SHIFT to open to the next link as default?\nFinal Verdict: The story and gangsta theme is better than GTA V, but it doesn't mean that's bad, I like both games but SA brings memories and many customizations. The first time I played it when I was like 7 or 8, it first came from a computer I bought (some computers have illegal games from the store but that was fun. Always tricked my parents) Now that I'm a young adult, turns out I didn't became a serial killer.\nSteam edition: 0/10 > Trash can \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\nWhy bother porting it on Steam when you remove the good things inside it?

He comes back to Los Santos after he received a call telling him his mother died, and that's exactly where the story starts.\n\nIn this new installment released in 2004 you will play not in one, not two but in three different cities located in San Andreas county: Los Santos which is modeled after Los Angeles, San Fierro which is modeled after San Francisco and Las Venturas, modeled after Las Vegas. Yes, Las Vegas got GTA'd and it's awesome. The San Andreas map was a huge achievement when it was released as it was one of the biggest the videogaming industry had ever seen until that point. But what was most surprising was that it was not as empty as one would believe, the map had several side-missions and activities to do. You could modify your character and make him fat, muscular or skinny. You could date girls. You could fight gang wars. You could rob houses. You could go to the gym. You could race in bikes. Or you could simply continue the story missions.\nAs usual as with the other games, San Fierro and Las Venturas are blocked at the start, making Los Santos the only available area until you advanced through the story missions you could unlock the new areas and you could travel there. Otherwise you'd get a really nice 5 Stars Wanted Level if you dared to cross to the blocked areas. One of the most notable differences from previous videogames was the addition of an ability to the protagonist, and that was swimming. For the first time in GTA history a character could swim. Tommy Vercetti couldn't, Claude couldn't but CJ did it!\nEither way, this is one of the most fun installments in GTA history, rivaling the newest counterpart GTA V. If you don't have this game in your library, then you should by all means save to get this.\nAre you ready to order?

My first GTA was VC, then 4, 3, and then 5. I played little SA in between of me playing those. I never really dedicated myself to this game as I did to the others. 2016 arrives and I pick it up from Steam and start a playthrough. Holy\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665it was so good. Well I'm gonna list some pros and cons and some facts..\nMain Locations in GTA: San Andreas:\nLos Santos (Los Angeles)\nLas Venturas (Las Vegas)\nSan Fierro (San Fransisco)\nNevada Desert\nForests\nMountains\nPROS:\n+ You get to freely fly aircrafts, unlike GTA IV\n+ Much better gameplay than GTA 3 and VC\n+ The story is amazing\n+ You can swim, unlike GTA 3, VC\n+ Driving phsycics are blessed by the gods\n+ RPG Factors (Gain muscle, stamina, sex appeal, etc)\n+ A lot of guns! Such as the AK-47, SPAS-12, RPG, Grenades, MP5, Uzis (or MAC-10s), Desert Eagle, and more.\n+ Six stars instead of five like in GTA V\n+ The infamous memes: Big Smoke's order, WRONG HOUSE FOOL, etc\n+ You can beat peds with long, purple \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665... Don't \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing lie, we all have done it...\n+ Great modding community.........\n+ Hot Coffee\n+ Barbershops (Chose your haircuts!)\n+ There's a multiplayer mod\n+ You can drive cars, trucks, buses, dirt bikes, motorcycles, bicycles, planes, jets, boats, tanks, and more!\n+ There is an Area 69 (Based off of Area 51)\n+ Gambling!!!\n+ HUUUGGEEE MAP!! Bigger than GTA IV's Liberty City! Not quite sure aboit GTA V though..\n+ Bigfoot?\n+ Awesome cheat codes!\nCONS:\n- I wish this game had more of a customizable video settings, instead of it just being low, medium, high, and very high\n- I hate it if you die in a mission you have to do everything all over again.. Even the drive there too\n- The swimming mechanics are clunky.. Hard to control and maintain underwater\nI really could go for a\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas 2", "hours": 220.1, "username": "Fireseth", "products": 136, "early_access": false}

Make sure you lock the frame-rate, and take time out to properly bind controls as this game was a pre-XInput release.

If you are having problems getting the game to run on modern hardware, try at least the downgrader and SilentPatch to fix your game. Also, the reason my playtime says 8 minutes is I was running all the patches through the install directory, not Steam.\nGTA: SA has been a long time favorite game of mine. Compared to previous open-world games, the landscape for this title was HUGE. It still feels pretty huge to this day. It is chock full of interesting characters, missions, story, and gameplay. It almost feels like it goes on a little too long with the main story side-tracking, but ultimately reels it in quickly at the end. Back when I first played this game like 10 years ago, I probably easily put 30-40 hours into the main missions and doing all the extras (trying to 100%). This most recent playthrough, I feel like I definitely put another 20-30 hours into the main missions and fewer extra missions. If you are the type of person to 100% games, this one will keep you busy for a while. The bang for your buck with this game is incredible, especially if you were to get it during a sale for like $3 or less.\nAs much as I gush about the gameplay and how fun this game is for the most part, I would be remiss to mention the final part of the final mission is still garbage to this day. Rockstar had and, I think in a couple of cases with recent GTAs, has a problem with making the final mission so grandiose it breaks the game. Needing to catch people falling off of transports with cryptic instructions and uncertain landing zones is garbage, most particularly when the price is having to repeat the same 2-3 minutes of easy gameplay to try the obnoxious 10 second part over again. I've had this character you need to catch bounce out of my car, fly over it, you name it. Considering this is the conclusion to an otherwise amazingly fun game, it really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Not enough that I wouldn't recommend the game - just so that you know when you get to it, you are not alone in quitting early and just looking up the ending on YouTube. It's so badly executed it seems bugged (and maybe was patched out in later versions that are kind of broken/unmoddable now....).", "hours": 0.1, "user_id": "76561197983545926", "username": "FudoAkira", "products": 385, "early_access": false}

Firstly, the graphics have aged really badly, if you have been playing GTA V you will see how much graphics have evolved in the last decade. However by far the worst thing about this game are the controls (due to its console origins no doubt). The controls are terrible for shooting and driving and it makes what could be enjoyable missions a very frustrating experience and much harder than they need to be. I would say the controls are moderately better than VC but a million times worse than GTA V. I guess the game is unlikely to be updated any more so I guess I have to live with that.\nAll that aside, it is good to fire this classic up again after so long and despite the aged graphics and terrible controls, it is still a really enjoyable game and I would still recommend it despite its flaws.\nEdit: since playing a good few hours I have discovered that this version has issues with stability. I have had several crashes to desktop, which were extremely frustrating after completing horrible missions only to have the game crash before I could save my progress. Music has been severely cut too.

Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is ARGUABLY the best GTA game in the series. (Some will say Vice City is the best, which is also understandable). First of all, San Andreas Open-World environment is very big for its time. It includes a lot of RPG elements such as Stamina, Fat, Weapon Skill, Clothing and the like. As such this includes a lot of so-called mini-games to boost said stats and also some are for entertainment sakes. Second, the STORY. San Andreas puts you in the shoes of Carl Johnson (hence will be referred as CJ) who after the death of his Mom, finally returned to San Andreas after 5 years in Liberty City. Little did he know that a lot happened and changed. It is up to CJ to return the Grove Street Family back to their former glory. Of course not everything is all great, there will be hindrances along the way.\nLastly, the soundtrack. San Andreas (17 songs were removed tho, but with a DOWNGRADE PATCH this can be fixed), offers songs from the 90s that will give nostalgia. From hip-hop to softrock, this game offers alot and caters to music lovers all over.\nI suggest getting this game on a sale but the regular price in itself is justifiable enough to warrant it.\nEDIT: This game can run on almost any toaster device out there.

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 289, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-12-24", "text": "I'm beyond amazed how this game runs so smoothly on my PC...other big shot, smaller games I play, like 7 Days To Die, Barely 10 FPS on the LOWEST SETTINGS, GTA: San Andreas, 45-55 FPS...my average FPS for all games is around 5-20.\nI would recommend this game over GTA IV and V, no outside stuff needed, except a program I made that helps boost my processors for better game performance. (Not releasing that...not yet anyways. Something I plan on doing some time soon.)\nThough this game tends to glitch for me every now and then...\nWhen I want to record (Bandicam), I go back to the game (Using Windows 8.1) and have a black screen...I usually have to close the game, close and restart Bandicam, THEN start up the game again...if I don't do that...I get glitched texture overlays on my screen...and occasionally, I'm walking on the roof inside of the houses I buy...cool, freaky, and annoying cause I can't jump or get out the doors. I'm ok with those issues, since they don't actually corrupt the entire game, just a simple reboot of the game fixes those issues.\nApart from those down sides, I really like this game...only if GTA IV and V weren't always breached by hackers, or people getting false perma bans that can't be undone. Here's my Pros and Cons to all 3 of them.\nGTA: San Andreas\nPros: Performance is really great! Quite a bit of missions to do, and things to find. Includes a built in cheat code, for when you want to do stuff that can't be done normally, like give yourself a jetpack, spawn in tanks and helis and so on...hope that'll stay for many years to come.\nCons: Some missions can be quite hard to do. Client Side issues such as the Black Screen and occasional texture glitches. Not many down sides, unless you get your car stuck in that 1 spot you didn't mean to drive into...or park a tank in your garage...AND CAN'T GET IT OUT, even with a tow truck.\nGTA San Andreas Tip: DO NOT PARK YOUR TANK IN YOUR GARAGE, YOU'LL NEVR GET IT OUT...unless you have some extra room to squeeze in there and hop in it...garages need to be wider and taller.\nGTA IV\nPros: Somewhat just like GTA V, completely free, open world...be the good guy, or destroy everything.\nCons: Terrible port, runs quite badly on PC, not to mention it needs Windows Live, and some other crap that can alter the game nearly unplayable...they should've rewritten the whole game to let it run on PC a lot smoother...WITHOUT WINDOWS LIVE!\nGTA V\nPros: The finest of the GTA series...tons more things you can do, more destruction, more missions and fancy things...a rather amazing game! (I haven't played it, but judging by VanossGaming, it's very fun to play.)\nCons: Constant breaches and hackers, lots of absolutely pointless, false Perma Bans that CAN NOT be undone...come on RockStar...y'all ate our wallets and got your loot...use that stuff to stop them breaches, and quit issuing pointless Perma Bans when the hackers are the ones who deserves the perma ban, or an IP Ban for that matter, and not perma ban the innocent people who didn't do anything but played the game fair and legit! (Judged by the recent reviews on the game's page)\nMy tip for GTA V players: If you can, before starting the game, unplug your modem (and router if ya got one), or set your PC to be in Offline Mode, to play it offline, that way you have no concerns about getting hacked and your random, pointless perma ban chances get lowered by a small percentage.", "hours": 99.4, "user_id": "76561198134432319", "username": "\ud835\udd80\ud835\udd92\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd9e \ud83c\udf19", "products": 32, "early_access": false}

Some people complained about the original color filter missing from this version, but honestly after playing the newer games it's not something to miss.\nThe ability to freely map the controller buttons is nice, even if the inteface for doing it is rough.\nOverall, the best way to play this game!", "hours": 12.1, "username": "egoBorder", "products": 56, "early_access": false}

So after some discussion and consideration we decided to try V3 (Steam version) and so far it works very well. My only concern or complaint is the controller config but it's minor and maybe I haven't had enough caffeine this week :) Graphics wise it looks better although maybe that's just us grabbing at straws and of course it can only run upto 1920x1080 but that is to be expected given the age of the game.\nMy machine is AMD FX 8350 - 8 core Win 10 64 bit, 32 Gig RAM, NVidia Titan X 12 gig video RAM Triple 27\" Samsung curved screen monitors, Sound Blaster ZxR Pro sound card.\nso the burning question, Is it worth the money? should I buy it? .. mm that's 2. ok well it is an old game but it's like an old photograph.

So for me, on top of everything great about this game, there's a little nostalgia mixed in as well. How does it stack up as a GTA game? Best ever. Why? Well compared to GTA 5, which is a great game by the way, it has many more detailed upgrades(and even downgrades, like obesity) for your charater to level up abd aesthtic customation is on par with games released today. It also has a variety of story and side missions that are also on par with GTA 5, and some honestly being a hell of a lot more fun and unique. It has a pretty big array of weapons to choose from, all with skill levels for each gun type. As for vehicles...for the time of realease it was impressive, now compared to newer titles it feels lacking(no suprise here though). Along with the vehicles, the customization is there, but seems like a last minute thrown in feature that really is only worth it if you're trying to throw some cash away. The map feels still very big today, and with new areas opening as you progress through the story, it really feels ever exspansive at times. However, what really makes this game amazing, and one of Rockstars best works, is the story and progression, and the characters and their development.  If you haven't played this game you're in for a ride. How the charaters build of each others morals and decisions, really makes this story play out like a movie. And somehow makes you feel family with these gangster friends, and see that it really isn't all about drugs, money, and kills. I think the story is really the only factor that makes GTA: SA better than GTA 5, that alone is saying a lot. GTA 5 is amazing the story is astounding and all in all I really have no issues with the game, I love it. However, once you play SA you'll understand why it is usually hailed king, because it's never a dull moment. It's a must own.

It added so much to the series including a huge map with 3 Big Cities, Countryside and Dessert, A massive selction of clothing to customize the main character, there are casinos which are usable, there are many side races to finish, you can customize a host of diffrent vehicles. Unlike the previous games Rockstar Games had added RPG elements that effect the overall build of the main character making it possible to make him strong, fat, skinny, overwieght and other inbertween sizes and this feature still has yet to return as it was only in this game. You can now fly planes from a simple stunt plane to a airliner and afew more boats have been added. There are many side activities to do which reward you greatly like, Vigilante, Firefighter, Ambulance and afew others. And it has a great story tho Vice City may be better its stil pretty good.\n'Five years ago Carl Johnson escaped from the pressures of life in Los Santos, San Andreas... a city tearing itself apart with gang trouble, drugs and corruption. Where film stars and millionaires do their best to avoid the dealers and gangbangers. Now, it's the early 90s. Carl's got to go home. His mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart and his childhood friends are all heading towards disaster. On his return to the neighborhood, a couple of corrupt cops frame him for homicide. CJ is forced on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streets'\nIf i have one thing negative about this game it would have to be this version o the game, The Steam Version doesnt have mod support and many songs have been taken out for copyright reasons. Some PC's the game may not work on aswell, Either way its still a fantastic game to pick up and if your able to get past the graphics its a fun game.", "hours": 382.8, "user_id": "76561198170182843", "username": "InformalEnforcer", "products": 105, "early_access": false}

And, the best part yet, it doesn't have over half of it's story locked behind multiplayer. I'm looking at you, GTA V.\nOn the topic of multiplayer, be honest. How many people play Multi-Theft Auto, or SA:MP, or something along those lines? Don't be shy to admit it, because everyone does. Statistics show that, in fact, over a million people take part in San Andreas multiplayer shenanigans per month. That's nothing compared to it's big, slightly more brain-damaged brother, but it's still amazing.\nOverall, this game was great to play again, especially when my brain could function and I got most of the jokes.\nI give this game a number nine large out of a number six with extra dip.\n10/10", "hours": 4.7, "compensation": "Product received for free", "username": "[RumHamTF] Honeybun", "products": 174, "early_access": false}

One can simply stick to it for months, just like my little brother and young me did.\nThere are bunches of cheating codes there. I'd like to recommend them if you are gonna explore more trivia of this game, but it doesn't apply to missions.

Has quite a good selection of options, you can make your draw distance pretty far or close, which is nice because I used to run this game on a total crappy laptop. Plenty of more options.\nThe story is pretty cliche but good, basically, CJ is the main character and his mother was murdered. He came back to Los Santos to find who killed her.

I wound up getting pretty far in the game but got too lazy to finish it. It's still fun, I haven't tried the mods but I hear they're pretty good. Sadly this game doesn't have workshop support. There's only one GTA with a better campaign than this one and in my opinion that's GTA IV. I don't regret purchasing this, however I do regret purchasing the pack as I never play the other included games.\nEDIT: I finally decided to finish the story. The story has enough drama, action, and comedic relief to keep you going. You really start to feel for the characters towards the end of the game. The final mission is as expected however the events leading up to it were not what I expected. I completed the game without dying once, not because it's easy but because everytime I died I loaded my game so I wouldn't have to repurchase my weapons. The story is better than that of GTA V and in my opinion both games of the Red Dead series. I would rate the story probably a 9/10. In total you can probably finish the game in around 15ish hours of gameplay. I have much more than that from starting the story over a bunch a while back. I would recommend this game to anybody, especially if it is on sale. The game does however crash from time to time and when in water it is required that you use the frame limiter (Just another example that RockStar is\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665).

Unfit for modern systems.\nI spent the last three days attempting to get this game to work on my Gaming Laptop only for me to realize how broken it is. I won't talk about the changes from the PS2 aesthetically. There are mods for that and that is a subjective topic anyways.\nNo, i would like to talk about how the first setting for anti-aliasing brings my laptop that can run Fallout 4 on Max settings to its knees. I got to Whetstone 4 years ago on a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 PC with 1 GB of RAM, Pentium 4 and an Intel 82865G GPU. Then I beat it on the same thing, except with an extra GB of RAM and a Core 2 Duo.\nSo why is this game nigh-unplayable on my GTX 960M GPU!? It's not that im running too new of a PC, that doesnt stop everyone, I got every essential improvement I needed. SIlent Patch, everything, but even with AA off, sure I get a solid 30 FPS, but the tiniest bti of activity on my screen has unresolvable stuttering problems!\nI didn't even get into the removed songs and features, along with all the work you need to do to get this game into a POSSIBLY playable state. I personally have terrible internet, downloading a 1.3 GB downgrader is annoying. After all this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t, I decided to just get the PS2 version, and if possible, I recommend you do too.

There's a mind-boggling amount of stuff to do. PC owners definitely will fare better than their console counterparts. The bugs that plagued the console versions all seem to be fixed in the PC version. The soundtrack is inspired, with a heavy emphasis on late-'8s/early '90s rap and alternative rock. The keyboard and mouse controls are a little wonky. Takes time to get usto the mouse free look. It's easier with a gamepad but overall, it's a good game and still works on a modern computer unlike GTA IV. The mod community is also active, you can get some nice HD textures to give the game a graphical update.

There's so much stuff to do and even still I'm discovering new things. The main story and the characters are well written according to traditional standards.\nI've seen people complain that it's sort of unforgiving since you have to redo the whole mission if you die, but if you're having lots of trouble, try doing some side activities. Along with some rewards, you learn the geography of the city which at least makes me feel a lot more attached to the virtual location.\nThere are also lots of cars and weapons to drive aroung and the RPG stats. At first I felt like they didn't change much, but I can definitely feel a difference between the max driving and minimal driving skill.\nThe game is locked to 25fps. You can turn off the frame limiter in the options, but because parts of the game use the framerate to time the scripts that make the game function, things go either slowmo or too fast. Vice City has similar problems, but as an example the fountains in the game emit more particles when the framelimiter is turned off, which seems to indicate that the timing on the emitter is using the framerate instead of x per second/minute or other measures.\nIt does have gamepad support. If you want to play with the mouse and keyboard, there might be issues with the mouse suddenly not working. This can be fixed by downloading a file called \"DINPUT8.DLL\" and putting it in your San Andreas folder where the .exe is.\nYou may also come across a bug where the game crashes instantly after an explosion happens.

(this crashes the game during gameplay)\n-Random crashes upon themselves.\n-A bunch of other problems\nMoral of the story is; if you're going to port a game to PC for Steam, do it right. Other than that, this game was literally the best of it's time and went as far as being the best-selling game on the PlayStation 2.

This is in my opinion and will always be the greatest game of all time.\nStory: Great, so great I don't want to spoil it one bit. Play through this game for story alone.\nMissions: The missions are a blast (some of them literally) to go through, I think the only missions that are not enjoyable in this game would have to be the RC drone missions, because they are just frustration to control, other than that though, I can't think of a single mission that made dislike playing the game.\nGameplay: Apart from precise aiming which for some reason it is quite hard to do in San Andreas, the gameplay is well done, it is easy to switch between for example GTA V and GTA San Andreas, the gameplay is quite similar (definitely not technically) in a lot of ways.\nWorld Design: I think the world in San Andreas is great, my favourite open-world by far. You've got Los Santos, which is everything from docks, to the hood, to downtown, Vinewood hills, tries to imitate Los Angeles. Then you have The Country (as I like to call it) which connects Los Santos to San Fierro and Las Venturas, filled with little towns, a giant mountain, rivers and a couple of forests/farms. San Fierro, mostly downtown and housing areas along with the docks, tries to imitate San Fransisco. Then finally, Las Venturas, much like its real life counter part (Las Vegas) has the city, with the strip. There is also desert surrounding it, with a military base, a quarry, a couple little towns, massive hills, airfields and all sorts to explore. Because of the variety of locations in this game I think it is great.\nMod Support: If you've played through the main game quite a few times (like me), you may find the game to get just a little bit repetitive, or maybe you just wanna spice things up a little. There is a lot of mods for this game, ranging from graphics mods, retextures and all that to mods that make you into Superman, Naruto or Goku from Dragonball Z. San Andreas' mod community is still active and massive.\nMultiplayer Mods: Even if you typically don't like GTA games, San Andreas Multiplayer (SA:MP) or Multi Theft Auto (MTA) may be the mods for you! I personally believe that SA:MP is better than MTA but that is only because I've played more of it. Technically MTA is better because it allows server owners to make mods server side meaning that no one will have issues with installing map packs or anything. I feel like SA:MP is just a lot more friendly in terms of UI and it is easier to just jump in and play rather than MTA which is a lot harder to get into and a lot more time consuming. I often play SA:MP to play the roleplay server, Los Santos Roleplay (LS-RP) for short. But SA:MP and MTA both offer freeroam, DM, Cops and Robbers and other gamemodes. Between the two mods roughly 1,000,000 people play monthly. The mods were at their peak a couple of years ago but still many people play them.\nOverall: I think you should get this game, it is amazing, my favourite game of all time.", "hours": 187.7, "username": "KaiBR", "products": 265, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

God DAMN that made me mad.\nThe game runs like\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665at max settings, so what you need to do to make it run better is to change the Visual FX to Low and the Draw distance to a 4 or lower (found in settings under \"advanced\"). After you do that, the game runs like a dream. And don't worry about the graphics quality going down, as far as I can tell it doesn't affect it. Besides that, the game will run fine.\nEvery single mission in this game is like 10 times easier than their console counterparts because of the ability to use the mouse to shoot and having all the controls in one place. Missions that took me hours or days to complete (Supply Lines from Zero), took me a couple of tries to do and I beat it. Amazing.\nEven with all the crashes and stupid updates, the game is still fantastic. Don't be discouraged by all the other bad reviews you see in the review section, all they're \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing about is the last update Rockstar made to it.

It's not a trainwreck like the shoddy pc port of Vice City, but it is not a near masterpiece like the ps2 version of San Andreas. Its middle of the road for me. The reasons behind why I prefer the ps2 version of San Andreas are as follows. The pc version has some game breaking bugs here and there. Its playable, yes, but the bugs and glitches that you have to work around to avoid or fix cripple the experience a bit, not to an insane degree, but they are irritating, like a fly buzzing around your ear, a baby crying or finding a bug in your food. This review is based off of my experience with the game, so the problems you encounter may vary. Such bugs/glitches that I had to put up with/endure were the game crashing every now and then (which makes saving your game alot a nessecity, or face anger/rage), swimming underwater was impossible, certain items would cause the game to crash upon using them, various audio files were missing, some texures were missing, some graphical errors here and there, framerate issues and more that I probably forgot because meh. I would recommend this game because, if you lower your standards and are okay with dealing with the things that I told you about (or other bugs/glitches that you may find yourself) then this game would be okay for you, but understand that the ps2 version is far superior as you would be free of all of the nonsensical bugs/glitches and you could listen to the radio with all of its music stilll within the game. So, to digress, the pc version is tolerable, the ps2 version is near perfect (despite a graphical downgrade). Oh, and I have no idea what the ps3 version is like so I guess its a mystery! :D", "hours": 40.2, "user_id": "76561198087303210", "username": "TheUndone", "products": 105, "early_access": false}

Coming back to it with a sense of nostalgia and nothing but fun memories of killing hookers and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing about for hours on end, I was a bit worried the game would not live up to my expectations.\nPerhaps when an individual is presented with a game series, they will always cherish their first game, despite there being flaws, with other better titles out there, similar to my view of Twilight Princess in the Zelda series, despite it drawing many plot elements from Ocarina of Time. I had a blast re-playing this game as an adult.\nThe graphics, while primitive today, looked very nice 11 years ago, and can easily be made to look better with the numerous mods out there. The explorable zones are HUGE, allowing hours of dicking around before coming back to the main missions. This also  grants me my favorite past time in this game, which is dressing up as a black cowboy, and riding a motorbike on the desert highway at midnight listening to K-Rose, with my favorite host Mary-Beth Maybell and her husband-killing fetish. The story is just interesting enough that it motivates you to advance further into the plot.\nHalf-way through the game, it presented a fairly huge challenge, which at first seemed like a flaw of the game, because up until that point in the game, all you drove were cars. You had to learn how to pilot a single engine stunt plane and perform complex manuevers through rings similar to Superman 64. Little did I realize the grind to become a better pilot opened up a new avenue of gameplay, as I soon found myself hooked to piloting planes and flying across the countryside, and covering distances in very short periods of time that I would otherwise have to spend tens of minutes on the ground navigating through the complex snake-like roads while minding all the incoming traffic. The combat is obviously the worst aspect of the game, but I was having such a blast playing this game that I just didn't really mind it.\nLooking at the game today, I would probably rate this game a 6/10, but it certainly aged well and was a marvel for its time.", "hours": 42.1, "username": "Kimi o Nosete", "products": 47, "early_access": false}

Either way, easy fix.)\nBasically you're a gangster who does gangster things:  kill, rob, drive-bys, etc.  You run with the Grove-Street gang while gaining \"respect\" and moving up the ranks.  At some point, you'll be able to control territories and expand your gang's influence while defending the turf you have.  There is a decent story line which I won't go into, along with multiple girlfriends you can date if you choose to.  Rival gangs chase and shoot at you; police chase you after committing crimes; paint your car to lose your wanted status or simply hide out and wait for it to go away.  If you've played other GTA titles, then it's all very familiar.\nI played this as a kid and it brought back good memories.  There are a couple of software 'updates/mods' you'll want to install to make the game run better.  To play higher resolutions (ex. 1980x1280, etc.), you'll definitely need these updates/mods - simple to install.  They can be found on others' reviews.\nPurchased during the July 4th sale (around $3.00) and well worth it!  Rated 8/10 stars.", "hours": 25.5, "username": "Sgt.

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 434, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-06-26", "text": "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is arguably the best in the series (also my personal favorite). This game follows Carl Johnson who returns to San Andreas when his mom is murdered. Throughout the story we learn about some treason in his gang, Grove Street Families. I won't go into details since that would spoil the story...\nThere are so many things to do in this \"3D Universe GTA\", swimming, gyms, hunger (yes, you can become hungry after a ridiculous amount of time and eventually die from it), stats (lung capacity, fat, stamina, muscle, weapon levels, driving skill, etc.), flying planes, flying helicopters, parachuting, and so much more! Each stat can be increased/decreased from its corresponding activity. For example, fat is affected by eating. The larger the meal, obviously the fatter you get, but you can buy salads for generally the same price as the most expensive food and not gain weight. Muscle is affected by cycling, weights, climbing, and other activities that logically bring up muscle in real life. You can lose muscle by not doing anything active or hunger, like fat...\nGuns are also affected by this skill system now. If you pick up an AK47 and try shooting someone with it in the game, Carl will hold it poorly, be unable to move while firing, strafe slowly, and will be highly inaccurate. However the more you use this weapon, the better he holds the gun, he will eventually be able to strafe while firing, strafe faster, and be extremely accurate.\nDriving skill is self explainatory so I won't go into detail.\nCycling skill affects the speed you can get a bicycle to, the higher the jumps, and the less chance that you fall off. Also, self explainatory.\nI'm sure you don't want me to go on about the skills any longer, now we shall go onto the minigames.\nYou can play a wide range of minigames such as video games, billiards (pool), and go on dates (yes, dates). There are only 3 video games, but these can be fun to play with friends. Billiards is only single player. Fun fact, there was actually supposed to be a multiplayer billiards activity but sadly, it never made it into the game... And the dates... So there are multiple women that you meet throughout the game by story (like Catalina) and some you meet outside of missions and are sort of hidden. Each one has certain activities that they like to do and most have a specific body type they want you to have. One likes you to be a bit fatter than muscular, and another wants you to have no fat and max muscle. Good luck juggling them around because you have to do all that in one day. Yes, you have to go on dates all across San Andreas everyday, and switch your body type pretty much every time. Hope you have cheats active...\nIn my opinion, the story could be better, but it's not the worst in the series. I'd say GTA III had the least interesting story, but then again, I've yet to complete it. Anyway back to this, the story starts off as Carl being a gangster, but ends in him being one of the richest men in San Andreas. Don't ask me why, but he does. I'd rate the story about 7/10. Like I said, it's not awful but it's not great...\nIf you've played GTA Vice City or GTA III before, you know the controls can be a little hard to use at times. This game changed this for the most part... You can now orbit the camera around the character, climb objects, and most importantly, YOU CAN SWIM! If I remember correctly this game started the ability to swim.\nSpeaking of starting something, this game started and ended the legacy of the jetpack. It was the first game to feature it which was AWESOME! However, this easy mode of transportation has yet to appear in the \"HD Universe GTA\" games. There's really not much to talk about it, you fly up, slowly go down, move forward, sideways, backward, it's basically being able to walk in the air...\nThis game also started the car customization. Yes, almost any car could be upgraded, but bikes you couldn't. Also, though you can customize your car, it's mainly hydraulics, color, nitrous, paint jobs, and wheels. There's a radio bass boost feature but on PC, it really doesn't help. Don't waste the $100 it costs...\nIf you want to mod this, you might want to buy a physical PC disk and install it off that. Take this from someone who's tried to mod the Steam version, you can't. If you don't want to mod this and don't plan to in the future, then you should probably get this as it's the most stable version...\nYou're probably bored of reading this by now and I applaud you for getting this far because there's a lot of stuff in this review. But this game, is definitely worth at least trying. If you don't know how good it really is, you can look up stuff about it on the internet...

This is absolutely great and a classic game every PC gamer should own! Unfortunately, I have some bad news and good news. Firstly, this Steam version is not particularly great - it misses SA:MP - the multiplayer mode of which I made countless friends! Also, some songs have been removed, You can find out which songs have been removed here:\n[\n]\nThankfully you can add all of these songs again in the customizable radio station. My honest advise to you is that you follow a guide on the internet and legally downgrade this game to an earlier version, preferably versions in the v1.x range ('x' stands for random number/s). Also, some game physics are broken (such as the car physics and overall driving which is downright numb when framerate is manually unlocked) when you remove frame limiter. The game is otherwise capped at 25fps which is awful to say the least. However, that can easily be fixed with a downgrade in the version and a mod to patch the physics for 60fps usage. It all takes a while though, but it is all worth it in the end.\nOf course this is a fantastic and hilarious game in its own right, even though it is aging now. I would give this Steam version or any unmodded version a 7/10 (because of technically glaring issues) and a fixed version a 9/10.\nGetting it on Steam is a safe bet, but the best way to enjoy this game is to simply buy a retail copy as the downgrading process is not necessary.", "hours": 13.1, "username": "Rocketman \u262d", "products": 243, "early_access": false}

San Andreas, however, I played it for years between 2006 and 2013, when I finally bought it from Steam and clocked another 110 hours.\nLots of collectibles and side missions to feel rewarded.\nAnd you can always feel the adrenaline of escaping your known cities or returning to Los Santos (if you have been kicked out already). Even at the end-game you can hunt for the largest plane (I won't tell you where it is) and attempt to escape Area 51's airspace alive.\nThe biggest upside is that you can own more than 6 cars with your character, unlike GTA V.

Turning off the frame limiter lets the game run silky smooth, but also changes the way the game calculates it's physics and is just generally poorly implemented, meaning that you can hit some bugs that stop you from progressing with the game entirely, and blocks you off from completing the 'Vehicle School' missions, so it's better just to leave it on, rather than having to dig your way through options menus and restarting the mission every time an NPC's pathfinding goes haywire.\nOther than that the game is incredibly solid, and, apart from a few graphical glitches resulting in, for example, bright-green mist rolling in over San-Fierro, and some low res models/textures, a very fun and enjoyable game, back from the days when there was a middle ground between Easy and Dark Souls difficulties.\nTL;DR: Buy it, Play it, Leave the Frame Limiter on.", "hours": 74.6, "username": "O\u032f\u030f\u0332lf\u0357\u0362\u0489e\u032ch\u030c\u0362", "products": 63, "early_access": false}

I just wanted to get this out of the way right here:\nHere are the specs of my PC:\nProcessor: Intel Pentium\nCPU: B980 @ 2.40GHz\nRAM: 4GB\nOperating System: Windows 10\nType: 64-bit operating system x64-based processor\nGraphics Card: Intel HD Graphics\nAnd guess what? I'm getting over 100FPS! This game is well optimized, and has a great story. There is so much you can do on the PC version that you can't do on the PS2/XB versions. Amazing mod support, great story, great gameplay, and good graphics and frame rate for a terrible PC like mine! Even though I'm running the game at low graphics, you can't even tell a difference.\nThe game's story is very long, but it's so open-world, that it feels like San Andreas is just as big as the GTA V version of Los Santos. I also noticed that this game along with a couple other GTA games has gore in it, which makes it a little more graphic. I'm totally ok with it too, just thought I'd bring it up.\nThe gameplay mechanics are a little different than the PS2/XB versions of the game. There's no auto aim on PC (unless if you play with the controller mod), but PC gaming is really advanced and I understand why they don't have auto aim for mice. It'll be really easy to get a shot with auto aim if your playing on PC. I also know that the PC version is missing a cheat code from the console version, and there are a few changes to the environment, because the console version and the PC version are not exactly the same either. It's alright though.\nI'll give this a 9/10, and here is my list of PROS and CONS on the PC version:\nPROS:\nGreat mod support\nGreat story\nGreat gameplay\nGreat performance/optimization\nOPEN WORLD BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Well, that should go under gameplay)\nAnd it actually works on bad PC's!\nCONS:\nMissing cheat code\nEnviromental changes between PC and console\nSlight gameplay mechanic changes\nBad controller support (you have to use the controller mod to have good controller support)\nNo intro at the beginning of the game (for me at least, I don't know about other people)\nWell, this is my review for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on the PC.

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 453, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-05-20", "text": "San Andreas is a third game in \"3D Universe\" which was heavily based on real-life events such as rivalry between Crips, Bloods and Hispanic gangs, crack epidemic, Los Angeles riots and severe police misconduct in LAPD which involved unprovoked beatings and shootings, stealing and dealing narcotics, planting of false evidence, frameups and bank robbery. It is one of the rare games that features black character as main protagonist. Besides San Andreas, I can only remember that The Suffering and GTA V did it.\nMap is almost four times bigger than its predecessor, and consists of 3 big urban areas Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas which are inspired by Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas respectively. Countryside in game effectively serves as a 4th area due to its large size and diversity. There are many recognizable landmarks (which are named different) such as Area 51, Hollywood sign, Hoover Dam, Golden Gate bridge and many others.\nYou play as Carl \"CJ\" Johnson, who returns to Las Santos after spending five years in Liberty City when he hears about his mother's murder. He finds his life very hard immediately upon arriving. Relationship with his brother \"Sweet\" is cold since he accuses him of leaving the family and friends. Crack addiction has affected many in his neighbourhood, and on top of that he gets on Frank Tenpenny's radar, a corrupt LAPD C.R.A.S.H. officer. Situation is grim, and he decides to rejoin his former gang, to get brother's approval and help making things better.\nWhole getto vibe and jargon are omnipresent, they are delivered through excellently written dialogs and voice acting. Besides CJ's Groove Street Families, other gangs include their arch enemies Ballas, Vagos and later in the game Vietnamese Da Nang Boys, Triads, Russians and three families of Italian Mafia.\nGang wars becomes a thing later in the game when you need to defend your territory when enemy gang tries to take over. If you successfully do it, members of your gang will hang out in the area, and you can recruit them for helping you in missions. Stealth elements are also incorporated from Rockstar's previous game Manhunt; there are couple of missions which were specifically made with stealth in mind.\nRole-playing elements are new part of the series. You can visit the gym and learn hand-to-hand combat, work on your stamina by running or driving bike and build up your muscles by lifting weights. It has effect on your appearance which is important because you can date girls, and not all of them love the same thing. Muscles will open you a way to some of them, while others won't appreciate it at all, so you'll have to visit fast food restaurant to gain some fat. You can customize your looking by getting different haircuts, clothes, jewellry and tattoos.\nRPG elements that have effect on the gameplay are in driving and handling firearms. The more you drive certain type of vehicle or use specific weapon, the more you excel at it.\nSwimming and diving are also introduced, so you don't have to be afraid of water anymore. You can even pilot a plane after acquiring license for it. Bicycle, offroad vehicles such as tractors and combine harvesters, even jetpack and using parachutes are now on the table. There are driving, bike, boat and pilot schools which will help you learn many tricks.\nFor those who love to hunt for hidden stuff, there is a plethora of it. Original 100 hidden packages are replaced with spray paint tags, but in addition to them there are hidden camera shots, horseshoes and oysters which will keep you preoccupied.\nMy favorite side activities in the game were definitely street races and trucker missions. There are over twenty street races and they include cars, bikes and aircrafts. You are given specific vehicle for each of them and you compete against 5 AI opponents. They are absent in aircraft races, they just consist of getting through checkpoints in a certain amount of time.\nEight trucking missions are separated into three types; delivering cargo within certain time limit, delivering illegal cargo whilst being pursued by a police with a three or four star rating and delivering a fragile cargo without damaging it. There are eight missions in total that successively become harder by having tighter time limits, stronger police attention or easily damaged cargo, all that by covering larger areas to reach destination. Last two missions are combination of fragile and timed objects as well as police attention, and can be quite challenging.\nThere are 11 radio stations in the game with over 10 hours of material. My favovite one is WCTR; Rockstar is always spot on with satire used in talk shows and advertisements, laughing is therefore guaranteed.\nVoice cast lineup is led by phenomenal Samuel L. Jackson who gives voice to main antagonist. William Fichtner and Danny Dyer reprise their roles from Vice City as Ken Rosenberg and Kent Paul, while the rest of the cast include James Woods, David Cross, Peter Fonda, Wil Wheaton and many famous rappers.\nGame has sold over 27 million copies by 2011 and remains best-selling PS2 game of all time. It has been remastered and ported to many other platforms. It is the last game in \"3D Universe\", Rockstar launched a new canon (\"HD Universe\") with GTA IV and GTA V.", "hours": 60.6, "username": "Makki", "products": 1786, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 454, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-05-20", "text": "San Andreas is a third game in \"3D Universe\" which was heavily based on real-life events such as rivalry between Crips, Bloods and Hispanic gangs, crack epidemic, Los Angeles riots and severe police misconduct in LAPD which involved unprovoked beatings and shootings, stealing and dealing narcotics, planting of false evidence, frameups and bank robbery. It is one of the rare games that features black character as main protagonist. Besides San Andreas, I can only remember that The Suffering and GTA V did it.\nMap is almost four times bigger than its predecessor, and consists of 3 big urban areas Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas which are inspired by Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas respectively. Countryside in game effectively serves as a 4th area due to its large size and diversity. There are many recognizable landmarks (which are named different) such as Area 51, Hollywood sign, Hoover Dam, Golden Gate bridge and many others.\nYou play as Carl \"CJ\" Johnson, who returns to Las Santos after spending five years in Liberty City when he hears about his mother's murder. He finds his life very hard immediately upon arriving. Relationship with his brother \"Sweet\" is cold since he accuses him of leaving the family and friends. Crack addiction has affected many in his neighbourhood, and on top of that he gets on Frank Tenpenny's radar, a corrupt LAPD C.R.A.S.H. officer. Situation is grim, and he decides to rejoin his former gang, to get brother's approval and help making things better.\nWhole getto vibe and jargon are omnipresent, they are delivered through excellently written dialogs and voice acting. Besides CJ's Groove Street Families, other gangs include their arch enemies Ballas, Vagos and later in the game Vietnamese Da Nang Boys, Triads, Russians and three families of Italian Mafia.\nGang wars becomes a thing later in the game when you need to defend your territory when enemy gang tries to take over. If you successfully do it, members of your gang will hang out in the area, and you can recruit them for helping you in missions. Stealth elements are also incorporated from Rockstar's previous game Manhunt; there are couple of missions which were specifically made with stealth in mind.\nRole-playing elements are new part of the series. You can visit the gym and learn hand-to-hand combat, work on your stamina by running or driving bike and build up your muscles by lifting weights. It has effect on your appearance which is important because you can date girls, and not all of them love the same thing. Muscles will open you a way to some of them, while others won't appreciate it at all, so you'll have to visit fast food restaurant to gain some fat. You can customize your looking by getting different haircuts, clothes, jewellry and tattoos.\nRPG elements that have effect on the gameplay are in driving and handling firearms. The more you drive certain type of vehicle or use specific weapon, the more you excel at it.\nSwimming and diving are also introduced, so you don't have to be afraid of water anymore. You can even pilot a plane after acquiring license for it. Bicycle, offroad vehicles such as tractors and combine harvesters, even jetpack and using parachutes are now on the table. There are driving, bike, boat and pilot schools which will help you learn many tricks.\nFor those who love to hunt for hidden stuff, there is a plethora of it. Original 100 hidden packages are replaced with spray paint tags, but in addition to them there are hidden camera shots, horseshoes and oysters which will keep you preoccupied.\nMy favorite side activities in the game were definitely street races and trucker missions. There are over twenty street races and they include cars, bikes and aircrafts. You are given specific vehicle for each of them and you compete against 5 AI opponents. They are absent in aircraft races, they just consist of getting through checkpoints in a certain amount of time.\nEight trucking missions are separated into three types; delivering cargo within certain time limit, delivering illegal cargo whilst being pursued by a police with a three or four star rating and delivering a fragile cargo without damaging it. There are eight missions in total that successively become harder by having tighter time limits, stronger police attention or easily damaged cargo, all that by covering larger areas to reach destination. Last two missions are combination of fragile and timed objects as well as police attention, and can be quite challenging.\nThere are 11 radio stations in the game with over 10 hours of material. My favovite one is WCTR; Rockstar is always spot on with satire used in talk shows and advertisements, laughing is therefore guaranteed.\nVoice cast lineup is led by phenomenal Samuel L. Jackson who gives voice to main antagonist. William Fichtner and Danny Dyer reprise their roles from Vice City as Ken Rosenberg and Kent Paul, while the rest of the cast include James Woods, David Cross, Peter Fonda, Wil Wheaton and many famous rappers.\nGame has sold over 27 million copies by 2011 and remains best-selling PS2 game of all time. It has been remastered and ported to many other platforms. It is the last game in \"3D Universe\", Rockstar launched a new canon (\"HD Universe\") with GTA IV and GTA V.", "hours": 60.6, "username": "Makki", "products": 1786, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": false}

GTA: San Andreas is easily the most overrated game I have ever played, with GTA fans calling it the best in the series, purely out of nostalgia. The game has so many problems:\n-broken driving: every single time i try to drive in this game, my vehicle veers off in strange directions and crashes into something. For a game that's all about stealing cars, this is a very, very \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 system. I understand that the game is old, but I've played games from the same era that had WAY better driving. This game has no ecuse, and the driving ruins the entire game in itself for me.\n-horrible camera: even for an older game, the camera is absolute garbage. you CANNOT look around while in a car without crashing into a wall, which made some missions way harder than they needed to be. Why does this game insist on making missions like the one where you chase the Mexican guy on the bike, when every time you follow him across a road, a car hits you from the side because you can't see it because the camera wont let you turn and look without driving into a signpost? It's frustrating and broken.\n-useless RPG elements: why the hell do you need to eat to stay healthy? Its a damn video game! These health elements are useless and annoying, and I'm very glad they were taken out of the series.\n-boring story- GTA: SA follows a super generic storyline, where you are a gangster who rses to the top. It's exactly what everyone expects, and yet people say that the story is better than GTA V? Get over your nostalgia and stop worshipping \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 games.\nOf course, there are things I love about this game, but the things I love can be found in every GTA game. San Andreas is nothing special, and it just doesn't hold up anymore. It has aged VERY badly.\nIt's time for us all to admit that GTA V is by far, the best GTA game yet. It has so much to offer: A great storyline, great driving, top-notch shooting mechanics, amazing customization, awesome & hilarious multiplayer, tons of variety in the missions, awesome cars, awesome music, great graphics, tons of activities and cool side missions, and a more genuine, detailed, and beautiful game world than any other game that I have ever played.\nWhile still a huge and amazing game, San Andreas has very little to offer from a gameplay standpoint. I would stay away from this game if you have already played and enjoyed GTA V or GTA IV.

But there are also secondary missions, it's just a mission, neobezatelno run, can bring you some amount of money or weapons. I want to warn that THEY DISAPPEAR !!! for example you have a mission, there is an additional, decided to perform the Foundation, fulfilled, additional disappeared, so if you really want to experience the whole SA 100% the extra pass of the mission is given the opportunity.\nIt's time to choose a weapon..:)\nWeapons in SanAndreas is one of the most important moments. What do you think what it is ??? of course for the murders. You will always be a choice, to bring your favorite six-gun or take a small and compact treatment of the ultrasound, in some missions, your 6x-barrel machine gun will simply be nowhere to go, and in some missions without it is better not to go. Unforgettable that you will not be able to take as many weapons, vprintsape as usual, ie one type of gun, machine, etc BUT in the game you have your physical form and if you are the last distrofan something about the six-barreled machine gun you can only dream of. In SA shops or just in the underground shelves, you can buy different types of weapons. The most unusual gun I believe a gun with a silencer, this gun is for silent actions, such as when you Rob a house and want to be the owner of this home already never woke up. (In Russian docks you can buy mini-SMG''s one of the strongest guns in the game)\nFlight school\nWe all remember the plane in GTA III ? of course remember, remember all those sweet times, when everyone was trying as much as possible to stay in the air and it wasn't easy. In ViceCity the problem with the complexity of flight has been solved, you could very easy to fly, almost not nobregas. What in SA ??? start with the fact that now you will have not a Dodo or Skimmer but you will have plenty of new planes !!! ranging from maize to passenger aircraft. Control of the aircraft is not subjected to large izmeneny, but appeared something new. For example, a device that shows your altitude, etc (these really are on the aircraft) , for more accurate navigation Rockstar came up with a more accurate alignment using the buttons L2, R2. After a short training you'll be one just the coolest pilot around SA. Each plane has its own physics, for example on the plane you will very quickly and easily validate, but if you have some kind of Boeing you have papatel...\nForbidden heavens\nEveryone remembers that in ViceCity, you can take off wasn't high... This error was corrected SanAndreas because here you will be able to uslatest to the heavens and go even HIGHER !!! You will be able to szletes really HIGH, but it can take quite a long time because if you will fly by helicopter and just clamped up (something to climb vertically) that you need 30 seconds of REAL time... can you imagine how long it is. but if we descend to zemlyu. Use your stairs as if scalabilities on them and continue your journey further.\nHigh, high...\nCJ in General in fact don't know how to use a parachute and he doesn't have the license for it. But think about it why do we need rules ? of course that would break them !!! The parachute you will be able to find in LosSantos'e on the cone-shaped building on the TransAmerica in San Fierro on the big skyscraper. Something to climb on any building you just need to come to the door. Well, what else remains to do ??? to run very fast !!! and JUMP !!! YES YES YES !!! And here you are flying and you are thinking... hmm... have we forgotten anything ??? how strange... YES, we forgot verevochku which will activate your parachute !!! Oh too late you already fell you're already dead... Onetime my mistake...\nLook at the love\nNovels in GTA III and ViceCity somehow netcallidus... the first time our hero is almost killed by his love, and in the second case, our hero is simply not even interested in Women. As concerns our CJ ??? Yes, he loves to Rob, kill, etc but he always has time for his lady. And you will not just spend 20$ with \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s in cars, and it will be really true love. So what to do ??? here your love, she is interested you or you her... what's next ? How can you care for your girlfriend ??? it's very simple... In the game there are so to speak a few MINI-games on this account. First you can just go somewhere to invite, to walk, to ride, to give her some gift, a compliment, etc you will Also be able to impress her with his dance abilities, all you need is to find the dance floor and dance it as best you can. You have to do everything for her, if she wants to eat you should take her to the diner, some girls don't want to go to a simple diner they want in a real RESTAURANT. You can just make a joke, or to agree or NOT to agree, of course it is better to agree if you don't want to lose touch with the girl. After a while it is very strong abilities, she requires a lot of attention, just once you did a mission to perform, and if you won't give her attention then she's just gonna leave you all... all over again... very gemoroyno classes... but the ending is worth it ;) There are at least 6 girls who are longing for a man like CJ. They are located in completely different places for example one of them to be \"the SanFierro driving school, the other in the gun shop. They are all different each has its own flavor, some plump tadalisa from Tolstikov, some from inflated impotent :) That to win the heart of every you must be unique person. Don't forget to monitor their appearance, dress decently, also don't forget about physical form. If you one day will come fairly athletic, and the next day a little plump, your girl is neponravilsya. FLOWERS, FLOWERS... Yes Yes and flowers too, can give your girl, to find them you will be able in many places in SA, but SA is big and you can get lost, you can find them lengthwise of the track, near eateries and in many places. After taking the colors run to his beloved, that would give their beloved flowers hit tab and don't forget to press tab once again to get your reward.", "hours": 458.9, "compensation": "Product received for free", "username": "Rockstar Games", "products": 44, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 463, "page_order": 4, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-04-23", "text": "The 90s were a special time. The International reputation of the USA was more closely aligned with baseball, basketball Disney and a naughty President than the decidedly militaristic and dark cloak it would come to adopt in the coming century. The internet had not made information instantly accessible and the world therefore felt so much larger, so much more varied and unknowable. NWA, gangsta rap in general and various news stories had suggested the dangers of gangland Los Angeles, among other places, but these things were all distant, almost mythological.\nPoking above the waves in the late 90s however was a series of top-down crime simulation computer games known as GTA which would eventually bring this entire world of crime right to your TV or computer screens. A catchy title, the first two installments (and an expansion or two) had the players navigating a city viewed from above, running their little sprite around shooting people, stealing cars, jumping bridges and delivering bombs. Addictive gameplay was given an edge by a high degree of polish, vaguely black humor, outlandish micro-plots and satisfying - if unrealistic - vehicle gameplay to be enjoyed alongside some hilarious radio channels.\nWhen GTA 3 came out at the turn of the century these things were translated more or less directly into a 3D world, meeting with huge success and revolutionising the public concept of exactly how much we would be able to expect from computer games going forward. An entire, full scale city was rendered for us in seamless 3D (a short draw distance not being noticed as there was no real precedent to hold the game up against) Beyond the graphics, the gameplay was every bit as darkly fun and raunchy as it had been in the 2D games, only this time in full 3D with a distinctive visual style - and of course the car driving was still there, satisfying as ever, with those radio stations becomming a core feature of the game - ah, Lazlow.\nThe exceptional expansion GTA Vice City had come and gone - arguably staking a solid claim to being the best game in the entire series with the quantum leaps the game offered in terms of gameplay and, if less noticably, graphics - and before you knew it a new title had been announced: GTA San Andreas.\nThings were different this time around. Consumer commitment would be tested by a huge change in tone from the white trash east-coast earlier games to a Gangsta Rap-inspired west coast rendition of Los Angeles gang warfare, headlined by an African American protagonist, and radio stations which would be booming out rap classics. Rockstar by now was building a third title for the ageing PS2 system, and the technological bottleneck which meant that the graphics in this game were only separated from Vice City by aesthetic margins - more polygonal detail on cars and most other objects, more vibrant colours, a more evocative set of terrain types - meant that a huge amount of attention was fixed on shoehorning more and more gameplay innovations into the package.\nLooking back each GTA title released on the PS2 was a quantum leap ahead of previous titles in terms of gameplay. GTA IV would arguably buck this trend - perhaps they ran out of ways to innovate, perhaps the power of the new system was too potent for them to focus on their other obligations - but San Andreas really was a bigger, badder, better game than any previous title. As such this review stands as a solemn assurance:\nDon't let age fool you, San Andreas is a lush, vibrant, jam-packed world of crime with half-forgotten gameplay tweaks and additions that will out at you out of the shadows of the past and cause huge grins to break out on your face.\nYou play as Carl [Williams? I forget], an African American man returning home from the East Coast to bury his mother and - exactly to what extent this was part of his plans at the outset is unclear - reconnect with his initially grudging former gang bretheren and wrestle control of the San Andreas region from anyone else who might wish to stake some claim to it. Small fish prevail at the start, as a corrupt cop, double-dealing gang member, pathetic music artist hopeful and a few other similar characters have you running the kind of jobs that are best accompanied by NWA or Cypress Hill, but after a highlight of the game has come and gone - an all-out gang war in which you are free to dominate an entire city if you can be bothered - you are ejected out the refuse pipe of the starting city and sent scurrying across the redneck alpine regions between the SA towns, ending up in a different town full of different crooks and continuing on your quest for relevance and power.\nThe game is long, the missions varied and often challenging, the vehicles more varied than ever and great fun. The list of characters is endless, and the gigantic environment offers hours upon hours of entertainment even when it is cordoned off into smaller regions at the start.\nBuy this game! It is guaranteed to be good value no matter the price, and it is a holdover from a time in gaming when things like the console wars persisted and the idea of single companies like EA or UbiSoft holding sway over vast spans of offered products was, while emryonic, merely background noise to the single-player offerings being offered for the iconic gaming platforms of the day. Of those offerings, GTA: SA is without a doubt in the topmost echelon.", "hours": 28.0, "user_id": "76561198007539033", "username": "The Nac Mac Feegle", "products": 173, "early_access": false}

That's what i fell, it has everything GTA V has, except great graphics and online gameplay. You can steal houses here, buy ridiculously expensive massions, make great cars (Racing Ones), participate in lowrider events, races... or even, just parking your car somewhere, doesn't matter where really, and listen to the music this game has..

It is even more better than GTA4 in regards to map size, misson count (unless you count the DLC) vehicle variety, vehicle customization, things to do outside of missons, how fun it was, among other things. Very well made game. I have over 100 hours logged in this game, mostly from just messing around in it. I think that any GTA fan will enjoy this game immensely.", "hours": 197.1, "username": "Turkey", "products": 82, "early_access": false}

CJ basically tries to rebuild the strenth of the Families (Specifically Grove Street) throughout the whole game while dealing with rival gangs and dirty cops. the reason this game is so favored is because of the freedoms it brought to us GTA players who were used to playing such GTA games as GTA III and GTA Vice City (Which is much better in my opinion, despite not including as much detail).

First on the pros side their are a couple upsides. First the game world is vibrant and reactive and makes you feel like the one in control. Second the car custominzation is deep and varied allowing you to make some seriously neat whips. Third and finally this was the first gta game that offered pure freedom and every aspect which gives it a touch of charm. Moving on to the cons. First of all the missions although varied are either incredibly diffcult or extremly easy making the diffculty spike uneven. Second the game has aged terribly and thats not a understatement this game has some seriously murky textures and the game world is shrouded in fog at points. Finally and in conclusion this game has terrible side missions that even the most seasoned of gta players wouldnt want to particpate in.

A nice storyline with it, great plot twists, missions are challenging but not that difficult. (Well, some are.) It is very sad how Rockstar made the game unmoddable. This game would grow bigger and get more sales on Steam if it would be moddable. Heck, even let it have it's own community workshop would be awesome! But, sadly, most people would download the crack version which is mod friendly, and avoid buying it on Steam. I bought the game just cause ive been playing the crack version as i grew up, and wanted to make a redemption. Downloaded it to re-live the old modding times. But dissapointingly it doesn't allow that. Rockstar probably doesn't care about the game anymore since it has newer games to get bigger incomes from. The huge throw off was the point of it being unmoddable but it's a great game.\n7/10", "hours": 54.6, "username": "kawa.zoode", "products": 22, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

It definitely feels bigger than GTA V. You can climb walls now and your character can actually swim, which was huge back in the day. The story of San Andreas is the biggest yet. Rockstar put a lot of effort into the story this time.\nThere is a lot of variation in the missions, which is something even newer games cannot pull of. There a lot of new features in this game such as\nto personalize your character.\nOne of the biggest sacrifice Rockstar made was its graphics. Yes, the map is huge but there are few details. Not saying the graphics are bad, but even back then it was underwelming. The only down side of San Andreas must be lack of vibriant colors. Colors feels washed out compared to the previous games, which is personally why San Andreas is not my favorite Grand Theft Auto game.\nBrilliant voice actors as always! The radio stations are pumped with classics tunes of the 90's anybody can enjoy. They have upped their sound quality and the cars, bikes and planes sounds more realistic this time.\nI still play this game today and even though it is not my favorite game, it definitely pushes the limit of what games could do back then!

As in Vice City, you can purchase properties and businesses, but the latter is only unlocked through the quest line. Properties have little use other than to offer an extra save spot, sadly, and you probably won't have the need to collect the money your businesses generate.\nIn San Andreas the protagonist can (and will, forcefully) get into relationships. Fortunately, you can for the most part get along fine without tending these relationships with tedious, mindless tasks. There's just one exception, I think. You can also work at a gym, pick hairstyles, get tatoos and choose a wardrobe, which are all fairly uninteresting activities, but as with relationships, they're pretty much optional.\nDespite these small things, this is a game I can warmly recommend without hesitation.

Even now going playing on it just brings back so many memories, like long\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665cheat codes...THE DREAM! Seriously everything about this game is great considering it's 10 years old! If you've only ever played the newer GTA's then your missing out. This is where ( in my eyes ) they really opened up. Adding features like modding your car, i'd spend hours making my cars look to just how i want them. Although you might find it hard to play due to the graphics are so bad it's like watching paint dry, remembeer that it's 10 years old! and even better than a lot of games produced to this day! You're missing out if you don't buy it, seriously.", "hours": 14.2, "username": "Red Randy Devil", "products": 41, "early_access": false}

PlayStation Underground released a demo of Spyro in which it would format your memory card if you saved your demo partway through the game.  Because this happened days after San Andreas' release date, hundreds of gamers lost their save files, at least one of them being 90 percent through the game.\nIf that happened to you, 2015 is a good time to stop hyperventilating and give the game another try.  It works with a USB XBox 360 controller, although the game recognizes all the buttons as JOY1-JOY16.

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 550, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-10-31", "text": "The Grand Theft Auto series is like comfort food. It's one I've always been able to go to for reliably charming characters, enthralling story and gameplay, with presented moments leaving me curious to dive in and see what's new and exciting.\nSan Andreas is not an exception to this! In fact, in my books, it defines those exact values.\nAs far as the story goes, the protagonist returns to his hometown, where he then finds his family and friends going downhill. Then framed by two high-ranking and corrupt policemen, he's on the run getting into all sorts of hijinks and shenanigans, traveling far and wide meeting and getting involved with all sorts of interesting characters!\nSimply navigating the variety of environments in the vehicles provided feels good. The weight of the cars is just right and though the friction their wheels provide against the ground could be called a little slidey and difficult to maintain, it's rewarding to feel yourself master the way it works as the game progresses, both through in-game stats and your own technical ability. The gunplay isn't anything too special, but every weapon does what it should and there's one or a few in every expected category (though some are definitely outside of what you'd expect) for getting the job done and more.\nThere is absolutely no shortage of missions, and while some can be stubborn, every one is fun in premise. It's important to be careful, because any one mistake no matter the size can screw the whole gig over and cause you a lot of time! On missions where you're driving somebody important, which there are many of, flipping the car upside-down will cause it to catch on fire and, in time, explode. The person inside won't leave, and instead will sit there waiting for their demise, giving you a long time to think about how much they must hate you and an even longer time to think about how much you hate them. If you fail a mission, to try again you must make it all the way back in the world to the starting point... and this can lead to awkward and tedious situations, since some missions can take you pretty far away from where you began. Not to mention that if death is the cause of defeat, you'll lose all your guns and some of your cash you could use to help get them back! Any indoor segments can be clunky and frustrating, with the game's on-foot mechanics of navigation and battle noticeably designed overall to work better outdoors. It adds a good amount of pressure to not screw up when you know things can go wrong at any time, but it can be hard to keep sane when half your mistakes can be so easily blamed on the game!\nWith missions put to the side, there's still much to play with outside of them. The world is full of things to do like play basketball, pool, or arcade games; you can go racing, disco dancing, gambling, or do some work as a paramedic... and that's just the start! The protagonist can change and be customized in many different ways: you can fatten him up with junk food, buff him up at the gym, get him tattooed at the tattoo shop, change his clothes to your liking, or take him to the barber for a trim! (Or an afro, seemingly straight out of nowhere?) While one of the few things you can't change about him is what he says and how he acts, throwing him in a pair of boxers with hearts on them as he goes about his business will seem to change his tone a bit. On a bit of the downside, there are a lot of collectibles, with no clues as to where they would be, all over the place in odd locations. This is an absolute pain to anybody who's picky about getting everything done, but resources can be found online which list the location of every one, and if it's not something important to you then know that you're not missing out on much! All rewards are something nice to have, but are pretty much all superfluous, as you can already obtain just about everything they offer otherwise. (There are a few exclusives, but still, they're nothing fun or exciting, only helpful, so don't worry!)\nFor the age of the game, the graphics stand up well to the test of time. Not in their realism, but in the style they are consistently represented in. Everything is solid from one thing to another, and the world is beautiful to look at from every angle, though it shines especially when everything can be seen complimenting one another at once from a distance! Indoors the attention to detail can be lacking, especially in some of the mission-exclusive locations, but you'll be finding yourself outside most of the time anyhow, and it's nothing that will break the experience when you aren't.\nThe soundtrack consists of licensed tracks, and is represented through the different radio stations you'll hear while driving, which offer from one to another a good selection of just about anything anybody could be into. It sticks true to the early nineties setting, the list of tracks being full of nothing but memorable songs! Each radio station has commercials brimming with heavy satire, alongside an eccentric disc jockey who chimes in every now and again. There's no shortage of both hit classics and hidden gems which anybody should be happy to hear again or to be introduced to. It's all top-notch, and compliments the time you'll spend in cares quite well! Even if you don't like what's presented, since this is the PC version of the game you can add your own tracks into the game if you'd like, which will have their own radio station.\nFor anybody new to the series, I'd suggest this being the place to start. To get through the story alone takes fifty to sixty hours, but if that seems like a bit much, don't worry! It'll be hard to notice the time flying by when there's so much fun to be had. With a wide variety of weapons, vehicles, side-games, and a gigantic world to play with all you find and gain within, the game lives up well to the title of the series, which even outside of context gets to the point: it's grand, there's theft, and loads of auto! ...Auto meaning, y'know, automobiles...", "hours": 59.0, "username": "Dick sucked by Christmas Friend", "products": 367, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false}

It's like Straight Outta Compton in video game form. I remember always asking my brother if i could play this on his Xbox, and when i got to play, i played ALOT. When i had freinds and relatives over i'd play split screen.\nEnough with the nostalgic review and on to the real one.\nShort about the story: In GTA SA you play as Carl Johnsson (CJ) who \"after 5 years on the east coast\" comes home to his brothers in Groove street, but things have changed since he was last there and he now finds himself in a city full of street gangs and criminals and must get himself to fit in again.\nGameplay: Gameplay is overall pretty good, can get a bit clunky at moments and the game has a few bugs.\nMap: The game is set in an completely open world based off of Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Fransisco. You start of in Los Santos but to get to the other cities of the map you have to complete main story missions.\nCharacters: The game has some really intersting characters, some even based off of real people like Eazy E. Voice acting is great.\nSide missions and minigames: After you've beat the game there are still tons of things to do, like purchasing properties and apartements, a few minigames and sidemissions. And still after you've done all that you can mess around with cheat codes.\nThe game is not the same as you remember it if you played it a few years back, recently they released a patch that removed a few songs and broke saves wich you might have guessed caused the fans and community to outrage, but it was copyright issues so what could they do. If you wan't the \"FULL\" game i recommend buying a physical copy online or at a local game store.\nI'd give this game a solid 8.5, would be a 10 if they didn't release that god forsaken patch.\nSorry if the review felt lacking, but it's my first atempt to a serious review and i hope it helped someone.", "hours": 128.4, "username": "Bimon", "products": 150, "early_access": false}

Let me ramble real quick about it.\nSan Andreas improved literally everything from the previous games, from the better engine to the story, everything is top notch.\nEver since GTA III that the franchise gradually became more story focused but San Andreas is where Rockstar went all out. It features a really integrate plot that perfectly ties everything between the events in Vice CIty and III. You get the most memorable characters with real personalities in GTA along with the best protagonist in the franchise. The story finally deviates from cliche mafioso plot and is much longer and broken into multiple chapters that bring you to different places, you start in a guetto and suddenly you notice you own a casino in the big Las Venturas. Gladly the pace is flawless, it's just the right time and the story doesn't really contain any unecessary \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t. The narrative and theme of the game is very unique and was pretty controversial when it came out.\nThe Special Edition of the game even contains a 20 minute cutscene with a ton of backstory and insight on the development of characters and events before the game starts:\n\nThis intro alone has more emotion and is better written than the entirety of GTA V. I wish that wasn't the case but sadly no other GTA game has surpassed San Andreas in terms of story and immersion.\nThe map in this game is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing amazing, one of the best open world maps in my opinion. Rockstar didn't waste any space, everything is unique and has content and most of the time you get to explore cool places thanks to side missions. It features three very distinctive islands with big cities, countryside, a big mountain, a desert, loads of cool easter eggs. This was a big game changer for the franchise, the most we had before was 2 small islands with the same kind of aesthetics and you couldn't even swim or fly high. The map feels huge and I still prefer it to GTA V's take on San Andreas.\nThe refined engine really makes vehicule handling pretty \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing amazing, it brings tons of new mechanics to the game and prettier graphics. You have a much bigger selection of vehicules from sport cars to bikes, boats, planes and some very cool unique vehicules like the Vortex and the Kart.\nFinally the soundtrack is very important to a GTA game, and this game simply has the best soundtrack in the franchise, only Vice City comes close but San Andreas has such a nice variety of genres that fit perfectly with the multiple settings. From listening to Radio Lost Santos in the hood to roaming endlessly listening to K-DUST in the desert. It's just too \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing good.\nI probably forgot to mention a lot of things but I just finished it and wanted to get my thoughts out asap, I'll probably come back later and add more stuff.\nOverall, It's still the best Grand Theft Auto game and I'm glad I replayed it again.", "hours": 23.8, "username": "raffle", "products": 727, "early_access": false}

There was Morrowind, my favorite game; there was New Vegas, my second; and there was Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, my third favorite game of all time.\nWhen I was younger, less open to new ideas, I was reluctant to pick this one up, even though I loved the series up to then--- the underlying reason being that it centered around a man with whose culture I never thought I could identify, and therefore not be able to become immersed.\nI was wrong.\nCarl Johnson is a subtle man as far as Rockstar characters go. He is thoughtful, careful, never impulsive. He is intelligent, not prone to being manipulated. A natural leader. He rarely shows passion when it comes to morals and can seem gray at times. He doesn't whine and complain like a spoiled preteen (you hear that, Niko?) It will take you deep into the game to see that he is a good man, if you ever come to that conclusion.\nOn his journey to the top, his downfall and journey back up, Carl sojourns through an odyssey of interesting characters who reach two different peaks: the neo conservative Mike Toreno, and the mad liberal known only as The Truth. Without either one of these men, who stand on opposite ends of the game's dynamic philosophical underlay, Carl would have been lost. Each presents his ideals and reasoning in a manner not hitting the player over the head, and stand out among the greatest and most memorable characters in gaming.\nAs for the villain--- Samuel L. Jackson never agreed to a better role.\nThe plot is presented in such a way that you feel every step Carl takes in his conquest of Los Santos; you feel the loss as he's betrayed when things are going so well and banished to the country; you feel his clawing back up, making new friends who help him build an empire across the state and back to where it all began.\nAs all that Carl has built steers toward the final battle, you feel the tension as his hometown descends into chaos reminiscent of the Los Angeles riots of '92. At the end of it all, you'll find yourself looking fondly on his accomplishments, his friends, even his trials and his enemies.\nFinally, the atmosphere.\nI remember looking out the window of a car dealership in GTA III (the one with the Banshee) and wishing that I was looking out into miles of farmland that I could actually explore. It amazes me to think that the devs of Rockstar were as inspired by imagination and wanderlust as I was. While San Andreas carried a lot of what Rockstar would later pejoratively label \"empty space\", I appreciated it (more than many fans, apparently). I loved it. It felt real, being stranded in the desert outside Las Venturas, a road trip through the green country on the other side of the map, flying over empty lands to find a magnificent dam and small community in the middle of nowhere. The graphics at the time were getting outdated, but the imagination and content (even the \"empty space\") made up for it a thousand times.\nFrom my opening hour experiencing this world back on Playstation 2, Grove Street was my home. I was there. I laughed like a little girl at how real it felt when I helped hold up a fast food joint.\nAfter each mission, when Carl would return home for the evening, I felt like I was headed home after a hard day's work. Dropping the friends home on the way was an especially nice touch. When I would return to Grove Street years later in GTA V, I got a little misty-eyed. Although the place had changed, it felt the same. A bitterness arose on seeing the cul-de-sac littered with Ballas.\nPlot, characterization, setting. Each of these things were executed with power and precision by a company who to this day put their damnest into every thread of every tapestry they roll out to us. They are the masters of their craft and no one in the industry has deserved this level of success more than they.", "hours": 49.1, "username": "Folcro", "products": 844, "early_access": false}

One might say, there are mods that fix that, and they would be entirely correct. However, the version on Steam you get is unnmoddable, and if you downgrade to V1 (the only version that works with mods), it will crash often. Another thing that gets on my nerves is that saves from one version are incompatible with another, so you can't switch between an unmodded and modded GTAs.\nSo, in conclusion, the game itself is great, but how Rockstar made this game is just truly awful.

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 574, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-08-17", "text": "Forget the fact that GTA San Andreas started life as a PlayStation 2 game. The ugly caterpillar has become a beautiful (if foul-mouthed) butterfly. The fifth in a series that since its 2D birth on PC (back in 1997) has celebrated despicable gangsters and drive-by/-thru/-into and -over crime. San Andreas reaches new lows of depraved morality, senseless violence and alpha-male aggression. But it's the fact that it's one of the best games ever made that has already propelled it to console ultra-success.\nGTA 3 struggled to make the technical leap to PC with its code intact, but months of finger-crossing and animal sacrifices to nameless gods have paid off. San Andreas runs like a dream, with the excellent mouse and keyboard control system of Vice City, extended visual range and atmospheric effects.\nLike its two more recent predecessors, San Andreas puts you in the shoes of a central character about to embark on a life of crime. However, CJ \u2013 aka Carl Johnson \u2013 is no career mobster in the mould of Vice City's Tommy Vercetti. In fact, he's been away from the 'hood for five years to try and escape the gang violence endemic in his home city of Los Santos. He's brought back by his mother's untimely death. Hooking up with his brother Sweet and old friends, CJ is inevitably drawn back into the world he had left behind; a world of guns, drugs, territory, casual violence and 'respect'.\nRespect is actually a measured factor which is raised by performing notorious criminal acts. High respect means you can reinforce CJ with extra gang members when attempting to take over enemy territory. Although, initially, CJ doesn't even get respect from his brother. It's a good system, which draws you further into the game. As you complete missions, you start to gain the grudging respect of those around you. Eventually they adore you. San Andreas is no conventional RPG, but there's a definite feeling of character progression in this game.\nOr is it an RPG? CJ has several other stats which have subtle but noticeable effects on the game. Driving, cycling, stamina, motorcycling, flying, pistol, rifle... every mode of transport and every type of weapon has an associated skill which increases as you employ it.\nBetter gun skills mean more accuracy with that weapon, while a higher motorbike skill means you won't fall off as easily if you nick a car or lamp-post. There are even scales for fat, muscle and sex appeal, variously dictated by what and how much you eat; your work in the gym; what you wear; your haircut and your tattoos. Some of this is frippery, but it'll also affect whether you can attract girlfriends (and their subsequent side missions), how much damage you withstand (fatties can take more lead, apparently) and some people's responses to you. Like so much in San Andreas, these statistics are carefully woven into the game's structure.\nIf you thought that Vice City's twin islands offered a huge playground, prepare your mind for a boggling. San Andreas offers a whole new world of largeness. There are three cities: Los Santos, a version of Los Angeles and your home town; San Fierro, standing in for San Francisco; and Las Venturas, a dusty, neon-bright Las Vegas squatting in the desert. Not only is each vast in its own right, but the intervening space is expansive and packed. After the first ten hours or so, you're 'encouraged' out of Los Santos and introduced to a world of hicks, country music, tractors and remote, winding roads. The game's sense of place is so distinct that, as black CJ, you actually feel out of place in the small towns that dot the countryside.\nAs you get sucked further into the nefarious scheming of the corrupt cops excellently voiced by Samuel L Jackson and Chris Penn, you're dragged through the rolling countryside and north into San Fierro, all the time meeting and working for bizarre and intriguing characters. With a much more memorable layout than the first city, it's an even more exciting place to be, and you'll be rushing back and forth between the cities too, through the countryside.\nThroughout the game, the variety of the 100-plus missions never fails to delight. Steal a combine harvester. Infiltrate a secret army base. Chase down thieves on quad bikes. Rob a bank. Shoot down remote-controlled planes with a minigun. Rescue a bunch of stoned English rockers from the desert. Fly a plane to Liberty City to carry out a hit. From the simple to the devilish, from the grimly criminal to the comedic, from the sublime to the ridiculous, San Andreas retains the power to surprise and entertain throughout its lengthy structure.\nNot just in terms of the missions, either: you'll be infiltrating, burgling, flying, following, swimming, and shooting as a passenger as well as the more usual shooting and driving. My only quibble is that CJ never questions the reasoning behind the hundreds of casualties he's asked to inflict. \u201cKill that man? Aiight,\u201d sums up his usual response, and at times it's hard to empathise with such a cold-blooded hero.\nAs in the previous two GTA games, you can invest your cash in properties, some of which will provide an income once you've established a business there, and others which just act as new save points. These special locations often require you to complete a series of missions, offering yet another avenue to pursue. At any given time you'll have between one and half a dozen mission paths on offer, for you to take up in any order you want, or ignore completely in favour of a spot of pimping, exploring, police-baiting, male grooming or just riding around.\nAt once a giant, living playground and a smoothly contoured story, San Andreas still manages to be coherent despite giving the player the opportunity to ditch and pick up the storyline at will. The world doesn't have to depend on cutscenes for consistency, because there's always something going on, even if just in the background, to provide colour, life and atmosphere. The radio stations, legendary in GTA 3 and Vice City, are back with a dozen to choose from. As ever, Rockstar's cultural references are spot-on, and anyone older than their mid-20s will be powerfully reminded of their youth with the likes of Public Enemy, Primal Scream and Guns 'N' Roses. The interludes and chat shows are superbly scripted, if not quite as bizarrely hilarious as Vice City's. Again, the PC version enables us to supply MP3s and have them played on a dedicated radio channel.\nSan Andreas does the simple things well. Just stand on any given street, and within seconds you'll see little tableaux developing. Pedestrians bump into each other, pass comments at you and others, and get run over. If you're in an unfriendly 'hood, thugs wearing enemy gang colours will swagger up, offering threats, and eventually attack.\nJust existing is more gripping than before. Your 'wanted' level is again represented by stars, but here just one star will have the cops shooting and crashing cars like their doughnuts depended on it. Wanted stars are harder to get rid of, and even civilians will react angrily if you nudge their cars. As a result, you can't afford to be too carefree while cruising the streets. This, combined in particular with Los Santos' gritty, often run-down atmosphere, makes the overall experience quite different to Vice City's cartoon world. 'Actions have consequences' seems to be the moral message.\nThat's not to say that San Andreas is humourless: quite the opposite. From the missions and  cutscenes, to incidental dialogue and even tiny signs in obscure shops, you'll see Rockstar's trademark comedy style, ranging from the juvenile to the very explicit. San Andreas isn't afraid to say anything. Minor graphical scars left from its painful transformation into a PC game do nothing to dull San Andreas' inner beauty.

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 575, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-08-17", "text": "Forget the fact that GTA San Andreas started life as a PlayStation 2 game. The ugly caterpillar has become a beautiful (if foul-mouthed) butterfly. The fifth in a series that since its 2D birth on PC (back in 1997) has celebrated despicable gangsters and drive-by/-thru/-into and -over crime. San Andreas reaches new lows of depraved morality, senseless violence and alpha-male aggression. But it's the fact that it's one of the best games ever made that has already propelled it to console ultra-success.\nGTA 3 struggled to make the technical leap to PC with its code intact, but months of finger-crossing and animal sacrifices to nameless gods have paid off. San Andreas runs like a dream, with the excellent mouse and keyboard control system of Vice City, extended visual range and atmospheric effects.\nLike its two more recent predecessors, San Andreas puts you in the shoes of a central character about to embark on a life of crime. However, CJ \u2013 aka Carl Johnson \u2013 is no career mobster in the mould of Vice City's Tommy Vercetti. In fact, he's been away from the 'hood for five years to try and escape the gang violence endemic in his home city of Los Santos. He's brought back by his mother's untimely death. Hooking up with his brother Sweet and old friends, CJ is inevitably drawn back into the world he had left behind; a world of guns, drugs, territory, casual violence and 'respect'.\nRespect is actually a measured factor which is raised by performing notorious criminal acts. High respect means you can reinforce CJ with extra gang members when attempting to take over enemy territory. Although, initially, CJ doesn't even get respect from his brother. It's a good system, which draws you further into the game. As you complete missions, you start to gain the grudging respect of those around you. Eventually they adore you. San Andreas is no conventional RPG, but there's a definite feeling of character progression in this game.\nOr is it an RPG? CJ has several other stats which have subtle but noticeable effects on the game. Driving, cycling, stamina, motorcycling, flying, pistol, rifle... every mode of transport and every type of weapon has an associated skill which increases as you employ it.\nBetter gun skills mean more accuracy with that weapon, while a higher motorbike skill means you won't fall off as easily if you nick a car or lamp-post. There are even scales for fat, muscle and sex appeal, variously dictated by what and how much you eat; your work in the gym; what you wear; your haircut and your tattoos. Some of this is frippery, but it'll also affect whether you can attract girlfriends (and their subsequent side missions), how much damage you withstand (fatties can take more lead, apparently) and some people's responses to you. Like so much in San Andreas, these statistics are carefully woven into the game's structure.\nIf you thought that Vice City's twin islands offered a huge playground, prepare your mind for a boggling. San Andreas offers a whole new world of largeness. There are three cities: Los Santos, a version of Los Angeles and your home town; San Fierro, standing in for San Francisco; and Las Venturas, a dusty, neon-bright Las Vegas squatting in the desert. Not only is each vast in its own right, but the intervening space is expansive and packed. After the first ten hours or so, you're 'encouraged' out of Los Santos and introduced to a world of hicks, country music, tractors and remote, winding roads. The game's sense of place is so distinct that, as black CJ, you actually feel out of place in the small towns that dot the countryside.\nAs you get sucked further into the nefarious scheming of the corrupt cops excellently voiced by Samuel L Jackson and Chris Penn, you're dragged through the rolling countryside and north into San Fierro, all the time meeting and working for bizarre and intriguing characters. With a much more memorable layout than the first city, it's an even more exciting place to be, and you'll be rushing back and forth between the cities too, through the countryside.\nThroughout the game, the variety of the 100-plus missions never fails to delight. Steal a combine harvester. Infiltrate a secret army base. Chase down thieves on quad bikes. Rob a bank. Shoot down remote-controlled planes with a minigun. Rescue a bunch of stoned English rockers from the desert. Fly a plane to Liberty City to carry out a hit. From the simple to the devilish, from the grimly criminal to the comedic, from the sublime to the ridiculous, San Andreas retains the power to surprise and entertain throughout its lengthy structure.\nNot just in terms of the missions, either: you'll be infiltrating, burgling, flying, following, swimming, and shooting as a passenger as well as the more usual shooting and driving. My only quibble is that CJ never questions the reasoning behind the hundreds of casualties he's asked to inflict. \u201cKill that man? Aiight,\u201d sums up his usual response, and at times it's hard to empathise with such a cold-blooded hero.\nAs in the previous two GTA games, you can invest your cash in properties, some of which will provide an income once you've established a business there, and others which just act as new save points. These special locations often require you to complete a series of missions, offering yet another avenue to pursue. At any given time you'll have between one and half a dozen mission paths on offer, for you to take up in any order you want, or ignore completely in favour of a spot of pimping, exploring, police-baiting, male grooming or just riding around.\nAt once a giant, living playground and a smoothly contoured story, San Andreas still manages to be coherent despite giving the player the opportunity to ditch and pick up the storyline at will. The world doesn't have to depend on cutscenes for consistency, because there's always something going on, even if just in the background, to provide colour, life and atmosphere. The radio stations, legendary in GTA 3 and Vice City, are back with a dozen to choose from. As ever, Rockstar's cultural references are spot-on, and anyone older than their mid-20s will be powerfully reminded of their youth with the likes of Public Enemy, Primal Scream and Guns 'N' Roses. The interludes and chat shows are superbly scripted, if not quite as bizarrely hilarious as Vice City's. Again, the PC version enables us to supply MP3s and have them played on a dedicated radio channel.\nSan Andreas does the simple things well. Just stand on any given street, and within seconds you'll see little tableaux developing. Pedestrians bump into each other, pass comments at you and others, and get run over. If you're in an unfriendly 'hood, thugs wearing enemy gang colours will swagger up, offering threats, and eventually attack.\nJust existing is more gripping than before. Your 'wanted' level is again represented by stars, but here just one star will have the cops shooting and crashing cars like their doughnuts depended on it. Wanted stars are harder to get rid of, and even civilians will react angrily if you nudge their cars. As a result, you can't afford to be too carefree while cruising the streets. This, combined in particular with Los Santos' gritty, often run-down atmosphere, makes the overall experience quite different to Vice City's cartoon world. 'Actions have consequences' seems to be the moral message.\nThat's not to say that San Andreas is humourless: quite the opposite. From the missions and  cutscenes, to incidental dialogue and even tiny signs in obscure shops, you'll see Rockstar's trademark comedy style, ranging from the juvenile to the very explicit. San Andreas isn't afraid to say anything. Minor graphical scars left from its painful transformation into a PC game do nothing to dull San Andreas' inner beauty.

Changing resolutions can lead to a number of bugs forcing me to quit the game and come back. The singleplayer does feel a bit limiting since you have to finish all the missions to leave Los Santos without the entire police force coming for your\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Some tracks were actually removed from the game in an update (win for the people with physical copies). As someone who didn't notice that at first though, it never bothered me, and it doesn't bother me now. You might be better off with a physical copy but who has optical drives these days? It's a decent game and I was into the story (until I forgot to back up my saves when doing a clean install of Windows 10). Buying this game for full price on steam is a bit of a stretch though. If you REALLY want it on your steam library wait for a sale or better yet buy a used copy of the game for PC. If you don't mind losing mods then other versions of the game such as the ps2 version might be a consideration. The only mod I've used so far is San Andreas Multiplayer which works better with a physical copy. Modding for the steam version is actually a chore itself which leads to the physical copy master race once more... In fact, I myself would consider samp a very strange thing to play... You might deal with scumbags but it might be fun. I had a lot of fun and I also hated playing it at times. The people who play it are absolute dickbags though. It is EASILY the worst community I had ever dealt with in a while, maybe all time. The owners on this server leave \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t loopholes as well allowing donators to choose their spawn and if they wish spawn at YOUR house and your spawn and be a total\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665to people that didnt play GTA San Andreas since it launched. It doesn't help that door camping on that server is only camping if your crosshair is on the door and you shoot right as they leave, but standing on the top of their house is fair game. Now while this was one server, it was in a weird way the best one. A both better at the game community who happened to be a bunch of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s ruined it. Other servers with decent game modes are Mexican which can be a fun gimmick at first but the weirded out effect runs out eventually and the US servers are stuff like cops and robbers which is pretty lame IMO. Maybe my talk on samp went on too long but my original point still stands; if its on sale buying it might be a good idea but this isn't a full price game thanks to mods being somewhat broken on steam and used copies of the game having more content.

But it\u2019s probably too big for its own good, with so many things to do that it eventually feels empty.\nGTA: San Andreas is\nGTA game for many, and with good reason: unlike any other titles in the franchise, it has a whole miniature state with three cities (GTA versions of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas) and several towns. These all offer a variety of activities from collectibles to minigames and side-missions, on top of the already lengthy story.\nThis time you play as a black gangbanger who returns home after several years of self-imposed exile, only to find his old gang reduced to three members, the neighbourhood trashed, and a corrupt cop running half of the city. Just like how Vice City was a nod to the 80s shows like Miami Vice, San Andreas tries to capture the essence of early 90s blaxploitation movies like New Jack City, down to the obscene amount of profanity in every dialogue.\nThe plot is split to several chapters and moves around a huge cast of great characters, but maybe it is a tad too large for its own good. Missions try to be interesting, but eventually start repeating themselves, especially around the third city, where the story loses most of the steam, just like the additional content.\nThe large map also has drawbacks. There are lots of optional things to, but it often feels empty, especially when driving back and forth between the cities. Also, the rampages were removed from the PC version, taking away one of the most crucial elements of this era of GTAs, the random mindless violence.\nThese drawbacks only put a small dent into the shiny finish of the 3D era GTAs, and by all means, San Andreas was the perfect way to say farewell to this game engine and one of the best trilogies of action games.", "hours": 60.7, "username": "talgaby", "products": 488, "early_access": false}

The updated removed songs form the radio station people report about broken save files and they even removed resolutions... i play on a 1366x768 and they dont even have that resolution... i think they have four or five resoltions you can choose from and if you have a higher resolutions that what gta sa gives you then to bad you have to play on one of the lower resolutions.\nAlso my game freezed up by trying to enter the pizza shop close to grove street! What i never had a game freeze up on me and i have played arma 2 and 3 farcry 4 assassins creed 4 and many more and i can play them just fine but i cant play a 10 year old game without it freezing?\nAlso people have reported that you cant mod gta sa no more... why the **** not rockstar, you took away SA MP why would you do that to us. One of the most popular if not the most popular gaming company gave us the worst update they could have ever done. you should put gta sa on the steam workshop that would be amazing but you wont will you rockstar... no you wont, you took away many of our childhood memories with that update, you need to reupdate the game taking away all the stuff you put in this update.\nI have also noticed that the textures in the game are messed up as well, at the begining of the game when officer tenpenny and the other 2 officers gun down carl i noticed there guns clipping through the hands and it was very noticable so yes it is true that there is glitches with the textures in the game.\nAnother issue is that when i start up the game i cant use the mouse i have to CTRL+ALT+DEL many times to get my mouse to move the camera which makes no sense... and yes you can use a controller but you dont know what to do because it say stuff like use joy 9 to do this or joy 11 to do this... why not just say use y to enter and car and use x to jump... so unless you know all the 16 buttons and where they are at on the controller you wont be able to play with a controller. and yes i know you might be thinking that well if you have played gta sa before you should be able to play with a controller right... wrong because when i tried to use the controller everything was swapped around on the controller making it impossible to figure out what was what and where was where.\nSo i wish i could recommend this game but no i cant i feel it would be a sin to recommend this game that was one a amazing game to now a run down game full of missing songs to broken save files to texture glitches... and its sad knowing one of the very best gta games has been ruined by there own creator's... i never thought the day would come.", "hours": 9.5, "user_id": "76561198151814457", "username": "HazardWarfare", "products": 45, "early_access": false}

There's also a great soundtrack and a brilliant story. The characters all have a very interesting personality, the plot is very well written, and chances are you will get hooked just after a few missions.

The first sign of bad port came from the default keybinding. I always have a first look at keybindings before jumping into a game and remap a few things here and there. In GTA SA, I ended up spending 15min in the start menu remaping MOST controls since it was completely off! I've never seen such a poor choice of default keybindings. On the good side, most keys have only one action attached to it.\nThe interface feels sluggish (map can't be access with the press of a button, switch between crouching and standing only happens when you stand still...).\nThe game has some boring gameplay mechanics inherited from a lost era: you remember those sport games where you had to smash buttons as fast as possible to win a pathetic race... yeap, GTA SA's got that too because that was fun! Oh, the fond memories... Want to go faster on that push bike of yours, please tap the forward button like a mad man. Oh, and make sure to control the steering at the same time. You'll be in for a treat!\nYou don't seem to be able to carry any kind of health boost item and health kits seem pretty seldom on the map meaning you'd better be careful during missions.\nAnd if you fail a mission, you have to drive back to where you got the mission in the first place (from wherever you failed the mission or the hospital if you died) and start over again. Thankfully the game allows you to skip some parts... sometimes. For some reason some driving parts can be skipped but not others, and some videos can be skipped but not others... It's just a mess.\nI liked the idea of leveling skills and having some kind of fitness management. I was looking forward for the neighbourhoods fights and taking over the city since I enjoyed this in other more recent games.

Thankfully the game allows you to skip some parts... sometimes. For some reason some driving parts can be skipped but not others, and some videos can be skipped but not others... It's just a mess.\nI liked the idea of leveling skills and having some kind of fitness management.

A Game that probably anyone who calls himself a gamer knows.\nThis is game that really got me into games like this. I was around 8 years old when i played it for the first time (I'm 17 as I write this review),\nAnd I instantly loved that game. This game is 10 euros but gives as much or more fun as those expensive new titles.\nNow to the real deal.\n-Graphics? Probably best you could get in 2005.\n-Gameplay? Fascinating, amazing and immersive.\n-Character customization? You name it you got it - Tattoos, haircuts, Clothes, martial arts, and, what's impressive for such an old game, Fat and muscle levels which actually affect protagonist's body in pretty much real time.\n-Story? Dear authors...y u no hollywood yet?\n-Easter eggs? Of course! Pretty good ones, it's a rockstar's game afterall.\n-Bugs? yep, they happen, however nothing really disturbing unless it happens excessively (which appears to happen rarely).\n-Modding? Sure thing. There are tons of good mods, scripts, models, textures etc. You'll just need to downgrade the game since usual steam version can't be modded.\n-Map? Pretty big and well detailed with lots of interesting places.\n-Soundtrack? Really good, eventhough I mostly listen to rap, I enjoy listening to almost any radio station in the game.\n-Worth the price? How do you even dare to ask? Absolutely yes!\nIn short - Get this game. You won't regret it. Total 10/10.\nAny questions? Let me know in the comments.\nThank you for reading.", "hours": 368.0, "username": "TheNielegalnY187", "products": 55, "early_access": false}

Los Santos <3\nSounds- 75/100\nOh gosh , how I love to get in a car and live again those 90s musics . One of the things that I did not like about it , is a recent update that took some of my joys off. Copying one guy ----- \"Rockstar you a busta! \"\nStory-98/100.\nPERFECT STORY ! In this game you can live the life of Carl Johnson ( C.J) that came back to his city to assist to his mother funeral. As he gots here , he realizes that his gangsta crew was weak and dying and the others crew like the Ballas were getting better and bigger.He knew that he cannot turn his face around and ignore his familly , so he does a couple things to help the crew. He feels part of the team again and starts to live the thing again. You will be CJ that will try to seek the truth about his mothers death and will try to raise once again the glory of the Groove Street gang.\nGameplay- 80/100\nYou have 3 citys - Los Santos , San Fierro , Las Venturas , and 2 \"country \" zones , the Desert one , and the mountain one .\nThats enough ! You have 10000000 things to do!\nIn the end i consider that this game evaluation is 80/100 because it is an analyze from 2015, if this was an analyze from 2004 I would give without any doubt 99/100", "hours": 70.3, "username": "Your boy, Chillda the Great", "products": 371, "early_access": false}

Obviously the graphics are not on par with Grand theft auto V but boy is this game good. It has allot of customization when it comes to cars and clothes, also tattoos, hairstyles, body weight, muscle, sex appeal and more! Everything about this game is so nostalgic but i would highly recommend using a controller as it makes game play much more enjoyable, especially flying! This game has one of the best maps in any game i have ever played! There is always a place you have never been even if you have been playing since 2005. The story is solid and quite long but most of anybody's time playing this will be driving down the highway listening to k-rose. One other great thing about this game is that you can install hydraulics in almost any car.

The game itself is amazing although with a few issues. The most apparent issues are with compatibility, mostly on Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10. Problems ranging from audio and graphic glitches ... screen/game freezing .. to mouse controls not working properly. Same as in Vice City. But you could expect these for an old game and many (if not all) can be fixed by adding fixes, workarounds and mods. Now I remember how my friend bought me this game over a decade ago. The huge amount of content ... cool story ... I had lots and lots of fun. To this day I still own the DVD and I even got my girlfriend to play it. And she loved it too. So I thought I would have digital copy just in case something happens with my DVD. An added bonus is also that you do not have to deal with RGSC in this game. But just like Vice City it suffers from licensing and how Rockstar treats digital distribution of games. Because you DO NOT OWN IT when you buy it here, you just borrow it. They change the game when they wish and as recent events have shown they can remove stuff. Songs, options, fixes and in this way also all of the mods made throughout the years. In this case they swapped it with a mobile port entirely. And this will go on in the future. So as time goes your copy of the game on Steam gets worse and worse ... while old disk copies (like mine) and even pirated versions remain the best quality available. THIS is why I do not recommend buying it here. Which is a shame because it is one of the best games I have ever played and mods just made it even better. Most of those mods got invalidated when they switched the normal version with this clumsy port. Yes, you can download files to return it back to how it was. But then what is the point of having a legal digital copy if you need third-party files. Very very disappointing. Also this review and a TON of others were pushed away to erase the \"Mostly Negative\" score on Steam, real classy Rockstar & Valve...\n------------------------------------------------------------------", "hours": 0.5, "username": "Artibius", "products": 491, "early_access": false}

The negatives in this game are that the options menu isn't as great as vice city's. In this game you play as CJ (Carl Johnson). Our friendo CJ has been kicked out of the state of san andreas to Liberty City. CJ tries to live a normal life there. One day CJ gets a call from his brother Sweet then he finds out his mom died so he returns to San Andreas. CJ is soon held up by Officers which he all ready knows and is blamed for the murder of an officer. The Officers take CJ's cash and drop him into ballas turf (your rival gang). From then on you take control of CJ and help Grove st. (your gang) get back on its feet. The story in this game is brilliant. It will make you think twice about your friendships as some of the people you grow to love will turn your back on you and the people you hate might become your friends. This game tried to add RPG elements which worked well although I didn't like that you have to go to the gym to get muscle otherwise you become weak. There is a stat for eveything in this game. There is a stat for every gun, A stat for your breath, A stat fo you muscle, a stat for your stamina, a stat for driving, a stat for bikes and more which will keep you playing the game to max them all up (appart from fat, unless you want a heart attack.) And you will soon learn that money is something that you don't want to spend as you will not get it back quickly (unless you do the fire truck missions which give you $30,000 each 12 levels of fire trucking.) The better you get at certain things you might get certain buffs, like having the ability to dual wield shot guns. In this game you can gain turf for grove street which will make the streets a safer place for you. To gain turf you must kill 3 gang memebers on that turf then you will start a gang war which will send waves of gangsters at you. You can make this easier by bringing more grove memebers with you. Once you have killed the members of this turf grove members will spawn here and you will gain income from this turf. Like in vice city you can buy buisnesses and do missions for your buissnes helping you gain cash from it. This game is probably my second or third faviourte gta game and I love it.

I can maybe have let it slide if they removed the songs from any copies bought after the date in which the rights were lost but no they will just take it from anyone that has a digital copy. And this is what's messed up with the digital only world we have made for ourselves. We have waived our rights of ownership for the convenience of downloading. We no longer purchase games, we rent them and can have them taken from us or modified at any point of time. Can we do anything about this? Well no because when downloading these games you are agreeing to a bunch of legal nonsense that pretty much says we are screwing you over and there is nothing you can do about it. The best part is the consumers of digital games don't get a break anywhere, digital games cost the same as a hard copy, you can't let a friend borrow it, you can't trade it or sell it to a gamestop and on top of all that if they want to remove a bunch of content from the game in the future they have every right too. What do we get? We get F'ed in our A for the luxury of downloading something instead of going to a store and just buying it off the shelf. I have fallen for this con many times myself and after dealing with stuff like this I am no longer a consumer of digital goods.

It is one of the greatest games ever made and it pretty much left us all speechless when it came out. It's funny how after SO many years, I can easily remember the map and even where all the hidden items and guns were located. Countless hours, countless mods and all the countless stories we made up as we were playing this game as kids... That's something hard to forget. The map feels huge, the music is amazing and the gameplay is great. All the customization, minigames, hidden items, vehicles, landscapes, the driving schools, the war gangs... There are just too many things this game does right. After playing it recently, the missions and races that I found almost impossible are a piece of cake now. Nevertheless, they are still a lot of fun. As for how the game looks, yeah, well, it does look kind of old now (the game was released in 2004!) but a few texture packs here, an enb there and a mod here, and you've got yourself a beautiful looking game.\nRegarding the recent patch... Yeah, it sucks, but I wouldn't personally punish the game rating it bad as everyone seems to be doing. I wouldn't want anyone missing this game just because of the patch. Just use a downgrader to get it back to 1.0 and there you go! All the amazing songs that used to be in the original game are back and you can add a few extra mods. Takes less than 10 minutes.

When Carl arrives he is then greeted by 2 police officers known by the names of Frank Tenpenny And Eddie Pulaski.(that's all i will say about them)\nbut Carl realizes that thier gang \"Grove Street\" has fallen apart since he left cos the other gang Ballas have taken it all, and i mean they pretty much have nothing.\nSo now it's up to Carl and his friends to take back Los Santos!!!!!!!!!\nSo the story might seem a bit boring or just not interesting but that's because i don't wan't to spoil it for you :)\nPresentation:\nThis game looks pretty damn good but i've seen better looking games from 2004 or 2005 such as, Metal Gear Solid 3,uhhh other games? i can't really think of any games from that time,\nbut the lighting is nice the models are nice aswell but some textures are just terrible just look at the weapons. But maybe that has to do with the game being and openworld sandbox and to have insane graphics at that environment would just be too much for the game?\nThe only thing i really HATE about the graphics are the effing shadows they are just so bright it makes no sense at all.\nGameplay:\nThis gameplay is absouletly awesome and it's a Huge improvement over Vice City you can now crouch and walk with a weapon, aim by right clicking, Svim, ride bicycles, fly jets, parachute, date girls, f*** the girls you just dated, hit people with \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, be black,aim your gun sideways, dual weild, respond to people dissing you or greeting you, say the n word,\nlearn new fighting moves, work out to increase your stamina, workout to increase your strength, be hungry, puke,gain weight, loose weight AND SO MUCH MORE.\nwhat i'm trying to say is this game is filled with stuff to do and it plays nice and smooth no delay when turning (like in Vice City) and it's just great fun\nFinal Thoughts:\ni have to say the map for San Andreas is just Awesome i love Los Santos(Los Angelas) I love San Fierro(San Francisco) I love the country parts of both places, love the desert of Nevada, I love Las Venturas(Las Vegas).\nAlso Carl Johnson is just the funniest coolest character ever just listen to these qoutes\nInfact all the characters are awesome they are just well made.\nIn Conclusion:\nthis game here is just amazing in every single way possible\nthe soundtrack is awesome fitting and catchy\nthe gameplay is smooth fun and responsive\nthe story is great and deep sort of deep(not really)\nthe game looks really good\nit hasn't  dated at all in gamepaly\nGET IT NOWWWWWWWWWW\ni rate it 10/10 i think this game is just perferct i have nothing bad to say about it (apart from the presentation)\nbut i do recomend you downgrade to version 1.0 to have all the songs back and stuff\nand then i recomend to get silents patch and asi loader, and widescreen fix\nyou can get it all here\nOh yeah there is also multiplayer (it's a mod it's called san andreas multiplayer or SAMP)\nand also 10/10\n10/10\n10/10\n10/10", "hours": 211.1, "user_id": "76561198079702749", "username": "BENDER-DOOMILE", "products": 83, "early_access": false}

To a newcomer to the game this won't affect you at all. You've never heard the songs in the game, and it's really rather irrelevant when it comes to the final verdict of the game unless you already own the game or have nostalgic memories about one of the songs removed.\nYou really should just play this game with the Silent Patch anyways, the vanilla version on PC has always been pretty lackluster without it (locking the fps to 25 to make swimming work properly), and the Silent Patch fixes just about everything and adds in the songs as well.\nIt's a R* game, and it's not a Max Payne game...you know the port is not going to be good. Vanilla GTA San Andreas does not have a 1080p resolution, the options are VERY limited (although Anti-aliasing is there, so that's cool), and in order to proceed through certain missions in the game, you'll have to enable the frame rate limiter...which locks the game at a silky smooth 25fps! Also, from my playthrough the game would occasionally crash anytime I messed with the settings too much. So, it's definitely not a great port by any means. However, it's an old enough game to where performance shouldn't be much of an issue for any modern PC (especially with Silent Patch).\nDidn't look great 10 years ago, looks bad now. It's not \"god awful\" or anything, but at the same time it definitely shows its age. I'd say it looks more like a game from 2002 than a game from 2005 (the same year BF2 came out on PC). The characters do not even have fingers, which is one of those little details that can really kill an emotional scene. Some of the foliage has a really ugly white outline to it as well, which looks really out of place, and is actually pretty surprising to see considering that R*, even back then, was known for their insane attention to detail. So, definitely not a looker.\nIt's decent, I mean it's GTA, so first and foremost the focus is fun and mayhem. However, if you want to unlock all the territory in the game, you'll have to do at least most of the story line so the story still plays a big role. You're CJ, an ex-gang member who moved to Liberty City and got involved with the mob. One day in 1992 you get a call from your brother and gang leader of your former gang, Sweet, who informs you that your mother has been killed in a drive by. You return to Los Santos to find that your gang and family has fallen apart mainly due to the rising crack epidemic. So you start to clean up, but in the process you get caught back up in old feuds. So basically you go on a redemption story to save your hood and family while going through all of San Andreas and meeting characters voiced by actors like Samuel Jackson and James Woods. It's an enjoyable ride, and most of the voice acting in the cutscenes is really top notch for the era. However, for the most part the story is just there to get the player to the next set piece, city, or gameplay element. Why am I sneaking into a top secret base for some hippie and stealing a million dollar jet pack? What does that have to do with saving my family and redeeming myself? Nothing, but it sure is fun and makes the gameplay even better!\nThis is where the game shines. It's just an absolute blast to play. Cars control very tightly and smoothly, planes and boats not so much, but they still are a lot of fun to fly around in. A HUGE selection of guns that all feel unique. The only area that I felt was pretty bad would have to be the stealth sections. They're just so forced, and most of the time they make no difference. Also, auto-aiming is a bit OP on the controller, it really feels like I'm a hacker with an aimbot. And, the drive-by mechanic of the game isn't great, since you can only fire in 2 directions instead of a full 360 like in future GTAs. However, it's not really fair to complain about San Andreas missing features from future GTAs.\nThe amount of content in this game is insane. I'm willing to bet it will take the average player at LEAST 100 hours to complete this game fully. It truly is never-ending as well, there are always more cops to fight, more hoods to take/defend, more people to save, more fires to fight, more criminals to chase, etc... If you're tight on cash and can only run low demanding games, San Andreas is absolutely perfect for you.\nSan Andreas is a wonderfully realized world, the cities all manage to some how feel unique from one another, which is amazing when considering how small the map really is and the limited space R* had on the PS2. Everything from the radio stations to the pedestrians on the street scream 90s west coast. R* is great at making digital worlds come to life, and San Andreas is no exception.\nThe game really doesn't have a score (besides the catchy song that plays in the intro and when you complete a mission) however, the game does have a ton of radio stations. And I gotta say, these are easily the best radio stations in any game I've played.\nJust, an insane list of musicians. Also, one of the DJs is voiced by Chuck D, and of course Lazlow is also in the game. In the 40 hours I played of the game, I never got sick of the radio stations, they are all just awesome.", "hours": 43.5, "username": "Favorite Hobo\u2122", "products": 170, "early_access": false}

Hey, don't forget that Sam L. mother\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing Jackson is also a voiceactor here.\nThe dialogue is real shining. You are garunteed to be laughing in every cutscene. Very humorous, and very clever.\n10/10 'd like to rewind the cutscene for these great dialogue\nThe story is not so strong. The drama is not so good. But the length is very good for the gameplay-based type. Overall, it is not so ugly.\nMusics are great, special effects are acceptable. Main theme song is the best. Please go to youtube and find Young Maylay (CJ's voice actor) version, fricking sick!\nCar models are very beautiful but pedestrians are somewhat repetitive. The weather and sky are beautiful. Overall, not so bad.\nMap rendering mechanics are very slow such that rendering distance can not be very large. Map details are very good, you can walk/drive around San Andreas, listening to the radio, after your long day. However, it has very low interactibility.

It was on sale a couple of days ago and I decided to buy it and try for myself this now broken and ugly game, that bloody mobile port everyone was running away from and... THE GAME IS JUST FINE! Sure, some songs were removed which is totally stupid and I really don't understand how can a license for a song in a video game expire during time (why is there a need to renew it) but that's about it. GTA SA looks great, as it always did, plays great and handles very good. My framerate is constant (it wasn't on older versions), no texture poping, draw distance is much better now, the gameplay is the same. All in all I do miss the 14-15 songs that are missing, but with time you stop noticing they aren't there (you can always make your own playlist ingame) but that's about it. Everything else is just perfect. It's GTA San Andreas, the best game ever made in all it's glory. I think that today's kids are just too spoiled and therefore trash everything that doesn't meet their expectations. They thought they were getting an HD version (because all today's kids see is the graphics) and they didn't get that.\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes video games. This is the definition of a video game.\n10/10\nPS: I heard that some are complaining that some resolutions are removed. Well, the support is not removed, just the ingame options, you can make custom resolutions easily by using external software found on the web.\nAlso, if you don't want to risk losing your save files in the future updates just set the update options for GTA SA to update only when you start the game. Now when there's an update for your game you can see it first, before installing it, backup your savegames and than just restore them after the update. Shouldn't be a problem because the savegames are easily found in My Documents and updates are really rare for this game now.\nGO BUY THIS GAME!!!

I usually don't play the PC version that much compared to other GTA PC ports, but I recently got back in to it, and Rockstar has to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 it up. What do I mean? Well for starters, they recently had an update having new features such as a better resolution and controller support. However, I wouldn't really call the controller support well intergrated, as its very basic, and in my opinion not well optimized since it doesn't work for me. HOWEVER, the biggest problem with this new update, is that it causes the saves to become corrupted, and for some, all of their save files are gone, with no way of getting it back. This is the most \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t update that Rockstar has ever released, its terrible. Not to mention, they removed 19 songs of this games soundtrack, most likely due to copyright reasons but there is no way of preventing this game from being updated, so hope you didn't have any 100% saves, because now you're left with a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 version of GTA:SA with your saves corrupted. I cannot recommend this port by any means, there is a way to downgrade it, so there's that at least.

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 678, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-02-13", "text": "Forget the fact that GTA San Andreas started life as a PlayStation 2 game. The ugly caterpillar has become a beautiful (if foul-mouthed) butterfly. The fifth in a series that since its 2D birth on PC (back in 1997) has celebrated despicable gangsters and drive-by/-thru/-into and -over crime. San Andreas reaches new lows of depraved morality, senseless violence and alpha-male aggression. But it's the fact that it's one of the best games ever made that has already propelled it to console ultra-success.\nGTA 3 struggled to make the technical leap to PC with its code intact, but months of finger-crossing and animal sacrifices to nameless gods have paid off. San Andreas runs like a dream, with the excellent mouse and keyboard control system of Vice City, extended visual range and atmospheric effects.\nLike its two more recent predecessors, San Andreas puts you in the shoes of a central character about to embark on a life of crime. However, CJ \u2013 aka Carl Johnson \u2013 is no career mobster in the mould of Vice City's Tommy Vercetti. In fact, he's been away from the 'hood for five years to try and escape the gang violence endemic in his home city of Los Santos. He's brought back by his mother's untimely death. Hooking up with his brother Sweet and old friends, CJ is inevitably drawn back into the world he had left behind; a world of guns, drugs, territory, casual violence and 'respect'.\nRespect is actually a measured factor which is raised by performing notorious criminal acts. High respect means you can reinforce CJ with extra gang members when attempting to take over enemy territory. Although, initially, CJ doesn't even get respect from his brother. It's a good system, which draws you further into the game. As you complete missions, you start to gain the grudging respect of those around you. Eventually they adore you. San Andreas is no conventional RPG, but there's a definite feeling of character progression in this game.\nOr is it an RPG? CJ has several other stats which have subtle but noticeable effects on the game. Driving, cycling, stamina, motorcycling, flying, pistol, rifle... every mode of transport and every type of weapon has an associated skill which increases as you employ it.\nBetter gun skills mean more accuracy with that weapon, while a higher motorbike skill means you won't fall off as easily if you nick a car or lamp-post. There are even scales for fat, muscle and sex appeal, variously dictated by what and how much you eat; your work in the gym; what you wear; your haircut and your tattoos. Some of this is frippery, but it'll also affect whether you can attract girlfriends (and their subsequent side missions), how much damage you withstand (fatties can take more lead, apparently) and some people's responses to you. Like so much in San Andreas, these statistics are carefully woven into the game's structure.\nIf you thought that Vice City's twin islands offered a huge playground, prepare your mind for a boggling. San Andreas offers a whole new world of largeness. There are three cities: Los Santos, a version of Los Angeles and your home town; San Fierro, standing in for San Francisco; and Las Venturas, a dusty, neon-bright Las Vegas squatting in the desert. Not only is each vast in its own right, but the intervening space is expansive and packed. After the first ten hours or so, you're 'encouraged' out of Los Santos and introduced to a world of hicks, country music, tractors and remote, winding roads. The game's sense of place is so distinct that, as black CJ, you actually feel out of place in the small towns that dot the countryside.\nAs you get sucked further into the nefarious scheming of the corrupt cops excellently voiced by Samuel L Jackson and Chris Penn, you're dragged through the rolling countryside and north into San Fierro, all the time meeting and working for bizarre and intriguing characters. With a much more memorable layout than the first city, it's an even more exciting place to be, and you'll be rushing back and forth between the cities too, through the countryside. Eventually you'll progress to Las Venturas and then back to Los Santos to tie up the loose ends of the story.\nThroughout the game, the variety of the 100-plus missions never fails to delight. Steal a combine harvester. Infiltrate a secret army base. Chase down thieves on quad bikes. Rob a bank. Shoot down remote-controlled planes with a minigun. Rescue a bunch of stoned English rockers from the desert. Fly a plane to Liberty City to carry out a hit. From the simple to the devilish, from the grimly criminal to the comedic, from the sublime to the ridiculous, San Andreas retains the power to surprise and entertain throughout its lengthy structure.\nNot just in terms of the missions, either: you'll be infiltrating, burgling, flying, following, swimming, and shooting as a passenger as well as the more usual shooting and driving. My only quibble is that CJ never questions the reasoning behind the hundreds of casualties he's asked to inflict. \u201cKill that man? Aiight,\u201d sums up his usual response, and at times it's hard to empathise with such a cold-blooded hero.\nAs in the previous two GTA games, you can invest your cash in properties, some of which will provide an income once you've established a business there, and others which just act as new save points. These special locations often require you to complete a series of missions, offering yet another avenue to pursue. At any given time you'll have between one and half a dozen mission paths on offer, for you to take up in any order you want, or ignore completely in favour of a spot of pimping, exploring, police-baiting, male grooming or just riding around.\nAt once a giant, living playground and a smoothly contoured story, San Andreas still manages to be coherent despite giving the player the opportunity to ditch and pick up the storyline at will. The world doesn't have to depend on cutscenes for consistency, because there's always something going on, even if just in the background, to provide colour, life and atmosphere. The radio stations, legendary in GTA 3 and Vice City, are back with a dozen to choose from. As ever, Rockstar's cultural references are spot-on, and anyone older than their mid-20s will be powerfully reminded of their youth with the likes of Public Enemy, Primal Scream and Guns 'N' Roses. The interludes and chat shows are superbly scripted, if not quite as bizarrely hilarious as Vice City's. Again, the PC version enables us to supply MP3s and have them played on a dedicated radio channel.\nSan Andreas does the simple things well. Just stand on any given street, and within seconds you'll see little tableaux developing. Pedestrians bump into each other, pass comments at you and others, and get run over. If you're in an unfriendly 'hood, thugs wearing enemy gang colours will swagger up, offering threats, and eventually attack.\nJust existing is more gripping than before. Your 'wanted' level is again represented by stars, but here just one star will have the cops shooting and crashing cars like their doughnuts depended on it. Wanted stars are harder to get rid of, and even civilians will react angrily if you nudge their cars. As a result, you can't afford to be too carefree while cruising the streets. This, combined in particular with Los Santos' gritty, often run-down atmosphere, makes the overall experience quite different to Vice City's cartoon world. 'Actions have consequences' seems to be the moral message.\nThat's not to say that San Andreas is humourless: quite the opposite. From the missions and  cutscenes, to incidental dialogue and even tiny signs in obscure shops, you'll see Rockstar's trademark comedy style, ranging from the juvenile to the very explicit. San Andreas isn't afraid to say anything. Minor graphical scars left from its painful transformation into a PC game do nothing to dull San Andreas' inner beauty. The best of the series, and already a contender for game of the year.", "hours": 0.3, "username": "Raz1911", "products": 175, "early_access": false}

So I was verry disappointed when rockstar for some reason decided to postphone the release of an already finished game by 3 months for no reason.

So i thought: well i might as well get the game now and have something to do. I even noticed that it was recently updated so i expected something that was in a remotely working order.  I was verry wrong:\n- I noticed that there is something weird with some of the textures. Now i know this game is 10+ years old by now... but i think i would have remembered it if something like foliage is missing.\n- Some of the old higher resultion settings appear to have been removed. Which irritated me a lot.\n- apperently some of the old songs are missing (if you read the other reviews you can see which), now i dont mind it that much but now the list of leftover songs has been become shorter which means that songs start to repeat themselves. which, again, is annoying. (and i did notice this)\n- but most irritating of all: i would not mind a patch removing some of the old contend if it would mean that the game is playing on todays computes. But it is not: There is a bug in the game that render you unable to move the aiming dot with your mouse. Now this bug can ofcourse be fixed by alt-tabbing repeatedly (my average is about 5 times which takes about 1 minute thanks to the switching resolutions) . again not a big deal but this bug occurs just about every time your character enters or leaves a car.\nSo overview: Used to be a great game, felt nostalgia. noticed it had been updated. however: the update removed a lot of contend and did in fact not fix even the well known game-breaking problems.\nJudgement: dont waste your time on this... even 10 euros is far too expensive for this.", "hours": 0.6, "user_id": "76561198007299273", "username": "Tim", "products": 285, "early_access": false}

Prety much from the time of it's release many of my friends told me about how much fun it was.  Myself I cannot get past how awful the controlls are, and perhaps thats just a sign of a bad port to PC.  For a game that spends so much time driving you'd think the cars would be drivable, but the driving in this game is laughable.  It's more frustration than anything else, only being usable due to the lack of other cars on the road.  Most of the time the road either in your lane or oncomming trafic is clear so you don't have to worry about room to drive.  If you do happen to bump something the pinball collision bumpers will engage and through you completely off course, even if it's low speed bump against a light pole on your rear you may be sent spinning...\nThe on foot controlls are just as bad, most especialy the combat.  Being another major factor in the game play the guns and melee combat are horribly underdeveloped.  Aiming a gun using the mouse is clunky and less responsive than the original Doom.  The melee is just as bad making the melee in Morowind look like and advaced hand to hand combat simulator.\nIn several quest mandatory minigames I was left high and dry to figure out the controlls, and even worse durring at least one quest (Cesar Vialpando) the controlls were reversed to what the on screen prompts asked for.\nOne of the most frustrating things about this game is the save system.  In order to save a game you must return to your safe house... no mater how far away that safe house is.  It is simply absurd that there was not an option to save on the spot even if loading a save spawned the character at the safe house being forced to return there any tiem you want to save means that saving your progress could take five minutes or more.  Saving should not be an exercise in patience.\nFinally, a big disapointment for me was the lack of anything interesting to do or see outside of listening to the radio and missions.  The city is very large, and well designed.  Driving around however it is just a bunch of buildings you can't enter  with NPCs milling about.  Occasionally you might hear a snip of conversation that may make you chuckle but the city is quite dull... whats the point of an open world sand box if there isn't anything to do.\nI found this game to be a little ore than a struggle against the controlls with little to speak for it other than a beautifull, static city", "hours": 8.6, "user_id": "76561198032536288", "username": "Red XIII", "products": 163, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

The mouse completely fails to work in-game unless you alt-tab after starting the game, open Task Manager, right-click the GTA San Andreas process, and set the CPU affinity to a single CPU (and users have to learn this information themselves if they want to play the game they purchased). This has to be done every time the game is started. The mouse still tends to break randomly after setting the CPU affinity; sometimes alt-tabbing temporarily fixes it, but sometimes restarting the game is required.\nThere's also a graphics setting called \"Frame limiter\". If this is turned on, the game is limited to 25 FPS, which is nearly unplayable for a PC game. If it's off, the FPS is unlimited, but apparently having it off can cause all sorts of bugs because the game uses frames as a way to measure time in the game.\nFurthermore, the game doesn't save the mouse sensitivity setting; it must be reconfigured every time the game is started.\nFinally, the game has terrible performance on a GTX 660M; draw distance can be maximized, but turning up visual effects or AA causes the framerate to drop to sub-20 FPS. It's absolutely unacceptable (but perfectly in line with Rockstar's low-effort PC ports) for a PS2-era game to run this poorly on a computer that can max out Far Cry.\nI'm glad I got this game for free.

However, I had the non-steam (retail disk) version a few years back, so thought it would be fun to relive the old days, before GTA V came out.\nThe game is crappy now. It is poorly optimised, most of the songs I remember are gone, and the resolution is very low, even on its highest settings. I thought this was perculiar, as the resolution was great, when I first got the game in 2010/2011. Having done some research, I found out that R* patched the game, to the point where it was essentially a port of the MOBILE game. This dissapointed me greatly.\nIn conclusion, no, I don't reccomend this. If you got it free with GTA V, its okay, because it's free. However, don't buy this on it's own.\nReally, my honest opinion is, if you want to play this game, torrent it. This gives you the genuine experience of what the game was intended to be upon release.

Until now, this game is interesting to many people because of its graphics, gameplay pleases many. We can argue that GTA San Andreas is already old, but she still let all the new additions, fashion, programs, cheats. Specifically for this version of GTA were vypuschiny two different online client (naturally from third-party developers). Online this game is huge it can be played on the DM servers and build their real life. Very much like Clint sump. What can you say about the world included in GTA San Andreas? - I can only say one thing, he is not big but not small. For us, there are three medium-sized cities, more than 10 villages.\nI commend this part of the game in its development capabilities, you can buy a house (of which more than 20), you can tune almost all the traffic is present in the game. You can dress your character from more than 100 different clothes. Nakochat can fill his belly or bigmak'ami. Can be Alphonse or meet with a girl.\nWork in the game is also present normal amount, starting with the police, firemen, ambulance, taxi, truck drivers. These works are the additional income the same as raced since finishing racing bicycles and penalties. You can razvist stamina your character izvuchit martial arts of the three species. Bleed skill weapons - which by the way the game is also a stable number.\nMission of the game and of course a lot, but each one is unique and they are tightened. I can even say with certainty that this review will be useless and not fully open to opreleeniya this part of the GTA. But I just think that there is in the world of modern man, who at least once did not play this wonderful game.", "hours": 50.3, "username": "RaFiK", "products": 257, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": false}

One more time to try to do the most from what there is to be done in this game and 60 hours were not enough to do not more than 70% of what I had aimed for after after beating it. (But there's so many other games to try out there, so I decided to move on)\nGTA: San Andreas is one of the best mafia openworld sandbox action 3rdPS games i've ever played in my life.\nThe graphical improvements from GTA: Vice City are noticable. The voice acting is perfect. The map is huge compared to the games before it.\nIn a big world full of choices you make your way through a very interesting, fun, crazy, and dramatic story about brotherhood, friendship, hunger, corruption and betrayal. GTA: San Andreas is the 3rd  instalment of its kind and the 5th in turn within the franchise (excluding the special editions of the titles of that time).\nLots of vehicles to use, lots of guns to choose, lots of characters to meet, lots of places to explore, lots of easter eggs to find, and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s of side quest missions and achievements to accomplish. A game easy capable to stay playable for a ton of extra hours after finishing the main story.\nAnd even after all that said, with the game supporting mods and with millions of those out there to be downloaded and tried, the amount of extra playtime that can be spent in this game even today is insane.\nIts like the Elder Scrolls of its genre.\nThere are noticable cons in this edition to be fair. Some crashes here and there and very few but hard to miss bugs, but they didn't take away from the tons of fun i had. Also some missions, taking their length and places under consideration, could use a checkpoint mechanism (though you can still manage them after a few tries at worst).\nTotally and fully recommended.", "hours": 60.6, "username": "Zweis\u2020ein ( \u0ca0_\u0ca0)", "products": 261, "early_access": false}

Some games you hear all kinds of praise about, they get 10/10's all across the board and when you play them you end up feeling like you've been scammed, some games are universially considered rubbish and laughed at by all and sundry. GTA San Andreas isn't one of them. Right from the start, from the very first time the police drop you in Balla territory, to the time you hear your combine harvester cut through crazed cultists, to the first time you get behind the pilot's cockpit of a Hydra fighter plane, every moment sticks with you.\nFor todays realistic graphics and complex storylines and total linear action and easy save and restart everywhere gamers (you kids these days) this game will look very dated, but for it's time it was an incredible influence and PS2's BEST game without a doubt. On PC, there's all kinds of incredicble mods you can get, which while that may apply to all GTA games some of the best I've ever seen are on this game. Recomended: the online mod and a good console command/trainer.\nDon't let my small play time fool you: I've been playing this for years on the PS2. It's got to a point where I know San Andreas State more than I know my home city, and most of my music taste comes from GTA (white guy who likes underground rap, natch) now, I've explored every nook and cranny of the game, modded it to the extremes and yet here I am, still riding around on vanilla with the radio off just enjoying the drive.\nFor anyone who got this free with their copy of GTA V pre order, and who hasn't played it yet (!) I implore that you play this first. No doubt it will fill the time until March, but even then you will keep playing it even after GTA V. Call it nostalgia goggles, call it dated, but don't call it overrated. This is one of the most golden things to come out of gaming, and until GTA V proves me wrong I will still call this Rockstar's greatest game.", "hours": 38.5, "user_id": "76561198157410379", "username": "PirateEagle", "products": 124, "early_access": false}

Certainly the most major FAIL of steam! They don't want to take any responsibility for 3rd party games, which I can understand to a certain degree. But you can't even put a ticket on Rockstar support since you have to wait ONE MONTH (SIC!) until you're able to comment in the forum! To make things even better for users there is no other way to contact them. Oh! Wait, there's a twitter account... I tweeted them and can't be sure my problem will be understood in 140 signs by them... Letz see what's gonna happen there. I also tried to contact the steam support, but they didn't even read my request, they just sent me an automatic email which told me that nothing can be done about that and that thereby my problem is marked as solved.\nFU steam, rly!

They are giving this game a \"not recommended\" review because they are butt hurt over this. The reality is that the PC verision of this game lets you create a custom radio station from any music file that resides on your PC, So most likely, this is a non-issue if you can figure this out. You can replace all the songs they took out with the original files on your computer (or any other songs that you would want to listen to while playing - like your crappy band you played guitar in while you were in college)!\nI have also read that this does not support 1920x1080 resolution. It does and it works great on my 46\" HDTV. The only weird thing is that certain graphics - the most noticible being the map in the lower left - are still lower res. This doesn't really bother me though, because the main game is running in full res.\nI haven't experienced any crashing or glitches thus far. I bought this game the day it came out on Playstation 2 and this Steam version is just as good as I remembered it, except it looks way better. Oh, and I'm playing on an Xbox 360 controller, so all the original controller mapping is still there as well.\nI can't, for the life of me, figure out why people are so upset over the latest patch. To not recommend this game because they took some songs out is just idiotic! Some complain that mods or previous saves don't work after updating, but if you don't own this already, then that is no reason to not recommend this game to you. Buy it! Especially if it's on sale for a few dollars. I spent $50 on it when it came out for PS2, and I happily paid a few more dollars to have it on Steam as well to relive a great game that's still as good today as it was over 10 years ago!\nBuy it if you haven't played it, or if you have and want to relive old memories.", "hours": 10.1, "username": "Elf Blizzard", "products": 91, "early_access": false}

Some games are excellent without good graphics such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (even though the graphics were amazing for such a huge game) and any Grand Theft Auto game pre GTA IV. The game brings back a great nostalgic feeling when playing, I felt like I was back at my old house playing as I was running over hookers with a motorcycle and throwing molotov cocktails at anything that moved (I was a sick kid) but the controls on the keyboard are a bit awkward.

It's a little of a downgrade because I'm so used to playing GTAIV (graphics aren't as nice, etc.), but it's still a nice game for Sandbox/Open World/GTA fans. I can actually see myself playing this game for hours and hours now, despite all the new update has changed or \"ruined,\" as some others may put it.\nHowever, I really hope that Steam releases a new update to fix all of the issues that other players and I have experienced.  Initially, I felt that I made a terrible investment. I still kind of feel it's a bad investment in its current state. In its current state, I would give this game a 2.5/5. Once the issues have been resolved, I would definitely give this game a full 5/5.\nEDIT: Over 100 hours of gameplay later, I would give this game a full 5/5 hands down! There's a fix for the screen resolution issue (don't remember where I found it or what it is, but you can find it pretty easily on the web.

It has the world that can't compete with that of GTA V's (in size, that is), but there are 3 separate cities which are pretty big, with different people, with different gangs, with different, unwritten rules.\nThe soundtrack is great, because you might find a radio channel with the genre of your liking.\nI have heard of the patch that removed a piece of the original soundtrack. It also made all pre-patch saves obsolete. Just because a wild patch appeared it doesn't mean that this game is suddenly crap. But the save ruining is pretty serious for those pretty far in the game. Also it completely removed 1080p support for no reason at all. Personally, this patch doesn't make me angry, not even a bit. Hell, I think the 1080p removal even fits the game, because I think there were no 1080p monitors in every household back in 2005.\nDespite the patch, this game is a 7/10.\n+Open-world, no worries with the time\n+Soundtrack variety\n+Car customization, didn't happen in later GTAs until GTA V\n+3 cities gives the player a better choice to live in\n+Modifiable\n+The patch added controller support for PC\n-The patch ruined pre-patch saves, hopefully another patch is released to patch the patch that broke pre-patch saves (ay man, I heard you like patches...)\n-At the start, you have to be in Los Santos, no possibility to go to San Fierro or Las Venturas before progressing\n-The patch also broke all mod support\n-The patch removed 1080p support", "hours": 9.0, "username": "Mecha Carny", "products": 89, "early_access": false}

And nothing really has changed since the previous games other then a couple little things like the player is able to swim and not die instantly, flying is easier and parachutes are added, lock on isn't perfect but better then before, and the game adds a fat-fitness part where the player has to watch what Carl eats and exercises so that he isn't too fat and slow or too skinny and weak.\nOne major thing over previous installments is the shear size of the state of San Andreas which it is about 2 to 3 times as big as Vice City's layout and is full of things to do.\nThe music is a mixed bag for me as most of the soundtrack is full of rap/hip-hop and the only stations I would listen to was the talk and rock stations and sometimes those got boring so I was glad I could mute the game and listen to my iPod.\nThe voice acting in San Andreas is awesome as all the characters from Carl to Officer Tenpenny all sound like they are real people in this faux world.\nNow unless someone was living under a rock for the past couple years, San Andreas came under fire for having a \"hidden\" sex game but was only unlockable if the player owns a cheat device or has the PC version and unofficially patched the game so really the game got a little more heat than it should have. And in this edition that part of the code has been removed totally so players wanting to see the \"hot coffee\" are out of luck.\nAdded into the special edition is The Introduction which chronicles the events leading up where the game starts.\nIn whole the game is a blast to play and if you own a PS2 you shouldn't be caught dead with out it.\n10/10", "hours": 0.5, "username": "UberGeekGamer", "products": 1983, "early_access": false}

Extremely well-written, expansive, innovative and incredibly fun. CJ is one of the strongest characters Rockstar has ever developed, along with the rest of the character list. The voice acting is incredibly well-done, the music selection is (or was) second only to GTA: Vice City in my opinion. The variety of things you can do in this game is arguably second-to-none in the entire franchise, which helps Rockstar in its portrayal of a truly open world.\nThe graphical stylings, while outdated by today's standards, still please the eye and many parallels can be seen between this game's environment and that of Grand Theft Auto V's more recent version of Los Santos which I can't help but think about as I play this game. GTA V's environmental design would undoubtedly have suffered in my opinion had Rockstar not made GTA: SA previously.\nOverall, I'd consider it a must-play for anyone interested in sandbox games, GTA as a franchise or... hell, historically notable games. This game is widely considered one of the best of all time, which makes sense, considering it was the best-selling PlayStation 2 game ever.\nHowever, the Steam version has just been updated (after several years with no updates whatsoever), and there are a few unfortunate setbacks I have to point out for people who are considering buying the Steam version.\nYears ago, Rockstar updated GTA: SA for Steam with version 3.0. Among some bugfixes and miscellaneous improvements, the patch somehow inexplicably broke 16:9 resolution support entirely.\nThis problem is still around in the latest patch, which, if you're like the majority of PC owners these days and have a 16:9 widescreen monitor, will mean you will encounter letterboxing and a lower resolution than your monitor is capable of rendering. Only with an unofficial modification can you get around this, and it's deeply disturbing that Rockstar still hasn't noticed this problem yet.\nAlongside this, Rockstar, apparently pressured by music publishers whose tracks they licensed for GTA: SA's soundtrack, has removed somewhere around 20 tracks from the game entirely. This was done retroactively, meaning that previous owners of the game before the latest patch, like myself, have no choice but to play the game now without musical content they purchased.\nIf you don't play GTA games for the radio stations, this may not impact you as much, but regardless, Rockstar's approach to enforcing licensing restrictions with this patch was in my opinion heavy-handed at best, criminally deceptive at worst. It can set a precedent for AAA publishers to unilaterally remove content at will, and while the change of content with/without notice is disclosed in most games' EULAs these days, that just doesn't work in an economic system where one pays for the ownership of a good.\nSome of the artists in this game I first found out about thanks to GTA: San Andreas, including Helmet, Rage Against The Machine, NWA, Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Public Enemy, and it's a little heart-breaking that the game no longer reflects my childhood memories of it after a decade, with some of my favorite songs conspicuously absent. These are songs everyone who bought the game before the update paid for.\nRockstar hasn't even mentioned the update at all on their website (par for the course, though, they're very sporadic with their PR), or on the News page on Steam for the game, so I'm not sure whether or not they were even going to announce this. We shall see what happens.\nI will be fair and include the latest patch's implementation of (apparent) DRM-free implementation and XInput control support, however. The XInput implimentation is not perfect but still playable and hopefully it is beneficial to people accustomed to GTA console controls.\nBasically, if you try using an Xbox 360 controller's triggers for throttle control for vehicles similarly to GTA IV you've got your work cut out for you, as all inputs besides the thumbsticks are treated as digital buttons including the triggers. This makes it very difficult to regulate the speed of your vehicle in my personal experience, which is extremely important in multiple missions. Other than performing steering with thumbsticks, I gained absolutely nothing in playablility because of this but was still capable of beating the game.\nIt's due to these less-than-ideal changes to the game, as playable as it still is, that I cannot recommend you purchase the Steam version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, because at the end of the day you get less content than you would have had a week ago for the same price (at the time of writing) and have no choice in the matter. You owe it to yourself to find an original retail version with the soundtrack and resolution compatibility completely intact, at least then you won't be forced to update the game according the whims of music industry executives.\n(As the update to the game was very recent and may change in the future, I will accordingly update this review if things develop further.)", "hours": 112.9, "username": "arbayer2 <BCI/TBfB>", "products": 555, "early_access": false}

It's a fantastic entry to the series, with enough content to keep you occupied for weeks. That's not even including the highly populated and still, very much alive multiplayer mod (SA-MP) and the plethora of other mods you can obtain for this amazing game.\nHowever, since Rockstar is so hell-bent on ruining the PC user's experience, I can't recommend the Steam release of this game. The latest patch has removed a number (18, to be specific) of key songs from the once fantastic soundtrack. There is still no 1080p support. Previous save files will no longer work and you -will- more than likely crash if you are playing this game with a dual-monitor set up. Although despite these downgrades, at least they were 'kind enough' to implement very basic Xinput support, so you can play it with a controller. Woo.\nRockstar has all the right to do this. The removal of once available songs makes sense due to copyright reasons. You can't exactly sell your product when it contains content you no longer have the license to use, let alone monetize. But when the game is deliberately patched to take away content that users have already paid for, and to hinder the experience once again, you're just hurting your PC fanbase. Which, I suppose is nothing new if you've played any PC release of Grand Theft Auto post-GTA3.\nThe best way to enjoy this game is to purchase a retail copy. It'll probably be cheaper, it'll look good on your shelf, you can mod it by default all you want, and you won't have any of your content patched out without warning. With that said. Don't bother buying any other GTA games on Steam either. If they've already removed content in one title, then expect it again in the future from other installments of the franchise when licenses inevitably expire, or can no longer be obtained.\nTL;DR: Great game but ruined by Rockstar's anti-consumer attitude.

Right off the bat you are thrust into the shoes of Coldsteel the gang banger aka Carl Johntron working for the illuminati fish capers known as CRASH who are corrupt and work to further the secret agenda of single black women everywhere. After a plane crash the preisdent calls in Chill iron to come sell drugs to kids across california so CRASH can operate in secret and save the world from the russian mobsters importing illegal lobsters to suburban housewives in the US. But the game takes a twist when Icemetal the gang banger is thrown in crime for a prison he did not commet. His brother Small Vapor turns out to be working with the russians and you must break out of prison using your streeet knowledge to board a giant airship made of lobsters and kill your brother. Afterwards you are shown a cutscene where your mother turns out to be a lobster and you kill yourself wiht your brothers corpse due to your grief. If you get the bad end then CRASH loses all their funding and the russians ivnade us and the cold war breaks out.

I had only one friend. That friend introduced me to the world of GTA. My first GTA was Vice City. That game was a true experience. It made me feel all tingly in the places I now pay women to lick and suck. Results, unfortunately, cannot be compared to the pleasure Vice City gave me. And then my only friend said:\nThat game wasn't like anything I played before. It was bigger, faster, better. It had everything my developing body and mind needed. Rockstar had always been great with writing plot and making cutscenes but they outdone themselves in San Andreas. It had it all. Gang wars, bouncing lowriders, classic rock, sunset over the desert, robbing the casino, murdering harlots to get your cash back, etc, etc.\nI mean, you started as a low gangbanger from the ghetto with no rep, no name and then BAM you're stealing a fighter jet from an air carrier just to blow Russian spies to kingdom come. Is there anything better? Of course not, you\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.\nI've been playing it with my mouth open and my underwear leaking with j1zz.

This game has flaws, yes, but it is, even today, one of the greatest achievements of game industry.\nSuch names as CJ, Sweet, Cesar, Kendl, The Truth, Toreno,\nare part of my life.

(You have to drive ALL the way back to a home you own JUST to save.)\n-The Music and Speech in the game, can often feel repetitive and just plain boring.\n-Missions have NO checkpoints, so if you die YOU have to do that mission ALL over again.\n-Modding is hard to do in this game.\nWould I recommend this game? Yes, I would infact i'd recommend it to anyone whos already played the game, or IS completely new to Rockstar Games, or the GTA franchise.

You play the role of Carl Johnson (CJ), who has been living in Liberty City. But then he got a phone call. His mom was killed by a drive-by. He rushes home to Los Santos to do honour to his mother. Back at home he has to put in work for his hood. A cycle of violence begins: drugs, gang wars, corrupt police... Welcome to Los Santos!\nWhat GTA San Andreas delivers is classical GTA gameplay with many improvments:\n- the huge world with 3 different cities, smaller towns and varying environments like desert, farmland, forests, hills\n- an amazing shooting and movment system compared to Vice City\nYou can duck, swim, dive, climb on rooftops etc. Which gives you a new feeling of freedom\n- there is even a bigger variety of vehicles: bikes, bicycles, sport cars, SUVs, pick-ups, boats, helicopters and planes!\n- customisation: tattoos, clothes, hairstyle, tuning cars\n- RPG elements: you have to eat, you can level up skills\n- many details and mini-games: robbery, basketball, video games, billard etc.\n- amazing music: especially rap music (nwa, 2pac, ice cube, eazy-e), but probably not as good as Vice City's music\nThe story of GTA SA is okay, but sometimes confusing and hard to follow. I also think that parts of it are a bit over the top. However Rockstar Games did a good job connecting the story of Vice City, San Andreas and GTA 3. They also did a good job with the characters.\nSome of the missions are a bit annoying, but overall the missions are very good. I really like the addition of stealth in some of the missions.\nRockstar added a lot of details and mini-games, which often made me wonder: \"Wtf? You can really break into a house and steal TVs? This game is amazing!\" I love such moments.\nWhat I also really liked was the hood part of the game. Getting green shirt, rag and shoes, spray a car in green, call your homies to join you, drive through other gang areas, provoke a gang war... even if the KI is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and could have been improved. Of course it's a matter of taste and actually not the whole game is about the hood life.\nConclusion:\nGTA San Andreas offers so much content, that everyone will get countless hours of fun out of it.\nIf you haven't played it yet, go get it now or you'll miss a part of video game history!", "hours": 156.6, "username": "core", "products": 132, "early_access": false}

One on hand, I had a blast, on the otherhand, I stopped playing the game due to a few fatal and poor gameplay decisions by Rockstar. The car handling and mechanics are fine, although depending on the car they can become very crappy especially in nicer cars which spin out anytime you try to turn them. The flying controls are attrocious, almost undoable with a keyboard, the worst flying controls I've ever seen in a video game. Worst, you are FORCED to do the flying school missions, and worst, the game lacks controller support so it's impossible to play the game with a controller which could help flying siginficantly. This game is a pretty poor port all around, locked at 30fps (unlocking it screws with the physics) the draw distance is incredibly low, cars spawn a block away from you. The keyboard controls suck and require rebinding to get them playable. The default mouse settings are unplayable, you need to set the \"fly with mouse\" and \"drive with mouse\" and \"invert mouse\" all to off, otherwise the mouse wont work at all.\nThe story is fine, the missions (for the most part) are fun and engaging, but the game's controls lack polish and Rockstar's instance on forcing you to do everything (flying, racing, swimming, ect) gets in the way of having fun as some of what Rockstar has in the game isn't very fun, and will make you want to rage quit.\nCan I reccomend this game? No, sadly. I've enjoyed my 40 hours in San Andreas, but I will forever look back on the game with a sour taste due to the incompitence and ignorance of Rockstar.", "hours": 66.1, "username": "Soy", "products": 325, "early_access": false}

Rockstar has recently patched the game to remove unlicensed songs and other things necessary in the game. This is completely unacceptable and pre-patch buyers should have the right to play the original game as it was intended before the changes were made. A company as big as Rockstar should have more than enough money to re-license the music anyway.]\nPlaying this game again after so many years reminded me of why I loved the GTA series in the first place; but it also made me realize what's missing from games today.\nI was hyped when GTA IV was first announced, but when I finally had the chance to play it I quickly got bored after a few hours. Sure, getting drunk was interesting; but where was the fun? Everywhere I look I see the defenders talking about graphics. Really, graphics? That's what makes a game great? Sorry, but I don't play games because they look nice. I play them because they are fun. And when you take out the fun-factor, I lose all interest. There are some pretty sharp-looking video games out there. But if their only purpose was to look good, I would rather go to an art museum. There's nothing wrong with good graphics, mind you, but I want something I can sink my claws into.\nGTA: San Andreas was, in my opinion, the last worthy installment in the GTA franchise. The new ones don't even come close. It's a perfect example of how a game can both look amazing and play great. It's also a sad reminder of what used to be a cool genre and why we all loved playing it; and why the new games just pale in comparison. The scope of San Andreas is so vast and has so much to do that completing it 100% is akin to resolving an epic life journey. Finding the Holy Grail would be easier, but you wouldn't have this much fun doing it.\nThere's so many things you can do in this game that I cannot list them all without accidentally leaving something out. I'll give it a try nonetheless. There are the usual vehicle missions that became a staple in GTA; including police car, taxi cab, ambulance and firetruck missions. In addition to these, there are truck driver, pizza boy, and home burlary missions. There's also arcade games, marathons, auto races, gang wars, drive-bys, gambling, billiards, character and car customization, girlfriends, swimming, weight-lifting, exercising, skydiving, and flying.\nAn extremely long story campaign takes the player to three sprawling districts that were fashioned after major American cities. These are seperated between vast areas of highway, desert and wilderness. All of this provides unlimited exploration for the hundreds of collectables that are hidden on the rooftops, back alleys, or under the waters of the game world. Countless drivable vehicles are also scattered throughout the streets and parking lots. There's so many things that you can pilot or drive that I haven't found them all. The world of San Andreas is so impressive that it even has its own set of urban legends. Witnesses and myth debunkers often argue about the sightings of Bigfoot and UFOs.\nWhen I first played this game many many years ago I became very fond of the bicycle. I would spend long nights just riding my bike around San Andreas and practicing stunts in the Los Santos skateboard park. If I got bored of that I would drive cross country in a stolen car listening to the golden oldies and laughing at the crude humor of the DJs. This is all I would do for hours upon hours. Eventually I would get around to completing the main storyline and the endless side missions, but I will never forget how much fun I had just cruising around in a car or on a bike. Can I say this much about any other game? No I cannot; and sadly, I doubt to be able to again. The fact that this game is still being played and replayed after all these years is a true testament to its longevity and why modern developers should take a flippin' hint on what makes a game fun.", "hours": 24.7, "username": "HitDawg47", "products": 1001, "early_access": false}

The story missions are just...so...ungodly boring or repetitive. If it's not going from one side of the country to the other, it's going from one side of the country to the other under a time limit. Needless to say at times missions do have diversity, but in nearly every single one there is a transition stage; first you get to the mission then normally you'll be sent to drive off to the objective. On the outside this is no huge issue, i mean of course you gotta go there, but in San Andreas the length to which to get to some certain places just starts getting larger and larger.\nWhat really becomes a problem, for me anyways, is how in these moments mission failure is still a possiblity-- of course it is. But in a game like this, the slightest wrong move can put you underfire or in a danger state, wether the physics bugger up and you flip a car just by simply turning and a npc inside wasnt smart enough to leave, or maybe you needed that car in specific because a character owned it or other small reasons it all leaves you to sit and go back to the start of the mission just to get to that part.\nThis, all in all, becomes a huge turn off for me because the missions themselves arn't catching my personal interest enough to warrent me wasting so much time after one failure. There are missions in this game that have you start, as ive mentioned, on one side of the map, then have you go all the way to the other. I don't mind \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing up and starting over, however, what I do mind is not being able to restart from around where I died. So in many instances, I could and have failed causing me to respawn (without all my items now) thousands of miles away from the mission to which then I will have to drive all the back for the sake of the mission itself.\nI can't even restart from the begining of the mission.\nGrand Theft Auto IV fixed this by having your phone give you a pop up asking if you wanted to restart, and would put you at the begining of the mission. But in San Andreas, it is so repetative, it is such an ungodly time waste I can't maintain any sense of interest to even continue playing the missions.\nThis is seriously a huge problem for me, and I dont want to keep pushing forward to retry missions I already have no interest in if it means I have to do nothing but waste time over and over again.\nNo Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, I am not entertained. Now if you will step aside I am going to punch in some cheat codes which will allow me to fly a dune buggy across the sky into (Not) Las Vegas in a clown suit while im being chased by hookers weilding \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 as weapons.\nBecause that's the part we (Or at least I) remember from GTA: San Andreas.", "hours": 25.0, "username": "Salmon, Lord of Sinder", "products": 628, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 807, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-07-05", "text": "Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a \"sandbox/openworld crime simulator\" as some people have dubbed the genre. In this game, you take on the role of Carl Johnson (aka CJ for short), a man who recently came back to San Andreas from Liberty City after his mother was killed in a driveby shooting. During the course of the game, CJ will have to earn money and respect by doing tasks and missions for others.\nNow that the summary's out of the way, let's get onto the game itself. The PC port isn't as good as the PS2 port in terms of features. For some reason a lot of features were left out in the PC port. Even at version 3.0, the game still lacks things the original PS2 version has. Most notably, car sheen is missing from most of the cars. Some sound effects, such as when you invite hookers into a car, are also missing (the moaning sounds mostly). The moon and night skies are also less detailed and varied. In addition, a few cheats don't exist in the PC version (such as \"drive on water\" and \"hookers pay you\".)\nAnother unfortunate issue is that you can't mod version 3.0 or 2.0 (which is technically 3.0 but without steam support.). This was done because of a controversy a few years back. Thankfully, you can downgrade the game to either 1.01 or 1.0 with a downgrader program. (google it)  Despite some saying it's illegal, Valve hasn't removed forum posts from the Steam forums which means they probably don't care. (they're heavy supporters of modding as you probably know. And removing something like that wouldn't be good for their userbase or their business.)\nThe PC version also boasts a special radio station for players to play their own music. You'll usually find it in your \"My Documents\" folder in a folder under the name \"GTA user files\" Another feature that uses this folder is the camera. Take a picture and it saves here.\nGameplaywise, the game plays pretty well and it's just as fun as the PS2 version, regardless of problems. Most if not all of CJ's dialog is there. At first, being used to playing GTA IV, I was a little confused about how the wanted level system worked.  But after a while I figured it out. The weapons are responsive and the controls are fluent. Even the hand-to-hand works well.\nThe pedestrian AI is very good for such an old game. They'll do things from conversing with eachother (though sometimes the conversations make absolutely no sense) to fighting eachother and getting into police chases. they'll even ram you until your car explodes if you hit theirs (such as the stupid Taxi drivers) That being said, it's not without flaws. The plane AI is simplistic and will often wreak for no reason. This is because the planes were only programmed to fly over the player's head in a straight line, which often results in them colliding with high objects like skyscrapers and mountains. The resulting explosion can injure or even kill CJ if he's too close too.\nGraphically, the game is dated by today's standards. This can easily be seen on character models. While the lips move, the individual fingers on the hands don't, which results in a \" classic Resident Evil esque\" cutscene where characters point with their whole hand. Some cars also lack detail, such as the ZR-350 which just looks like it was textured in MS paint. Thankfully, there are mods out there that can help the game look nicer so it's not a total loss. (most will require you to downgrade to 1.0 or 1.01 to actually use though unless they use the 2.0/3.0 installation method.) It's also not as impressive as the PS2 version graphically due to the lack of detail on some cars mentioned above and the moon thing mentioned earlier. It can go higher res than the PS2 version, so that is at least somewhat a redeeming quality.\nSound. As stated earlier, some sounds are missing. However, most if not all the typical dialog and sound effects are there. CJ will yell at pedestrians and police if they attack him or get in his way. What he says depends upon how expensive the clothing he's wearing is and how much money he has. The game features a voice acting cast including favorites like Samuel L. Jackson (Officer Frank Tenpenny.) As with most GTA games, the music doesn't play unless you're driving. The variety of stations ranges from R&B, hardcore rap, to even rock and country. The User Track player function mentioned above allows you to customize your own station. The Radio commercials and talk shows are just as enjoyable as well. With many humorus parody commercials and talk shows with the nonsense and humor that the GTA series' radio channels are known for.\nOverall: 9/10. The PC port has its flaws but it's well worth the 14.99 price tag here on steam. Buy it if you want it. Though if you want to mod, it would probably be easier on you to buy the original version of the PC version (version 1.0) off of ebay than downgrading steam's version 3.0.", "hours": 245.6, "user_id": "76561198100171221", "username": "glitchhunter09", "products": 52, "early_access": false}

It's also probably the most fully featured Grand Theft Auto game (with GTA V coming closer to this then IV did.) with player and vehicle customization being quite diverse and some light RPG elements such as gaining/losing weight, strength, running speed, stealth, and swimming abilities.\nOverall if you enjoy the Grand Theft Auto series, games like it, or just feel like you're a black man stuck in a white persons body, then you should very much enjoy visiting San Andreas, whether it's your first time or coming back again.", "hours": 85.3, "username": "Dank McMuffin", "products": 349, "early_access": false}

I love the location the characters, (Well, not ALL of them, but I'll get on that later) and the vehicles! I think this was an outstanding achievment for 2004. But, this is not my favorite GTA, that prize goes to Grand Theft Auto Five. I hear you thinking \"It's the same location!\" well it's not. It might be in Los Santos, but when I purchased the game this past monday (On the X-Box 360) I took out the map of the game in the box, and (To my displeasure) I did not see San Fierro or Las Venturas on the map. But overall, I like it better that GTA SA for four reasons, 1, More likable characters, I personally did not like CJ all to much in GTA SA, to me, he got annoying, really fast, and I have not played to much of GTA VC, so I can not make a judgement on Tommy. 2, The vehicles, they hadle much more realisticly that SA, and also show more realistic damage that SA. (Where when you get hit in the side all the doors on that side take as much damages so as they look like thay have been hit by a hand grenade) 3, The weapons, that feel more realistic (Well except for the silencers that things some some major BS) and the the add-ons make them weapons near perfection to me. and finally 4, I love the story in GTA SA, but GTA V's story steal the show for me. (Play them both and you will understand). But still for all of it's flaws, GTA SA is one of the best games I have played. If you can, get both this and GTA V, because they are both amazing.

The game is great from a story/gameplay standpoint, but many bugs have caused me to dislike my experience so far.\nFirst thing I noticed was the controller support in the options, which originally I thought was great, but failed to work properly from the start. You can do few things with a 360 pad and the setup is so asinine, it feels nothing like how it originally played on playstation. You can't move the camera for starters, unless you have a 3rd arm so you can also use the mouse, you'll have problems as well.\nSecondly, the resolutions that are put in there are all outdated, It cannot display 1080p+ unless mods are used to \"unpatch\" the game. This is what I find really silly, in the 1.1 and 1.0 version of the game, 1080p and several other resolutions that were available are now removed in the 3.X version of the game. It would be understandable since it is an old game after all, but they were there originally, why remove them?\nFinally the framerate. With the framelimiter put in place, the maximum FPS you can get is 24 which is god awful to look at. You can remove the limiter with the simple toggle of an option, BUT when you do, the physics of the game start going ape\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Cars bounce all over the place and just try swimming in water. Again, there's probably some mods out there that can fix this issue, but I shouldn't have to do that. I shouldn't have to spend hours of my time researching, downloading and installing mods into my game to make it run well.\nWith all that said, if you can stomach playing GTAsa at 720p, 24fps, and no gamepad, this game should work fine.\nFinal score\n10/10 for the story/gameplay\n4/10 for the amount of fixing that needs to be done to the game.\nMaybe a 8/10 with the inclusion of mods.", "hours": 4.9, "username": "Sword_Frog", "products": 413, "early_access": false}

The RPG elements were useful without being annoying (building up your gun/vehicle/hand-to-hand/etc skills was just fun and MUCH better than dragging your friends and family to friggin' leisure activities between every damn mission like GTA 4). The play control was better than VC (mouse looking in vehicles was a great addition), the characters are a little cliche (over the top, racial stereotypes), but all in all, it adds to the 90s flavor of the game. Also, the soundtrack can't be beat. After GTA 4, I switched over to Saints Row and haven't really looked back. I love GTA's dark sense of humor, but the play control in 4 was a massive step down from San Andreas.\nIt's not flawless, but it is a true sandbox.

I've spent many a childhood hours playing this game, and spent $15 planning to reunite my current self with my fantastic adolescent memories of San Andreas. However, this game is essentially COMPLETELY INCOMPATIBLE with Windows 8, and from what I hear it is a chore getting it to work with Windows 7 as well. From my experience, my mouse did not function at all. This left me to use the NumPad to simply look around, which quite honestly sucked. I attempted to use my Xbox 360 controller (which normally works flawlessly on every other PC game I either want or don't want to use it on), only to experience the L thumbstick alone working. Every other button on the controller did nothing whatsoever. I attempted a controls configuration in-game, which wouldn't recognize the controller. \"Xpadder\" showed some promise of using the controller with this game, but was not compatible with Windows 8 Steam San Andreas.\nBasically, yes - San Andreas is an amazing game I would reccomend to everyone. However Windows 8 (and apparently Windows 7) Just simply don't work with this now dated game. I thought Steam would properly port this old gem, but in this case I was unfortunately dissapointed. If you're rocking Windows Vista, buy it! I was able to enjoy GTA: SA on my older laptop to full extent, even without a controller.

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 842, "page_order": 4, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-04-27", "text": "What an insane classic game, GTA San Andreas takes place in 1992 San Andreas (Los Santos, Las Ventures, San Fierro, Flint Country, and Bone Country which is now known as Blain Country in GTA 5) which San Andrea sis based on Califronia, Las Ventures is based on Las Vegas which isn't even in California but whatever, and others which are pretty well known so I'm done explaining the locations. Wait, one more thing the locations are all bordered up due to a storm or some stupid excuse to not explore the entire map at the beginning of the game which I guess they knew you were going to, they eventally all are taken down and the player is allowed to explore the game as the main story unfolds. Anywany CJ (Carl Johnson) leaves Liberty City which he stayed at for six years to Los Santos and on the way to Grove Street while taking a Taxi, he is pulled over by our main villian, Officer Frank Tenpenny (Voiced by Samuel Jackson) with the help of Officer Eddie Pulaski (I don't know his actor infact I only know Samuel Jackson voiced Tenpenny and James Woods voiced that bussiness guy that is also in the main story but I'm not getting into that) and Officer Jimmy Hernandez. If you seen \"The Introduction\" which is set before teh events of GTA San Andreas and after the evnets of GTA Vice City and GTA Vice City Stories though nly GTA Vice City is refrenced with Ken Rosenberg appearing and he main villian Sonny from GTA Vice City who spolier alert, one more time. SPOILER ALERT SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH SO YOU AREN'T SPOILED ABOUT THE END OF GTA VICE CITY, anyway who was killed by Tommy Vercetti at the end of GTA Vice City and his death is mentioned in GTA San Andreas's introduction and on a billboard in GTA Liberty City Stories which a documentary is said to be made about his death. Woah, I need to start talking about the game, a little more about the story and I go on about the gameplay and some other stuff.\nAnyway Officer Tenpenny arrests CJ as he is a corrupt cop along with Officer Pulaski, but, Officer Jimmy Hernandez isn't a corrupt cop and later on it is revealed, also spoiler alert yeah I can't talk about this game without talking about the story to much, anyway, it is revealed Jimmy alerts the higher ups and Officer Frank Tenpenny and Officer Eddie Pulaski are caught which leads to alot of story and stuff and Jimmy is killed by Eddie after trying to save CJ, CJ kills Eddie right afterwards, and Frank s killed by really himself after crashing a Fire Engine off a bridge. Jesus Christ I'm done with the story I'm sorry, great story really great but I'm talking about gameplay now.\nGTA San Andreas focuses on Cars, Boats, and Helicopters like GTA 3 and GTA Vice City did before but this time GTA San Andreas includes airplanes (I know the Dodo was in GTA 3 but that was it and was a pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665to control in the first place so just calm down). Also, you could swim in this game for the first time unlike GTA 3 and GTA Vice City where it appears Claude and Tommy skipped swimming classes back in school, luckily swimming was Carl's favority class and we can even dive down which isn't as good as GTA 5 looks but hey it was Rockstar's first try and they did an okay job, pratice makes perfect which GTA 5 isn't perfect but come on it is probably the best Rockstar game out there.\nAlso the cheats in GTA San Andreas are so good, well, more funny then good I guess but still cool. I wasn't able to play mutiplayer which I am planning on playing soon, looks interesting. Anway, GTA San Andreas is a great game, classic, with all those myths and legends which I was planning on talking about but I think I am going in this too much.

San Andreas is perhaps the second best game in the GTA series, second only to GTA IV. The plot is very well told and interesting and the freedom that you have in San Andreas is flat out amazing. The graphics are a little messy and not really all that great but that is nothing compared to the rest of the package. The controls are really good but the foot controls are kind of wierd, the gunplay is a little lose and it sucks that there is no cover system but this is all very minor compared to the rest of the game. The characters in San Andreas are all really robust and alive, each with their own qualities that makes them so special and the voice acting and sounds are top of the line well the guns sound more like paintball guns so that is dumb but again just a tiny insignificant error. Overall, San Andreas is a great game that does not dissapoint at all, it is a great GTA game worth your time and it is probably the best game on the PC. Breakdown for \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\": Presentation: 9.5, Graphics: 8.5, Sounds: 9.7, Playability: 9.8, Lasting Appeal: 9.8.

As for the people saying negative about the controls, they're really not that bad once you get used to them and bind them to the correct keys. Also, there are tons of mods out there including multiplayer, but you'll have to downgrade to v1.0 to play it. I don't suggest modding singleplayer until you finish the game or don't care to finish the game, as some mods can screw up the missions like they did for me. I'd give it a 9/10 just because the controls were bunky at first, but I really recommend this game for hardcore GTA fans especially if you played it on the PS2 back in the day.

{"product_id": "12120", "page": 857, "page_order": 3, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-03-19", "text": "It is always a great surprise when one considers the original Grand Theft Auto and compares it to the three games that have appeared since 2001. Even if GTA 3 was in many ways a sleeper hit, fans of the franchise always knew the potential that the games could have when they would make their translation to 3-D. GTA: San Andreas confirms these sentiments and manages to please every adept to the series by presenting them with a game that is an evolution of the previous two in every respect.\nLet us address all technical issues right off the bat concerning this game. GTA: San Andreas does not use a brand new graphics engine and does not revolutionize its sound scheme very much; but it clearly shows that its previous 3-D instances were inferior in terms of graphics and performance. The game features a superior drawing distance that is only occasionally frustrating when flying aircraft instead of (almost always) being frustrating at high speeds. One of the trivial, yet noticeable things that one may call to your attention is the fact that car engines are now more detailed, so when you are driving around with a busted-up car you'll notice the engine is more visible instead of just being a conglomerate of grayish textures. These little differences are present in almost every aspect of the game and in the end do make a difference in the overall visual experience you may have with the game.\nThe soundtrack and sound effects in the game remain very well-executed even if the music in the various radio stations seems to be the weakest of all 3-D showings, not just because of a personal choice, but because the variety and originality of previous radio stations is not that present anymore; the DJs do not seem as lively and the commercials are not as witty anymore. This is of course a relative judgment, the overall quality of the soundtrack is still great and to balance this \"weakness\" is a plethora of well-executed sound effects and a vast repertoire of in-game speech. CJ, the main character, can now respond to the most inane accusations or compliments made by the most inane of pedestrians, his voice acting being one of the most solid performances in video gaming to date. This area is where the game surpasses its predecessors by far: every major character in the game has a definite personality, and some of them could become quasi-icons in videogame storytelling like Toreno, voiced by James Woods.\nWith these technical issues out of the way; the game's substance is rich, concentrated, and perhaps too much to handle for some of us. The depth of the game's story and side-quests are reminiscent to an action RPG, yet it still remains a pure action game. The main character now has a variety of stats to build up and see to in order to progress in the game; things like lung capacity may keep you from entering a main mission and flying or cycling skills may keep you from entering a side-quest. These small considerations never do detract from what has always been an action game at its core, and one is still able to roam the vast world and do nearly everything one wishes to regardless of plot consequences.\nThis time around, the world is huge; three full cities of roughly the size of Liberty City in the 2001 game populate the map, together with some very well defined countryside landscapes. This last last word seems crucial to grasp the overall feel of the game; every geographical area has its own \"personality\" and manages to fully immerse you in the gameworld. Evry major city has a drastically different feel, every countryside has its own pride, if you will, and it shows whenever you travel through them.\nIf this were the only saving grace of any given game, it would perhaps suffice, but GTA: San Andreas has way more to offer. In terms of its plot only, the game does an amazing job in storytelling and progression; in terms of gameplay, it makes your experience a lot easier and more pleasant by implementing a more or less foolproof targetting system that avoids the frustration of Vice City and GTA 3. The game also has dozens of vehicles that roam the seas, land and air in the gameworld and only get better as your skills get better, It is impossible not to recommend this game to any fan of the series and very hard to discourage mature enough gamers to pick this title among hundreds of possibilities within the same genre. The gaming experience they will have will be invariably gratifying.", "hours": 0.2, "user_id": "76561197968271048", "username": "Cahuatijo", "products": 883, "early_access": false}

So people know it does work on windows 8 for me without any problems. I would advise researching what others with windows 8 have to say to see if anyone else has had problems. The main downside for me is the pc controls are not very good for instance riding a bike you have to spam w to move fast which makes turning very frustrating. The first mission i failed a bunch of times because i couldn't get the hang of the bike. Would recommend using a program to bind keys to a controller to make things easier if you have that option. I love the story of this game its a little over the top but thats what makes it so great. GTA 4 went with a more realistic story which was great, but it just didn't leave the impression on me this game did.

Let's start off by saying that this game has MAJOR optimization issues, as do all old school GTA games. CJ cannot look around with the mouse. At all. Or at least I can't find a way to fix it, making me have to play the game with the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 gamepad. And even worse, the game wouldn't even start unless I ran it in compatibility mode. The cameria is jittery as all hell, and sometimes \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 itself and won't work at all (even with a gamepad). On another note, every time I take my finger off the accelerator, my car instantly screeches to a stop. The brakes are always engaged, making it impossible to drift or even turn reliably.\nBut I have to admit, the game itself is absolutely fantastic. It actually has a storyline, which already differs from other earlier GTAs. Every character is likeable and memorable, and the voice acting is great. And the RPG stats that CJ can gain or lose depending on what you do really does wonders to make this game feel more immersive and alive. The world is huge, which further adds to the realistic feel. The radio stations are great, and i love to just cruise around the desert and listen to them.\nOverall,  it was an amazing game, but a butt\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665port to the PC.

Immense customization. Hilarious satire. Well-written characters, dialog(with James Woods, Samuel L. Jackson and David Cross in roles perfect for them) and plot. Great RPG elements, and they're largely optional. Missions are well-designed, memorable and fun. Tense without being unbeatable.\nCons: Graphics are washed out, and when it's dark and in a small enclosed area(tunnel or alley), it can get straining to look at. Camera too often needs manual adjustment. Flying is still tough and it's necessary to complete the game - there is a flight school, but it's too restrictive, linear and you have to go through it before you get to fly much(and once you finally do get past the school, you start actually learning and getting a feel for the planes and helicopters).\nMy recommendation: If you enjoy the GTA series, you have got to play this.", "hours": 48.7, "user_id": "76561198019557045", "username": "A.G.B.", "products": 77, "early_access": false}

ALSO THIS IS FROM THE TOP OF MY HEAD, SO SOME INFORMATION MAY BE INCORRECT, FINALLY I TALK ABOUT AN INAPPROPRIATE THING, THIS IS YOUR WARNING*\nThis game is SUCH a great game, while the graphics do seem a bit lack-luster considering it came out in like 2004, if you compare it to Half-Life 2.  Also some of the controlls are hard to learn on the PC.  Also diving and swimming under water is a problem, i still don't know how to do it, but it is important for a mission of the game luckily i still beat it by climbing on a rock and jumping to a rock in the direction I had to go (Name of mission is Amphibious Assualt, you also need a decent lung capacity skill to actually start the mission, to train that you need to dive underwater alot and it takes a decent ammount of time, also the rock I was talking about is where you jump down but you have to look behind you down there to see it, it's like right behind you), also there are various glitches and you should save your game alot, like getting killed by a bush or standing on a car and dieing.  Ok enough of that let me go into details.  I probably took about 30 hours to complete it, 30 HOURS, for a 15$ Game that's really good, and while the game frustrates me at times it still is a great game.  I can't really talk about the story very much cause of spoilers and stuff and I skipped through A LOT of the cutscenes cause im impatient.  Here's the introduction, you are CJ (Carl Johnson) a gangster who was part of the Grove Street Families (GSF) whose older brother, Sweet, is the leader of.  CJ left San Andreas after his younger brother was killed and went to Liberty City and had a decent life with crime.  But when his mother was killed in a drive-by it's time for Carl to come home.  Some key features are gang warfare in which you take over other gangs territories (Ballas and Vagos) to become the biggest gang and to generate more money which will be generated at the Johnson House.  Also there is a HUGE ammount of weapons.  The weapons include:  pistol, sub-machine gun (two variants), smg, ak47, m4, rocket launcher, shotgun, sawn-off shotgun, combat shotgun, heat-seeking missile rocket launcher, flamethrower, MINIGUN, desert eagle, silenced pistol, knife, katana, chainsaw, baseball bat, shovel, flowers (can also be used as a gift for girlfriends,  a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665(also can be used as a gift) for girlfriends), maybe a vibrator (not exactly sure about this one), spray paint, and a fire extinguisher (can also be used to put out fires).

ALSO THIS IS FROM THE TOP OF MY HEAD, SO SOME INFORMATION MAY BE INCORRECT, FINALLY I TALK ABOUT AN INAPPROPRIATE THING, THIS IS YOUR WARNING*\nThis game is SUCH a great game, while the graphics do seem a bit lack-luster considering it came out in like 2004, if you compare it to Half-Life 2.  Also some of the controlls are hard to learn on the PC.  Also diving and swimming under water is a problem, i still don't know how to do it, but it is important for a mission of the game luckily i still beat it by climbing on a rock and jumping to a rock in the direction I had to go (Name of mission is Amphibious Assualt, you also need a decent lung capacity skill to actually start the mission, to train that you need to dive underwater alot and it takes a decent ammount of time, also the rock I was talking about is where you jump down but you have to look behind you down there to see it, it's like right behind you), also there are various glitches and you should save your game alot, like getting killed by a bush or standing on a car and dieing.  Ok enough of that let me go into details.  I probably took about 30 hours to complete it, 30 HOURS, for a 15$ Game that's really good, and while the game frustrates me at times it still is a great game.  I can't really talk about the story very much cause of spoilers and stuff and I skipped through A LOT of the cutscenes cause im impatient.  Here's the introduction, you are CJ (Carl Johnson) a gangster who was part of the Grove Street Families (GSF) whose older brother, Sweet, is the leader of.  CJ left San Andreas after his younger brother was killed and went to Liberty City and had a decent life with crime.  But when his mother was killed in a drive-by it's time for Carl to come home.  Some key features are gang warfare in which you take over other gangs territories (Ballas and Vagos) to become the biggest gang and to generate more money which will be generated at the Johnson House.  Also there is a HUGE ammount of weapons.  The weapons include:  pistol, sub-machine gun (two variants), smg, ak47, m4, rocket launcher, shotgun, sawn-off shotgun, combat shotgun, heat-seeking missile rocket launcher, flamethrower, MINIGUN, desert eagle, silenced pistol, knife, katana, chainsaw, baseball bat, shovel, flowers (can also be used as a gift for girlfriends,  a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665(also can be used as a gift) for girlfriends), maybe a vibrator (not exactly sure about this one), spray paint, and a fire extinguisher (can also be used to put out fires).  Im not sure if these are all the weapons but this is most of them.  YOU CAN ALSO GET A JETPACK YEAH!!! There's also a skill system.

I'm really impressed with the effort that has been put into the game details even having different maneuverability for each type of car and the planes, the choppers, the boats - everything! There's also a lot to do and a fairly huge area to explore which for me is just about right as opposed to later GTAs with bigger game worlds (its dragging sometimes). I like how each area has a different aura to it making you feel like you're playing a different game and story for each. The only cons I have about this game is that sometimes I get crashes and there is an issue with the game resolution being unable to match max monitor setting. Anyways, I highly recommend this game! If you're a serious gamer, make sure you don't pass this one.

And although San Andreas is supposedly the most fully-featured release to date, it is deficient in almost all areas.\nGraphics- The game is graphically inferior, for the time it was released on the PC. Low quality textures, models and low view distance make this game a mediocre entry at best.\nSound- The farcical dialogue can sometimes be funny, and the radios feature good songs. But all the stereotypical voice acting is grating and obnoxious, and the gun sounds and other sound effects are mediocre at best.\nGameplay- Clearly, no effort was made to port this game to PC, although whether or not it should have been remains up for debate. At it's core its a TPS with driving elements but the aiming system is clumsy, the driving controls are downright drunken, and the consolized save system ( you can only save in \"your house\") is incredibly outdated, even for 2005 standards. In addition, the story and characters are incredibly annoying. Annoying isn't a strong enough word. I'm all for crime films and games IF they have compelling characters. There is nothing compelling about anyone you meet in this game. Nearly everyone who is your ally is despicable, and have no redeeming qualities. Maybe it's just me, but I find no reason to do missions involving tagging and lowriders, especially for people who give me no reason to like them. I understand this game is gang themed, but despite its sandbox gameplay, the missions themselves are quite linear and offer nearly no reason to complete them.\nA good deal of my criticisms are subjective, but I believe this game is not only better suited on console, but better suited for a specific type of gamer that has little in common with me. I'm all for morally dark or straight up evil characters, but they have to be interesting, and the opportunity for role-playing has to be there. There's nothing interesting about ordinary criminals and gang scum.\nWhether you agree or not, This game is off my hard drive for a long time.", "hours": 3.8, "username": "Brendissimo", "products": 329, "early_access": false}

The way you make contact with this life, it's one of a kind. It's not all about thugs, drugs, thefting and many others like these.

They brushed every single object, excluding the sky-scrapers. You can even enter in some gigantic boats of army.\nI bought this game for almost 3 euros. I did because it was the game I was obsessed to play when I was younger, like 4 years ago. I even gifted few to my friends. This game has been a massive impact upon Action Games; a tremendous jump from GTA Vice City; no one would have expected such a real game.\nNow some particular issues:\n- huge map; so well detalied;\n- plenty of characters you will make contact with;\n- variety of vehicles(tanks, choppers, boats, cars, bicycles)\n- many missions, all achievable;\n- sound track, voice lines between characters;\n- weather types, all again neat;\n- good radio stations, well suited to that period;\n- you can find more by playing it.\n- nothin' ;\n- just to fill this space- this game has lost its delight because many gamers now play only by their attention given to graphics details. I know it's an old game. Still, you don't know it untill you don't play it.\nAll in all, shall you ask yourself if you should buy this game? No, just do it right away.

The cities you get to explore are Los Santos which is based on Los Angeles and does a really good job with detailing the area and putting the ghetto into it and makes you feel like you actually live in the hood. You have the countryside between Los Santos and San Fierro and feels like you live in California with its lush forests. San Fierro which is based on San Francisco also does a good job and feels like a believable Bay Area city, The dessert between San Fierro and Las Venturas feels like a realistic mojave desert and is perfect(especially if you're a fallout fan) to explore. Las Venturas is based on Las Vegas and does an amazing job with its neon lights and casinos to make it a realstic metropolis. The game mechanics in this game are very heavliy improved from Vice City because you can now see your target's health and driving feels more loose in SA. You have gang wars which are pretty fun and lets you recruit your own gang members and take over other hoods by playing a little survival mini game. The soundtrack is amazing in this game and is very believable and feels you are actually living in the 90's and is my second favorite soundtrack after Vice City. Oh and using the jetpack is so much fun. Now the flaws on this game is that even though GTA SA is challenging it is also has very tedious missions, especially missions that involve using an airplane. Those missions are terrible, not fun at all and have the worst controls that I have ever seen in a video game. The story is flawed in many ways too and there is some character flaws here and there but the story isn't bad at all and it's very deep. The characters are also memorable too and good voice acting from Samuel L. mutha\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in Jackson. Yes he plays the main antagonist which also gives this game another +. Like I said earlier, this game is challenging and tedious at times but it's very rewarding and that's what makes a good video game. This I would say would be my favorite GTA game after Vice City and this game was worth playing through till the end and is a masterpiece.", "hours": 43.6, "username": "< blank >", "products": 551, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

They range from ambitious underdog gangster to oblivious hippie to blind Asian casino owner to nerdy RC enthusiast to corrupt policeman villain voiced by Samuel L Jackson. The story branches off into unexpected turns, and does it with flair. Even the final mission proved to be more thought-provoking than I thought, for the villain who was once the protagonist's best friend ends up destroying himself by living it up at the top and betraying those who trust him. Isn't this what the protagonist does as well? Moreover, while many missions prove to be a bit frustrating, they still provide a good challenge, and you can still strategize a bit.

The steam version also features a later version in which Rockstar thought it would be a great idea to remove support for most 16:9 widescreen resolutions, so I had to download a downgrader patch and do it manually to get support for 1920x1080.\nIf you're swimming and diving in the water without frame limiter on, even if you have it set to 60, you'll notice that you'll be swimming very slowly. This is a great example of a terrible port, in which they set the rate of swimming speed to the standard 24fps cap, so make sure to cap it when in the water.\nThe gameplay is arguably the best one so far, it features the largest map so far, a lot of different vehicles and weapons. There's just so much different things you can do here that you couldn't do before, therefor this is definitely the best GTA for sandbox players.\nHowever, the story isn't that interesting and GTA still lacks common sense mechanics.\nimdbScore: 7.0/10\nI only rate .5 or .0, 55/100 and 50/100 works, 57/100 or 51/100 I dont use...", "hours": 33.5, "username": "\u00b0treetoon", "products": 226, "early_access": false}

It took everything that made GTA III and Vice City great games and added in a ton of amazing new features and content. The result is what is widely considered to be the best game in the series.\nPros\n+ Great story with memorable characters. CJ is one of the best GTA protagonists, Big Smoke is legendary, and the main villain is also voiced by Samuel Jackson.\n+ A gigantic map featuring 3 cities, a farmland, a desert, a mountain, and other exciting areas to explore.\n+ Radio stations featuring many real-world songs as well as some humorous in-game talk shows/commercials. Plus you can also make your own custom station with your own music.\n+ Lots of weapons/items to use, including a\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665and even a jetpack.\n+ Lots of fun vehicles to ride including bikes, planes, jets, go-karts, and tons more.\n+ Adding to the above point, you can customize cars with features like more acceleration and paint jobs.\n+ Many safehouses for you to buy, so you can save your game in most places and store lots of vehicles.\n+ Tons of ways to customize CJ, ranging from haircuits and clothing to bodybuilding and stats like sex appeal.\n+ Countless amounts of side activities including: car/bike/boat racing, horse betting, gang territories, gambling, burglaries, dating, dancing, gym activities, deliveries, and tons more.\n+ Very easy to mod and the modding community for this game is huge.\n+ Usually very cheap when on sale.\nCons\n- The Steam version had to remove a few songs due to licensing issues.\n- The intro movie doesn't show (just a black screen) but still plays the sound for some reason.\nThe cons are just small nitpicks that don't deter from the overall experience.

After playing GTA4 and becoming more aware of the constant \"do this\" messages on the screen, I do think that the gameplay element is slightly overrated.  However, for me, this is not where the brilliance of GTA lies.  The fun of GTA is vicariously living the adventure of the story's character.

Thanks EB Games!\nGTA: San Andreas was a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing game changer that had literally anything you could ever think of in the game. I mean, c'mon: Area 69, Jetpacks, MULTIPLAYER, dildoes in the showers of the police department showers. It was the blueprint of which Saint's Row the Third said, \"Let's try THAT!\" before eventually saying, \"\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 it\" to logic and, \"Hello\" to mindless fun.\nThe difference between those two though, is that San Andreas had a compelling and believeable story. Compared to Saints Row the Third, I mean. But I guess even Shaq Fu has a believeable story compared to Saints Row 3.\nAll the same though, I have nothing but fond memories of this masterpiece and I've been replaying it to get me even more hyped up for the series' return to the title city in GTA:V.\nThat being said, I've been replaying it on PS2, because the computer version of San Andreas is the worst \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing insult to this series that I've ever seen. It just..... really needs to be played with a controller in hand. I've never gotten hand cramps quite like the ones I've gotten playing this ported piece of garbage.\nSo dust of your PS2s that I already know you have, dust of your copy of GTA: San Andreas that I also know you have because you're not lame as hell, and play it there.\nUm, that wasn't a suggestion.", "hours": 3.1, "username": "\u0158aees \u2714Activated", "products": 89, "early_access": false}

It has native Xbox controller support and higher-fidelity graphics on par with the 2014 re-release, but also less resolution options, less music tracks (check\nfor a list of what was removed) and breaks some old saves. You can find information on unofficial fixes\n. Gamers' Steam reviews, as always when things change in any way, are 'taking Rockstar to task' over this. Not that they don't have a point, but still.\nAnyway.\nSan Andreas is the fifth game in the Grand Theft Auto series, released in 2004. You've probably heard of the series if you're browsing this website, but if you haven't it's basically an open-world crime simulator that also lets you simulate low-rent gangster movies. This particular release has somewhat clunky controls and the graphics were bad even when it came out, if still charming in their own way.\nBut I ultimately think San Andreas is the best game in the series, and not just because it has 'the most to do'. Grand Theft Auto V is technically higher on the 'fun scale' with superior gameplay, superior graphics and more optional side activities; it's certainly fun to play. The titles\nSA are really more valuable as gaming history, since they were even more janky & limited, and even more cliched, than SA. And while SA is a functional game that absolutely has its charm - I'm partial to its pastiche of the 90s myself - that's not the main reason I'm saying it's the best.\nNo, my reasoning has to do with the story and the tone. GTA V's story is interesting enough in a doofy crime capers way, but the tone of that game is ultimately aggressively nihilistic and uncaring about almost anything within itself. Not to say these elements aren't present in San Andreas, but they're not nearly as strong or disheartening here.\nGTA IV is better in this regard, I'd say, but it's not off the hook. It tried to be more serious, and while it made strides in that direction, the weight of its open-world gameplay ambitions ultimately hamstrung its story. I didn't mind its more muted tone, 'realistic' driving and lack of cheat codes (for the base game anyway), but there's no getting around the fact that having a main character who bemoans the atrocities of the Balkan Wars he survived but is perfectly able to wantonly run over pedestrians is...odd. The final act of the story resembling a cheap mafia film didn't exactly help either.\nSan Andreas, by contrast, doesn't just exist primarily to \"poke fun\" at American society so much as it tries to tell a story about a West Coast gangbanger with a heart of gold, trying to do right for his lower-class neighborhood, family and gang within the moral construct (and repressive society) he was born and raised in. It's ultimately more genuine than V because it cares enough about its characters not to utterly derail itself every time the game displays pathos for them. It's also not self-important enough to pretend that it wouldn't be a bad thing if it\ndo that. Perhaps most importantly, it's self-aware enough not to be stony-faced at every turn it takes.\nThe characters themselves might not be particularly more savory, and certainly there's stereotypical/exaggerated behavior going on, but at least SA doesn't furiously punch in every direction or practically flash \"LAUGH AT THESE SAD LOSERS WHO ARE ALSO YOU, LOSER\" on the screen every time you see them interact with each other.\nNot that this game is a literary masterpiece by any means, but it's the closest the series has come to that level. And while GTA IV was also trying to operate on the same level, albeit with its own direction and its own flaws, V was just a step back in this regard. There's always been puerile satire of society and voyeuristic displays of women in the 3D GTA games, including in San Andreas, and it's always gotten disheartening if you played for long enough, but SA...isn't quite as bad in this regard, I feel. There's enough determination and hope in the story for the game not to crash and burn at least, although it's long enough that it does drag in parts.\nI still resent whenever the game shoves boobs, 'sexy wimmins' and other series-standard female objectification in my face without comment, of course. Nothing is perfect. I also think it's still a bit weird that CJ comes across as a pretty decent dude, perhaps the most 'good' in the series, trying to do what he can and make the best of a pretty bad situation, and yet the game still gives you the option to go on classic GTA rampages.\nMaybe there's something to be said for the tension between open-world game structure and any semblance of a plot. Whatever the case may be, San Andreas doesn't gel perfectly. GTA IV suffered from this problem too, and both games - hell, pretty much the entire series - also suffer from a number of frustrating missions. Following a damn train was never so difficult.\nThe game world is obviously not as realistic as V's due to the technological constraints of 2004, which means that the game isn't trying to sell itself as a perfect graphical model of Real Life\u2122 that's fatally flawed by crazy AI behavior. The game looks enough\nthat it's not\nas jarring when something insane happens on the street next to you. (San Andreas' modding support is at least better than V's, and I say this because I couldn't find anywhere else in the review to stick it.)\nHonestly, I don't know if I'd call this one of the best games ever made, but I think it's still a classic in its genre.

After years away from his old mates, he goes back to Los Santos to attent to his mother's, only to find himself back into the life he desperately wanted to get away from.\nUnlike Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City, the gameplay hasn't aged at all. Anyone who played IV or V will know what to expect, as it is the basis for every new GTA title. You can climb anything you want, look anywhere you want without the camera bothering you, interact with pedestrians, climb a mountain with a bike and much, much more. It's not about what you\ndo, it's about what you\ndo.\nAs this is the first 3D open-world game ever to have multiple cities, it leaves a lot to be expected. Fortunately, it does not disappoint. The cities (Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas) are incredibly huge and detailed, fiddled with minigames, side-activities and crazy characters to spice up the formula. All accompanied by a large countryside for you to\nexplore.\nWhen you attach all that with an awesome licensed soundtrack that takes cues from dozens of different genres with the voice of Samuel L. Jackson himself, you realize that this is a game like no other. The world that Rockstar created using this engine feels like a living charicature of 90's USA, even if it's held back by the game's primitive visuals.

I love when they say\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665alot, it reminds me of my father, when I was a kid.
