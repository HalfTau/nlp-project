I recommend the original Grand Theft Auto because I fear many havent played it, or even more worryingly may believe GTA III to be the first actual installment. GTA was one of the first games I played on PC and while it lacks the 3D graphics of todays era it is still tons of fun. The modern iterations of the GTA franchise focus too heavily on story and never on an arcade pickupandplay style game. GTA was just that. Its fun, pure and simple.
