The base GTA game gives you 2030 hours experience . I do enjoy the old school matchup on LAN but the old archaic controls are super old now.New players may have a hard time playing this classic including those older Resident Evil games just due to control alone . It still has not been patched to be directional go where you point , but instead uses a first person control system forward , turn left or right but in a top down view.It is atrocious to replay it like this ! However , it has an amazingly fun sense of humor not found outside of the GTA franchise . If you do not mind the outdate unintuitive controls , you might have a good time going through the story.However , I have to post my rant on why I would not recommend anyone to buy thisI love R and all the Grand Theft Auto family of games , but lets be real here . R banned all modding recently in their nuclear management decision to curb cheating in their more modern GTA franchise starting with OpenIV . With OpenIV , modders and the Grand Theft Auto Community , you have a game that can be played for years in SP mode for GTA4 and 5.When Take Two publisher decides to monetize on that goodwill withOUT creating any additional content or assets for the SP user base , trying to force those user online and destory it at the same time , I can not recommend ANYONE to put their hard earn money into buying ANY Take Two Published games.It is exactly like a politician taking away your RIGHTS RIGHTS mean something that you have with no questions asked since modding and OpenIV does not HARM the purchaser , publisher or online experience whatsoever . The mods ONLY work in single player . It is absolutely one of the main reason gamers even buy GTA in the first place.Again for the reading impared , OpenIV CAN NOT and does NOT allow any of its modded contented to be used online or interact with that post apocalyptic Detroit where no Robocop can be found they call GTAO.Before anyone disputes this , lookup what OpenIV actually DOES , and note there are CONSUMER FAIR USE LAWS in most IP protected countries that allows private modding for personal use.So NO , I do not recommend anyone to buy ANY Take Two published games including GTA series from R until they change their shill corporate policy towards the community that built them in the first place.If I can I would REFUND all my Take Two published games and delete it off my HD right away .
