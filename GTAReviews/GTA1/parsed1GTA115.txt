The controls on this game suck but hey, its FREE.  I tried this game with a controller thinking maybe itd be better, only it got worse. Anyway, my recommendation for this game is to avoid it unless youre bored, have nostalgia goggles to go with it, or unless youve found some way to make the controls worth it, in which case, TELL ME.
