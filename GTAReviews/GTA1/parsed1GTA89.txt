The classic, the one, the only, GTA. This is free to play off the Rockstar Classics site  so no doubt get it for free if possible, but this really started open world gaming. You need a set million X points to progress  get it with missions easiest way or by doing whatever you want  police are agressive, top down view is fast and frentic, and it is damn hard in later levels! Wonderful stuff, then and mostly now.
