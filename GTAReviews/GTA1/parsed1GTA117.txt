One awesome little game that started it all . It only has a top down view that takes a few mins to get adjusted to , but once you get the controls , it is a pretty cool little game . It still has all of the crazy and wackiness as the new ones , and you also have freedom to make money however you want in the city . The only thing is it has the old school like difficulty , and that might turn others off , but I still think this is an awesome game . You can also play it on anything , even a netbook .
