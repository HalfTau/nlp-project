GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAND THEFT AUTOAnyway. Both this game and GTA2 were taken off the Steam store, likely due to licensing shenanigans on Rockstars part. This also means that you cannot create new reviews of either game. Lucky for me, I posted a joke review years ago, consisting of that oneliner at the top.The game itself is an old topdown arcadestyle openworld game where you must complete missions and wreak havoc to gain points. Each city has two levels containing missions, and you can only save at the end of each level. Once you get enough points you can advance to the next level. Liberty City, Vice City and Los Santos all make their debut in this game. The controls can be difficult, and when youre driving, the car and camera often move too fast for you to react to obstacles.This isnt exactly a stellar game, but its interesting to witness the birth of GTA, even though it wouldnt assume the form we know it as now until GTA III was released. The main menu is deliciously 90s, at least. If you consider yourself a game history buff or a connoisseur of old games, try this one out if you can find it.
