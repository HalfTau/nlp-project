You want realism ? Here you can die from 1 single shot ! The game that started it all . Where you can burp and fart your way around Liberty City , Vice City and San Andreas while hoping you dont crash against a building or another vehicle because the camera doesnt zoom out far enough.Follow the not so intuitive arrow though the city to find and do the missions your bosses demands and rise your point counter in order to progress to the next city.Blow up kill pedestrians and maybe ... JUST MAYBE ... You will find those Hare Krishnas and achieve the all mighty GOURANGA !
