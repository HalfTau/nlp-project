A classic, but also a very good game. Loads of fun running around the cities causing destruction. The missions are nice and the dialogue is very funny. Dont expect GTA V levels of immersion, this is a topdown arcade game with guns and cars. Look forto find a version with the expansion packs and solid framerate on Windows 10.
