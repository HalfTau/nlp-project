Grand Theft AutoSome games are better left forgotten...Remember when GTA II first came out on playstation in the 90s? I do. I recall being sick, so I couldnt attend school. I sat in the living room playing Grand Theft Auto II  and boy was it glorious!This game is the predecessor, GTA.I decided that 20 years later I should give it a try, with all those fond memories of GTA II. Let me tell you, this game is NOT GREAT and for that matter, neither is GTA II  not anymore  they used to be.Through my nostalgia, I still thought they were. Good childhood memories, which I guess is always important. Disgusting graphics, birds eye view obstructs vision of anywhere you drive or run. No story, no clear objectives, difficult to complete missions due to the flaws of the game. Rampages and killing is not fun, nothing is fun in this game!GTA is simply too old to be enjoyable. Its a product of its time  a gem when released. Sadly, being a 2D game means it has no place in modern gaming and its replay value is essentially zero.Valve no longer sells it anyway, so this review is just for the lols.2/10
