Itd be a lie to say GTA1 aged well, but the first entry of the series is still a fun arcade game about carjacking and other criminal activities, with the kind of satiric humour that stood the test of time.Compared to the massive open world lumbering giant the franchise grew into, Grand Theft Auto 1 is a simple topdown arcade action game, inspired by the highway car chase helicopter news casts.The simplicity is reflected in the core mechanics instead of playing through a story which this game lacks pretty much entirely, all six levels require a target score to pass. While almost every action gives points, the intended way to progress is to raise the score multiplier, usually by completing missions. These missions are barely anything more than a random set of objectives, tied together with some immature and politically incorrect, yet not too controversial flavour text with some black humour and social satire.The game is easy in many regards enemies aim terribly, the police are quite ineffective, and all tasks can be described in a few words but many small annoyances can ruin gameplay. For example, there are no mission retries, and when even the player dies in one hit, it is easy to fail a task on the first try.The best way to approach GTA1 is to think it as a memorisation game learn the city layouts, weapon locations, and the mission objectives, and itll go smoothly. Just dont forget that there is no save, so each stage has to be completed in one sitting.The game engine is ancient and difficult to run on any modern system. On top of that, it can cause nausea with the jerky camera movement and wonky frame rates. And when it works, the player can enjoy the interesting physics that turn every vehicle into a bouncy bumper car.Still, if you can live with these limitations, GTA1 can still hold itself on its own as a good arcade game that can warrant a replay from time to time.
