GTA1 is a PC classic by now . The first two GTA games are both in a 2D topdown style . The gameplay resembles what youd expect to find in any Grand Theft Auto game steal cars , run down pedestrians , and evade the police . The difference is that this game offers very little else . Theres a very loose mission structure , but really very little reason to care about them . This game truly is a sandbox , which can be fun to play around in , but the lack of direction prevents it from holding your attention for too long.The graphics are decent for the time . The sound can get obnoxious quickly , and theres no music . The controls arent very good , and I found it imposible to play with a controller.At the very least , the price is right . You cant buy it individually on Steam , but its free on Rockstars website .
