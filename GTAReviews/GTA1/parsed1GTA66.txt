If you really want to blast to the past as far as GTA goes, I would recommend playing GTA2, as it has many improvements over the original GTA. This is still a great game, though I was disappointed that the Steam release did not include GTA London or any of the other expansion packs. Those content sets really brought in some great humor to the series, which was later refined in GTA2.
