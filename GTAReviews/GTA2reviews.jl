The only possible way I know to get this game on Steam is to buy the Grand Theft Auto Collection key from the green man gaming website, as of last year October, they still sell the old version of GTA collection with GTA1 and GTA2 (On a side note, the key also includes Vice City without any songs cut, probably SA as well. But no promises on you getting these bonuses though, they might have sold out the old keys by now).\nBut you really shouldn't spend $39.99 on a random-CD-KEY-selling website just for this game alone, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT USED TO BE FREE (and also the possibility of the old keys sold out already). What you should do instead is tell R* re-provide the free version again, or at least give some sort of explanations (lame excuses) on why they removed it in the first place.", "hours": 0.1, "username": "TheJackyking", "products": 210, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

With OpenIV, modders and the Grand Theft Auto Community, you have a game that can be played for years in SP mode for GTA4 and 5.\nWhen Take Two (publisher) decides to monetize on that goodwill withOUT creating any additional content or assets for the SP user base, trying to force those user online and destory it at the same time, I cannot recommend ANYONE to put their hard earn money into buying ANY Take Two Published games.\nIt is exactly like a politician taking away your RIGHTS - RIGHTS mean something that you have with no questions asked - since modding and OpenIV does not HARM the purchaser, publisher or online experience whatsoever. The mods ONLY work in single player. It is absolutely one of the main reason gamers even buy GTA in the first place.\nAgain for the reading impared, OpenIV CANNOT and does NOT allow any of its modded contented to be used online or interact with that post apocalyptic Detroit where no Robocop can be found they call GTAO.\nBefore anyone disputes this, lookup what OpenIV actually DOES, and note there are CONSUMER FAIR USE LAWS in most IP protected countries that allows private modding for personal use.\nSo NO, I do not recommend anyone to buy ANY Take Two published games including GTA series from R* until they change their shill corporate policy towards the community that built them in the first place.\nIf I can I would REFUND all my Take Two published games and delete it off my HD right away.", "hours": 0.2, "user_id": "76561198019292264", "username": "Valken", "products": 130, "found_funny": 5, "early_access": false}

See the end of this review for links that may or may not work, and make sure to check for viruses, for example on VirusTotal!\nBut okay, what is Grand Theft Auto 2?\nGrand Theft Auto 2, or GTA2 for short, is a top-down action game where you can steal vehicles, shoot at people and fulfill missions for various gangs in the city which unlock by having respect for them (it is recommended to do all missions for one faction at once since you should have the respect by the time you complete their missions). You gain respect by fulfilling missions and shooting enemy gangs. There are three gangs in each district (level), each with distinctive personality. As an example, there is an over-the-top asian gang, the mafia-like Zaibatsu, the Hippie gang \"Loonies\", and so on.\nThe game is entirely controlled by the keyboard. It feels fluid, the graphics which at the time were too demanding for my PC (in 1998 the game would run but the graphic effects would leave white boxes because I had no 3D card) nowadays are good 2D from above. There is one known crash which was never fixed but can be easily avoided: Entering a vehicle while shooting the flamethrower crashes the game - no other gun crashes it.\nThe game can be saved at anytime outside missions in a central spot, of which there is one on each map (this costs 50,000 USD ingame, so you want to keep your multiplier from missions and reload if you die or get caught by the cops - this also means you need to do the first two or three missions in one run to get the score). There are additional collectibles - 50 GTA plates and 20 Kill Frenzies. Warning! If you play the game in German, they might be censored, I am not sure about that anymore (I only remember they were in the German version, but I don't know if all were there).\nI had great fun just bringing vehicles to the crane to see what goodies each one gives, then running rampage against the cops or against the civilians until I face my inevitable death or in very rare occasions even survive. At one time I even completed the first level with 100 percent. And although the game has only three levels, they can take a lot of time, although a speedrun probably could do them in maybe an hour each (of course only the missions then).\nAnd I did not even talk about the hidden things you can discover such as combos, \"Elvis has left the building\", the great soundtrack, the fun you can have with grenades and rocket launchers, the ability to even drive a TANK, etc.\nSo is the game worth it? Of course! I have almost 7 hours in the Steam version as I write this, and that is years after I really played it. If you never played this game, give it a try, you will not be disappointed! The download link can be found above, as sadly neither the Rockstar Classics nor the Steam version are available anymore.\nRecommended: Yes!\nDownload for the non-Steam version (freeware):\n(EDIT: But run it in a sandbox, see below!)\nhttp ://\nchip. de/ downloads/Grand-Theft-Auto-GTA-2_13015291.html\nClick on the blue button that says \"Download\", then again, then again and the download of a ZIP file will start.\nEDIT: Because VirusTotal tests the exe with a 22 of 56 detection rate (vs. 0 of 56 for the Steam version), the link has been made unworkable.

For starters, it is the only game that isn\u2019t tied to a real-world city or time frame: Anywhere City is a featureless metropolis, and the supposedly 2013 date doesn\u2019t fit the 1950s car designs.\nJust like in GTA1, the goal of the game is to earn enough money to advance to the next level, usually accomplished by accepting jobs from three rivalling gangs to raise the score multiplier. These jobs also earn respect, a new mechanic that forces the player into some love/hate micromanagement to access high-tier missions at the cost of making entire neighbourhoods hostile.\nThe missions themselves are quite varied in flavour text but not in objectives: you either chase down a target or try to get a specific vehicle to a specific spot. There is some emphasis on platforming, especially in the last district, but these sections are probably the worst in the entire game.\nGameplay also had some tweaks, and the result is a double-edged sword. Everything is easier now with the introduction of a player health bar and by increasing the sturdiness of every vehicle. And everything also feels more dragged out with a camera that essentially prevents going fast or missions where you are expected to take on entire armies on your own. The save feature and the ability to retry failed missions helps a lot, but in the end, GTA2 just feels more tiresome (yet more thought-out) than its predecessor did.", "hours": 7.8, "username": "talgaby", "products": 488, "found_funny": 7, "early_access": false}
