A solid sequel in a time of games where they were not always so. More varied weapons, better graphics in a nearfuture style. Multiplayer was good too if you could get TCP/IP mode to work including deathmatch and other modes, even including cops which is great fun!, and the missions were much more impressive then the originals. Well worth a play for free.
