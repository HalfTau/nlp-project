This is the best game ever made! Legendary storyline, evolutionary graphics, amazing soundtrack!What a masterpiece! Its just a shame that you cant buy this game though.But in all seriousness, the game is still rather fun. Certainly not the best GTA or even openworld games out there, but you will find the weird setting of GTA2 to be rather fascinating and unique, and the humor in this game is.... interesting to say at least. Its definitely worth giving some attention to, especially when it was available from R website for free.Yes, this game used to be free, and R removed the link for some reason. The only possible way I know to get this game on Steam is to buy the Grand Theft Auto Collection key from the green man gaming website, as of last year October, they still sell the old version of GTA collection with GTA1 and GTA2 On a side note, the key also includes Vice City without any songs cut, probably SA as well. But no promises on you getting these bonuses though, they might have sold out the old keys by now.But you really shouldnt spend 39.99 on a randomCDKEYselling website just for this game alone, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT USED TO BE FREE and also the possibility of the old keys sold out already. What you should do instead is tell R reprovide the free version again, or at least give some sort of explanations lame excuses on why they removed it in the first place.
