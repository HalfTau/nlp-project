A complete improvement from its predecesor.You must burp and fart your way through Anywhere City doing missions for 3 gangs per district. But every time you do this another gang will be angry at you and attack you on sight until you balance the situation.Once you get enough money you can progress to the next district... OR you can do all the missions, fight the leaders of the 3 gangs and see how everything goes toat the end before you leave.Look out for Elvis.
