Might be a classic and it may have been great for the time it came out but my god did this game not age well. The controls are awful, its tank controls but on a keyboard so you cant make precise turns which will have you going every which way when you try to turn ESPECIALLY when driving. Speaking of the driving in this is horrible, you cant build up any speed because you slam into every other car on the road since the camera is zoomed in so close you arent given nearly enough time to dodge. The camera does try to zoom out when you speed up but the second you lose speed it snaps back in and if you suffer from motion sickness easily avoid this game like the plague. The missions are also just bad, i tried 5 missions for every faction and failed each one for seemingly random reasons. In one mission i had to drive a car in a bank heist fine and dandy except i had to drive to the other side of the city to even begin the heist and with how bad the driving and camera is my car was already dead when i got there. Another mission had me going to kill some random gang members, before i can even get there cops show up and i get punched ONCE and im busted. I didnt play this when it came out so i dont have nostalgia blinders on when i play it now, the game mightve been great in its time but it has aged like sour cream.
