GTA2 was the first GTA game I played and I still like it even today because it is the most detailed 2D GTA game around.There are 3 large maps to do all your missions and all your freeroam on.It feels like an arcade game to play and it does have multiplayer but when Ive played Ive never seen anybody on it because its designed for local LAN play.
