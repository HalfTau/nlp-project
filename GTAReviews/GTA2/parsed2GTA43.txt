Even though GTA2 is sort of the black sheep of the franchise, it is easy to fall in love with its easier overhead driver/shooter mechanics and zanier atmosphere that manages to hide the issue of repetitive missions and tiresome platforming sections.Grand Theft Auto 2, while it retains many gameplay elements of GTA1, is still the odd one out when it comes to the franchise. For starters, it is the only game that isnt tied to a realworld city or time frame Anywhere City is a featureless metropolis, and the supposedly 2013 date doesnt fit the 1950s car designs.Just like in GTA1, the goal of the game is to earn enough money to advance to the next level, usually accomplished by accepting jobs from three rivalling gangs to raise the score multiplier. These jobs also earn respect, a new mechanic that forces the player into some love/hate micromanagement to access hightier missions at the cost of making entire neighbourhoods hostile.The missions themselves are quite varied in flavour text but not in objectives you either chase down a target or try to get a specific vehicle to a specific spot. There is some emphasis on platforming, especially in the last district, but these sections are probably the worst in the entire game.Gameplay also had some tweaks, and the result is a doubleedged sword. Everything is easier now with the introduction of a player health bar and by increasing the sturdiness of every vehicle. And everything also feels more dragged out with a camera that essentially prevents going fast or missions where you are expected to take on entire armies on your own. The save feature and the ability to retry failed missions helps a lot, but in the end, GTA2 just feels more tiresome yet more thoughtout than its predecessor did.
