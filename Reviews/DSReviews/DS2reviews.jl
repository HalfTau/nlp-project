You will need to find the hardware IDs for your graphics card in....   Device Manager -> Display Adapters -> Your Card -> Properties -> Details then scroll for Hardware ID\nYou are looking for a two sets of numbers\nVEN_XXXX and DEV_XXXX (X = numbers so for example DEV_1234)\nOnce found copy the whole line in a notepad doc and dig out the VEN and DEV numbers they should be fairly close together and always be in 4s.\nThen remove the text \"VEN_\" and \"DEV_\" and replace with \"0x\" for both of them (make sure you seperate them) so it will look like \"0x1234\" You'll need those numbers and the names of your graphics card plus who manufacures it in order to generate the gas file.\nFollow the rest of the instructions on site and download your new gas file and replace the one in your Dungeon Siege 2 Folder. this should make sure that your card shows up in vidconfig and should run from that normally. This fixed my issue before the creator update when live for Windows 10.\n2)\nWith Windows 10 however... I haven't found a way around it apart from rolling back the creator update... I don't know why this update breaks this game like it does but for now till a proper solution is found (and I will edit this review with it) I do really recommend editting your launch target line with \"fullscreen = false\" setting the resolution in vidconfig and using BorderlessGaming to fullscreen it!\nI hope this helps somebody!", "hours": 21.2, "username": "Doc Hollandase", "products": 833, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "39200", "page": 8, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-07-01", "text": "This is a weird franchise. I've played since I was young at the first and second game, however then a few years later they got a needless sequel that forgot what stuff needed fixing in the previous games and also pretty much killed the franchise. However, what about the first and second game? As usual I'm gonna start warning you about what the game fails, then move into it's strong points.\nFirst and foremost, the biggest problem this game has is being around 20 hours long and having a story that you'll hardly care about. Remember Sacred? Similar games, however there the story hardly got in the way. Here however the story is all over the place, it's redundant, predictable and overall kinda worthless. After a while you might just end up skipping every dialogue. And it's sad because the first game wasn't so heavy on the story and made it more enjoyable. It also doesn't help much that the game is long but it honestly felt easy. It rarely got too hard, though I did grind up a bit at certain points to look for those damn set items, which might have something to do with it.\nThe second bad part it has are some of the changes from the previous game. On it, you could have a ton of companions from the beginning and it was up to you to choose what they equip, who to take and sh#t. Well, you don't get as much freedom in quantities here anymore as from the start you'll be forced to a VERY small amount of possible characters that can follow you, and you'll have to buy more character slots, with the final slots being locked for higher difficulties. Excuse me, but wasn't the most fun part of the first game to f#ck around with a party of 6 dumb#ss guys with sh#tty loadouts into dumb dungeons and getting killed half-way? Why the hell would this game hold 4 character slots to ransom? That's a pretty clear case of fixing what wasn't broken. Thankfully there's mods that fix that\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and I highly suggest you use them.\nThird is that for some reason this game tried to be more edgy. You know how it goes, back then most sequels went with the edgy tones and this game was no exception. For some reason there's way more blood, there's NPCs EXPLODING IN BLODDY CHUNKS OF MEAT when killed with hard hitting attacks, but it looks really silly and out of place in my opinion, after having played the first one. It does kinda show that they were running out of ideas or had their ideas mixed up.\nThere's also how the devs didn't fix a common issue with the first game, how linear the game is and that there's not that much rooms to explore. Sure there's hidden areas and all but with a game called DUNGEON Siege you'd expect a bit more freedom, more caves where to explore for a reasonable longer time for some mini-boss that'll drop a weapon you'll instantly use once and forget or something. As it is it's usually just a hidden cave with 2 or 3 rooms and some monsters/loot or secret rooms with better loot inside but reasonable smaller. Kinda lackluster on that regard\nLastly is that the game wasn't made for modern computers, so you should expect some compability issues and weird resolutions. Some of those are fixable by f#cking around the game files or by modding, though.\nBut what does the game do right, you might ask? Well...\nThe combat system is satisfying enough. Though the story might get boring and the game is linear as all hell, the combat doesn't get too boring. You get full freedom on building your small number of characters as you please, including having weird but cool pets instead of humans or even a FeCKING DONKEY WITH INSANE CARRYING SPACE. A F#CKING DONKEY. THAT is cool.\nThe game's lenght is also really good for it's price. Specially since it offers replayability and\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\nThe game also had a really cool multiplayer mode which is really cool... But it's patched out here. However, you can mod it back into it, and playing the game with a friend is quite fun!\nAnd there's also completely randomized and it kinda adds to the experience. You can also upgrade items which adds to making your characters more customizable. Finally, there's also set items, which means that if you get multiple items from that one set, you get higher and higher special stats, which I REALLY LIKE! It's kinda hard to get those set items and you might end up farming up a bit, but it's worth it.\nOverall, I would recommend the game, HOWEVER I would seriously recommend you to try the first game instead, and also to just avoid the third game like the f#cking plague. In a sale, it's a decent amount of fun and a really good lenghty game for a cheap price.\nTL;DR Edition: It's average. The first game was better, here sh#t went edgier and gorier for no reason while the exploration stood the same and the story became a sour mess. But still kinda fun to go through, specially if you mod the multiplayer back in, as for SOME UNHOLY GODFORSAKEN F#CKING REASON THE STEAM VERSION HAS IT PATCHED OUT.", "hours": 19.5, "username": "BadassFreeman", "products": 331, "early_access": false}

Simple to play, and rich in story and lore, this game is an all around enjoyable waste of time, having improved in all the right ways on it's predecessor and somehow still remain relevant nowadays.\nGraphics (vs. todays standards) = 6.5/10\n- This is by no means a bad thing. The game can play very smoothly for pretty much any PC. I add the .5 for the beautiful scenery, the cool effects on the more advanced weapons and status effects, and the visuals of the actual combat. This game was well on par when it was released.\nGameplay = 9/10\n- Everything is so intuative and simple. You will find yourself repeating many actions, but they will feel new each time (sorting through the loot to see what you equip and what you sell or store, changing abailities according to foes you encouner, etc.) A few pathing mechanics can be annoying at times, and automated action priorities may conflict whith what you want to do at the moment, but it will be refreshed with every click fixing the issue at that moment and causing it to be but a minor setback in a very smooth play. The gameplay is rather linear, but you find yourself branching off the paths to discover hidden secrets, or returning to places visited to find something new or missed.\nStory and World = 9/10\n- It's no \"The Last of Us\", but you do feel immersed in this world. The main story is rather simple, bad guy wants to take over the world and in turn make it an awful place, and only you got the guts to stop him (together with a few followers), but the world is very rich in it's own lore. Usually I would skip through chit-chat from the NPCs, but in Dungeon Siege 2 the voice acting and actual story call your attention. Amazing voice acting by the way. So many NPCs feel so unique, and having certain members in your party will cause different conversations between them. The world it's self is diverse and scenery changes throughout revealing an enormous continent with a vast range of environments each with unique flora and enemies.\nReplayability = 8/10\n- Besides the fact that you can only play the more novice level of the game before being allowed to replay it on a more advanced level (3 difficulties to play through) which will start your charachters off at the level you stopped the previous difficulty, I believe most people will find themselves returning to this masterpiece after cooling down, all thanks to the above.\nI highly recommend anyone into the \"RPG/lvl-up charachters and abilities\" genre to give this a go. The current price is more than welcoming vs. the time you will spend on it and the enjoyment it provides.\nSmall note: I play almost entirely off-line, hence any apparent short time logged on the game.\nAnd thank you to Killah, who has the top rated guide on how to enable the \"Broken World\" expansion.", "hours": 1.3, "user_id": "76561198093582724", "username": "SK.DACECAD", "products": 13, "early_access": false}

You can only play on Easy diffuculty untill you finish all 9 Chapters (last two-three chapters are pure fighting with bosses and hordes of enemies between them). I was surprised I achieved level 44 by the end even though Mercenary difficulty is limited to 39 level.\nHalf of the game is no challenge untill you meet some strong bosses with higher level than your best member. Game includes a lot of story telling and side quests. Creatures are respawning after getting over a little area out, so firstly cleared area can be full of enemies again.\nUsually you have teleporters at every few meters forward and you can easily move between three main cities. I was a little frustrated by the end that there was no teleporter and I did not achieve to kill final boss at first chance so I had to fight the hordes of enemies between him and last and closest teleporter.\nThough I was not satisfied with the beginning of the game (probably until level 20), I enjoyed slaughtering through hordes of 38-40 level enemies.\nYou can specialize your characters into more styles of fighting, for example mage for melee and magical attacks but less  efficient armor and weapons you will be able to equip on him if you do not stick to one style. There are also armor sets which will add you some nice bonuses.\nI am happy about the story but the enemies could be more balanced, even though I did not know how the power attacks and other things are, I managed to easily go forward.\nAnd big con for stupid AI, my members were driving me crazy, when some of them got lazy to walk and stopped so I had to go back to them or when they got into strong enemy and instead of running with my selected one away to heal, they all ran towards death. I found out pressing R solved this problem, but I only found out by the end of the game.\nYou are offered with few puzzles in dungeons, mostly simple ones, but there are few you have to think through a little more time. Nice addition.\nIt took me 50 hours to finish the game. The hardest part of the game was at the Chapter 7 when I had to fight multiple bosses at once so I basically finished all possible sidequests to improve stats and equipment and after that just slaughtered them. Even though I improved only from level 40 to 42, it helped me a lot against them.\nAnother con: you can only save in one slot by pressing CTRL+S so no older saves possible but not needed. You just need to save while you are in town or before boss fights. Otherwise you will die and get automatically teleported to the town with butt naked. At least you have your inventory, so if you have secondary equipment or something in your chest, you can take it and reclaim your lost items easier.\nBugs: enemies sometimes get stuck in the wall so they do not attack but your heroes barely attack them too and it is hard to get their loot if you do not stand close enough. Sometimes enemies, especially last remaining of the horde assault will stop attacking you until you strike them (it may be intended as losing morale over dead allies), but to me it looks like bug. Some enemies and even your melee characters tend to circle over their opponents to strike them from another angle, which has no special effect on damage. Ranged attackers tend to shoot walls and ground if below or behind the terrain and you have to manually move your selected one deeper to enemy lines to move whole party. But still these bugs do not destroy whole game experience, it is not disaster.", "hours": 70.0, "user_id": "76561198140435102", "username": "savvym", "products": 368, "early_access": false}

The party AI is so awful it makes the game a giant chore. Case in point, your healer just wants to make a bee line straight into a new pack of enemies and die. Without a healer you front line melee players go down in seconds vs an evenly leveled foe.\nThe only party commands are positional, which is almost completely worthless, and manually controlling every character individually is impossible with the UI. You need to constantly adjust the camera, it's such a pain the butt.\nTo add salt to the wound, ressurecting in town makes you lose ALL of your gear.

This is a simple game, but one thing that I would really recommend trying out if you haven't is a party system, which is what makes this game unique: You can have up to 4 people, 5 or 6 when replaying on a higher difficulty, and that is what makes this game really shine. Being able to actually use all the loot you get instewad of being forced to sell that bow because you are a One-Handed Rogue  makes it really seem like a forgivable game.\n50 hours of hacking and slashing down the Haku for a price of around 2 bucks is worth it if you are into casual gaming, so buy it on sale but keep in mind it is a fairly old game.\n(Oh and people complaining about not having DLC or multiplayer: It doesn't matter\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 the game is still awesome)", "hours": 52.7, "username": "Baraklava", "products": 226, "early_access": false}

The gameplay was easy to understand and honestly preferred it over Diabalo, graphics were pretty amazing. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game if you expect it to be similar to the first of the DS series.\nI don't know if it's just my computer (which runs games like Chivalry Medieval Warfare pretty well) or it's the game, but the textures aren't as good as you'd expect for the second game of the DS series, heck the first DS looks better and even more crisp.\nThe second thing I don't like about this game is they seem to have thrown the party options like having the whole party target the weakest or strongest enemy, being able to highlight and select all party members to regroup.\nThe next thing is more of a personal preference but I'm not a big fan of having to continuously use the right click to attack. I'm more used to the DS1 single click and let everyone do the dirty work.\nNext is the lack of game settings, there isn't a whole lot you can adjust.\nLastly (I think) everything seems so cluttered, mostly the objects in the game like crates you can't destroy followed by other nit-picking like how fat the cursor is.\nNow obviously I haven't spent much time ingame but to me DS2 was a disappointment in comparison to DS1 but it's all the matter of personal preference. When I think of \"Dungeon Siege\" I think of an idle action packed game that's simply point and click while you manage your party's health, but this game is trying to be Diablo with some differences here and there.

You can see the evolution, but there are so much diversity, that people who like DS1 may be strongly against DS2, DS2 fans might be opposing DS1 and DS3... At least, it is not that hot, as \"apple vs. droid\" holywar now.\nDungeon Siege II made much to expand all that was good in the DS I - the system of characters development, interesting setting of fallen and reshaping empires - just like from known history, only with magic, demons and angels... To add pathos and glory, you know.\nIn addition to DS I formula \"take x levels with the skill - do y damage with that skill\" there was added perks - to enhance the benefits of choosing one specific path (class) rather than do them all but just on the average level (still, multiclass with some magic is better than pure melee).\nWhile the first Dungeon Siege was quite straight forward with only the very little need for backtracking, the expansion of DS II added BOTH the variety and size of different locations AND the need to go back-and-forth on the same landscape. While there exists a system of teleports for quick-travel, just the need to return to the base or some previous location every now and then feels very distinct in comparison both with the DS 1 and DS 3.\nWhat good do I see in the game?\nFirst, the developers made some work with the level design, to the point where dungeons and paths between them are not looking like intestines - like it was with DS 1 and many other similar games.\nSecond, while the story lost more of the previous \"abandoned (Roman) legion\" lore, it become more original. Now it's the tale about power-obsessed meglomaniac and some wannabe mercenary, who unintentionally gets in the way of the \"New World Order\". On his way to make some score with the bad guy, our hero-by-chance will be loosing and gaining friends, step-by-step evolving into rebellion leader. Sounds epic, right?\nOther than story, good level design with bad constant backtracking quests (and some good quests thereto), and somewhat original (at its time) character grading system... I have to say that the game is quite dated. And even back in time when it looked good, it wasn't the brightest star even between so-called \"Diablo-killing\" action RPGs. Not to mention more pure RPGs like Bioware stuff... There are some nice little things - like the spells to make looting more easy work - but they can't outweigh the main issues, like the general fun-out-of-the-game (which can't be measured, but can be compared).\nAs a summary, game's not a bad one. It's decent, like 7/10 in my book. But would I recommend it to the new players? Hardly. If you have desire for old-school gaming, find the real brilliants, like early Bioware products, Divine Divinity or Arcanum - don't start with \"somewhat original\" copycats, unless you want to grow a dislikeness to old games in yourself.", "hours": 161.1, "username": "Whiteswart", "products": 1665, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

I have bought so many games where I have either returned them for a refund or played once and never bothered again.  This is the 1st game since Football Manager that has the potential to cost me a divorce as football manager nearly did.  Bye bye wife.  Hello Dungeon Siege 2.  The game is just brilliant.  Yes the graphics are dated and yes there is aot to get your head around but it is so much fun.  Unlike other games in the genre like Torchlight you dont just get given loads of loot.  Yes there is still plenty but it feels so much more rewarding to get new weapons.  For example I had a 2 handed hammer that I couldn't use until I hit melee lv 5 and unlocked a certain skill from the skill tree usinf skill points.  Once I met this criteria it was so satisfying to equipt my new hammer and smash everything up with it.  On other similar titles in this genre you just seem to get given weapons or there are too many weapons.  This game puts them to shame.  I love the story as well.\nOn a final note as well this game is an excellent way of losing weight in the same way football manager was when it owned my life.

Although the gameplay concept didn't change much, DS 2 presents itself more complicated and somehow contraintuitive about the controls, if you come from DS 1. I have a hard time getting started because of that and die a lot. On the other hand DS 2 presents some improvements like an arrow telling you where to go, respawning enemies and a portal system to speed up the journey and making revisits of old locations much easier. On the other hand, this assimilation to standards kind of takes away a piece of the uniqueness of the first part. If compared to other rpgs DS 2 sadly doesn't rise above mediocrity. I also have to admit that I found the graphics poorer than those of the first game. I had the impression that at least the first sceneries are grayer and somehow more practical than aesthetic. I especially disliked some of the character faces and their portraits, although they are not as important as what they have to say. Usually I am not into graphics that much and prefer the pure story, but it really stroke my eyes.\nI don't think that DS 2 is a total waste of time. I'm sure, if you have the time and dedication you could have lots of fun with the game, but I personally do not want to spend so many of my resources on it and I do not recommend the game for most other players, who might be frustrated with it as well.", "hours": 1.6, "user_id": "76561198024794948", "username": "Lichgrub", "products": 76, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

Overall I enjoyed it, and would recommend to gamers who enjoy old-school top-down RPGs.  It's very enjoyable in that regard.  The story was also improved, in my opinion.\nPersonal Cons\nClick system change:  The changes to the original click system felt weird to me, making it feel more like Diablo, but I eventually accepted it and enjoyed it.\nTalent System:  The talent system was an interesting addition, and gave more depth, but it was rough because you couldn't ever change them.  Without playing you weren't sure what would be benefical later, which led to some talent points being wasted.\nParty size reduced to 4.  Part of what made the original Dungeon Siege fun was the party size, but I understand why they wanted to make the change, especially for balance reasons.  Some of the itemization was strange to me\nBoss Fights: Some of the boss fights, especially the last one, felt so clunky and obnoxious, which shows the games age.\nPros\nLong, and decent story, was fun to explore.  It was a little annoying that it did not connect with DS1, but was very great. Great exploration feeling, lots of fun areas.

This feature keeps the game interesting throughout as you spec up your main starter character and have the ability to improve your other party members and try out their skill sets. The voice acting is pretty decent, and the storyline is interesting. There's a heap of side quests to do as well, and some are pretty challenging and have puzzles that you have to solve to move forward in the main quest or open a chest to find epic loot.\nMy only concern was toward the end-game it gets a bit grindy to reach the final boss, and replayability is good but would be better with friends as you play through game again on a harder difficulty (similar to Diablo II's difficulty levels). Boss fights are at first challenging but once you get the jist of their mechanics they are pretty easy. With the resolution configure making it 1920x1080 with v-sync, the game looks pretty decent for it's age (2005 I believe).\nOverall it's a classic Action RPG with interesting combat system, able to control up to 6 party members and fairly decent choices to focus your character on i.e. a Mage can focus on Fire, Lightning or Death Magic, or Summoning Skills.", "hours": 32.6, "user_id": "76561198069273911", "username": "Mikeey", "products": 24, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "39200", "page": 23, "page_order": 6, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-12-04", "text": "I still own the physical Deluxe Edition of this DSI & DSII and was very excited to see them reach steam so that I can access and install it no matter where I might be in the world. I have probably put roughly 3k hours or more into this game alone.\nI still consider this game to be one of the best action RPG's ever created. Rich story and lore, not the greatest but decent voice acting for it's time. In some ways this DSII still puts some of the newer RPG's to shame, and it is easy to see where some of todays RPG's draws it's roots from here.\nAt first glance the graphics look outdated, since this is not a remake of DSII, one should expect the graphics not to be top notch in comparison to today's titles. But once you zoom in to take a more detailed look at the characters, enemies, weapons, armors, & spells, it is still quite amazing. Far from the majority of cookie cutter RPG's of today DSII still stands out from the rest.\nDSII is full of sidequests along with it's main storyline. But best of all true individual party member customization. A choice not truly given in a lot of today's titles. When a character joins your party you are given a \"suggestive\" path, based on the character's background in the story. But, every character & party member has all the ability trees available to them. You are not forced to build into that characters suggested tree. You want to turn your warrior into a a dual wielding assassin but also have healing, ranged, or combat magic abilites? You can do that. Or a fire wielding combat mage with a bow? You can build that too. A party of all mages? Sure. Picked up a bowman you want to turn into a healing mage? No problem. True freedom to make the party you want. Or even go solo if you want to.\nThere are still many mods available for DSII out on the net, some of them giving minor changes to complete overhauls or new maps and in a few cases a whole new story and storyline. Want to beat down your enemies with an overpowered pillow? How about pots, pans, spoons & forks? Want to play as one of the enemies in the game? Grab the mods. With all the mods available out there it gives the game a very high replay value.\nSince the closing of gamespy, there has been no full internet accessibility. But creating a virtual LAN over the net using a 3rd party program like Hamachi or Tunngle can easily overcome this issue. And the Steam version user can connect to a retail disk user provided they are playing both the same version, example: DSII to DSII, or DSII BW to DSII BW, and same patch version (Since I own a retail copy disk I have been able to test this). If not, then you will not see each other in the LAN lobby. I would like to see cloud support in the future. (It is easiest to add the BW expansion Killa has provided in \"guides\" to get LAN working as it comes with the original DSII:BW launcher.)\nIn this review I would also like to thank Killa and everyone else that have done all the work to get the DSI & DSII expansions for steam working and making all the necessary files available. So that all who have purchased it can enjoy the complete classic Dungeon Siege experience. Since DS3 lacks everything that made DSI & DS2 such great games. Also if you enjoy the Dungeon Siege series of games give Space Siege a try, which is a spinoff of the Dungeon Siege series of games set in a fictional future. Unlike Dungeon Siege, however, items are limited much like Shadowgrounds (No relation). Also Space Siege lacks the party play style of Dungeon Siege, and I have not had a chance to test multiplayer on it (unlike DSI & II, Space Siege used GPGNet, & I have not yet had a chance to see if the service still works). But still nonetheless another great game in the Dungeon Siege realm.", "hours": 100.6, "username": "CoporateFatCat", "products": 945, "early_access": false}

Reminded me alot of Baldur's Gate when I first played it back in the day, with a splash of diablo. However, while the loot system is very satisfying, and the out-of combat secrets and goodies are worthwhile, the skill trees, spells, and skills in general are a little too simple for my liking, and some are completley useless while some are incredibly overpowered. The end result is too little replay value for the kind of game it is. They do let you pick your race, and you aren't locked into a class, but if you don't specialize in one of the four skill types, (Melee, Ranged, Nature, uhhh... well the fourth one is damage magic. Can't remember the name.) you will end up very underpowered as they punish you severely for trying to multiclass in this game, One very cool fact is while at the middle-to end of the game most party members are leveled up so much there really is only one way you can build them, the few you get at the beginning you can basically mold into anything you want, to work with whatever role your character fills. I won't give away all the features of this gem, but with a tiered playthrough system similar to diablo, you can carry your experience, loot, and party members (unlocking additional party slots when you reach the harder tiers) through another playthrough, making up for the \"why bother\" rolling a new character.

In terms of the action RPG category I honestly have to say Dungeon Siege 2 takes the cake as the best game ever released. The speed of play and game mechanics are perfect, especially for their time. Unlike the Diablo series, Dungeon Siege 2 takes a less of a \"run and gun\" approach to the game. What I mean by this is when your fighting adversaries you actually have to stop and put up a fight. Those who have played Diablo know that if you're playing in a big party you pretty much never stop running while mowing down enemies in the process. I prefer the Dungeon Siege approach because it feels more like a role playing adventure, which is what I am looking for. As for the mechanics, they nailed it. The loot is always great, there are tons of different items, magical, unique etc. There isn't really any one thing about the game that I can honestly pick apart and say \"I really wish they had done that\". Every good aspect of action RPG's is contained in this game and the bad left out. And the storytelling? Second to none.\nGraphically this game is 10 years old now from me writing this review. That said, in the year 2005 3d graphics were certainly nothing new. If graphics factor heavily into your purchasing of a game, this game will probably never live up. But it still looks pretty good. The environments are very beautiful, and the team who made this game definitely took their time putting work into every little detail.\nThe last thing I will say is when you buy this game.. it comes with glitches. If you have a windows 7/8 computer you have to download some direct x patches (from the microsoft website), setup some commands to enable widescreen, and also I had to do something to get the mouse to appear. If you want to play multiplayer it is disabled, but there is a workaround possible, and you can play with friends from around the world by setting up a virtual server.

I've got no clue how many hours I spent playing that franchise in my lifetime. All this to say: don't trust my Steam hours played - I'm very familiar with the franchise.)\nWith that being said, Dungeon Siege 1 is fairly nostalgic to me, but Dungeon Siege 2 brings more to the game than the previous one did.\n_______________________________\nTL;DR: Very good game that surpasses the first one in terms of classes, combat, and story. For those who are unfamiliar with the game, do not let the outdated graphics fool you; this game has a lot to offer and has proven more fun and addicting than most other recent games I've tried. A must-play for all who call themselves PC gamers.\n_______________________________\nHere it is more detailed:\nThe classes have skills that allow you to specialize in the role you want each character to fill. Rangers are far more potent now, but are comparatively the weakest class still. I have one in my party and have no problem with it nonetheless. Love it and will keep using it, but they could use more DPS.\nThe cities are far more returned to than the first game. Teleporters connect the entire world, promoting revisits as you unlock means to interact with thing you couldn't before. There are clear quests now, and you have a storage safe for your items after the intro stage. Overencumbrance and lack of inventory space is a thing of the past, as you have the access to shops to sell your stuff very early. The story is smoother, better brought and told to the player, and I dare say the game in general is more immersive than the first one. It's a must play for all PC gamers; considering how old the franchise is, you could even call this a classic. And it's also conveniently cheap for the same reason.\nOnce you get used to the simple game mechanics, and what does what, it's very difficult not to enjoy this game. If you enjoyed the Elder Scrolls, Pokemon, and MMORPGs, you'll enjoy the Dungeon Siege franchise.\n(NOTE: Go into your game options and set the combat back to DS1 for it to be generally easier, until you want to implement kiting into your playstyle later on. With it on DS1, your selected character will keep attacking until whatever you're fighting is dead, instead of having to hold down the attack button for that, or clicking for each individual attack.)", "hours": 66.2, "user_id": "76561198100434243", "username": "Disappointed Father", "products": 107, "early_access": false}

I've been hooked on Dryads for years because of her.\nThe game has some age on it. It's not super complicated like others that are available now, but it didn't have to be. Trying to keep your party alive in a skirmish was enough to make you wish you had a diaper on. The story was great and most of the characters where likable. The voice acting was ok.\nI think it's way better than the 3rd installment.\nThe dryad Taar had an INCREDIBLY sexy voice. Srsly. She could read a dictionary to me any time.\nMake sure you know where your hot key is to use potions as well as the hot key to select specific members and the whole party. Health drains fast. Even faster when a caster's mana dries up.\nThere are different skill levels for the game. They encouraged you to up the skill level in an interesting way. Not sure if they're the first to do it or not, but it was effective - you could have more characters in your party if you choose a higher challenge.\nWhich leads me to one of the greatest things about this game! The dialogue!! (Oh, and do yourself a favor and find the mod that takes care of the issue where everyone stops talking and you miss out on that part of the story if a bad guy walks up and attacks. Which happens ALL THE FREAKIN TIME!) The inter character banter is flawless. No matter what combination of characters you have or how many, they all interact naturally in conversation. They seem to develop sort of complex relationships between them. They say different things to each other depending on who's there. I've played the game through a billion times over the years and I'm constantly hearing new things.\nSomeone needs to make a NPC follower of Taar for Skyrim and all other sandbox games I like. WHERE IS THE FUNDING FOR THIS!?!?\nThe game does have a massive inventory of weapons, armor, rings, amulets, shoes, reagents, bathroom accessories, nicnacks, etc etc.. Also, look up the mod that changes the size of your stash box to 255x255 squares. There exists one to do the same with your pack mule and your own inventory. Bump up the resolution and collect some loot!\nIt's also a pretty long game. You're not going to beat it in a few hours. Even if you cheat via the console, it'll still take a few days. There's SO MUCH territory to cover, puzzles to solve, banter to listen to, cut scenes, missions, shopping.. The boss fights are also super long. Not that they're oppressively hard (though they can be on Legendary), they just require a lot of tactics and strategy. And the bosses have insane HP pools.\nGames as of late have really lost the charm this little gem has. Yeah, the graphics aren't what games have today, so don't get your hopes up if you come across a mod that makes all the girls sans clothing. Though the world does look pretty good. It also doesn't have much in the way of DLC and fortunately you don't have to bust your wallet out and type in credit card numbers every five seconds to get one item you need to progress like those lamentable \"free to play\" crapsterpieces.  When you enchant items, you don't need a doctorate from MIT like the spells in Lichdom.\nBut, you do have to be careful where you spend your skill points, lest you ruin a character. You do have to plan ahead. You do have to be quick on the keys. But most importantly, you are definitely rewarded for it all.\nIf you've made it this far, you prolly will buy and play the game. I'd like to leave you with one piece of advice that will save you much frustration, and it has to do with elevators:\nWhen you put your party on a lift to go up or down into a new area, there is one glitch in the game that will bone you. Even if you get all your characters on the platform; for whatever reason, when you trip the lever to move, one or more of your people will say \"I'm out, peace!\" and walk off the platform before it stars to move. Often times dumping you into a mob of baddies you simply can't beat with only half your members (or even sans one).\nSo here's what you do. Arrange all your peeps on the platform. Move one of them right next to the lever and use them to pull it. This way, when you go down, if there are a billion bad guys, you can use that same character to bring your party back to safety before anyone dies.\nIf you can't get them all to go up or down at once, and this happens, here's the strategy that I have used for years.\nSet everyone's AI to aggressive. Try to get your magic users to all go down. Leave the Melee and archers behind except for one (which you will keep selected and control) next to the lever. The reason why you do this, is because a melee character will run off the platform as soon as it touches down and end up toast. The magic users will stay on the platform and hit everything from a distance.\nKEEP A CLOSE EYE ON HEALTH!! If you're fighting low level creatures, come up once the lowest health meter is at 1/4. If you're fighting high level creatures, come up as soon as the lowest one is close to  1/2. If they're super high creatures (and this is actually a good strategy to kill them period) then go down and only say there long enough for your mages to charge their spells. They'll continue to pelt the baddies as you're coming back up. While you're in your safe zone, use that time to heal and let your mana recharge.\nLove and cherish Taar.

There are two serious issues that cripple what honestly seems otherwise a reasonable game.  First is movement.  Point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, point, click, etc.  Come on, seriously?  No constant movement like Diablo of YEARS before?  No directional keys to move and attack at the same time of later games of this same era?  That's pretty terrible.  Second is your attacks/ abilities.  You have immediate access to a rich array of spells and attacks, but you can only use one at a time.  No hotkeys for spells?  You're kidding...  Nope, you have to go up to the corner to click on a little button to change to one of a select few that you have put in your ready tray, likely bumping the edge of the screen while at it which changes your camera view/rotation.  This is just a UI failure all around.  If I could hold the mouse button to move and hotkey 4 spells/attacks into the 1-4 keys to swap ablities in combat easily, I'd be all into this instead of detailing why you shouldn't bother with it.  A third issue of note is that there is VERY strong discouragement in the tutorial that you should pick an attack and stick with it, meaning melee, ranged, or spell.  Great, except for the fact that spells use mana which runs out, the other two are infinite.  Yep, infinite arrows, finite mana.  So, you CAN'T stick with spells, you MUST swap out to something else, which again isn't easy by design and starts to impact your development apparently by the warnings.

Dungeon Siege II is one of those games.\nEverything that makes a fantasy action strategy game fun to play is in this game -- gorgeous artwork, evocative soundtrack, user-friendly interface, fully customizeable characters, great gear, generous loot drops, secret rooms, interesting and complicated quests, and far more gold than you could possibly need.

You don't have to play the first game to understand the story (which is pretty decent by the way).\nThe gameplay: It's similar to that of the Diablo series, it's point and click movement/combat, except that you can control a party of up to 6 characters (it's easier then it sounds). You can set each character to automatically perform a certain attack or spell. So the only character you have to actually worry about controlling is the one you choose to select as the leader. You gain skill points that you can spend on certain active and passive skills: shield block, less mana consumption for casting spells, dual wield extra damage, etc. The active skills you earn are based on what passive skills you choose. Example: by investing skill points into the passive skill \"increase cold spell damage\" you earn an active skill that blasts several shards of ice that do massive damage.\nAdding the skill point system really improved the oversimplicity of the first Dungeon Siege leveling and combat system (don't get me wrong though, the first one was still fun too). Another addition, is that you can enchant items by finding or buying certain ingredients. You can make some really powerful armor/weapons. This feature definately adds more strategy and depth to the gameplay.\nLastly, the environments are very dynamic and beautiful. There are lots of fun extra dungeons/caves to explore.\nI definately recommend this game!", "hours": 59.7, "username": "wheatiesrgood13887", "products": 470, "early_access": false}

Most of my time was recorded \"offline,\" so really it's more like 50-70+ hours, 100+ on the outside. And guess what? I'm only halfway through Veteran difficulty after spending god-knows-how-many hours trying to get through Mercenary. And time of completetion on Mercenary? Somewhere in the ballpark of 15+ hours for me at least, because holy\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665I was grinding so hard and I enjoyed every. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing. Second. Of it. Was still a grind, but it was a very fulfilling one, I'll admit. Yes, I was trying to kill mobs so I could get this one drop that would make or break my build, but when it finally DID appear...oh man, oh MAN did I feel like everything was worth it.\nThat should stand as a testament as to how damn addictive this game is, which is pretty damn good. Really. DIABLO(tm) is and always will be the king of Hack n' Slash Action RPGs, but this game gives the king a run for its money.\nA classless, skill-tree based progression system is the star of this title, having built on the framework of the first title. Now, you can tweak your builds to your liking. Combat Mage that deals \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665tons of AoE damage? Go for it! Melee tank that uses greatswords for massive crits? Baby, you can do whatever you want~~! Ranged character that can snipe from halfway across the map? Yes, please! Nature Mage that can makes enemy projectiles tickle like they're nothing but feathers? Oh, darling, you know how to get my motor running~~~!\nHowever, be warned! Multiclassing is nigh-on impossible, so take the game's advice to heart and stick to one class. Not that you can't do it, but it's ill-advised nonetheless.\nAlso revamped is the town system. Instead of just being a checkpoint, you actually have a *reason* to go back to town. You can sell-off your vendor trash a *lot* easier. You can portal back to town. You can buy that one sword that gives +5 cold damage and has a chance of proccing a massive blizzard from the merchant. Sure, it's pretty bare-bones compared to other games, but gawddamn this title needed this sort of system badly.\nI know that a lot of Hack n' Slash Action RPGs already had this feature, and this was definitely missing from the first title. It was basically GPG realizing that they screwed up in that respect on the first title, so to see them rectify it is refreshing.\nOverall, this title is amazing. It's $6.99 USD or your regional equivalent. Don't even wait for a sale. Get it now.

I remember playing the original Dungeon Siege (and Legend of Aranna) and rather enjoyed it, even though it involved a lot of pretty endless side-tracking as you go up and down hills and follow paths and attack monsters and whatnot. Turns out this is about the same thing, albeit with a bit more \"heroic\" story...\nYou play this character who was in a bad guy's mercenary unit, hit a few battles, then was captured and released to do a few good things for amends. He picks up companions for different roles such as fighter, archer, combat mage and nature mage (he himself can be any of the four).\nThe game is pretty simple mechanically, and while there is a ton of loot, most of which are pretty forgettable, as Dungeon Siege at its heart, is 3D Diablo. You'll find various items to improve yourself, and you will swap items trying out different \"packages\".\nThe game's graphics are horrible, but that's really no surprise for a game that came out in 2005... It was state of the art THEN, it's horrible now. Character polys are low, fighting's clunky. The fighter mechanics also changed, and not always for the better. Instead of just fight, each character now has a \"super-move\" that you can unlock as you gain skills. A fighter, for example, can do a shield-bash, or perhaps a two-handed sword smash-strike, that does like 10x the normal damage, if you unlock the prerequisite skills. And each skill be further improved in skill levels, with additional skills only unlock when you reach a particular combination of prior skills. This complexity, IMHO, actually made the game worse. Supermove requires recharge, but how it recharges isn't explained very well.\nThe world's big, but it's a single path through, with SOME side areas to explore, but not that much of it. A cave here, a building there.\nThe plot is pretty simple... and cliche. Bad guy is about the conquer the world, and the only guy who can save it doesn't even realize his destiny. Then there's this sudden deus ex machina twist at the end, like WTF?

Die Story ist nicht schlecht, wenn auch am Ende etwas zu offen. Ansonsten ist das Spiel eigentlich genau so wie der Vorg\u00e4nger.

This game was a game I bought when I lost my key to Sacred and had to reformat my computer years ago. This game is an amazing party based dungeon crawler. You have four different skill paths to go down (Combat magic, nature magic, melee, ranged). Within this paths are many different paths to help create a unique party. You should have one from each class and specialize in that class or you will end up being weak. The story on this game is amazing for the most part (starting area sucks). If you want a Diablo 2 ish game with an amazing party system then play this. This one is five times better than Dungeon Siege 3!", "hours": 6.9, "username": "Zai", "products": 1183, "early_access": false}
