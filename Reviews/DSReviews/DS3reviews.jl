You can't remember it after a game, though.\nStory - 3/5: it's not that rich, but it's solid enough. You have some plot twists, some choices to make (especially depending on your current party partner). The game provides funny allusions to the plots of Dungeon Siege and Dungeon Siege 2, too. No romance subplots, pity (though one book makes a rather straight hint, and the ending video makes another one).\nGameplay - 3/5: pretty decent fighting system, strange mouse controls were figured out by the end of the tutorial. I'd say that the combat suffered more from unclear synergies and information about stats than from somewhat repeated and lackluster button-mashing. The moves look cool enough.\nReplay - 1/5: only for 100% achievements, I'd say. It seems that boredom will eat me for sure, should I decide to replay the game only to win Anjali/Katarina/etc. influence and level up a character up to 20... without any clear rewards item- or story-wise.\nIn the end, the game seems a decent one to spend money on. You'll get a bit of anything: hard fights, decent visuals, some funny dialogs, a bit boring but solid enough story. But you won't get the ideal RPG of all times with 100% in either department.\nTruth to be said - I've never seen Dungeon Siege 3 to aspire for such heights, though, so here you are.\nP.S.: don't forget the thaumaturgical analysis of those statues!

The maps are incredibly linear, exemplified by the minimap. Combat is seemingly repetitive, as you use a total of 10 different abilities, including the ability to use your weapon and dodge. The story is about as bland as they come, as far as I have gotten (Stonebridge, dealt with the mines, working on Miesters), and the characters all feel very one dimensional. THere's strong hints to a moral system, and \"influencing\" your single companion you can have at once is implied to do something, but, so far, I can't tell if they have any effects at all. There's little to no explanation of how your stats and abilities interact, so I just end up using whatever item is at the top of the list. The camera, which comes with two angles (niether of which are good), is always too close, meaning enemies will aggro from off screen, and you often won't see what your character is shooting for, with a ranged attack. And don't get me started on the targeting system. It's a joke.\nAnd you know what? I love it. I am having a blast. It's humour is just quirky enough, it's monsters just interesting enough to keep me playing.

It feels almost like an homage to games like Dragon Age, or Diablo, and a fun one at that. A guilty pleasure, through and through.\nDo I think you, the reader, will like it? No clue.  Is it mechanically perfect? Hardly. But I love it.\nIf you are thinking of playing, I have some rebinding advice:\nIgnore the click to move. It worked well in 1, but with no pause, and only 2 characters, using WASD to move works infinitely better. Bind left click to your primary attack, and right click to your first ability. Make E your heal, but keep the second armors on 4 and 5. Make your secondary ability another button on your mouse, like a thumb button. Map your third ability to shift, and the weapon swap on Q. Keep the quest helper on C, and rebind your character menu to tab. Move the secondary menus, like quests and inventory to buttons near O and P, as you don't often need access to them directly. Hammer dodge frequently, as it often is the fastest form of movement.

And I was one of them.  This happens on all platforms of the game.  The main bug being that once you save your progress right before the Rajani boss fight.  If you skip all the sidequests and don't take the time to level up nor properly equip both of your characters, you will rage quit guaranteed.  There is no way to exit this level and you are locked in that area by a gate, regardless if you switch which mission to track.  She does not summon any minions that you can earn XP from to even attempt to level up during the fight.  I even knew that this would happen on a second playthrough and had two save files, the gate locks as soon as you enter the courtyard with one of two mini bosses you need to take care of first.  The only option is to restart the game entirely if you have no backup save file from before this area.  Unfortunately for me, found out this can also happen again when you're in the mission where you're in the town with the Grand Chapterhouse when it's been overrun by the clockwork guards.  Luckily, there is an area in the lower part of town where you can save, battle 2-3 clockwork guards, save, quit, reload and they're back to help you level up.  I needed to beef up my hit points and strength by about 4 levels before being able to continue.  Not many adventure fans that want to steamroll through the main campaign on Easy mode are going to have patience enough to grind your way through leveling up.\nAs for multiplayer, seems a little broken as your friends progress won't be saved and I think they are equipped with your sidekicks equipment.  So if you're bad at equipping that character and chose poorly for their skills, it's not going to be a fun ride for either of you.\nBut, after knowing where the bugs are and how to save multiple files per character, the game isn't all that bad and is very pleasing to the eye.  Controls are a bit cluky, story a bit thin, but almost halfway through the game, determined to finish and do the DLC.\nPS There are a ton of resources online for recommended character builds that helped me tremendously.

My history with Dungeon Siege began with the second game in this series. DSII was an unforgettable experience, I've played it through 6-7 times probably. The major thing that stood out was epicly, originally and vividly told story. This is the same with DSIII and it is probably going to be the major thing that keeps you playing this game. If I would have to name any comparable games (taking into account only this aspect of the game), I'd choose Dragon Age Origins and Fallout New Vegas. DSIII offers the ability to shape the games' ending to your liking and that is what you can find in those two, even if they're slightly better at it. In addition to that, DSIII connects to the lore of its' predecessors thus making the game more enjoyable for the fans of the franchise.\nDSIII also offers a nicely looking environment and perfectly fitting soundtrack. Actually, there were many moments throughout the game when I wished I could just turn the camera around and enjoy a full view of my surroundings while listening to that calm \"out of combat\" music... Anyway, even checking out things that are allowed by the camera is really satisfactory. This aspect could be simply put like this (basically it goes the same for any fantasy RPG): does this game create a world you would like to live in? Yep, DSIII most certainly does. The world in this game is vivid and immersive as much as the story and that's what I really liked about this game. The only minor drawback for graphics is a lack of various item sets. Most of the equipment you'll find will look almost the same. On the other hand, it's nice to finnally have a matching gear for a change rather than walking arround with red plate leggings and gauntlets, yellow shirt and blue hood just because they're good.\nThe negative part of this game is pretty much everything else and I can understand the negative reviews. The combat and camera mechanics are quite terrible. This game moved from what I believe is hack and slash to action RPG by reducing the amount of enemies you encounter at once and removing the abillity to sustain damage by using loads of healing potions. Instead you get rolling mechanics like in dark souls. So the fighting pretty much comes to this: you hit once and then you roll. If the enemy is slower, you may hit 2-3 times, if you're fighting faster enemies, they'll hit you anyway and you can die in seconds. That is especially true if you chose to be a warrior. There is no balance between classes or enemies. Some bosses are really hard, some are puny. Talking about the pit I had to roll around... This was because the boss I was fighting had special attack that steals life. The attack does not even have to hit you, that boss can leech health out of thin air... Inorder to avoid that, you have to stay far away from the boss and still be able to hit it. Thus, rolling around the pit. Not to mention that various stones get in your way by making you stuck... So, yeah, the combat is rather irritating. And for someone, that hasn't played previous Dungeon Sieges this will probably negate all joy that can be gained from playing DSIII.\nAlso, there are other things that get in the way: lack of customization, underdeveloped player characters, overall linearty of the game, sometimes really silly dialogue options, almost no use for most of the gear and stats (sorry, this may be misleading, but I think going for stamina is the best for any type of chatacter), crappy saving system (seriuosly, why can't I save anywhere out of combat??)... All this makes the game average rather than good. If I were to rate it, my final score would be 6/10 and probably I'm adding one extra only out of love for DS universe.\nTo wrap it all up, I believe, that this game would find its' place in the hearts of people who can ignore all technical flaws just to experience a good story. And if you'll excuse me for dreaming a little, we could have a DS IV that competes with such masterpieces like Dragon Age, if only they made an amazing, technically fluent gameplay within the world of Dungeon Siege.\nCheers!", "hours": 29.5, "user_id": "76561198110667709", "username": "AJKWind", "products": 93, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

The first allows levelling through activity, getting better at whatever you use. This game on the other hand gives set characters with set personalities set ability trees and set playstyles. This means your first decision is both crucial and completely uninformed. All of the character descriptions come down to \"Fights at range, except when it doesn't\" or \"Fights up close, except when it doesn't\". All of the characters are supposed to be different in meaningful ways, but they're also supposed to be adaptable to different people's playstyles. So the differences come across as cosmetic (at least early on)\nThere are things like blocking and dodging to try to make up for taking all the fun of leveling up by limiting it to slotted abilities just like diablo. They even fail to make the low level characters feel weak. I've already murdered about a hundred fellow human beings in the first few hours in groups of 5-10... So your character is both the chosen one and a super-saiian. At least in the first they were dimminutive goblin-things...

While dungeon siege 3 abandons the somewhat abstract party system of previous titles in favor of a more arcady action style dungeon hack, it still does quite well.\nOverall, I enjoy dungeon siege 3. As a standalone dungeon hack it is reasonably fun, with a moderately strong story, reasonably diverse and active combat, decent visuals, and a fairly straightforward and accessible UI/interface. There is lore to collect, items to upgrade, a not-too-complicated inventory system and what I would consider to be medium-strength character level-up options (skills and powers and whatnot).\nThis is all single player. Co-op varies tremendously based on a single issue - out of the box, all co-op characters are \"tethered\" - the game plays in a top-down isometric view, and out of the box, all players playing together (up to 4) must all be fit within the same camera area.  It's crazy.\nHowever, moderately simple console commands that you can look up online\nallow you to \"un-tether\" the game camera, allowing all co-op players to move around the map independently. This is, in my opinion, a TREMENDOUSLY better way to play the game\nsadly, the game only bears a passing homage to the original dungeon siege (mentions of various characters and locations are tied into the storyline, but have little-to-no impact) and absolutely no discernable connection to dungeon siege 2 (which is okay, as ds2 bore almost no connection to ds1, which was a little annoying - but I digress)\nall in all, I love this game.  While limited in scope, it's a better-than-competent dungeon hack, and suprisingly fun co-op online that seems to function pretty well - easily worth 5-10$ us, and quite possibly worth more depending on whether you have friends that like to co-op with you online, I not only recommend this game but I actually quite like it", "hours": 67.5, "user_id": "76561197983758407", "username": "phermitgb", "products": 248, "early_access": false}

The characters you play as have very specific personalities and backgrounds, unlike the prior games in the series. Although this was a good idea, since \"random farmer\" and \"random mercenary\" isn't exactly good writing to use all the time in a series, the characters were largely forgettable. It's been about a year since I played, and despite having spent a good 20 hours in the game, I can only recall a man with black hair, and older gentleman with graying hair, and a woman who is some sort of fire elemental. With five characters, that means I've completely forgotten the identities of two of them.\nThese established characters also have very specific abilities they can use. In the first two games, there were tons of different spells, and you could set your character up to learn all sorts of them, as well as using a variety of different types of weapons. In DSIII, however, the established characters have far less options. I normally hate the term \"dumbing down,\" because it tends to be elite \"hardcore\" jerks who use it to talk down about a game for doing anything differently. However, I am actually in favor of established characters to choose from, and character-specific abilities to choose from, but I felt that DSIII's abilities just didn't feel right for me when I played.\nThere is a fair bit of lore in books you can find as you go through the game, but I never found any of it interesting, despite reading everything I could find. The main storyline wasn't very interesting, either, in my opinion. There was a little mystery involving a grove, but the pacing wasn't good and...well, let me stick on that point.

In DS1 and DS2 you just spent all your time ducking into corners trying to find armour and weapons and spells that were just a touch bit better than what you already had; DS3 honestly does a better job of this, with a much tighter reward cycle.\nThe story is a bit . . . \"meh\". Decent enough, but not a selling point of the game. The butchering of the original DS1 lore is a touch sad, even if it kind of does set up nicely for a sequel . . . that won't ever happen, probably.\nCouple of other things that bothered me: many of the female characters have \"armour\" that isn't even close to being realistic (for Azunai's sake, Katerina wears _high heels_ in combat!). Multiplayer is a bit of a joke... some of the skills are solidly OP. I finished the game on the hardest difficulty and only ever needed to use the \"block\" mechanic in one battle, which was in the DLC content . . .\nBut overall it's a solid fighting game with beautiful graphics. Camera controls are a touch annoying, and the story is nothing to write home about, but it kept me interested enough to play through three times (once as Katerina, twice as Anjali). It's very different than the other DS games, so I suspect that's why it has poor reviews, at least in part.\nI think you can do better with $15, but you can also do far worse.\n(Quick note --- I played this game offline, not online, hence Steam claiming I've only played it for 0.1 hours?!?

The game had some interesting choices made for it during development it seems though.\nLet's take a small look at what you can expect _IF_ you decide to buy it at the end of this review.\nDungeon Siege 3 hosts a few terrain problems in some areas that force you to turn the camera 180 degrees before you can get away, unless you changed the basic controls (W S = movement, A D = turn camera). Don't be scared of this though, it'll mostly happen at the very edge of the paths and normally doesn't happen during boss fights.\nWe also don't get to evade past enemies (at least this seems to be the case most of the time) but you get i-frames during your dashes so just dash away once you find your character. DO NOT LOSE TRACK OF YOUR OWN CHARACTER.\nIf you love a challenge, you'll enjoy the \"hardcore\" mode, which no- it's not actually hardcore, it's a cool word for hard to them. Powerleveling won't get you anywhere as the enemies randomly jump in power, and any spray or ability that makes the floor deal damage over time will -most- likely 1-shot you, there's no limit for how fast it damages you so you can drop really damn fast, and they decided to let most bosses and later mobs have at least one of these two.\nThat being said, every start is troublesome until you get to the first town I'd say, an unequipped character is exceptionally weak, and easy becomes really easy as soon as you start getting gear.\nNormal is still fine for a small challenge later on, though you'll probably be equipped and confident enough to win every fight.\nThere's also a few more things worth noting, this IS a ported game (at least feels very much like it) and IS made for 2 player co-op (I'm not sure if you can do 3 players or more, I haven't tested it.) Playing anything but easy or normal on singleplayer is like asking for someone to make you mad because honestly, the AI is the worst I've ever seen in any game, the way it attacks and positions makes no sense at all, it feels like it just spams random buttons in hopes of doing something useful. They also try to revive you instantly even if it's dangerous, so don't play this alone, you'll regret it.\nSo please, do not buy this game for a fun solo rpg game, because this is a co-op/multiplayer rpg, not a solo one.\nYES, you CAN respec in case you ruin something or want to change skills, but this requires the DLC and it isn't needed at all.\nAt max level you'll have 3-4 talents untouched and 2-3 ability upgrades untouched and from my experience there's always at least two abilities you don't want to level, because others are much better to use.\nWhile we're already on abilities, the game introduces \"Mastery\" for abilities, which is based off of times used rather than time used or damage dealt with abilities, so keep that in mind when going for that.\nWhen travelling in the game there's a few things that are nice to know.\nFirstly, the screen is capped in the area the players are currently in on any given map, P1 counts as a host in a signal, if P2 tries to dash away or other things, they'll be reset and teleported next to P1 exactly like AI will if they get too far away from the host.\nThis also means that both players have to co-operate when going places, or else one of the players have to let the other run around freely. This can be done by having either P1 or P2 open up any menu (c, x, f -- etc, though not escape menu) which will force the player into AI mode, It's best to have the player return to moving their character around before combat as the AI sometimes will force the player to stay locked out of their character because they're either using a skill, following a pattern of commands or a third thing that makes no sense at all. This can make it seem like you're unable to control your character at all, which technically is the case, but the AI has registered that you want to go back to control so it won't force you out completely. It will most likely stop attacking soon enough and you can help this by spamming the evade key just keep in mind that it won't always help and you can be stuck unable to control your character for a bit, so please try to have everyone out of menus before combat for your own sake. It helps a lot.\nP1 is also the ONLY person that can interact with people and quest items/objects and NPCs. I can't tell you why they decided to do it like this, but that's how it is. P2 (and others) CANNOT progress quests, interact with quest objects (unless they just have to pick it up for pull a lever) or talk to NPCs.\n\nHere's a final thing for playing multiplayer as well. Your mic is automatically turned on and you cannot disable it in-game for some reason. If you don't want it to be like this, change your mic settings under steam settings -> voice, add push to talk or change the mic to something that doesn't work.\nI believe I have mentioned anything worth mentioning in this game, and I'll answer any question needed in the comments.\nBesides everything I have adressed, I love the game.\nI love playing the game despite getting mad at sudden barrage of projectiles 1-shotting me on Hard, or other things.\nThe story is average to good, you don't really have any big options in the game, but picking the right thing to talk about at the right time earns you small bonuses. \"Deeds\" give you\nstat bonuses and some you get from talking, others you get from really exploring and checking out everything you can. Exploring pays off in terms of items and deeds, rushing the game lets you farm achievements I suppose, but why would you do that in an RPG?\nThe gameplay pays off tacticians on Hard, and lets people playing on Easy mess around and have fun, there's a fine balance from Easy to Normal, though Hard is a thing for itself.\nThe graphics are also where they should be I feel, they don't seem old nor super high-tech, I may be biased as I prefer it when games look like how Dungeon Siege 3 does, but I wouldn't say the graphics are bad at, they suit a game from it's year.\nIf you like the first 3-5 hours of the game I would buy the DLC if you have the chance, the DLC adds 5 hours of gameplay I'd say, if not more, and gives you just a little bit more to do in the game.", "hours": 35.8, "username": "\u018a\u0129wa\u00ee\u00eene \ud83d\udc95", "products": 493, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "39160", "page": 11, "page_order": 0, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-04-01", "text": "I bought Dungeon Siege III with its DLC and the prior two DS games for $10 about five years ago.  I gave it a little bit of a start back then but decided to just sit down and finish it this time.  A little more than 24 hours later and I finished both the game and its DLC.  I played as Anjali and maxed out Influence with Lucas and got halfway there with Katarina, and barely used Reinhart.  I used an Xbox 360 controller for the whole game, playing in Fire Form and shooting people from afar and using her area-of-effect abilities when crowded.  I'll explain that in a bit.\nFirst, yes, Dungeon Siege III isn't really a good Dungeon Siege game.  To me, DS games were about fielding a rather large array of characters and playing Diablo with them, as opposed to the \"player and AI helper and summons\" that's been the norm since at least Diablo II.  Everyone had personality!  And instead of hitting an arbitrary experience level and being given points to allocate, you had a 'gain by doing' system typical of some MMOs.  If you swing a melee weapon a bunch, you'd gain ranks in the Melee class; if you used Combat Magic, you'd gain in Combat Magic.  It did things kinda differently even though its goal of being a \"Diablo killer\" didn't quite take.  So is Dungeon Siege III a bad game?  No.  It's just not really good as far as DS games of past, at least in terms of gameplay.  It's pretty different.\nThings are pretty bad for the 10th Legion in Ehb.  Supposedly they murdered the king three decades ago and some fanatic from the church is hell-bent on killing every single Legionnaire, going as far as turning pretty much the entire country against them.  How lucky that you're one of the last few descendants of the Legion.  Join with your old friend Odo at the old Montbarron Estate and plot a counterattack!  I'm sure nothing bad will happen before you get there...\nDungeon Siege III is an action RPG like previous entries in the series, but combat is a bit different and there's an even bigger focus on story than even DS2.  Instead of creating a character from scratch, you instead have your pick between the sword-and-board knight Lucas, the spear and fireballs archon Anjali, the handguns and rifle Katarina, and the magic and more magic Reinhart.  The story changes slightly based on who you pick, and you're able to meet the other three characters as you play and have them join you.  DS3's 'gimmick' with combat revolves around the two stances.  One stance is designed to deal with multiple targets close-by, like when you get mob rushed.  The other is meant to handle single targets and for everyone but Lucas, you're able to attack at a great range with this.  The idea is to swap modes as combat progresses but I didn't really do that.  I can't remember any situation where you explicitly needed a ranged attack, so it's largely down to the stance's attacks and how comfortable you are with using them.\nWhen you level up, you slowly unlock additional attacks for your two offensive stances and enable options for your third defensive stance.  Each stance has three attacks and there are three options for defense, so you have nine total moves for each character.  Each move can then be enhanced five times each from a pool of two mods--for example, one of Anjali's Fire Form special attacks creates a burning field under her.  Your choice of enhancements are to simply boost the damage output of the attack or have it slowly heal any allies standing in its area of effect.  You are able to mix the effects, but you're limited to a max of five no matter what.  And you're also given points to provide unique passive boosts to your character, such as a percent chance to start regenerating health when damaged, a greater chance to crit a target at full health, or to simply boost one stat.  Though you cannot take control of your allies, you can still equip them and allocate skill points and so on as if you could, so there's still some customizing potential.  The Treasures of the Sun DLC adds the ability to completely respec your characters for 20,000 gold each--a little pricey but it's the only way to undo mistakes you've made in your build during the game.\nDS3 has completely done away with potions.  Small orbs drop from containers or enemies during combat--green ones restore health, blue ones restore Focus, and purple ones with yellow outlines restore Power.  Focus takes the place of traditional MP in this game.  You only ever have a max of 100 of it, and every special attack drains a set amount of it.  It's restored by using your regular attack on enemies.  Power is used to fuel your defensive stance's moves as well as the 'empowered' versions of every move, and that's restored by using your special attacks on enemies or taking damage.  Empowered basic attacks generally deal more damage or hit a wider area, but empowered special attacks have effects like much more damage, a wider range, or being able to affect your ally as well as yourself.  Empowered basic attacks are enabled as soon as you get the first Power orb, but getting it for special attacks requires you to use them quite a bit during your journey. The game at least lists the empowered benefit even before you purchase the special attack for use, so that's very handy.\nThere's still randomly-enchanted gear to find like in any ARPG.  You have a pretty spacious inventory of I think a bit over 80 slots, but it can fill up especially if you forget to dump your trash at the local merchant.  You can Transmute unwanted gear to get a fraction of its value in gold immediately and with the DLC, you can break down some gear to get reagents to apply to other gear with Enchantment, but I never really made use of it.  Everyone has eight equipment slots and navigating it wasn't too bad with a controller.  Each slot is a category and only the relevant gear shows up.  You're given a window where what you have on is compared to what you have selected along with green and red arrows showing the changes in stats.  Takes out some of the guesswork when you've figured out how to read it at least.  This is the first game like this in a long time if ever where NPCs sold unique-class equipment.  They still drop, but it didn't feel like it was at random.  There's no player stash so holding onto them isn't really useful.  They kept the \"pick up everything nearby\" button from the first two games though!  So looting won't be tedious at all.\nOne problem I had with the game was that it took me a good while to really get into it.  I don't know how much of it was \"ugh this isn't Dungeon Siege of old\" wearing off, but it did finally endear itself to me.  It's too bad that point was roughly past halfway, though.  I didn't do multiplayer but it has a pretty weird setup.  You join someone's game and you play as one of their characters...and you take nothing back with you.  Anything that drops stays with the host.  You don't even get experience points or progress through the story.  I didn't like the lack of fast-travel options.  No Town Portal, no warping between save points, just you and having to hoof it at a plodding max speed.  And...there's no way to save anywhere like the prior games.  There are several save points, but I ran into \"you cannot save until combat has ended\" more than a few times, even if enemies weren't in the immediate area.  Pretty annoying.\nOverall, Dungeon Siege III isn't a bad action RPG.  It's likely not going to be fondly remembered and some would argue it was what killed the franchise, if it'll be remembered at all.  To me, it didn't really do anything terribly unique, nothing that was memorable other than having a lot of polish, especially for an Obsidian game.  I had maybe two bugs and zero crashes the entire game, and that's pretty notable.  But yeah.  It's not bad, just not a good Dungeon Siege.", "hours": 25.4, "username": "DF", "products": 1026, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

It has different controls, is set forth in time and you are presented with more modern battles, guns and cannons. People complained about DS2 saving game, now you are presented with more save slots but on certain check points.\nSince beginning, it seems like very easy game, most attacks can be dodged and enemies do not kill you with one hit even on Hardest difficulty. Suddenly, after few hours in, you meet your first real opponent, you get to meet boss. If you thought it is going to be running through paradise with nice graphics and boring storytelling, you are WRONG. First boss makes you use your brain and tactics in practice. Basically, whole game spawns you with weak to moderate minions at which you will practice your skills, untill late game where these minions become strong as their numbers grow. The hardest part of game are boss fights, there are plenty and interestingly different from each other.\nI can not forget to mention mini-bosses, Lore if you like reading stories, nice outfits which affect your stats. Forget everything about stats from previous titles. This time you are not earning points towards some skill, for example mellee or ranged or magical but you get 9 powers, 3 superpowers (only DLC), you add points towards them which add bonuses, so 1 power has 2 options for bonuses which can be maxed out with 5 points. By the end of game, you will have unlocked all 9 powers but can add maxed out bonuses only to half of them.\nThe big issue is a camera which is moving by A/D by default which can be edited and you are presented with close to action sight and a little further sight which is not far enough and close camera is also not close enough. If you want to see your character upclose, you can do it in conversations but mostly they are turned by back to you. But seeing your character upclose is possible by moving towards the wall and looking from above wall. Not being able to see far across the field may be frustrating sometimes but brings you a little surprise and is not overally destroying the experience, it just needs a little getting used to it and adjusting your controls (not me).\nMost of time I was not reading Lore, but enjoyed talking to characters, sometimes simple, but mostly you have options which will affect the outcome, sometimes slightly, in main quests will change your fate in end cutscene, and you certainly want to ask everything possible so you do not jump up on some tough boss without proper preparation. Before every boss fight and even without that reason, you have check point to save your game or game automatically saves, so you can go back and make yourself better, change companion or whatever.\nLast important thing that is not similar to previous titles, you only control one character at once and can have one active companion so you can fight with two heroes at once. Game offers you with 4 heroes total to choose from. There is not gender customization, you just take already prepared character with some predispositions and history. So your main characters are mellee fighter Lucas, combat magician Anjali, support magician Reinhart, ranged Katarina.\nKnow that healing is mandatory, if you fall your companion revives you, but can be interrupted by enemy attacks. There is no thing as automatic health regeneration but skill that heals you by few points per second. Your mana is called Focus and is fueling your skills and strong attacks. Later you are presented with orbs which will accumulate by attacks and can be used in DLC for super powers which are very effective in late game.\nWhich character to choose? What is difference?\nLucas has most armor, is overally useful in mid-game and gets overpowered equipment in DLC.\nAnjali is good healer for early-game but does not have too much armor, can summon Fire Jackal.\nReinhart is strong support and good in late-game, moderate armor. Strong against bosses.\nKatarina is almost naked so no armor, summons Black Hound. Her strength is her fire gun.\nYou can gain influence over your companions while you make a good decision. This influence will create some boosts. There are more boosts to aquire by simply achieving main quests and making right decisions. Side quests make nice addition to game, but often you will have to go back on the map and return for reward since you already managed to travel across quiet some space.\nIn mid-game you have teleports available but forget those in previous titles. Again, you have original Causeways which only permit you to go to your previous important locations (hideouts and entrances to some dungeons) and are very few, and mostly you will use these for main quest purpose. It does not make your game easier for moving around world. It just tries to get you on vibe this game is fantasy and relates to the old titles which are in fact different.\nI must not forget your inventory is limited so selling some of your stuff is useful, not only at the beginning when you try to raise some funds for getting better gear which is in fact not so good from the drops. But as you proceed in game, you will have better equipment and variety in goods and more sellers. I achieved 300k gold by the end of game which I could not use other way better than empowering my ring with special orbs (only for DLC) which made my game easy.\nIn fact, I would seriously struggle without DLC, the Hardest difficulty is a real challange and read reviews of people who struggled on Casual difficulty, so think of your patience first. If you already read all my review, you will be able to withstand the Hardest challenge available. This game is awesome and first impression of it being different, what a surprise, will it get better? changed to this game is awesome and addicitve.\nDLC is worth too much. I became overpowered after finishing the storyline of DLC. I got some overpowered equipment for Lucas as he was my companion. To that, got nice superpowers. And story of DLC and world around is nice, you also get to see your characters up close as game itself never shows them to you in the face, rather just from back. It is challenging as well, untill you discover the last superpower which makes you so absolutely strong against main game bosses that it feels almost like cheating.", "hours": 42.5, "user_id": "76561198140435102", "username": "savvym", "products": 368, "early_access": false}

NOW that I am re-experiencing the series again, I think this MAY be my least favorite, it could be the wonky controls as far as keyboard goes, or how the camera seems to move around you if you walk with either mouse or keys, and the combat is probably the worst combat I have ever played with in any game ever, honestly it feels WORSE than a mobile port, at least you feel like you have a sense of control in mobile rpg's, this is just wrong. The blocking mechanics alongside the attack buttons seem like the game wanted to have such a huge  emphasis on the next attack position, that it dissociates itself from having smooth combat overall.\nThe story is also pretty meh SO FAR, and the characters to choose from look alright, I picked a mage, which has a voice actor that doesn't fit his look in 15 years.

However, the sequels failed to recapture the charm, and sadly DS3 is just more of the same, by adding complexity instead of fun, and even \"casual\" mode ended up being way too difficult for someone who finished DS1 w/o any cheating.\nMost RPGs utilize a skill tree, and as you level up you allocate skill points toward different skills and you can see the . DS3 however, went for a different sort... There's \"ability\", \"skill\"  (which can become \"empowered\" if you use it enough), and talent, which interacts in a complicated way that you're never quite sure which way to level up, as there are so many different choices, but not in a proper tree form so you can understand it. As you unlock more abilities, skills, and talents, you are given vague hints on what they do, but not the specific effects on your character's stats, like to-hit, or damage.\nFurthermore, the skills vs. empowered skill deployment is messy to use, as the game moves like an action RPG, but using the skills and the way they recharge is far closer to a phased combat RPG. Deploying the empowered skills is more on chance than actual proper timing.\nThe game soon gave you a companion and now you have TWICE as much skills, abilities, and talents to play with. Which brings to point yet ANOTHER problem... INCONVENIENT interface. Instead of something like shoulder button to swap characters or hot keys, only one character was displayed at a time, and you're prompted to press ENTER to swap characters. Who the heck designed this UI?  DS1 had a much better interface, sheesh.  This interface feels like it's trying to cater to low-res screens but failed horribly in being efficient.\nCombat is generally not a problem, but instead of just fighting (attack, attack, attack), you now have ability to dodge, block, and even one-handed vs. two-handed stance (and instant switching)  Slash/shoot then roll away is almost required unless you have good sweep moves. Fighters can use two-handed stance to sweep an arc, and shooters have shotguns (which we'll explain later).  Magic users can use circle or fire and such, but again, this is just adding complexity, not fun. Original DS has two \"loadouts\" per character, like ranged vs. melee, or close vs. far. DS3 again, decided to use a list interface rather than the standard RPG \"doll cloths\" interface where you fit items onto the character. This screen was separate from the stats screen so you can't see how much improvement the weapon does. The only \"comparison\" you see was how this item compares with the item the character was currently equipped with.\nAt about the 1/3 point, when you're about to take back the town, you and your companion took out most of the mercs and was attacking the town hall, and you end up fighting this girl who's related to the archon. The problem is you need to defeat her TWICE, and even on Casual difficult I get killed multiple times. The boss sets out magical landmines that takes away 1/5 of your health per hit, and your heal skill only restores like 7-8 points (out of 350!) per second. You die in about 2 hits, and since the traps are all over the place, even your archon companion gets hit and falls. As you need to stop to revive her, you die as well. This is just ridiculous, as there's just too many things to do... dodge, run, back in and attack, get out and not get hit, heal up, get back in... Repeat...\nAfter almost an hour trying to get past this one big fight, where my archon made absolutely NO damage to the UBG, I quit.", "hours": 5.8, "username": "kschang77", "products": 1056, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

I pulled up the review box immediately.\nGuys and gals... I really like this game.\nWhen I first saw it being paraded about, advertised, I came under the impression that it was a fantasy-action romp through a rich setting. I saw that it had unique characters. I concluded it had nice voice acting. My impressions were correct.\nWhile I grew up beside Baldur's gate, Neverwinter Nights, Vampire the Masquerade, and manymanymore CRPGs, I never actually got around to playing Chris Avellone's epic: Dungeon Siege. Over time it became dated, and somehow thrown into my own personal category of \"just another old fantasy title\" (Like The Summoner. Man, that needs a remake).\nI bring up my gaming heritage to illustrate that I love Oldschool roleplaying. I probably would have liked Dungeon Siege. but I never played it. I walked into Dungeon Siege i-i-i without any expectations except for those listed above.\nThus, for the sake of the other (negative) reviewers let me say: If I was expecting a fantasy epic stat crunching party based spacebar-to-pause open world fantasy, I too would have been a sore child. These things DS iii is not. So, let me tell you what it is.\nHopeful. Noble. And well meaning.\nIt is an important piece of story in the world of Ehb. You can tell because your choices are explained to you in the end. I love it when they do that, and I haven't gotten such a kick out of it since Arcanum (don't get me started on Arcanum, I'll start drooling).\nThis was written carefully. Characters have personality and charm (even if that personality is merely \"flirty russian\"). They say things that matter. A lot of work was put into their comments and role in the game. They aren't just a sandbox of people you can choose from the beginning, or just meet along the way. These characters are part of the tale. Some more than others. Their models are well designed, from the somewhat pudgy Reinhart, to the seductive Katarina. Their voice acting is mostly excellent (I'm looking at you Anjala, that synthesizer seems to throw off your tone).\nThere are a finite number of side-quests, and low and behold a lot of them impact the story in small and meaningful ways. The continuity was surprising.\nSurprising.\nIn a game set in a rich and lore filled world, and one that has a legacy to live up to, I must mention the abominable level design. It's a corridor. This broadens slighly in the later levels, but my first piece of advice to any new player would be to turn off the mini-map. You don't need it (unless you get turned around), and it will just depress you. Ignore the map and take in the sights. There are nice sights in this game.\nThe graphics are well designed. The engine was meant to eliminate load times by loading the next area as you play (this and the fact it came out for last-gen consoles might explain the linearity), but still manages to put a nice glowy sheen on everything. Mud looks sumptuous, water ripples, and sewer bricks glisten. Attacks carry graphical weight, and hits are punctuated nicely. There's lots of flair here. I especially love the teleport animations for Reinhart, the wizard.\nIf you've never seen them let me give you my next piece of advice, new player: Play this game on Hardcore.\nHardcore, because combat is really good when you need to dodge. Actually, nerf that. Combat is good ALL the time. Animations are smooth, and attacks are flashy. Until you clear an area, enemies tend to respawn, but there is really no need to grind. Once you start getting your groove into that leveling system you will tear them a new one all whilst proceeding forward gracefully.\nOnce you finish an act, much of the villainy is narrated away, so you can wander about once more with a minimum of fuss, should you desire. You really shouldn't. There is no point in returning to old areas unless you collect Unique weapons.\nIn the realm of combat are the epic, epic boss fights. No, not just any joe-shmoe \"leader\" of a group with a health bar, I'm talking the real bosses.  You'll know one when you meet one. There will be a sort of arena that appears, a flash of special effect, and you'll get stomped.\nIt's glorious.\nThese bosses shake up the fighting with excellent special moves and themes. I wish the same care had been taken for the usual enemies.\nI've digressed from my original points. Hopeful. Noble. Well meaning.\nThe real draw here is the story. A story that continues the CRPG tradition of interaction. The gameplay is fun and arcady, the mechanics are fine, but suddenly you'll be placed with a true conundrum on your hands. A narrative imperative! And the succulent tones of the narrator (Odo) will accompany whatever you choose.\nYou reap the consequences in a tightly focused tale about rising from the ashes. Getting back up again. Repentance. That golden second chance.\nIt is noble, and great, and fun. I recommend it for the $15-20 pricepoint, or lower (as it often goes on sale).\nSo...:\nGrab a controller,\nTurn off that mini-map,\nturn that baby up to hardcore,\ngive it whirl.", "hours": 28.0, "user_id": "76561197980160718", "username": "Tobwa", "products": 322, "early_access": false}

I paid $3.00 for it. So, it was very, very cheap. I guess I should get the DLC as well at some point, considering it's a lot more favourably viewed.\nAt any rate, I've done Dungeon Siege III a great disservice, by not actually sitting down and trying it out. Having burned out on Dragon Age, and not really looking forward to opening up anything \"heavy\", I decided to run DS3 for a bit, just so I can uninstall it with a clear conscience.\nNow, I've played the previous games in the series, though it has been a very long time. I remember the slow build-up of the first game, as I went from being a farmer to taking on a Dragon. I remember enjoying how I could customize my character's fighting style, and I remember that there were mules to carry all of my loot (something that Torchlight stole and then improved). I also remembered the second game, which I'd always start, but couldn't play through because I'd get frustrated with the characters. So, I have mixed memories of the games, having enjoyed them, but not enough to get them onto my top-ten.\nDungeon Siege III is more like its immediate predecessor than the first game in that you're restricted to 4 specific characters (whose skills you can modify). The other characters then later join you as computer-controlled companions (with whom you can raise your influence, and equip with items). I will mention that Anjali seems to be very OP compared to the others. I'd started playing with Lucas, but even as a companion, Anjali is outstripping me (which is rather embarrassing).\nThe graphics are pretty good. It won't break records, but it looks good while still running very smoothly. The animations are great, the ambient effects are very nice. Faces aren't the best, but there are very few games that can get those right. But it looks good while playing, and that's what matters to me.\nVoice-acting is uneven. It sounds a bit like those audio-books you buy for kids, with a small cast of people narrating the story and doing the voices. Some are better than others, but it's not at the level of, say, Dragon Age, or Neverwinter Nights 2. It's very... pedestrian.\nBut I enjoyed the gameplay, and that's what this is about. I lost patience with Torchlight when it came out, and Diablo never appealed to me. But Dungeon Siege III is far more to my taste. I would recommend that you look into changing the key mappings once you start because the default control scheme doesn't gel with how I like my layout. And I much preferred moving my character using the WASD buttons rather than the mouse.\nThe camera is mostly okay. It sometimes swings way too close if I'm bumping a wall (which can happen in the tight corridors of the game), but it doesn't happen all that often, and it's bearable.\nI will note that just like the previous games, Dungeon Siege III is very linear. There aren't a lot of open areas (except for boss arenas), and there aren't any \"procedurally generated\" maps. There's a very definite direction you're supposed to trek in. In RPG terms, you're being railroaded. But the combat is fun enough to overlook it, and I'm really looking forward to finishing this at least once (and we'll see how I feel about trying the other characters once I do).", "hours": 14.9, "username": "painedforever", "products": 154, "early_access": false}

The visuals look okay for their age, but that's about it. You know the ages old control mechanics that pretty much every ARPG used since the original Diablo? You know, left click to move (or attack if you click on an enemy, or pick up loot) and right click to unleash your primary ability. Convienient and simple. This game wanted to reinvent the wheel though. Left click attacks, even if there's absolutely nothing to attack. The attack animation is sluggish and cannot be interupted. To move around you either have to use WASD (clunky as all hell) or hold down the right mouse button contionously. There's no click-to-move. In addition the camera is as reliable and fast as a a drunken mule. Oh, and picking up stuff? No, you can't just click on them you silly sausage, no, you have to stand next to the item and press E. Because a context sensitive cursor is way too complicated to program apperently.\nA lot of these ARPGs have a checkpoint system where the game automatically saves.

{"product_id": "39160", "page": 12, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-02-23", "text": "Dungeon Siege III is not without flaws, but it is a very underrated game that deserves more respect than it receives. If you are a fan of the first Dungeon Siege games then you may be understandably disappointed to find that this game deviates from the typical diablo-clone formula and instead takes on a more traditional action RPG style. If you treat this game as a traditional action RPG then your expectations will be more in line with what you will get and you'll probably have a more favorable opinion of it. If, on the other hand, you are expecting another diablo-clone then I'd advise steering clear of this, but do keep in mind that this game respects the lore of the original Dungeon Siege games, even if it doesn't respect their style. If you are a diehard Dungeon Siege fan and love the lore and story then maybe you should give this game a chance even if you don't care for the gameplay. If so, I'd advise playing it on the lowest difficulty, as it can be quite challenging if you're not prepared to give it your best.\nI also strongly recommend playing with a controller, no matter which difficulty level you choose. It does take some time to get the hang of things, but there is a built-in help system that most people seem to just ignore, that explains everything in great detail. You'll see all sorts of weird stats like Retribution, Doom, Momentum, Staggering, etc. which you'd do well to learn. These stats also give you lots of different ways of customizing your character towards certain strengths. There's also an enchanting mechanic where you use \"essences\" you collect from defeated enemies and you can put these on your items to boost them in certain ways. You can also do the same with the gear of your companions, which you do not control directly, but in my opinion this was a welcome improvement over the earlier Dungeon Siege games as this means there is less micro-managing and you can just focus on controlling your own character. I also thought it was an improvement that enemy swarms are a lot smaller, and more of a focus on boss fights which can be very epic and fun. There is a co-op mode which many people say doesn't work very well and I haven't tried it myself, but the option is there in any case.\nThe worst thing I could really say is the controls can be a bit uncooperative. For example, you might need to execute a certain move in a hurry, but if your character is moving the game won't recognize it and you have to make sure your character comes to a complete stop and then try it again before it works. I've died countless times because of that and that's the worst thing about this game in my opinion. A game being challenging is perfectly fine, but the challenge should never be as a result of clunky controls.\nI found the story very well written, and you are presented with multiple branching paths in the dialogue and how you interact with other characters. For example, you can choose to spare a defeated foe's life, or execute them. The choices you make will have consequences later on, for better or worse. Your companions also have an opinion of you based on what you say and your actions, which makes them feel like real characters and not just soulless automatons. This may be a very minor point to most people, and a lot of people probably didn't even see this at all since they got frustrated at how the game wasn't like the first Dungeon Siege games and quit, but to me it is very important, and I took note of it.\nAnyway, to summarize, no, this game is not perfect by any means, but in my opinion the positives outweigh the negatives. I got nearly 40 hours of gameplay out of a single playthrough (including the DLC), and more importantly it was time I enjoyed. There are lots of games that have maybe only 1/10th the content that this game does, but have far better reviews. I ask you, where is the justice in that?", "hours": 39.5, "user_id": "76561198137656231", "username": "Logical Phallusy", "products": 4979, "early_access": false}

Its clear this was envisioned from the start to be nothing like a proper Dungeon Siege game. On its own its perfectly respectable... for a console game. For the type of game it is, it does well enough. My problem with this game has nothing to do with the combat or loot or even the screen sharing issues though. It the fact it tried to sell itself off as another Dungeon Siege game when it makes no effort to even try to capture what made the previous two games so great. Under another title it wouldnt have had the fan following behind it but it also wouldnt have created such a contraversy. The Dungeon Siege lore was turned into a joke. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say the main plot revolves around a religious nutcase being the badguy and doing all kind of things but with a selfrightious justification like all badguy religious nutcases are prone to have. I dislike the story. I dislike the visual representations. The only thing I actually like about this game is the Heroes' Crypt. Its where the heroes of the Dungeon Siege 1, the main character and all your companions you gain throughtout the game, were laid to rest. Its a beautiful nod to the first game but unfortunately the only good one.\nThis review was a long time coming. I hate this game for everything it should have been but isnt. I hate Square Enix and Obsidian for effectively killing my favorite series and I dont believe I will ever forgive them for it. If you are new to the series you probably wont mind the change.

It's ridiculously, mind-numbingly linear and boring. You can \"level up to make your character unique\" but that's lies, you get exactly the same abilities and \"level up\" to create uniqueness is basically small % tweaks to your tiny handful of standard abilities.\nFurthermore, while having decent quality voice acting, it feels like they didn't care and weren't working together, like all the actors were reading their lines in a vacuum with no direction or understanding of the story or the game's tone. That alone kills the voices for me and breaks immersion, which due to the massive flaws of gameplay would be one of the only ways this game could hold my attention.\n*Sigh* Again the failure at multiplayer made me frustrated, since the main reason I got this game was to play with partners over LAN, but it's frustrating and unweildy at best, a sloppy alpha-quality afterthought at worst.\nFinally the gameplay. Not only is DS III slower/clunkier than other games of this type, but it's also hard in frustrating ways, not \"good\" ways. There's no learning curve, no in-game clues to learn from, and certainly nothing to be gained by \"being explorative\" and leveling up and finding hidden things before mind-numbingly boring and way-too-challenging boss fights. FYI devs, making you do the same really hard thing over and over again for 10-20 minutes just to chip away at a boss's healthbar that's 800-1000% too large is NOT the kind of challenging players want to go up against.\nI give this game a D plus, maybe a C minus overall.

Partially with good reason as it is NOTHING like the previous titles in the Dungeon Siege franchise. While the game is still a hack and slash at it's heart, there's nowhere near the amount of loot and customization typically associated with games of that nature. That doesn't mean there isn't a great game to be played here, just maybe not the one you expect.\nInstead of creating a custom character at the start of your adventure you are given a choice of four different characters. Each has a completely different ability set than the other and a somewhat different adventure in terms of who you meet and when. I've played as all four and with the exception of one they are all a blast to play. I highly recommend trying out all of them whether it be in another play through (you are required to complete certain tasks, like getting to level 20, as each character) or in multiplayer. The game was made by Obsidian as well so the writing for all the characters is very solid and voice acting is pretty good.\nWhen it comes to combat this game doesn't disappoint. It DOES, however, almost completely require a controller. You would think playing with a KB&M would fit a Dungeon Siege game but unfortunately, it doesn't. If you have a controller though, you're in for some great hack and slash combat with a fair amount of strategy (especially on the hardest difficulty).\nVisually and audibly this game is pretty darn good. The music, while nothing special, fits the game enough. You won't be humming any of the tunes, but you won't be cursing the game for repetition. On the visual side, this game looks great for an isometric title. Even during cut scenes (where you see your model up close) there is a great amount of detail present and numerous visual effects that add to the level of immersion. The voice acting does Obsidian's script justice as well.\nLast but not least, I have to mention  multiplayer. I played through the entire game about two times in multiplayer sessions and it is a BLAST if you have people who know how to use each character. It's almost necessary for the highest difficulty in the game to played with other people if you want to stand a chance. While the game can be enjoyed fine solo, it's at it's best in multiplayer sessions. Each player takes a different role and strategy really starts to come into play.\nOverall I highly recommend Dungeon Siege III assuming you have a controller. If you have a KB&M I honestly can't recommend it as it is a pain to play that way. If, however, you have a controller and some friends to join you you are in for a treat.\n8/10", "hours": 63.0, "username": "Vagabond251", "products": 190, "early_access": false}

Of course I miss using multiple party members but the AI is not that bad, my biggest problem is with the online co-op: the camera is BAD and the game doesn't allow all players to have a character, you have the host's game and everyone else is a guest using the stats/equips of the characters in it.\nStory: The plot isn't winning any awards, and there are less characters and worldbuilding than in the previous DS's. The narrator isn't bad but most of the story feels like it's trying to be more epic than it is.

But I can't find a mass of positve aspects. The problem is, that \"DS I & II\" are different... In a better way. \"Dungeon Siege III\" offers:\n- flat characters (sad biographies)\n- only 4 characters available\n- no \"own\" hero\n- horrible inventory\n- the story is mehh.. 08/15\n- \"too\" easy? (also on \"legendary\")\n- poopy endboss\n- dead multiplayer (with terrible camera)\n- it's pretty linear (no open-world, only elements)\n- bad level-design... similar to a long hallway\n- NPC's are too powerful...\n- ...often they aren't recognised by the enemies\n- it's NO Dungeon Siege!\nYeah... as you can see, it is not my game. Even if I played over 40 hours. But trust me, one big problem is, that I loved \"DS I & II\" but \"DS III\" is in comparison with those just... poop. You were able to play with more than just 2 guys in your group; it was open-world; the classic-inventory was there; you had your \"own\" hero, with your individual hair, skin, face and name! And not \"Lucas\" some kind of a knight... like this 2011-decal.\nI have nothing against a game franchise trying out different styles so long as it's good or enjoyable. I also asked other friends, who like RPG's (and didn't knew the \"Dungeon Siege\"-series) and they were also not impressed or interested in playin'.\nMaybe my review is so bad because I was guided by the other two parts, but let me tell you, that other RPG-games are more fun. So if you still decide to buy the \"Dungeon Siege\"-series, play \"DS III\" first - it has nothing to do with the other parts and you won't be disappointed.\nIf you also don't care for graphics, the other two parts are a good variety.\n- you are a solid game but can't keep up with your \"older siblings\".

{"product_id": "39160", "page": 27, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2016-02-10", "text": "I honestly don't understand the hate for this game. Honestly, I don't. This is going to be one of those short-ish reviews because, and I am sincere when I say this, there isn't a ton to say about this game that would be unique. I'm mostly going to focus on the actual in-game mechanics and aspects. I didn't play Multiplayer because, well, there is no one to play with. AFAIK, multiplayer is client-side, so you join other people's games and play as their characters and the dialogue system works in that you choose different choices and thus' you can agree/disagree with each other on what to do. It's like a voting system, I think.\nMusic : It's got some amazingly atmospheric and fitting music, as well as high quality. That's all I can say without spluring my opinionated juices all over it. You want calm forest music with birds chipping and(at least, what I heard) crickets cricketing? Well,\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you got it. You want a creepy humming sound when in an abandoned haunted house? You got it! You want a mix of both when in the mines of a now-extinct race? Sure! For reference, go look up Stonebridge City's music. It's a perfect representation of music that fits and makes you feel \"into it\".\nStory : The game isn't really that short, according to my 22.2 hrs on record which is the fully utilized time in-game, including the DLC. So, the story itself, you ask? It was... Eh? Mediocre? Alright? Without spoiling anything, it's about the remnants of an ancient sect of an army of a long-destroyed  empire trying to fight back against a church-crazy angelic messenger. That's only the slight shortening of it. All-in-all, the story drags on a bit both because you move slowly and because it's kind of easy ot understand straight away.\nGameplay : Okay, this is where it gets kind of long and slightly \"That's just, like, your opinion, man!\" so a lot of people might disagree. I'd say that the combat / gameplay is basically Torchlight 1 / 2 but way faster-paced and with no delay between \"turns\" aka you constantly attack and have to be aware of your enemies. It's similar to Lord of the Rings : War in the North in that way. You can dodge, and it actually matters whether not you dodge, too. Especially with bullets and arrows which both move differently (bullets in a straight line, and arrows arch meaning you won't get hit if you continuously move albeit you sacrifice attacking back) as well as melee enemies. E.g. Certain enemies that lunge / jumpa at you and are unavoidable unless you dodge out of the way. Now, the thing with the dodging is that it *literally* gives you invincibility frames for the time of your dodging, meaning you can go straight through a magical missile attack (the most common champion/boss attack, to be honest) and be hurt for no damage. This makes blocking irrelevant aka USELESS, which is why using equipment that puts up block is, well, a waste of equipment.\nGraphics : This is obligatory by today's standards but, well, here it goes. It's got pretty good graphics for how well it runs on my computer, and my computer is\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 I had to run it on normal settings and it still looked amazing. Of course, the female models have your generic sexualized-esque shapely figures but I'm not one to complain. Katarina's clothing is generally stockings and corsets/loosely fitting blouses, so take that as you will. Lucas, the main tank-knight character is the ONLY person I don't like because he looks odd. It's like the default mass effect Shepard models odd. It just looks very badly done. If you're expecting a lot out of the graphics, it's no crisis or suped-up Bethesda game graphics. Don't expect a lot.\nCompanion System : I made this its own individual section because, honestly, talking about companion systems is important. Video game developers NEED to flesh them out if they're going to do them correctly, romance or no romance(which this game is the latter). The companion system works similar to Dragon Age Origins in that you get \"a point\" on your companion's like bar relationship bar(Sure, let's go with that!) whenever you say somethin they agree with. The, suprisingly happy, part about this is that you don't lose points if they don't agree with you, meaning that decision you make in dialogue effectively serve to ONLY give you points towards companion acceptance. However, this system itself only serves to add to a bonus-stat system within the game. The \"deeds\". Specifically, the companions each have their own \"deed\" to give to you per relationship level you get them to (1 per character, but you can only realistically get one to level 3, so choose wisely or balance it out, I'd choose one) and offers +X towards a stat e.g. +5 stamina. Oh, you thought there's more? No, that's it. That's literally it.  You can't even talk to your companions, they just occasionally jump in to say something when exploring or when they agree with you in conversations. This is something that developers need to work upon because this game could've had an amazing Dragon Age/Mass Effect companion system. Anjali specifically as she's amazing idea for a character and whenever she jumps in on conversations, she has hints of a hot(haha I'm so punny...?) personality in the makings.\nI may be the only person to actually care enough to make a legitimate review of this game. This game has the same curse as Dragon Age 2. Don't come in expecting a carbon-copy sequel to Dungeon Siege 1/2. Go in expecting a quick-paced Action-RPG that was clearly made to be, well, new. It is a great time-killer game in its own right. It's just not the Dungeon Siege game you were looking for.

I don't like writing negative reviews but, well... Let's just say this game is FAR below my expectations.\nLet me start by saying that I have been a DIEHARD fan of the first two Dungeon Siege games. Those two games - Dungeon Siege II in particular - were a very nice, fun, and more light-hearted action RPG break away from my long-standing Diablo II obsession at that time. The first two games were pretty much Diablo clones, at least in terms of overall gameplay - point and click mechanics and the usual hack, slash, loot - wash, rinse, repeat routine, and I was very much okay with that.\nSo what's up with Dungeon Siege III? It's NOTHING like the first two games. I was so excited when I first learned that a new Dungeon Siege game was in the works, but after it was released, I read not-so-good reviews of the PC version in particular and after finally getting around to acquiring it myself to try and give it a fair shake, I was left shrugging my shoulders with a head-scratching \"huh???\"\nObsidian has essentially \"console-ized\" Dungeon Siege III. Kinda felt like a slap in the face to us longtime fans of the first two games - Dungeon Siege has always been a PC game, and the console focus of this installment made it not much fun at all. It doesn't even come close to feeling like the previous games. No more point and click mechanics, the character movement is now relegated to the usual WASD suspects on the keyboard. I figured since they \"console-ized\" this game, I'd pull out the Xbox 360 controller and try to approach it that way, maybe I'll enjoy it more, but no dice.\nI can't stand the inventory management - it really would've been nice if they could've revamped it for the PC to be more like the first two games. I'm not a fan of the overall character management/leveling system either. Again, this is NOTHING like the original Dungeon Siege games.\nThe Dungeon Siege games were never very strong on story, so I wasn't expecting much in that regard. However, I've had such a hard time enjoying this game to get anywhere nearly far enough into it to fairly judge where Obsidian went with it. But as far as I can tell, they at least stayed true to some of the base lore in the earlier games.\nI can't recommend this game. Sad as it makes me to have to badmouth a Dungeon Siege game, I just really wish they would've stuck to the tried-and-true formula. It's a shame, and I can only hope that someday, Obsidian - or any other good RPG game developer, for that matter - makes a Dungeon Siege IV that will return to the original PC-based point and click, hack n' slash approach.", "hours": 5.6, "username": "ChorusOfOne", "products": 51, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

I had happy memories of the original Dungeon Siege and Dungeon Siege II; so I was excited to play this to finish my collection as I always wanted it, but never got around to it.\n15 minutes in I was feeling sick. I mean, Dungeon Siege was always a generic fantasy setting but had a charming 1980's D&D feel. This was just so bland, and I dare say the Dungeon Siege movie was more visually inspired than this game.\nThe graphics look good at first, but the animations of the first NPC you run into is just cartoonish puppet looking and  uncanny valley at the same time.\nThe lipsync was terrible, the eyes of NPC's dead and souless. Combine this with lack luster voice acting...I just couldn't get invested.\nFirst impressions are important, and it did not impress, but I continued playing further. An hour in and I still found myself exiting the game to play something else because I was bored. I couldn't be hooked!\nHowever, the major killer of this game is the camera, damn thing is clunky when being adjusted. It also turns so fast and wildly around making you sick and is never in a tactical advantageous position.\nAlso seeing how Dragon Age Origins came out a couple years before Dungeon Siege III, I couldn't help but compare the two. The graphics, animation, gameplay, camera and interface was just lackluster compared to a simliar sword and sorcery fantasy RPG.

I got together some distant friends who were not familiar with the Dungeon Siege series, but were familiar with other RPG's or avid players and they too were unimpressed even as casual gamers.\nI later learned from a review by Ross Scott of Accursed Farms; that one of the key and unique features of Dungeon Siege, it's large party system which could include up to eight party members active at one time, was not present. Having bombastic large melee's was one of the most memorable and fun things about Dungeon Siege and it's gone.

Not sure why they made it this way, but having really liked the first 2 games, this game is a total disapointment. Graphically, the games looks nice.

True, this game is vastly different then anything before. This however isn't a good argument to give this game a bad review, I even prefer games that try out something new, even if it means completely changing the game mechanics.\nThat being said, the current game has horrendous character controls, took me forever to figure out how to interact properly in combat. Lot of combat abilities used require of you to point your mouse in the direction you want them cast. In a bigger fight, with lots of mobs and numerous particle effects I'd constantly kept losing sight of pointer and would end up casting stuff in direction where there were no mobs or only a few of them. Quite frustrating. Too many stats and too generic gear that made gearing up so frustrating and a huge waste of time.\nGame storyline, while having an interesting backbone, appears to have been written by a 12 year old. While it was interesting to revisit some of the locations from original DS, the NPCs and playable characters & companions are so bleak with robot like interactions that made each convo in the game extremely cringy. You're also given an illusion of choice through dialogue, but in reality the development of events in the game aren't affected at all. These 'choices' only affect the final cutscene after you finish the game and 'influence' you gain with your companions (give you some small passive stat boosting perk).\nNow, a few things I did like is that game went in another direction. Completely revamped, you no longer drag entire army with you, instead you duo the game with one of 3 companions you get. Each companion/playable character is unique and has vastly different abilities from the other 3. This makes for an interesting experience, trying to figure out which combo is best for your play style. Also each char has two different stances, usually one for single mob fights (boss fights usually) and one for group pulls. Game also introduces transmuting and essences, which allow you to mend your gear and add one of 5 possible stats to your gear (costs a bit, but usually worth it, especially in final act of the storyline).\nMy final score for the game would be 2.5 out of 5, though you could say I'm biased. I really loved the original DS, but the 3rd installment as a standalone game isn't an RPG at all but a quickly made hack n slash, and not a good one.", "hours": 66.9, "username": "Vedran", "products": 54, "early_access": false}

Clearly the story has been worked on: there seem to be quite a lot of content there. But it's wasted by the lack of choices. This is an action game before it's a RPG, and it shows: killing is your only argument and you'll then be given an choice from the unconditionnal surrender of your enemy (it gets too repetitive not to be ridiculus). Can't expect too much from a game in which all stats are combat related, and it is better than a completely linear story, just not by much.\nBut then again, this could still be a pretty darn good action game right? Well...\nThe camera controls are among the worst I've ever seen. If you play co-op like me, there's simply no choice: you have to install the command line and tweak them into something playable (it'll still be pretty bad, but at least it'll be playable). I also recommend the command line if you play in hardcore, because otherwise your damage output is too low and it takes forever to kill anything (it doesn't make things less challenging, just less boring).\nI had to start a new game because I started with Lucas, the melee character, and it became apparent that my damage was so low it wasn't worth hitting enemies and blocking (although it's very effective) was useless because I didn't have any 'taunt' skill.\nCombat is repetitive. I've seen this game compared to Diablo, with people not understanding how the two games are similar. Well, Diablo's combat (considered very repetitive by many) is LESS repetitive than this game's, and there's a simple reason for that: in Diablo, your character's skills make your gameplay vary, making you want to level up to get new mechanics. In comparison, DS III would actually benefit from not having levels, as very few skills introduce new mechanics. Indeed, it would have been better to put the skills on equipement, which is otherwise just a collection of numbers (there's no unique effects) added to your character's attack.\nThe simple combat mechanics of the game aren't too bad though, just don't play if you don't have a controller. There's just one attack button (with a 3 attacks loop), no combo system, a nice dodge system (by far the best part of this game, IMHO). The two stances mechanic was a good attempt at varying the gameplay, but it's ruined by the loot system: if you get a good item for one stance, the other becomes pretty much useless.\nI'm not sure the game was play tested for its gameplay, as we found ourselves with way too much money effortlessly and yet nothing to spend it on, despite having bad equipement.\nThe only bug we encountered (a door preventing the main character from going to the boss room, effectively blocking any progress until we cheated our way in) was caused by the camera tweak, so I don't have any complain there.", "hours": 16.4, "username": "Raksura", "products": 76, "early_access": false}

Sadly my enthusiasm was quickly destroyed by two things:\n1. You can't create your own character, instead there are 4 you can choose from.\n2. Those character have 2 styles each.\nNow for those who don't know what's so bad about it let me explain: In DS you could always create your main character, the companions however where pre-created obviously and your fighting-style as well as your skill were determined by your playstlye. This mean that if you continued to use a certain style your character would get better and better with it. And , at least in DS 1, the stats for that style would raise as well.\nWell in the end, after it was avaible for a few bucks, I decided to play it anyways and quite honestly was exactly what I suspected it to be if slightly worse in some aspects.\nNow first of the good things about it:\n+The combat all around seem more dynamic, while it was very possible to win with little to no movement in the first two games that would be a death ticket in this one. Some might hate it but I kind of like it even it it is sometimes kind of clumsy.\n+It looks good, well most of the time... and yes I know graphics are not everything.\n+The story CAN be interesting, or at least entertaining. Especially if you take a drink everytime someone says \"Jeyne     Kassynder\" in a dramatic fashion.\nNow it's weakpoints:\n-Those f*cking bosses, now don't get me wrong, I love a challenging boss like everyone else but if it's difficulty is purely based on it having \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ton of HP as well as respawning minions? Not so much. There are bosses where it make sense (the warbeast comes to mind) but most of the time it fells more like the developers were lazy.\n-The characters are just stupid. No really they are. Imagine this: Your antagonist, who by the way controls the entire army of the church, wants every legionaire and anyone connected with the legion dead.... what do they do? RALLY ALL SURVIVORS IN THE \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ING MANSION OF THE GRANDMASTER! Sure! It's not obvious or anything like that, not like Jeyne could have spies nearby or anything like that! The next destination after the obvious happens? THE LAST CHAPTERHOUSE! Are those guys \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665?!\nWhile I am at it: I really wish I could have told some of those guys to go screw themselves.\n-Those \"triggered\" fights, to summarize: You see an obvious foe; you attack; nothing happens. You go closer, a cutscene starts and BOOM! in the middle of an \"ambush\" or something similar. Not to bad with the melee-fighter but as a ranged one?\n-The desing on several character is just... ugh... really just uncomfortable. Old character sometimes look like albinos in their 30's and they will NEVER. STOP. MOVING. THEIR. EYES! Really ?! Look me in the eyes and not at the ceiling damn it!\n-It just didn't fell like a DS-game... instead it relied on references to older game while practically screaming that it's a DS aswell and we should notice it.\n-Square Enix\nIn the end? Is the game good? No not really but it's also not horrible either instead it's in that weird limbo where some will like it while others despise it.\nNow if this games catches your fancy, buy it but wait for a sale.

There have been games like this before, but it is nothing at all like Dungeon Siege 1 or 2.

This game was designed to bring DS to console (which was a mistake for the franchise IMO).  Controls are simplified and there is no more party tactics playstyle and very little character customization (beyond choosing your gear).  That said, if you like this type of game then give it a shot.  It's relatively well finished and mostly balanced (some issues introduced with expansion).  Not a lot of replay value and no higher difficulty reruns (like in DS2).\nThe leveling up system allows SOME customization, but at the end you unlock all of the skills.  You can customize individual abilities for special effects, but after you find the core skills for your play style and max them out, it becomes a chore to level up.\nOnly get the expansion for this if you got it in the bundle (which I don't like because it doesnt have the expansion for DS2).", "hours": 25.5, "username": "Nyick", "products": 152, "early_access": false}

You had a character that you improved by using skills...that simple. Very wide open, the possibilities for your character were endless. This one really packs you into a role and significantly narrows your options. If you're a Dungeon Siege fan and are getting this because you enjoyed the franchise, don't bother. This game is as much about Dungeon Siege as that crappy Dungeon Siege movie with Burt Reynolds was.\nIf you want it for game play, it's alright. Not fantastic, not horrible. I think the mechanics are a bit clunky, but then they were so smooth in Dungeon Siege I and II that maybe I just got a bit spoiled.

It's built on the same design principles: incredibly well-paced story in a \"choose your own adventure\" form coupled with extremely linear level design. You won't find open world exporation, deep character customization, complex skill trees and full party management here - but it's not a bad thing, per se, since it allows to focus on a story while not being entirely devoid of gameplay.\nEven though there is no traditional party, the game features companion NPCs that double as pregen player characters. You can't control them in battle, but you can change their equipment and stance. You can't initiate conversation with them, but they have plenty of contextual banters and can disagree with your choices in conversations. All four are fully voiced.\nStory is lighter and less prone to deconstruction than certain earlier Obsidian titles. There is a fantasy trope subversion here and there, but most of the time the setting is treated with respect. This is a welcome change for me, but undoubtedly those who wanted it edgier were left disappointed. George Ziets was creative lead on both this and Mask of the Betrayer NWN 2 expansion, so they share much of the atmosphere.\nStarting levels suffer from being incredibly bland traditional fantasy, but later areas - both Stonebridge and Tumbledown Court - are excellent each in their own way, with great NPC casts and unique ambience.\nGameplay wise it's your run off-the-mill ARPG. Once you get your twitch going, it flows smoothly. Makes you wish the corridors weren't so narrow, the trash mobs - so numerous, and small time bosses - such obvious damage sponges. Otherwise it gets the job of carrying you from dialog to dialog done. This is a departure from the first two games in a franchise, but it's not really worse - just very different.", "hours": 26.9, "user_id": "76561198163667668", "username": "windoverwasteland", "products": 42, "early_access": false}

You may down a boss within a few minutes, but getting to the boss you may come close to death more than a few times from trash mobs.

Level cap +5, enchanting, more story and the option to respec your skills!!!\nDS3 isn't like DS1 or DS2 in the regard of open world ARPG's, but still does a good job in the genre nonetheless.  There are save points everywhere in this game so if you do forget to save your last save shouldn't be far behind.  I do wish the respec pool for your abilities was easier to do.

Slightly above mediocre, give it a try.\nDungeon Siege 3 is an odd one. It got more to do with the first DS game than DS2 ever did, and at the same time, has almost nothing of what made us love those two games.\nFirst of all, DS3 is set in Ebh several decades after the Seck incursion from the first game. DS3 contain enough tidbits of lore to make this connection plausible, and you even visit several places from the original game. It seems to me that Obsidian took care to tie DS3 in with the first game, unlike DS2, which is set on another part of Aranna. The plot revolves around events and characters related to the 10th Legion (which founded the Kingdom of Ebh in the first game).\nThe story is alright, even if character development and backstory is a bit wonky. All the player characters are desendants of the 10th Legion (almost all of them, at least), but I feel Obsidian could have fleshed out this part better, or even added  more information into the game. I felt especially one of the party members could've gotten a better backstory. She was interesting to be sure, but Obsidian did not act on it.\nGraphics and performance for a four years old game is good. The visual effects from attacks, spells and powers look pretty good.\nI got two major gripes with Dungeon Siege 3:\n- The party system:\nYou can only have two party members at any given time. You and one of the other three. Even if you can switch whenever you like, it simply isn't a Dungeon Siege game without the possibility of a large party. To make this even more irritating, the other two companions that you don't bring along is nowhere to be found. At least they could wait for you at the HQ or something, but no, they are *with* your party, without being there.\n- Skills, powers and (lack of) spells:\nThe original DS had no powers, only regular attacks and a huge amount spells. DS2 fleshed out this system significantly, with fewer spells but a load of powers for each class, which greatly improved replayability and customization. DS3 removed all spells. Instead, each of the four classes got 9 powers/abilities (the mage abilites look like spells, at least) tied to a \"focus bar\". Each ability have two additional improvements which you choose on level up.\nWhat we are left with, is a system with minimal customization, 9 powers for each character, several of those which are almost identical, and not a lot of reason to replay the game. Too bad. It gets a bit old when you use the same two or three powers throughout the entire game. Reinhart Manx is one of the most powerful party members, but for a mage, his arsenal of powers is somewhat lacking.\nAll in all, I liked the game, but it could have been so much more. It's cheap, give it a try.\nEdit: Finished the DLC as well. It is actually surprisingly good, and worth buying. Adds a higher level cap, a whole new area (Aranoi desert) and a good storyline. Not the longest DLC ever, but it gives you a few hours of fun.", "hours": 32.0, "user_id": "76561197993526514", "username": "Fiberfar", "products": 231, "early_access": false}

If you are someone with ANY cognitive or physical challenges or even frustrated by utter incompetence--do not waste your money on this game.\nThe FOV is atrocious. The camera is wonkier than handing a toddler your video cam and asking him to film his birthday party. I found the controller stuttered and skidded, crashing my character into walls, barrels etc. for no apparent reason. The camera won't do anything other than overhead unless the stars are in the right configuration and the moon is full so you can't see a demmed thing that's coming from RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. Hello? If they wanted a Diablo-type top-down the reason that worked was the FOV was a large area. It's like they couldn't make up their minds what they were going for, here.\nThe lighting is grim.

Its not like the previous games, it has issues, and the PC port has its own issues. Still, I would tenetively recommend it. If you can get past quality of life issues, there is a solid basis here. It feels rushed honestly, this seems like it was almost an excellent game. It took me about 19.5 hours to beat everything with one character, first run.\nThe plot is good, with exceptionally well written dialogue and interesting characters. It brings to mind a much larger lore and makes the world feel like it retains a lot of mysteries. You always feel like you are playing someone important, regardless of the character you choose. The different sections all feel a bit too unrelated though. It comes toghether, but your actions in each area mostly only serve the story of that area.\nGraphically the game is still attractive 4 years since its release. Character models in particular look very nice. Though the selection of armors available is a bit small. The locations are diverse and all interesting, each with their own palette.\nCombat is pretty good, your character has a small set of abilities to use, 3 each in 3 different stances. Every one of them is useful, and you can customize them further with special character talents and proficiencies. The basics of combat are nice, with attacks building up your bar for special abilities. Special abilities and taking damage build up a bar used for enhanced specials and support abilities. This keeps you engaging enemies and rewards being active. There are a few viable ways to play each character, and each of them feels unique.\nThere are downsides. The stats are a bit confusing, you will probably need to look online to see exactly what stats like 'warding' or 'retribution' do. This adds a bit of confusion to already rather dull loot, you will pick up a lot of items, but nothing is exciting. Its just more damage, more defense or more of one of the 'chaos' proc effects. Your AI partner holds their own okay, they make decent, if incosistent use of their abilities. However, when they need to revive you its a crapshoot, sometimes they run into an enemy, or stand in a pit of fire trying in vein to run towards your corpse.\nThe biggest issues the game has are all minor anoyances. Many, many minor annoyances. The UI was clearly designed for consoles, and while you can click through the menus, they are really inefficient at displaying information. Bizzarely, if you open up the equipment menu with the F key (or any other shortcutted menu) you cannot return to the main character menu, you have to manually exit out and then open it with its own hotkey. The movement and camera can also be a bit strange, and several times I was killed when I became stuck in a corner or an ability didn't activate. It also takes some finger juggling to activate your enhanced abilities, holding shift and punching in a number takes some getting used to. I never bothered with an enhanced support ability, but I suppose that would be space+shift+[1,2 or3]. Finally, and absolutely most confusingly, there only a minimap on your HUD, no dedicated maps. This is probably the biggest single problem I had with the game, and it makes finding your way to certain quests a guessing game until you figure out everything's locations.\nOverall dungeon siege III is a game that hurts from a transition to consoles. Even so, there is fun to be had, and I enjoyed it enough that I would recommend it to those who can ignore some rough spots. The game feels rushed, but the ideas behind it are solid, as is the story.

This game has near NOTHING to do with the first two games, therefore making it more of its own game rather than a continuation to the series.\nI felt like I owed this game my two cents because honestly I'm astonished at the amount of bad reviews. I will fully admit to this: After I first bought the game I only played it for one hour before giving up in frustration. The camera control in this game is absolutely TERRIBLE. If they would have just made it so the camera follows the way the character is facing, it would have solved the problem entirely. I also hated the fact I can't zoom in at all, because I like to look at my character and the monster detail closely on occasion. Despite this, I decided to give the game another chance later on because I am a huge fan of the Dungeon Siege series and I really wanted to finish the third installment. Getting used to the stupid camera controls took a lot of patience but eventually I found I had almost shrugged off an awesome game. The lore and storyline is rich and engaging, arguably the best aspect of this game. I also really enjoy how my decisions shape the game's outcomes and relationships with the other playable characters, much like The Walking Dead series (which I also love). The graphics and music are great, the voice acting is excellent. I liked how the maps were easy to follow and I almost never got lost due to the really great quest trail feature. Being able to swap between \"stances\" or whatever you want to call them during battle was near seamless. I actually liked that you had to point and click in the direction of the enemy rather than mindlessly clicking once on a target and letting your character attack by themselves as in DS1 and DS2(that is, if you choose the DS1 style of doing that when playing DS2). Many will argue that just having four generic characters is boring and un-inventive on the player's part - however I personally feel it is a refreshing change. You get to uncover this character's rich backstory, and learn their personality and style as you play. It's almost like getting to know a new friend rather than just making up a fake one. lol. Besides, I could spend upwards of 1-2 hours fully customizing my character down to the shape of her nose (*cough* Elder Scrolls anyone?) and for what? She's going to be wearing a helmet anyway, and even if you have a mod to make it so you can see your character's face, how often are you actually going to look at it? It ends up being kinda tedious, especially since I just want to get onward to the game! I -would- have liked to at least be given the choice of keeping their generic name OR coming up with my own like some RPGs, but meh it's not a game-changer for me either. As for other things I DON'T like about this game, let's talk about Lucas for a second. I'm a straight girl, so when I saw Lucas I was like wow this guy looks super hot...I'm going to try him out. ;P BIG mistake. The problem with Lucas is that to do any real damage you have to basically be up the enemy's \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, and when you're in the process of doing that in a huge mass of flustercuck you're going to get mowed down as often as the White House lawn. Unless you fully specced into every healing ability possible and have a ton of chaos:vampirism as Lucas, then you're in for a world of pain my friend. I don't really like when a game forces me to spend all my talent currency in ONE thing. Like okay well if I don't want to die over and over and over again I better spend everything in every healing ability possible. Super lame! My favorite character has got to be Katarina. Her gear looks cute and girly, her voice actress sounds exotic and awesome, and she hits like a truck from afar. I can just sit back and send my cool hound in while doing some badarse sniping and when the enemy gets too close I can just switch to my sidearms and deal powerful knockback damage. Amazing. Anjali is also fricken AWESOME. She's absolutely beautiful, especially in her fire form with all those tribal tattoos and the orange eyes. The way they made her voice actress (as well as the other archon in the game) sound all ethereal-ish was cool as hell too, it really added depth to the exotic element of her race. Her fire jackal is super cute, I love the little noises he makes!! Her self-healing is ridiculously through the roof, it's almost impossible to die as her if you do it right. She also has some decent range on her attacks, and both of her forms are viable though I tend to stick more to her fire form. Reinhart is the only one I haven't tried yet and meh, I probably won't. For some reason whenever I look at him I think of the Sultan from Aladdin and I start laughing. Also the way he talks is kind of annoying. lol. I've never even used him as the AI. I'm sure he's a great character with great abilities if I just gave him the chance, but meh. Moving on, I see a lot of people complaining about the very basic talent tree but let me tell you something, I WELCOMED it. Huge, complicated talent trees with a billion different avenues has always been one of the things I actually DON'T like about RPGs. It's like, here let me google online what is the very best talent tree and fricken -research- how to play my dang character. Otherwise I'm going to be halfway through a game and realize shoot I totally screwed up my talent tree and I can't go back so now I either keep playing and pretend it doesn't bother me or restart. GROAN. It's like work instead of play at that point! In closing, I see a lot of the angry people are commenting that they don't like this game simply because it isn't like the other two. True, it IS sort-of a letdown that this game has next-to-nothing similar with the first two games other than some very minor basic lore ties. But I wouldn't just throw out the whole thing just because it isn't a similar or because it \"shames the franchise\". I tend to want to look at it as its own game...just ignore the whole continuation of the 3 slapped onto the name. :P", "hours": 17.1, "user_id": "76561198073491321", "username": "SpookyEmily", "products": 49, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false}

Only play this game if you want to play single player.\nIn short, If you want a co-op rpg DONT PLAY THIS GAME. It has one of the worst versions of multiplayer i have ever seen in a game. The game forces both players into the same screen (which for pc is a slap in the face), only the host of the game gets to progress any character, money spend is the hosts money, any items obtained are only obtained for teh host, If you have a mic plugged in its always on (no toggle to talk) and etc. Overall its pretty much pointless to play multiplayer unless you own it on console and only play with a friend at your house.\nIf you are reading this you most likely dont care about multiplayer or realize that the game has been out for so long that the multiplayer base (what little there was) is now dead. Honestly i have to say that the single player aspects in this game are fantastic. While in single player you are limited to only 1 additional teammate. Depending on play style will depend on who you like to partner with the most. The story line is the thing that suprised me the most. Unlike mass effect your decisions often effect you long term. For example early in the game you get the choice of killing an archon, putting her in jail, or letting her go free. While the first choice will give you an extremely powerfull staff for that level, it will in turn make all future instances with archons hate you forever.\nThe combat is what i really enjoy most about this game. Each character you have has 3 abilities and 2 stances that they can switch between totaling 6 abilities overall. Each stance is either single target is aoe focused. Each stance though often has buffs or pets you can summon that remain active even if you switch. So reguardless of the situation i often found myself switching between them fairly often just to get the extra buff out even if that stance wasn't optimal. Using its combat system took a little to get use to. It's a small delay but deals quite a bit of dmg if you are able to get combo hits off or finish a long casting spell.", "hours": 55.7, "user_id": "76561197981181435", "username": "Moondude", "products": 252, "early_access": false}

Four playable classes, my fav being the mage because he has cool looking spells like clockwork bombs. I have beaten the game with him and the entire game was awesome. Now I am playing the dlc Treasures of the Sun with my gunner. The gunner can switch between a rifle and dual wielded weapons that include a one handed shotgun and pistol and she has some really powerful skills. The fighter chick can summon a fire dog to help and the warrior is pretty self explanatory with some good skills also. The voice acting is very good and the game has memorable sound effects. The mouth movement actually matches the words in most cases in cut scenes. That's some pretty good detail for a top-down action game. The music is superb and always fitting of the place and mood. The graphics are really very good and hold up very well even by today's standards. The best thing about the game is its unique combat system. You get two sets of weapons with three skills each, and you can hold right trigger to activate more powerful versions of your spells or hold left trigger to activate healing and defensive skills. Obviously I play with a xbox 360 controller and it actually works very well because otherwise I would never even consider using a controller for a isometric game.

Let me just start by saying that i probable have player more than 80 % of Square Enix tittles and i love their games so much!\nGraphics/Art: The graphics are smooth and the game is optimized well so it can play on older devices aswell. The enviroment is very good (not the best) but very enjoyable and the cutscenes are awesome aswell. There ae not much to be said about the raphics of the games, but certainly it is a big improvment from its predecessors. Soundtracks help you get in the mood of action as they feature a medieval/action/epic rythm.\nPlot: The storyline was very good and interesting. As a classic RPG you have to complete quests to move on through the game. Those quests can be main storyline or substory quests. In general there is nothing hard about getting the flow of the game as it is very specific on what you have to do and where you have to go. You dont really have to search around for what you have to do, you just follow the indicator. In general for a fan oof the series its a very satisfying game as you even explore and area directly related from the first game of the series which is awesome if youve been there before!\nGameplay: As a classic RPG you have the overwatch camera where you see a fixed amount of map and you character which is a little bit annoying because you would get a whole new experiense if you had a different camera. The movement is simple and so are the attack patterns. Each player has 2 combat modes that that one focuses on single target attacks and the other focuses on AOE attacks. Each mode has different skills and abilities. In general the gameplay is interesting and intense some times as the game on the hard difficulty is very hard, almost impossible to complete and the only way of doing so is by playing online with other 3 players. Each boss you fight offers you a different experiense as you have to play by a specific way to defeat each. In general each character offers you a very different experiense, defensive / offensive or close range / ranged attacks.\nIf you get this game at a daily offer its a pretty sweet deal in my opinion.", "hours": 15.4, "user_id": "76561198070478777", "username": "JOHN CENAA", "products": 195, "early_access": false}

It was an amazing game; a seemingly wide-open world, amazing levels of customization, and tough, too.\nThis game is a console port. The inventory system is optimized for console controllers (ie no grid system any more), the controls are built for a controller (ie to my knowledge, there's no strafe functionality, so if you want to strafe, you've got to use your mouse and stop attacking), and the skill system is simplistic enough for console controllers (ie no depth).\nThe game quickly deviates from the Dungeon Siege format. Instead of being able to build a character that does what YOU want with the ability to mix and match abilities, you get to pick from four pre-made characters. If something doesn't fit your fancy, well you can go screw yourself. What do you think this is, Dungeon Siege? ... Wait... Combat is MUCH more focused on positioning and fast-paced movement, where in earlier games movement was much more tactical and positioning was a little less relevant. The skill system is bland and uninteresting, not really letting you build characters like you could before. Oh, and your character can only use three skills at a time. Two stance abilities and a guard one.\nSpeaking of the stances... The game has what I can only describe as a stance system. You hit \"q\" to switch between two stances per character. One of the characters switches between double pistols and... a rile? shotgun? It's been a while since I've played her. Another switches between using a staff and spitting out fireballs. There's no customizing that, either. Each stance has one ability tied to it, and you have to be in that stance to use that ability. The ability use button (1) is right above the stance change button (q), so I often found myself switching stances instad of using the ability I wanted to.\nOne last thing that I want to harp on: the bounding boxes for terrain do not match up with their visuals half the time. I often found myself trying to walk into completely open spaces only to find myself unable to, because the stairs that were four feet away really had a bounding box there, or the cliff that was behind me was wrapping around in from of me somehow, or I was anywhere near rocks. For a game that relies so much on quick movement, you want to go NOWHERE near the rocks. They're devious traps set by the enemies to trap you and leave you helpless.\nEssentially, this game is not a DS game. It's a bad attempt at a third party of cashing in on the name brand, and a sloppy game even on its own. Stay away.", "hours": 7.2, "username": "BuncyTheFrog", "products": 424, "early_access": false}

While much more casual than its predecessors, there's still plenty of quests, hacking, slashing, shooting, magic, looting, upgrades, lore, and dialog - and when multiple players (online or off) are in a story conversation together, players can vote for their preferred responses to NPCs, albeit Player 1 has the final say.\nThere are four characters to choose from, and each delivers a different fighting style (melee, ranger, sniper, magician). Each character also has two \"stances\" to vary up their attack strengh, range, and/or speed.  Not to mention, the back story will also change, according to which hero you've selected.\nGone is the tactical pause.  Gone is the squad management.  Gone are the skill points you earn, specific to your fighting style.  Gone are the multiple skill trees for each character.  Each weapon and piece of armor you find can only be equipped by a specific character.  Obsidian has \"streamlined\" this game, effectively consolizing it.  This is the heart of Dungeon Siege 2 fans' complaints, besides multiplayer camera controls and multiplayer inventory management.  You now will be only upgrading a single skill tree for your character, which means close vs ranged combat will not award skill toward that specific stance. Instead of holding down on right-click to attack, you'll button-mash, and each press will be one swing/shot. Also annoying to some, even when you gain NPC followers, you will not be in charge of their tactics, nor their upgrades.\nThis game was developed by the same people who made South Park: The Stick of Truth, Fallout: New Vegas, Knights of the Old Republic 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, and Alpha Protocol.  I loved all of those games.  My point, they KNOW role-playing.  In my opinion, the story here is great.  If you don't have nostalgia stars in your eyes, it's easy to see that the voice acting here is by far superior to its predecessors.  Although the story is drastically shorter, it's certainly more focused.\nAll in all, I can tell you this:  if you have a friend or loved one you want to play an immersive, open-world action RPG with while sitting on the couch together, this is the game. You'll find a rich story, a simple skill tree, upgrades, dialog choices, and tons of loot.  It's one of the best (and few) couch co-ops that delivers a true RPG experience.  Plus, gamers of all experience levels can enjoy it together.\nI come from a Fallout 3 background, but my wife is really only good at Bejewelled and racing games.  While I was able to try to craftfully master my character's moves, she was able to button-mash with a rifle-wielding hottie from a distance, and we made an excellent team!  We were able to hack/slash/loot our way all the way through the campaign +DLC together and we both had a blast.  If you've ever played/enjoyed Diablo 3 or Daggerdale on the couch with friends and/or family, and you like the idea of breaking up the action with cutscenes and dialog choices once in a while, I'm telling you, this really is an awesome game.\nIf you're looking for the next 100-hour tactical RPG in the Dungeon Siege universe, buyer beware.", "hours": 35.1, "username": "bradleypariah", "products": 290, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false}

I'm about halfway through the original campaign and halfway through the DLC but I have a good impression of the game, playing it solo on Hardcore all the way through.\nThe negativity for this game comes from people expecting a game much like it's predecessor(s), which yes; it is not. I have only played DS2 and though I would have liked a direct sequel that plays similar to the previous, I'm not disappointed with the result. I can write an essay on game franchises with sequels that changed things up and why it's not surprising they usually aren't well-received, but it's common sense really.. or should be. Anyway, the gist of 'these' games is to treat them on a separate level in the spirit of fairness.\nI'll go ahead and say that there's isn't really anything that stands out from the crowd. Graphics, Story etc. are all around the same level and more than decent but nothing out of the ordinary. Game options are sort of there but other than that, the game is pretty consolized. Moving around, basic combat and UI controls are designed with a controller in mind. Though you can use your mouse to navigate the menu, it feels off as for instance you can't click an item to view it's stats without directly equipping it, effectively disabling you from comparing it with others. In general, keyboard and mouse just doesn't feel nearly as good as playing with a controller.\nThat said; if you can get over the controls, there's really a good amount of fun and enjoyment to be had with this game. Quests are easy, tracked individually and the game shows you exactly where to go should you only ask. Even the puzzles you come across don't require much (if any) thought to solve.\nother words, the main focus is pretty much the combat and character progression. It's not a hack and slash as it has a different pacing which often requires more tact / blocking or dodging.\nNot sure how it plays on Normal or less but I imagine the game becomes a walk in the park of casual fun. If however you don't want to be a scrub and join the hardcore folks, be forewarned because it is brutal, relentless and can be unforgiving at times. Aside from everything able to kill you in just a few hits, there are certain boss battles and segments in the game that can feel overwhelming to say the least. You may find yourself cursing at the screen and/or putting the blame on your friends/AI companion. Really, it sometimes feels like I'm playing Dark Souls as I found myself soldier through the same trash mobs over and over again just to die a horrible death in a seemingly unfair boss fight where one small mistake proved to be fatal. But as with Dark Souls, when you finally do get through; it feels very satisfying.. until, a moment later you come face to face with something just as bad if not worse. Nevertheless, I'm liking it very much.\nI think it's worth the current retail price. But as with most other games, if you're doubtful; just get it on a sale.

{"product_id": "39160", "page": 53, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2014-10-20", "text": "(TL;DR)\nDungeon Siege III, while not stellar, is a bit underrated or otherwise suffers unjustly from its departure from the original games of old. Those had more of a Diablo-like interface, with top down, mouse point&click, party management gameplay, with classes, gear and loot. Dungeon Siege III was clearly designed for consoles and controller use, as the keyboard and mouse controls are very awkward and it has a more 3rd person view. Without a controller, it is very difficult to play this game.\nI\u2019m a fan of the original game, and I found that despite the change in paradigm to a 3rd person hack and slash action RPG designed for the controller, the Dungeon Siege \u201cfeel\u201d is there. Experiencing the different events in the story, meeting new characters and talking to them, going from location to location, playing the combat, collecting loot, and optimizing abilities and equipment in regards to combat, all was rather enjoyable. None was arguably groundbreaking, but was interesting and enjoyable enough to keep me invested for 32 hours, which, in retrospect, is saying something. 7/10\nRPG-wise, it\u2019s actually quite deep with lots of stats and mechanics. You choose from 4 different main characters with different characteristics and play styles: a knight for meele/tank, a rifle and pistol/shotgun wielding ranged character, an agile fire magic female warrior and a spell casting mage/scientist. One of the other characters follows you as an AI companion. Each character has 2 stances that can be switched on the fly, each stance has one attack and 3 active abilities. There are also 3 defensive abilities per character. Active abilities include heavier or AOE attacks, buffs/debuffs, or even summoned creatures. Defensive abilities include healing, pushing back of enemies or buffing yourself. As you use attacks and abilities you fill their mastery bar and once you\u2019ve mastered it, you can perform an empowered version of it. As you level up, you can develop each of your abilities in a branching choice, for instance do you want more damage or increased chance to knockback opponents? You can go all in on one, or choose any balance between the two. Additionally, there are passive \u201ctalents\u201d to level up. With all this and also the different equipment you loot, buy and enhance with enchantments (3 weapon slots, 4 armor slots, a ring and a pendant slot), with different stats, you have a vast array of possibilities. You can choose the abilities\u2019 perks to work well with one another enhancing your favorite play style, and also compliment your companion\u2019s abilities to your own, which is very satisfying, particularly, I suspect, in local coop.\nHowever, with this 2-stance system sometimes it\u2019s a bit difficult perform actions from different stances in the heat of battle with a lot going on. Of course, it would be easier with pausable combat and 1-9 keyboard hotkeys, but this is a 3rd person action game. Also, the way aiming works is a bit awkward, especially for ranged combat, as you have to move in the direction of an enemy to soft lock on it. This results in sometimes having to move away to get a better line of sight to the desired target. I got used to it, though. Additionally, the companion AI is not ideal, though it\u2019s reasonable. Again, local coop should be fun.\nI won\u2019t spoil the story, which I found surprisingly interesting, meaning that the game is far from a loot fest. Events are set approximately 150 years after the first game, much of what once was has fallen or faded, and the characters from the first game are now close to legends, which also means you don\u2019t need to play the other games to enjoy this one. You\u2019ll learn of what happened as you progress in the game, your journey has always that tone of grandeur lost as you seek to reestablish some of that. You\u2019ll meet interesting characters and the plot will make you reflect on your actions and compare them to the main antagonist, and also think about your dialogue choices. The voice acting is also good and the dialogues lengthy. The lore is very well done, tying in nicely to the Dungeon Siege universe, and is deepened by finding some books or documents, and talking to characters. You\u2019ll even explore a location directly related to the characters of the first game, which was extremely satisfying for a fan.\nThe progression is mostly linear with growing scale of locations, enemies and events. It\u2019s an action RPG, but the pacing and amount of enemies is not insane like for instance on Diablo 3, though some battles are more enemy heavy. Though there are different and varied locations with enemies matching them, \u201cdungeons\u201d aren\u2019t as big as in the first game, but nonetheless acceptably lengthy.\nThe graphics are quite good, showing some age by now, but at least in runs well, high FPS. However, the camera is always restricted to look down a little, so you can\u2019t tilt it up and enjoy the scenery in a more 1st person style, which is a shame. That restriction also sometimes doesn\u2019t provide the best view for combat either. Though different equipment reflects visibly on the characters, there\u2019s no way to view the full character close up and rotate it, like in a character screen. The HUD is somewhat simplistic, as are the indications above enemies, which at first makes it a bit difficult to understand what\u2019s going on.\nThe soundtrack is quite good, mostly in the atmospheric orchestral style, aiding to that tone of grandeur lost, but with tense and epic combat sequences.", "hours": 32.8, "username": "Cinetyk", "products": 210, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": false}

Gone are the innovative levelling mechanics (use nothing but bows and arrows and level up in only bows and arrows/use magic and swords and level in both/etc.) to be replaced with a fairly standard \"choose your new stats and feats\" option when levelling up.\nThe story is a lovely follow on from the events of the previous games and fans of the original will enjoy the nods to past exploits (and occasional easter eggs).\nLooks-wise the game is better than average, with some nice effects.

Boss fight mechanics are repetitive, altho I haven't finished the game so it may get better in the late game (I wouldn't bet on it).

The game does not really have anyhing to do with Dungeon Siege or Dungeon Siege II.  Its like someone took a totally different game and just wrote Dungeon Siege on it because they wanted a name that people had heard of before.  Here you only control one character and you only have one companion fighting with you at a time, not a party based affair like the previous DS games and you have little to no control over your companion.  Its more of a single character action adventure with a pet.  There is a variety of different equippable loot and different passive abilities to put points into so you have some minor character customization available, but not as much as you might like.  If you play it with no preconceptions it is fine as it is, but if you are expecting another Dungeon Siege you will be disappointed.\nThe storyline and combat action were adequate and I didn't notice a single bug in the whole time I played the game, which is very commendable these days.  The graphics seemed pretty nice, but the camera is a bit of an annoyance because it doesn't allow you to zoom far enough out so you often lose view of your enemies off screen while fighting.  I recommend a gamepad since the right stick can control the camera while you fight.  I can't imagine how you would do that if you play with a mouse and keyboard.  Anyhow, the game was designed for consoles so that should be the preferred method of control.  I don't think I could recommend this game if you don't have a gamepad.\nThe playtime of the game was adequate.  I'm guessing it takes around 20-30 hours total if you do all the side quests.  There's not a massive number of side quests so you won't get bogged down with them like in some other games, but they do add a few hours to the game.\nI bought the game for five dollars and I think it was a decent enough game for that price.  The game is not the best in its genre at anything it does, but if you get it in a bundle or find it on sale you can get a few days of reasonable entertainment out of it.

Every skill used is colorful and bright and makes the combat really stand out. Making a critical ht is satisfying because it really stands out.  It makes you wonder why other developers are so afraid of having color in their games.\n+4 unique characters each with their own unique play style. Every character has 2 offensive stances used to either deal with single or groups of enemies and one defense stance. Each stance has 3 skills associated with it. Each skill has 2 way you can upgrade it, allowing you to customize how you want to develop your character. In addition each character has a passive skill tree further adding to your build. All of this leads to interesting builds.\n+The game play mechanics are a bit more unique to this type of game. In order to use your abilities you need force and the only way to gain force is to attack your enemies. Defensive skills use power spheres which fill up as you take damage. All of this creates some unique game play elements and changes the way you play and develop your character. Dodging and blocking also play an important role in game play,\n+You can always rely on Obsidian to craft a well thought out story.  The games side quests in some regards are even more interesting and creative than the main quest.  Books and lore are scattered around the world to further flesh out details if your into that sort of thing.\n+Music/sound and voice acting are all top notch.\nThe Bad:\n-If there is one aspect of an action rpg that you need to get right it's the loot. The loot has to be exciting, it has to make you want to kill enemies to discover new items, it should feel rewarding. This game has non of that. The loot in this game is boring. For the most part, loot just changes stats and more likely than not you will equip the loot that gives you the highest stats. A good loot system means the player has to make tough choices, this game doesn't do that.\n-Multiplayer is all but dead meaning you are not going to get any achievements related to multiplayer. Even if you do play a multiplayer game you character progress is not saved if you join someone else's game when you go back to single player. How this even passed in today's time is mind boggling.\nConclusion\nI really loved this game, I played it many times on 360 and will continue to play it here. This game gets a lot of things right in regards to the genre sadly it also gets things horribly wrong as well.  I love that each character is really unique and no two characters play the same.

Your team building is completely limited to the constructs of  the preset game options, your  character class is permanetly set and you cannot stray in the slightest to develop a character to fit your design or fighting style like the incredible system in DSII. You can tell that Chris Taylor had really nothing to do with this game, the fact that he let it be produced is disheartening. The visuals are great dont get me wrong, but the camera is horrendous. It is always at an angle that makes you a bit nauseous, plus you cannot adjust it to see well at all. The target locking system is entirely automated, I have not found a way  to turn it off, so the enemy that you are targeting  is not the one  that you choose, completly eliminating any potential strategy in the battles.

It blew me away that i could move from one point to another with out having to load and that i could complete the entire game with out a single load screen.  Moving down into a dungeon felt like it had real depth and the same went for DS2.\nIf you are looking for a decent RPG then this is an alright game, but if you are expecting the dungeon siege expience look elsewhere.", "hours": 2.2, "username": "Abeltensor", "products": 200, "early_access": false}

I was excited for it, as I was a big DS II fan. However this game plays nothing like its predecessor. That was a dungeon crawler similar to Neverwinter or even a team orientated Diablo. This is more of a straight action game. Each person has two weapons, and that is it. You never get a different type of weapon for them, only upgrades. What this means is combat is the same for the duration of the game. You do aquire different abilties, but that is about it. That would be fine if the combat was fun, however it never really managed that for me. In the last DS game you had a wide creative range on how to build your hero, in this one you are forced into a path depending on which avatar you want to play. If each hero had a unique story mode this might be worth it, however they all follow the same quests and maps. The only real difference is some conversation options, and a few videos. Think left 4 dead or dead island, there are different characters but the story is the same for everybody.\nI got this game on steam for free, so I installed it hoping after not playing DS II for years I would be more receptive to it.

This game definitely doesn't pass as a Dungeon Siege game, the only thing that qualifies it is the lore that's in it (Which I think I gathered all but one piece of). It has many nerd-service moments, in which it refers back to the original game, and even some moments that refer to the second, but it's style is entirely different. I look at games for what they are, not what they should be. It's still a good game, full of great story-telling, and an alright Combat system. The Combat System could use a bit of work, and I would have liked some more companion interraction, but it was a different developer from the first two games, so first of all, you can't expect them to go all out like they would have. Second, people need to stop saying \"It's not the same! It fails my professional inspection!\" It was a bold move to go from a, well, I don't know what genre it is, but mostly mouse controlled, to a game that actually requires some thought into combat. The combat system is very situational, and quite challenging, I can say that in the last two games, the combat mostly depended on luck, and how geared out your characters were. This one depends on actual skill, with the gear of your characters... The learning curb is a bit off, seeing as how it went from disappointing cake-walk to frustrating fires of hell, but once you figure it out, it tends to be a rather well-thought-out system that actually levels up quite nice now that I think of it.\nFor those that couldn't pay attention to my horrible rant: It's not a Dungeon Siege game, though it has the lore of it. It's still a good game, for what it is. I highly recommend it.

It was interesting, but way difficult at first. Basically, just hack and slash, run to the Light column to get \"revigorated\" and go back for more. Leveling was tedious, and the WIMP knight could not fight his way our of a paper bag. The girls, on balance had much easier time with mobs, albeit took a few weeks of same-ole hack and slash of the same old mobs to get levels and skills to an acceptablwe levels. LOOT sucks.  It is not always visable, get bounched to inaccessible areas, but usually not worth spending time to recover. Now, zones are locked until you complete certain quests or objectives,  STATS appear to be ambiguous, and gear is hard come-bye. you can not auto-pickup lot, but must click on it. Not sure if weight is a factor, but usually is in these games. Healing is readily available at the LIGHT collumns., but configuring the toons was SOOO  mysterious, with no readily available help, at least while I played. Someone said/posted there is a help file to guide in the config quagmire, but I never found it. So, after weeks, literally hundreds of hours, I got thru all four characters to the Boss. Each time you enter a NEW zone, it will auto-save, and you are locked in. You can NOT go back, you can not get out. SO it you are not upto the level of the mobs, you will lose. And while you can restart from previous zone save, it gets to be a real PIA after 10-15 re-tries. The biggest \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, for me, is the FINAL savegame, after completion, got LOST or deleted, BUT NOT BY ME. So, this prevents me from accessing the DLC, paid for TY VM.,and it appears Steam disavows and responsibility. Trying again for the 15th time to REDO the Boss fight, it appears they gave the Old Boy some steroids, cause he wipes out BOTH of my best toons, repeatedly. Overall, the game is similar to the first two, but since you do not have any physical disks, must abide by Steam rules, and at the mercy of some server-in-the-Sky to maintain your files and saved games, it is barfely worth the 50% discount cost. This must be a Steam policy, as EQ, again paid for, got wiped and can't be played without some additional fees being paid, so I was told when I attempted to log in....The Community groups are great help, mostly. I recommend the game, if, ONLY IF, there is a 50% price reduo, and GET SOME HELP files. Having played these games for 25 years, or more, back to PM and Donkey Kong on Atari, OK, 35 years, I thought I had a decent idea of how it should go, but NOOO. It appears that some of the \"special\" skills or attributes are worthless, and don't work most of the time. Made HOT KEYA for all of those, but they are intermittent, That is, you takes your chances. In Boss fights, you do NOT have any time to recon, reconfig, or GUESS. They will cream you. It would be nice to have some healing Pots or some decent gear, but you can only get what you can scavenge. Cheats might help, but are against Steam policy. IF you are tenatious, persevere, keenly observant, and have the patience of JOB, (read that book sometime) like Gilgamesh, yo might just win.

You were able to have a plot which may not be the most diversed but stil enjoyable and even twisted from time to time. You have enjoyable and less enjoyable Characters and therefore you bind yourself more to certain characters and you see yourself drifting away from others.\nThe Controls feel definitally better if you use any kind of Controller(I used a XBox 360 Controller and it felt quite well)\nThe Graphics fit the all in all atmosphere of the game and has a unique style to it (At least i see it that way)\nSo all in all I have to say its two-sided.

The bad mainly because it's not like the other Dungeon Siege games, etc. As I am new to the series and I briefly played this game with a friend on her Xbox 360 I decided to but it for myself.\nLet me tell, this game was so much fun to play! I usually tend to get some form of lag while playing system games on my laptop, but I got none what-so-ever with this game. It was both a refreshing and fun game to play. The level system is simple and easy to use. It was nice just to choose what abilities I wanted to buy or upgrade instead of using a point system to upgrade attack, defense, health points, etc. Your weapons, armor, and accessories decide to what kind of stat points you get.\nI highly recommend you get a Xbox 360 PC gaming controller from Microsoft (check\n, that where I got mine for like $23) to play this game with. Before I got the controller I spent an hour just trying to map the game commands to the keyboard to my liking but it just didn't work for me. Playing on the keyboard was just too clumsily and ackward.\nYou get to choose from 4 characters to play as. A sword user (male), a gun user (female), staff/spear user (female), and a magic user (male). I choose the gun character and as my supporting party member in battle was usually either the sword user or magic user.\nI am nearly done with the game. I just need to fight the final boss and then my first play through of the game is done. I think this game has a high replayability.\nI am not disappointed with this game and I will continue to sing its praises. The only thing I am sad about is that I am almost down the my first playthrough of the game and that I will have to start anew with a new character once this storyline is done.\nOut of a scale of 10, I give this game a 9.", "hours": 39.9, "user_id": "76561198122647995", "username": "Taya Seloria", "products": 29, "early_access": false}

And although this was my first Dungeon Siege, I can honestly say I immensely enjoy this game. I loved how I could actually control my character's movements instead of just clicking on some part of the map and wait for them to get there. It makes me feel more involved. Also, the combat was absolutely great and at times a great challenge. The abilities the four hero's have were all fun to use, and they each felt different from the other's. Something that really impressed me was that when you change any part of your armor, so too did your character. I do not tend to see my character's look change with other RPG games like this one, so it was just nice to see something as simple as this being implemented.\nNow, despite what I said, I still have faults with the game. I have to agree with many others when saying that camera was a pain at times. It was too close to the player, and at times it made me feel constricted. However, is the camera beyond awful and ruin the whole game? No, not even close. I also would find myself getting stuck in objects towards the later levels for some reason. I would be walking then uh oh, I am now stuck in a log, or what have you. I also see many complain about the confusing skill tree, clunky AI, bad controls, and for some reason picking up objects. I really do not understand their complaints because one: the skill is so simple to use. You literally choose what ability you want(only certain levels let you pick an ability), where you want your proficiency, and what talent you want. It is so straight forward. As for the AI, I have never had a problem. My companion was always helpful ( I have not played co-op) and never felt useless, and the enemies were not mindless oafs. I also thought the controls were just fine. There was nothing confusing about them (I played keyboard and mouse). And picking up objects? Really? If there are a lot of items near you, press ctrl. You now just picked up everything. No reason for that to be a struggle.\nIf this is your first Dungeon Siege game (because apparently this is not worthy of being called a Dungeon Siege), or if you like action RPGs, I recommend this game. It is beautiful, addictive, and the story is actually pretty awesome. I got hooked with it and felt really involved in it. It really is a solid gaming experience, and I wish more people could see that. I also recommend getting the DLC as well. Raises level cap, grants enchanting weapons and armor, and adds a good lengthy and engaging mission.

{"product_id": "39160", "page": 63, "page_order": 5, "recommended": false, "date": "2014-05-11", "text": "The next in my long line of pretty appalling reviews. I played this (on normal) for around 8hrs, and was level 11, completing as far as I know all of the side quests and getting to the end of Act I.\nGraphics\n@@@@@\nThe game is about three years old, but Titan Quest is older, but looks much better. Nice enough, but nothing special. There is a gamma setup, but I think its more to annoy you - making get stuck on the scenery to add to its difficulty.\nMaps\n@@@@\nThe area's seem varied enough, but oh my god is it bad in how its presented. All ARPGs are huge open maps that are basically mazes, with natural terrain to force you to backtrack as required, but using these dead ends as boss encounters or hidden chest areas. In DS3, you are in a series of corridors. I am nearly having a panic attack as I play this game, its so claustrophobic.\nThe map is beyond woeful. Imagine trying to navigate from Lands End to John o Groats with your map that looks like a small circle with a line going from South to North. That's what your map looks like. Sometimes its a little wiggly, but its basically a line. You can change the zoom once, or you can remove the map. There is no overall map and no map overlay of the area and no adjustable zoom to be of any use at all. Quest markers lead you to think that you are heading in the right place, but are miles away from where you think they are.\nMobs\n@@@@\nYou get swarmed a lot, and need very early on to perfect the hit, roll, hit, roll, hit, roll technique if you don't want to be dead. I am not sure why you can roll faster than you can run, nor why just about EVERYTHING can run faster than you to swarm you as they run down the corridor, sorry I mean through the dense forest that is so overgrown apart from the perfectly manicured path.\nMobs are a little samey, bandits and spiders so far, but the Boss mobs and encounters have had some interesting attacks.\nSkill Tree, UI & Classes\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\nLets start with the UI. Basic is the word, and nothing is contextual, meaning you have to wonder what on earth the empty orb things are that appear to be un-learnt skills are as no little pop up box helpfully appears.\nThe Skill section is something else. I am still not entirely sure what the Proficiencies do, as I think they only work when you expend your focus with your Ability 1 button (normally 1) You then change Stance to do something else and while in this stance, the 1 button does something different, but 4 always heals and 5 always does the other buff spell....its simply too confusing, when other games would allow you to use the orbs as you wish. Its reported to be a console port and one that has had no PC love at all. It shows.\nThere is a nice balance on the active skills, as you can only rank them to 5 in total and you have two choices per skill, so you can have 3/2 or 0/5 as you wish. Filling all 5 'empowers' the skill, meaning it now has a more powerful effect - multiple targets instead of one or heal all the party rather than just you.\nYou get Passive skills as well, which are normally based on x% per rank.\nLeveling is quite annoying though, it waits for the second you have finished a fight then goes to the character screen. So you cannot find a save point, then level and test a skill or anything. Its just annoying - like running into a wall.\nControls & Camera\n@@@@@@@@@@@\nRight click move and left click fire as usual, but you also have forward and back and lefty/right camera angles. You need them as well, as getting stuck on scenery happens a lot, getting stuck in corners happens in swarms and thats why I think the dodge roll was added. Spacebar adds a block move, while space and move rolls on that direction.\nThe camera is a mad thing that sweeps in and out at a moments notice. Nothing becomes see through, solid objects block its viewpoint, and boss fights in a room can see you looking at the floor a few feet in front of you as the camera changes without you doing anything.\nYou cannot direct your team members at all. Not with their spell choices or when to do anything. They do revive you if you fall, but forget directing them at the boss or the boss's minions, depending on your strategy.\nYou cannot click on targets to switch - it seem to be locked to the last one you attacked and you will contain to shoot the one miles away that you first started attacking while another beats you to death at close range. This is VERY annoying during the big boss fights, as you are shooting backwards and hitting barrels and chairs rather than your intended target.\nControls are not responsive either. There have been plenty of times when I have had to mash a button to get the heal to work (and I had enough foucs to use) and sometimes the roll dodge causes you to stand still and blck instead of roll, and as you are ALWAYS doing this, you are always facing the wrong way to block something.\nLoot\n@@@\nLoads of it, which is nice, and you can upgrade your weapons with essences you find.\nGameplay\n@@@@@\nOn one hand its all a bit meh! to be fair, while on the other so frustrating its beyond belief. At the end of act one you have a BIG boss fight that takes place in a tiny room. In single player, you can do nothing but fire off a quick ranged attack, then roll twice, then fire off an attack, then roll twice.....all aggro is on you all the time as you let your AI partner fight the boss and you just run away. If you miss a beat, she does so much damage that you lose half your hits in one go, and her she fires something off that takes away the other half. You have to roll as this is quicker than running, and if you dont roll she (as everyone else) runs 200% of your speed and chops your face off. If your AI party member drops in combat, you have no chance to revive her as you cannot get far enough away to spend the few seconds required to get her up again, and.....I wont say anymore about the fight, but it gets worse.\nThis is not difficulty levels being too high, this is being hampered by game mechanics that are just\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Camera angles, confined space and mechanics all together. Take the Dragon in Torchlight - now that was a rock hard fight, and while running and kiting is a sound mechanic, that felt brilliant. This? Nah.

The problem it has is its name. This is no Dungeon Siege!\nObsidian/Square Enix would've been better off by giving this child a different name, or make it a Spin-off (like it happend with Baldurs Gate back then. PS2 version was called Dark Alliance). This would've been alot better and the die hard fans of Dungeon Siege 2 wouldn't have been dissappointed that much. Especially when considering that they made this game with consoles in mind. The Port is bad. Crappy and slow UI, plays best with a controller and so on. Performance is good though.\nAnyways, in terms of Action-RPGs, Dungeon Siege 3 is not bad. It has its flaws, yes, but overall it's good enough to be picked up by fans of the genre. Especially at a discounted price.\nIt features good graphics, a decent story with multiple choice stuff, okay-ish combat with dodge mechanics and a nice lootsystem which keeps the good loot coming until the end. The companion system they used in the game felt kind of good too. They weren't annoying and could stand their ground on their own. They even pick up gold drops for you.\nThe biggest problem this game has, is its lack of bigger maps. It's mostly a really long tunnel... and I mean really long. It's on par with FF13. There is not much exploration going on and this is especially bad when you reach Stonebridge (the games Mainhub/Town). It doesn't feel like a Town at all.\nWhere the game kind of got it right was with the Treasure of the Sun DLC. Here it actually feels like you are running around on a big map with ways to explore it. Still a longshot away from being called an open world, but it felt satisfying to run around in the Desert. The DLC introduced a few new/nice Puzzle-/Dungeonmechanics as well.\nSo getting the DLC with the game should be a no-brainer.\nBut I don't recommend picking it up at the current price. 20 bucks for the Game+DLC is too much. 10 bucks at most seems about right.\nAll in all I'd rate it with 7/10.

The minimalist UI doesn't display the bulk of your abilities, and one of the more important features, saving your game, isn't really explained that well - make sure to \"use\" the save portals.

You can also unlock \"deeds\" through this and completing certain tasks, which give permanent stat boosts, which I found rewarding.\nBy the end I found the story to be quite alright, envolving and engaging enough to feel rewarded after it was all said and done.  I ended up liking the character customization by the end, even if, like I said, it took awhile for the ball to get rolling.  All in all, a decent game, well worth any marked down price its given, and certainly not the worst hack n slash loot fest I've ever played by far.", "hours": 47.2, "username": "Multani", "products": 641, "early_access": false}

He played the generic wizard and I played the generic swordsman. We played on the hardest difficulty. While the game offers some fun hack and slash combat, there's nothing very special with it. Each character has two modes (zwiehander/sword+shield, rifle/dual pistols, etc.) with three skills per mode in addition to three defensive abilitites. While I do believe you're supposed to use both of your modes, there seemed to be no benefit in doing so for me. I just went berserk with my zweihanders and that worked terrifically.\nI can't say anything about lower difficulties but we mostly found the regular enemies to be rather trivial while the bosses were hard only because they could kill you in one or two hits. This was challenging and fun in its own way but not in a good way as this was more like artificial difficulty where you're punished for a single mistake.\nWith this in mind, the balance between bosses wasn't good, either. One early boss was super hard while others were a breeze. The penultimate boss was one of the hardest in the game while the last boss was a joke.\nLastly, the game had some notable issues with other aspects. The depiction of women felt rather sexistic as you could usually judge the moral level of a woman by looking at the size of her breasts. Big breasts - good person. Small breasts - evil person. The camera was a pain as my partner and I limited each others' movements, which was super problematic as he was a long range character and I was purely melee. As far as I know, the game is purely a console port and although it could actually be good, I'm not so certain that it's good if you don't have a gamepad to play with.\nSo that's my review. You can see that I ended up giving it a recommendation but that's a weak recommendation. I do not recommend buying this game unless you'll either have someone to play with or if you can get it for less than the base cost.", "hours": 23.9, "username": "Krakob", "products": 223, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "39160", "page": 68, "page_order": 6, "recommended": false, "date": "2014-03-03", "text": "The third installment of the Dungeon Siege series really brings a huge change to the series, one that most people hated if they were fans of the previous installments. They take away the feeling of freedom, and the ability to have a large party, the skill system is completely stripped out and replaced by a VERY straight forwards skill selection tree, with a few passive powers for you to pick as well.\nAlthough it fails in comparison to what the old Dungeon Sieges represent it is its own unique blend of action RPG. Its linear making it a no brainer to get around, the graphics are decent, the moves your characters can do have impact and flourish to them, and the environments and enemies are all well thought out and interesting.\nThe story is actually pretty good, and even the side quests you can do can end in different ways, since you can make choices that literally alter how parts of the game will play out, and if you get certain perks or not. Which adds to the replayability of the game. You can go back and make different choices the next time around, and even have a different partner to see their different dialogues during the times you can make interactive choices.\nThe real weaknesses in this game stem from a high difficutly and learning curve, some cheap boss battles that you must figure out what to do right away or get pounded into the ground, and the VERY boring loot you receive, alongside a sometimes terrible partner AI that will stand there and watch you get your skull caved in from a safe distance..\nThe difficulty spikes up a huge amount if you choose to play as the melee character in the game. It takes alot of manuevering and quite a bit of use of the block and roll buttons even to survive a standard encounter on normal difficulty, even when your partner isn't being \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.\nSome boss fights come up suddenly with little warning, and unless you figure out their patterns pretty fast, they are going to absolutely crush you into the ground within' seconds. You need to quickly figure out what moves can be blocked, and what you have to avoid, because if you don't get ready to reload your save. Yes it adds to the challenge of the game, but some instances and some of the bosses almost require you to die once or twice just to figure out what you were supposed to be doing. Some of the fights for when you actually get to them are straight up unfair with the gear and skills you've acquired on your journey, and if you are playing on hard, get ready to get one or two shot, there is NO room for error in the boss fight on the higher diffculty.\nThen after all that, what do you get? A ton of garbage drops, a handful of cash, and a long walk back to turn the quest in, just to get a perk or a halfway decent item or money reward, sometimes not even that. Sure you get a ton of loot in the game, but most of it is boring and much of the same. Alot of the stats have no in game description and you literally need to look up a guide to figure out the meaning of the stats on your equipment and what it actually does for you, since there is no in game indicator as to what the stats do.\nThe game has an interesting enemy roster, with a variety of environtments that usually force you to round them up in a large area or choke point so you can combat them effectivly. Even some of the standard enemies can wreck your life in a matter of seconds if you're screwing around. If you wanted a challenge this game can definitly serve it up, depending on the character you select, and which partner you decide to pair up with. The difficulty spikes down a bit IF you can actually find someone to play with online, or if you're playing with a friend who is willing to replace the sometimes brain dead AI.\nWhile it's a fun romp with actual decent dialogues and cool choices, I simply would not recommend picking it up unless it's on sale or part of a bundle with possibly the other games in the series or perhaps bundled with other square-enix games for CHEAP.", "hours": 10.7, "user_id": "76561198037070834", "username": "Jimbos", "products": 182, "early_access": false}

Most buggy games seem to be somewhat forgivable because they have fun elements, but this game had absolutely none.  The game is incredibly linear (occasionally there is a single path branching off the main path, but these are rare and short).  The camera angle is terrible on the PC - I find myself fighting 50% of my enemies off screen.  I routinely cast fire jackal just so that it can show me what direction my enemies are.  Your characters are tightly tethered together so that all battles feel like three-legged races.  If you try to move right while your buddy is moving left, too bad!  The both of you will end up struggling to move but going nowhere while the big boss rains damage down upon you.  This sense of being joined at the hip continues even when just trying to maneuver through the dungeon.  Because of the terrible mechanism for moving about (on the pc), one of you will likely get stuck on a door jam or stair banister.  When this happens, you will not be able to move to walk around the obstacle because your buddy will likely have already traveled too far.  They then have to come back to get you!\nBattles can be especially frustrating as you find yourself mashing keys over and over again just to make some effect take place.  This leads to a strange bug that occurs occasionally in battle for the fighter characters and almost routinely for spell casting characters.  Normally, when casting a spell, a button is pressed and while that button is held down the cursor becomes a blue glowing ball that you are supposed to use to aim the spell.  When you release the key press, the spell is cast and your cursor returns.  At least, that's how it is supposed to work.  Routinely in battle our spell caster would get slaughtered because releasing the key press didn't cast the spell - instead the blue glowing ball whizzes around the battle field and until it decides to go away on its own the spell caster cannot move at all.  But don't think that playing the fighter characters will be much better.  Because you have to spin the camera in order to aim at your enemy, I routinely find myself attacking thin air while someone beats me from behind during the 5 seconds it takes to do a 180.  Theoretically this can be solved by placing your cursor precisely on your enemy, but I find that near impossible while a group of enemies swarms me.  There finally came a point where I realized that I had not enjoyed a single moment of this game and decided to never play it again (despite reaching what I think is the final battle).", "hours": 21.4, "user_id": "76561198018787696", "username": "csthrockmorton66", "products": 120, "early_access": false}

For centuries Legionnaires have protected the nation of Ehb until they were betrayed and all but driven to the brink of extinction. Years later, now that evil has returned to Ehb the people turn to the few remaining Legionnaires for the protection of the past. As an heir to the Legion will you accept this plea for help? Dungeon Siege III is the latest entry in the beloved long running classic roleplaying series from Square Enix. It is worth nothing though that this title is quite different from the previous games in the series.\nAt the start of the game you choose one of four different character classes and set off on an adventure to take back the nation of Ehb from an evil force that has gained control of the land and declared war on all of the former protectors of Ehb known as Legionnairies. Dungeon Siege III has all the elements of a traditional roleplaying game with you, the player, gaining experience points through combat, various tasks, completing quests and discovering lore. You can use these points to upgrade your chosen characters abilities to your particular style of play through a fairly diversified skill tree. There is also a great amount of loot to be collected in the form of weapons, armor and trinkets that can be accquired through combat, exploration and different merchants scattered throughout the land. Choosing the right weapons and items for your character as well as for your companion are vital to your survival as the narrative plays out. Even though the plot in this game is a story that has been portrayed many times before, I was really entertained with the way it was presented in Dungeon Siege III and thoroughly enjoyed the adventure from start to finish.\nGraphically I think this game is beautiful, it's played in a isometric top-down view much like \"Diablo\" and the \"Baldur's Gate\" titles. From the dense Rukkenvahl Forest, through the beautifully cobbled streets of Stonebridge to the mines of Glitterdelve and beyond, the environments of Ehb are varied and full of the little details that one looks for in games of this type. The title also uses a gorgeous color palette and blends in depth of field effects quite nicely both during gameplay and cutscene dialog. The sound quality is exceptional whether it's the sound of combat, dialog or just ambient background noises as you travel across the land. Also of note is the terrific musical score which is quite memorable in this game. There are a couple of tracks that I would really like to own but sadly the soundtrack to this title is not available anywhere and believe me I checked. To summarize, I really like R.P.G.'s that take you on a quest to a wide variety of locations and Dungeon Siege III excels at this while providing quite a visual feast for the eyes.\nI really enjoyed my first playthrough of Dungeon Siege III despite some problems with the camera angles at times during combat. The story was intriguing, the combat was alot of fun, the characters and lore was quite interesting as well. Each of the four available characters have vastly different styles of combat so the replayability of this title is high. I plan to go back and play again with each of the other characters at some point. Though I have to admit that for some strange reason I remember downloading and playing the demo of this game right before it launched a few years ago and I did not like it. I can only believe that is because of my gaming habits having changed around that time and me moving more towards R.P.G.'s like \"The Elder Scrolls\" and \"Kingdoms Of Amalur\" and away from the old-school roleplaying games that first captured my interest in the genre to begin with. I don't know...all I can say now is that this is indeed a great game despite all the HATE that it constantly receives and is RECOMMENDED for roleplaying gamers.", "hours": 67.5, "username": "\u03c1\u043e\u0455\u03b9\u0442\u044f\u043e\u0438_", "products": 470, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

For example, you get to make decisions such as letting someone live and that may benefit you or not later on.\nWhile I could complete the game on medium with a keyboard, a controller would have been far better as I rarely used the block function anyway.\nWhat the game has going for it is a nice colour palette, satisfying combat and a deep system to customise your character's skills and equipment rules. I also love is that there is next to no time for loading between areas and thankfully this game doesn't bother with a checkpoint system.\nWhere it falls is that the character's aren't that interesting. I played as Anjali who is a fire being of some kind. Yet her dialogue options were just dull. Now there are some funny lines from some of the characters so you will get a jolt of humour or two.\nAlso the AI of your partner can be annoying at times as you have no control over it. When your character gets knocked out, your partner can you revive you. Now you'd think that your partner would make it their priority to get you back on your feet. Wrong. Some times they will but sometimes they'll just mess about, doing their thing until either they finally come over or they die. Furthermore, if there's 4 characters, why can you only have 1 partner. Surely the mission to save the world (yup, no points for plot originality) would be better served with 4 peeps rather than 2.\nFinding your objective can also be tricky, especially with multiple levels of height in areas. Then there's the inventory system which while ok could be worked better. It takes time to get all 3 other partners but you can start getting their stuff from the get go. Stuff that only 1 person can use. Carrying it seems like a waste of space so there will be a ruthless amount of selling to be done.\nOn the whole my experience with this game was positive.

The skill selection process, for one, as well as the essences to add boosts to your character by way of weapons and armor. The multiplayer is certainly not the greatest, it would be if it didn't have a tethered camera. There is a way around this, but I am not desperate enough for a multiplayer to deal with adjusting the game by way of editing files.\nSo all in all, I would suggest buying this game to play solo. If you want it for the multiplayer aspect, I think I should say to skip it.\nEditEdit: I forgot to mention this is a linear game, meaning it follows a pretty solid track with no real free roam.

The original Dungeon Siege franchise used to be a party based, hack/slash game that focused on highly customizable character and party selections;  however, the latest installment was a blatant clone of the Diablo franchise, without the strengths that Diablo has. While it is still a strong installment, it does not live up to the expectations or any of the potential that the release had.\nThe main problem is that the game play was far easier than any prior Dungeon Siege or Diablo game, and only had a few difficult parts.  While the character's health was generally low and you can only define Katarina as \"squishy,\" the dodging function was exceptionally overpowered.  Once I got a good tempo while playing Katarina, I spent more time dodging than anything else. Due to the game's auto-target system, it was exceptionally easy to dodge, dodge, face in the general direction of your target, shoot, dodge.  While this removed most, if not all, of the difficulty of the game, it added a level of difficulty created by the pure frustration of changing targets.  Once the game selected a target, it was usually counter productive to attempt to change to a more desirable target than it was to simply kill all the least desirable targets to get to your intended target.\nThe second issue was that the story was completely unengaging.\nThe UI was cumbersome, and counterintuitive.\nFinally, the exact way stats affected your character were never defined, leaving the power gamer in me screaming for satisfaction.\nIt's a clear step-down from the original Dungeon Sieges in almost every way, but it is very similar to the Diablo franchise now. The original Dungeon Sieges were hack/slashes, but were party based and unique enough to stand apart.  If you don't have some other game to occupy your time, DS3 is an awesome game.

Or you even enjoyed the D&D lite Bauldur's Gate version for console? If you answered yes to any of these questions then don't buy this game.\nWhat DS3 does is a disgrace to aRPG's. What's so strange is it from Obsidian, one of my favorite developers. How they messed this up so badly is beyond my comprehension. Let me point out a few of the flaws.\nCONTROLS - In all aRPG's the left mouse button moves your character around, attacks enemies that are highlighted, and picks up loot. In DS3 the left mouse is the attack key only. It's basically what most games have set as shift+attack since when you press it you stop what you're doing and preform an attack no matter if there's an enemy or not. Moving is the right mouse button. The move button does not attack at all. Picking up items is the 'E' key. Yup, they took one simplistic function and divided it into 3 buttons that will confuse and frustrate you. That's just one example of how badly they messed up the control scheme here.\nCHARACTER - Character development should be an important aspect of any RPG. You are presented with 4 different characters to choose from, all with different abilities, and a decent back story. So in the beginning you're thining you'll be able to develop and grow this person. Nope. Firstly, you are not allowed to zoom in on your character for a close-up look. When you get new weapons and armor their apperance changes, but you can never really get the feel of how much more badass you are. Combine that with the worst inventory management system I've seen in 10 or more years. You are never allowed to view your character in an inventory screen and see good your new loot looks. And if that wasn't enough, when you interact with other characters in the game you are only ever shown the other person's face. Basically once you choose your avatar, and begin the game, you will never be allowed to relate to them again. Match that with a talent tree that doesn't give you a choice as to what to develop. You are forced to unock all abilities in each tier.\nGRAPHICS - There is one major problem here. Peoples eyes look like they are dead. Everyone's eyes in this game is slightly whited out and it seriously feels like they are the eyes of the deceased. Also a problem is the UI. I mentioned some of it with the inventory, but the UI is just bad all around. Not to mention your characters abilities icons aren't very good. They don't do a good job at representing what each ability does.\nSAVE POINTS - Really!? Save points in a game!? It's the 21st century is there anyway we could have just moved past this? Was it in Square Enix's contract to publish this game it had to have Save Points instead of an auto-save feature, check points, manual save? Oh, and when you do save; instead of just selecting the save slot, you must first select the save slot you want and then you have to actually go to the bottom of the screen and press the save button. An unnecessary step and only further points out the bad programing decisions that were made in this games development.\nMULTIPLAYER - Last but certainly not least is MP. You do not bring your avatar into a MP session. You are only allowed to play as one of the Hosts NPC buddies. Yes, playing with friends means you do nothing more than waste your time while your friend gets to complete the game. Which leads me to my final complaint...\nAI - You unlock NPC's in the game that help out on quests. Basically they're the pets of most aRPG's. Except the pets of most aRPG's are vastly better programmed than these human counterparts. They wander around in combat, barely helping at all. In fact, this game would have faired better if they had just not included them. IMHO it feels like they were behind on development and the team never got around to actually fleshing the NPC's out.\nPros - From all that badness there is some good.

You can choose from 4 solidly different characters.  The combat starts fairly simple (mash attach, use 1 or 2 abilities), but it gets more complex in a really rewarding way.  Each character has 2 combat stances, and each stance has 3 abilities that you get as you level up, plus 3 defensive abilities.  Each ability can also be mastered to unlock a more powerful version of that ability.  You get to distribute a few meaningful upgrades each time you level up.  The entire game was bug free for me in single player.  The graphics were really nice, and the plot was pretty solid (although as with most fantasy games I said \"huh?!\" a couple times).  The looting is good, the inventory and quest systems are good.  The game isn't incredibly long, but for me that was good.  It was about 9 hours for the single player and it really felt like an epic journey.  A few sidequests, but it wasn't bogged down with them.  As I ramble on, I realize that the bottom line for me was \"this game was pretty awesome.\"   I am also a couple hours into the co-op.  Only the person hosting gets to save their character, but as long as you play with the same person, you'll both get to keep your stuff.

And there is no diablo like loot system or a goal where you try to get good gear to showing, use or trade with friends, in fact the coop option is truely limited, but those who log in are forced to stay in the same screen as the host, so no wandering off and they cannot bring their own characters, gear and so on. The only thing they can do is use a free character slot on the host. So they don't gain anything for the time they spend on it. At least not for their own campaign. It's a pity really that they called it DS3, I can only hope there will be a real sequel for DS1 someday in the future.", "hours": 22.9, "username": "Mytharox", "products": 4295, "early_access": false}

If you were expecting a party-based Diablolike, you won't find it. Obsidian took DS3 in a totally different direction. The random loot/mobs has been watered down, the control over your party's development has been watered down, your ability to control your party itself has been limited, and your progression and potential has been reworked into linear specialization of your basic skills.\nWhen you get over the shock of realizing you're playing a game that's NOT really a DS title, you realize the game stands well on its own. It has a certain charm in the combat, the characters are credible and engaging, and the story is interesting. DS3 should be approached more like The Last Remnant and less like Diablo. Play it for the story and you won't be disappointed... even if the lack of character customization and the limited progression choices hamper replay value.\nWorth checking out the demo before hitting the Buy button.", "hours": 15.2, "username": "Trysdyn", "products": 362, "early_access": false}

I am highly annoyed that this is a console port, and would be a great game if not for my expectation of what a Dungeon Siege title should be.\nThe multiplayer is more like Fable 2 than your typical dungeon crawler. You could even compare it to Hunter: The Reckoning or Marvel Ultimate Alliance. The biggest weakness here is really that the camera locks your team into a small area of movement on screen while enemies will spawn and attack outside of it. You need to move together, while still blocking and dodging, in order to engage targets.\nIt's no wonder why you only get the single player versions of DS1 and 2 when you buy this, LAN either of those 2 games and you will have a vastly improved multiplayer experience...", "hours": 10.5, "username": "Fogg", "products": 459, "early_access": false}
