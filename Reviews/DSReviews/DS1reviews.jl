There are some points that will annoy any player, but it's up to you to decide.\nIf you like RPGs, especially the old style, go ahead. It will take hours to end and you might feel dissapointed, but, hey, you just went through another game. My comments for your benefit:\n1. 'Unlimited' world concept: Go back and forth, no 'stage' logic (not 'open' world like Skyrim, game is still linear). Graphics are also pretty good, given the time of desing. You will enjoy playing in the world of Ehb.\n2. Leveling up system according to your play style, no 'class' logic that limits your player and the weapons/armor you use\n3. Up to 8 people in your party, including mules that can carry all the loot you find\n4. Merchants placed in key areas, so you can buy/sell\n5. Decent battle techniques and camera controls. Nothing fancy but if you zoom in you can enjoy the battle\n- contains spoilers, hover mouse to view\n2. Unlimited supply of potions makes any fight easier. I had 2 mules packed with healing potions, I could have killed the boss and his family.\n3.\n. My first RPG was Baldur's Gate and I remember I was caught up in the mythos of the game (given, I was 20 years younger, but still...)\n4. If you dare multi-class your hero, he will never get to use the top-notch weapons/armor. Stick to one weapon use only. Othewise, the limitation from the requirements makes the good gear unusable.\n5.\n. You kill an imp, then 5 levels up you kill a bigger imp. Though it has unlimited monsters, many different kinds, it felt like a chore after a while. I was just moving and killing, moving and killing, like I need to clear a field from weeds. No story why the monsters are there or what their role is.

Multiplayer, in the days that it was available, was a masterstroke and a great feature of the game, and although you cannot import an entire party into a multiplayer game (that you can none the less play on your own), it's recommended to employ the work-around to do this because it just adds to the hours of replay-value and the challenge involved.\nRPGs of this day and age are of course technically superior in every way to this game. Look at its successor: Dungeon Siege 2, that improves upon virtually every aspect of the game. You can tell, however, that Dungeon Siege was a developers team's dream brought to life and they are very proud of it, despite the monetary adversity they faced during its production (The Chris Taylor interview about Dungeon Siege, particularly the bit about Apple as an investor is definitely worth a listen).\nDespite its aging geometry, low-resolution textures and poor UI scaling to high resolutions when applied to this day and age, and despite the alternative games that I play just as well, I keep coming back to this title at least once every two years for a full playthrough of the story.", "hours": 28.2, "username": "Wiking", "products": 123, "early_access": false}

It also has many secrets and shortcuts waiting in the world, for those who enjoy exploration.\nHowever, the game is not without flaws.

You point, you click, things happen. Said things can be: attack enemy until one you dies, collect items, open doors, or use switch. And that's the game.

There are no characters of note, your party members have as much personality as dry oatmeal, and I honestly forgot the name of the kingdom I was even in.\nBut how does it play? In a word, poorly. Imagine having an entire party to control as you play your Diablo clone! Imagine clicking on the wrong thing every 10 seconds in the heat of a hectic battle because character portraits with their respective inventory icons take up the whole left corner of the screen!

Those members died. Your party has virtually no soul: no unique skill trees, no various classes, nothing. Just boring stat growth with no appeal. You know what did this game in for me?

But with this game, I can't help it.\nThe game tries to be a \"party-based Diablo\", but it fails miserably at it. The combat is very simplistic (left-click, wait for the enemies to die, move on) and makes Diablo feel like a game of chess. The leveling system is one of the most boring ones I've ever seen: your 3 stats and 4 skills grow naturally as you fight or cast spells, and all they do is allow you to use new spells and slightly increase your chance to hit - no active abilities, no auras, nothing. The level design is atrocious: you are going to fight the same copy-pasted groups of enemies for an hour in a long location consisting of copy-pasted corridors, then move to another similar location, and so on. The story is nearly non-existent, the lore entries are very scarce and don't give you much information about the world. All the characters are very forgettable, and the companions never say anything beyond the few lines the first time you meet them.\nOverall, this game feels like a tech-demo for a decent engine that was sloppily put together by a bunch of programmers under extremely strict time constraints. It is probably the most generic and forgettable game I've ever played.\nI will give the game credit for its visuals (pretty good for its time), music and certain technological innovations. Jeremy Soule did an amazing job, as always, and you will recognize the musical style from Morrowind, Neverwinter Nights, KotoR, etc. I, however, don't think music and visuals can make up for the lack of... well, game.\nP.

Your guys level up automatically, you influence their stats slightly by equipping them with the appropriate means of attacking, like bows for dexterity, swords for strength and spells for intelligence.\n------------\nNow then, the worst thing that makes this game a drag aside from the low-budget execution (sound-design is something they almost could have used PC-speakers for.

You have I believe 8 guys, all specialized in something. And sometimes, there is a chapter with barely anything to equip your party with.\nThat essentially means that all you do is set your party to aggressive, navigate them around a bit and let them do ***EVERYTHING*** else including healing. Then you press a key for the entire party to tell them to loot everything in sight. Which is cool, don't get me wrong. But all they're collecting will be absolute\n.\nSo you barely do anything in this game. You can pretend to do some quests, but 90% (really!) of them mean to simply get to the next chapter quest-hub and talk to people and on the\nlinear way, you clear out some dens or something. Quest completed.\nAgain, this all wouldn't be such an issue if this would feel rewarding in a sense like in the good ol skinner boxes you expect from a dungeon crawler.

Decent lore and storyline which is the only reason I play these older games. The camera is a little tricky but I got used to it. Different from most ARPG's because your attributes and skills level up as you play instead of you picking which ones to level up. The looting system is different because you can't hold a lot but, so far it seems like there is no benefit for hoarding which puts a nice spin on things.\nIf you are on Windows 10 and it is crashing use the following steps to get it to work: Right Click the game in your library and click on properties>local files>Browse local files. When file explorer pops up, right click on \"DungeonSiege.exe\" application and click properties. Go to the compatibility tab and check the box that says, \"run this program in compatibility mode for:\" then select Windows 7 and click Apply and then OK. You will have to launch the game by using the \"DungeonSiege.exe\" each time you play the game. It is a little bit of a pain but, at least it makes it playable.\nUpdate 8/20/17: Just finished the game- I noticed that if you used the steps above to play the game that steam will not track your play time. Also, the game still crashed on me a couple times so make sure you save often. I am a little bummed that the ending sequence has been removed from the game. As soon as you kill the end boss the game goes right to the main menu. You can look up the ending on YouTube but, it shouldn't be that way.

There's not a lot of depth in terms of stats and skill trees.  But I really like that character abilities increase based on how you use them.  An archer that casts spells increases in magic ability, for example.  I also like that attributes like strength, dexterity, and intelligence also increase based on how you play.  Strength increases most with melee combat, dexterity with ranged weapons, and intelligence with magic use.  This all makes a lot more sense than having a character go up a level and then you choose what attributes to increase--you shouldn't be allowed to increase the strength of that spell casting archer because his archer level went up, but it's cool that any character can do whatever you want him to do.\nOne of the biggest positives to the game is how quickly you can change weapons or tactics during battle.  All options for each character are always on screen.  Fight with bows or ranged magic when enemies are at a distance, and quickly switch to melee weapons when they move in.  Or switch from offensive to defensive magic in a click.\nThe negatives really hurt the game, overall.  First, the trailing camera is dumb.  When a character goes through a doorway, you can't see anything in the room until you are quite far in.  This makes no sense, especially if there are lots of monsters in the room.  Your character might be dead before you even see what's attacking.  The camera angle also affects movement.  It's tricky to move forward slightly because you continually click on a character, selecting him, instead of moving forward.  Changing to the highest resolution helped a bit, but that's poor game design in my book.  Finally, the map only shows the area close to your party.  Finding your way through a larger area or even a dungeon maze is impossible.  You can't zoom out enough or move the map around to be able to see what you want to see.\nHaving said all that, the game is fun and it's at the current level of depth that I want in an RPG--more depth than Diablo, not as much as Balder's Gate.   7.7/10", "hours": 42.5, "user_id": "76561197970817381", "username": "mlantz", "products": 64, "early_access": false}

Sending you back through its early 2000 textures, this game was the first rpg adventure (party based) I stumbled upon, installed through a demo-disc in the year 2002.\nFrom what I remember, Dungeon Siege had one of the more memorable introductions. Just a farmer, the adventure starts and throws you into an ongoing quest. An rpg of progression from the very beginning. This game like many others have suggested, is without a doubt one of the classics that deserved more praise than it had. Games like Diablo, and baldurs gate were great in their own right. However there is something unique and special about this game. The graphics were ahead of its time; its still lovely to play and look at the textures & character animations. The music sets the tone nicely, and the storyline sucks you in to keep playing. Above all else, what I remember fondly about this game was the great layout of the menu, inventory, and weapons. Whoever designed this game has an extraordinary eye for detail. It is a testament amongst the years gone by, that many players remember this gem, or find it through another rpg game to boot it up.\nThe only thing that (has nothing to do with steam nor game developers) niggled me and others in this review section, was the fact it can crash upon loading an error. I found some ways to get around this problem, as addressed in the reviews (which happened to work for some play throughs).\nI give this game a 10/10.

Several locations to visit, several quests and good music done by Jeremy Soule (also responsible for the music for tes III: morrowind and tes IV: oblivion) . However, there is one big problem. This version here on Steam ain't complete. There was also an expansion released called Legends of Aranna, developed by Mad Doc Software. And that expansion ain't included. That's right, you will buy an incomplete product. Without LoA Dungeon Siege is just not complete. And that is not the only thing that is not included. Gas Powered Games released a mod of themself called Yesterhaven. That one isn't included as well. For LoA there is also a bonuspack called Return to Arhok. but it only works on Windows Xp. That one can be downloaded for free. But since it's a bonuspack for LoA you can't use it with the steam version, as Steam lacks LoA.\nTherefore i would not recommend to buy Dungeon Siege from Steam, as it is not complete.

{"product_id": "39190", "page": 13, "page_order": 4, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-07-08", "text": "The story is pretty simple and fairly formulaic. You're a simple farmhand that must rise up and find out what's up with all of the evil happening. But you have no background except that you're a farmer. And that's pretty much how it stays. The story is mainly presented to you in a series of books you find and read and some simple cutscenes (although I really liked one of the later ones at the goblin boss). The problem is it gives no motivation to your character, or really any of your other characters. You're just fighting evil because. I guess it was in the farmer contract. Yep, right there in the small print... \"If, in the event of an ancient, or any other kind of, evil should arise, you must report immediately to the bridge to hear the speech of a dying friend at which point you will purposefully pick up a weapon and begin your quest to eliminate said evil.\"\nThe game is very linear, although there are a few ancillary areas and dungeons to explore. You can backtrack, but there's little incentive to do so, since monsters don't respawn and dialogue with non-player characters doesn't change in response to events. In order to allow you to maintain situational awareness, objects like trees become transparent near your party members, and you can easily alter the isometric perspective by rotating, raising, or lowering your viewpoint. Despite that flexibility, trees and some environmental effects like snow and rain still sometimes make it difficult to see much of the area surrounding your characters. However, in those circumstances, you can rely upon the game's capable automap, which clearly identifies all nearby creatures and items and allows you to zoom in your viewpoint to essentially play the game from a top-down perspective.\nSince Dungeon Siege is party-based, you'll likely sample characters skilled in each of the abilities during the course of playing the game. Unfortunately, these skills are not well balanced. Nature magic, in particular, is much more difficult to rapidly develop compared with the other three skills, since there's an early shortage of effective spells. Characters specializing in nature spells won't get as many opportunities to meaningfully contribute early on in the game, other than by casting healing spells, which by their nature are only useful some time after combat has commenced. It's accordingly difficult to sufficiently develop a character's nature magic ability to allow that character to cast the more formidable spells that become available at higher skill levels. That's less relevant during the single-player game, since even a nature mage with half the experience of the rest of your characters will usually be adequate to keep the rest of your party healed, but it's frustrating to play as such a weak character in multiplayer games, where you're limited to controlling a single character.\nIn the single-player game you can control up to eight party members, and while you can elect to directly control all of them, they can contribute effectively with minimal supervision. You can individually set how aggressively each character will pursue foes, how they select targets, and when they will initiate combat. There are various formations you can adopt for your party, although their effect upon gameplay is minimal, since your characters can't be hurt by friendly fire. The interface allows you to easily and intuitively adjust the camera angle, pick up treasure, switch weapons, access inventory screens for any or all party members, or essentially accomplish any objective with a couple of mouse clicks. Vulnerable party members, such as the pack mules you can purchase to lug hoards of loot, will retreat from danger, and spellcasters with healing spells equipped will automatically aid their wounded peers. You can pause the game at any time in order to take greater control over the actions of your characters, but well equipped parties are capable of overcoming most foes relatively independently. It's an elegant and always manageable interface that allows players to assume as much control over their party members as they desire.\nWhile its party-based gameplay is a little more tactical and less frantic than that of other action RPG titles like Nox and the Diablo games, Dungeon Siege still plays very similarly to those games. It's a fast-paced hack-and-slash game, so if you're looking for a deeper role-playing game or one in which the primary goal isn't to liberate excessive quantities of loot from its owners, then Dungeon Siege isn't really for you.

{"product_id": "39190", "page": 14, "page_order": 4, "recommended": true, "date": "2017-06-28", "text": "Dungeon Siege was the first proper RPG I played. So when it was 99p on sale, I had to buy it for nostalgia's sake alone. So 15 years later, is Dungeon Siege worth buying? For those of us Millenials (I figure you have to be old enough to remember the Millenium to be a Millenial, despite what others may say) who played Dungeon Siege originally, I would say go for it. It's only 99p at the time of writing, less than half the price of a sandwich and you'll get much longer enjoyment from it. Plus, nostalgia... woo!\nA lot of people have commented on whether this game is compatible with later versions of Windows and there are those who claim it doesn't work. I can't speak for them, only myself, but for me personally I've had absolutely no problems (so far!) running it on Windows 10.\nFor those of you who didn't play Dungeon Siege at the time, a brief description: Dungeon Siege is an action RPG in a similar ilk to Diablo. However, even for games of it's era it's not got a huge deal of depth. You start of as a farmer, and depending on what weapons/spells you use, you slowly gain experience in one of the four main skills of the game: Ranged, Melee, Nature Magic or Combat Magic (you can mix and match these as you like, but it is slower to level that way). In addition, you have three attributes: Strength, Dexerity and Intelligence which rise slowly depending on whether you're using melee weapons, ranged weapons or spells respectively.\nOne of the great features about Dungeon Siege is that there are no loading screens and thus you seemlessly transition from one area of the world to another, even from indoor regions to outdoor regions. For the time, the graphics are incredible... and even by today's standards they're not THAT bad. The music's pretty nice too and quite atmospheric.\nAnother great feature about Dungeon Siege is the plethora of items available for each of the four different skills. Many of the items found have various enchantments on of varying degrees of power. These items are generated randomly, so you'll always come across different items.\nThe biggest problem with this version is the lack of multiplayer (and also lack of the expansion, but I don't think I ever played that). Multiplayer was a fun and enjoyable part of the game so it's a massive shame it's not in it (especially as there was a whole multiplayer map which is bigger than the single player map). Perhaps one day it will be enabled.\nSo in conclusion, dear reader, should you get this game? Well, as I said, if nostalgia is your thing (and it is mine), and you want to reminesce about your childhood while playing a fun, casual but enjoyable RPG.... I would recommend it certainly at the current price. If you didn't play it originally, then the question is a bit harder to answer. Yes, there is a lack of depth. You can get party members, but there's no romancing them or talking to them to find out their story like in games such as Mass Effect, the game is very linear and there's only four skills, but it is very fun and easy to play. However, if you are used to playing RPGs like Skyrim, Mass Effect, the Witcher... unless you specifically have an interest in retro games or you enjoy casual style gaming, then perhaps it wouldn't necessarily be the game for you.\nTLDR:\nPros:\n- It's Dungeon Siege! If you liked it then, you'll probably like it now for nostalgic reasons at the very least\n- Amazing graphics for the time, not bad graphics even today\n- A huge range of randomly generated items\n- Atmospheric music\n- No loading screens\n- Easy to play, ideal if you just want a casual bit of Krug bashing\n- Works on Windows 10! (for me, and others at least)\nCons:\n- No multiplayer\n- Lacking in depth compared to many RPGs with only four skills and a linear progression\n- Not many sidequests", "hours": 2.9, "user_id": "76561197972411061", "username": "Samantha :]", "products": 96, "early_access": false}

It looks like the game comes with Legends of Aranna pre-installed. The problem with that is that LoA introduced a stealth nerf to the gameplay. The game is significantly easier with Legends of Aranna installed (though I can't really recall if it was the installation that did it, or if it depended on which .exe you used.)\nI always used to recommend playing on hard with LoA NOT installed, but it doesn't look like you'll have a choice now, except that if LoA IS making it easier, you will definitely want to play on hard not normal.

Of course the graphics are out dated but who really cares when the game brings you so much content that's enjoyable. There are A LOT of items in this game with different rarities ,there are 2 shops in every town and area so you can get better gear. You can be a warrior,an archer,a mage (nature or combat magic) or a hybrid determined by strength - warrior,dexterity - archer and intelligence - mage. You have the option to take other characters with you but I think they're a pain in the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665(you can steal items from the ones you get for free then leave them there hue hue hue), I like to be alone and strong. I always play as a warrior because that's what I did back in the day. A playthrough will last way more than 15 hours if you actually take a look at the game because it actually has secrets , easter eggs and puzzles that are pretty fun and they reward you with rare items. It actually has co-op multiplayer but I don't have much to say about it since I only tried it like 2 times and I didin't get to finish the game, it may not work. If you're playing for the first time you may want to play on medium because it's the most enjoyable difficulty. The game has different mobs and bosses for each area  you are in so you don't have to fight the same creatures for the entire game, you don't go back so you'll only see new places. You can play at 1920x1080 there are guides on steam about how to do it, also there is a DLC for this game called legends of the aranna and you can find guides for it as well easily, I really recommend the DLC because it's another campaign that lasts A LONG TIME as well, more than 7-10 hours anyway. The review is more for the game than the steam version but you can get this game on sale for less than 3 dollars.. just buy it.\nAnd remember...

Dungeons are way too long where you can spend hours seeing the same enemies and building blocks again and again. And the AI behaves pretty stupid. They have a very limited field of view and you can easily wake them up one by one or in small groups even when you are surrounded by them in larger halls.\nBut if you accidentally get into a larger group that hits you a lot: Your health is regenerating very fast. So fast that using health potions is rarily required. And you can find tons of them. Speaking of which there is sooo many loot you can find that it's hard to manage all this stuff and have enough space to get the crap to the next town for sale. Don't let them lie around because they vanish after some time (especially if you change in-/outdoor environments).\nAt least you can have donkeys in your party that have plenty of storage for all your loot. But then you carry even more stuff around that needs to be organized.\nFurthermore the story presentation is boring and you never have the feeling to care about people you meet. They are so dull. And quests are solved when you just did what you should do. That means you don't have to go back to report... it's like magic. This of course leads to a very linear experience. Also the levels are pretty linear. You can only move in restricted areas, you can't fall down and it's hard to die.\nVerdict:\nThere are some good concepts in this game but it isn't executed very well so it gets boring after several hours of playing and finally its only annoying. But playing should be fun and never feel like plain repetitive work, isn't it? Because otherwise you should rather start to work on something useful.", "hours": 17.2, "user_id": "76561197988375096", "username": "Robbson", "products": 934, "early_access": false}

DS 2 just didn't do it for me. I didn't like the story at all. The game was boring and tedious. DS 3, same thing, I just didn't like it. Just goes to show you that sometimes, the originals are the best, and that is certainly true with DS 1, for it kicks major booty. For a game that is from 2002, the graphics are excellent. I personally love the outdoor scenery. It's so vivid and colorful, and was nicely done. I sometimes find myself traveling along and stopping my party just to gaze at the wonderful detailed world. The game has a Night/Day Cycle, weather effects, an awesome sound track and superb ambient sounds. The game world really comes alive. But the best part of DS 1 is the story. It's one of the best I've played in a game, and the narrated cut-scenes are just great.\nSome like to compare this to Diablo II, but there is no comparison. Although Diablo II is one of the best games ever made, DS is nothing like it, at all. Diablo II is a dark fantasy hack and slash with very little RPG element. DS is an action fantasy RPG. There is much more than just hack and slash in this game. Diablo II gets very boring, very fast. It's just a click-fest with some quests, that's it.\nSome of the things I love about DS 1 is how (unlike Diablo), you don't need to keep clicking on an enemy to attack. I about wore my index finger out on Diablo II from clicking the mouse so much. The drop system is also good. Not too much, not too little. It's just right. And if you have the stand alone expansion, LOA (Legends of Aranna), the game is even better.\nThe Original Campaign is quite long, consisting of 9 Chapters to keep you well entertained. You will meet and talk to tons of people which have unique personalities. Many are voiced extremely well. The game also has a nice modding community.\nLastly, I really enjoy the many companions you can bring into your party. There are many to choose from. Some of them will join you for free, while others will cost you some coin. I'm not sure how anyone could give this game a bad rating. it doesn't deserve it.

Founded by Chris Taylor, who created such beloved games like Total Annihilation.\nDungeon Siege is a party based rpg. You play as a humble farmer who has his/her farm attacked by an evil race called the \"Krug\". Taking it upon themselves, you then go from town to town ridding the land of whatever evil you find on a journey to destroy the source of it. The plot to Dungeon Siege isn't particularly interesting nor particularly fleshed out or focused upon. It's a background distraction that serves to get you from place to place.\nWhat Dungeon Siege excels at is in the gameplay department. The entirety of the experience of Dungeon Siege is unabridged. It takes place in a world completely without loading screens. Even while transitioning from the overworld to dungeons. This is by far the most impressive thing the game does and it feels very authentic. Dungeon Siege feels like an odyssey, where you are constantly moving forward on a trek. It is also absurdly long and has an enormous amount of content with its optional multiplayer campaign (which is double the length of the singleplayer) and has an expansion pack which adds even more to the playtime.\nThe levelling system is very similar to something like Elder Scrolls, all of your stats level up based on using them. And levelling itself is automatic. Indeed the only real thing you can directly control with your character is what equipment they have and what spells they can use. This makes gameplay very fast and aside from fiddling with your inventory in shops, you spend little time outside of combat.\nDungeon Siege is a kind of mindless game at times. A lot of the combat feels very automated and you mostly just run in and watch your guys smack the enemies around for a little while and then loot bodies, very similar to older rpgs like Ultima. But this is one of the most memorable aspects of the game overall. It's a very comfy game where you just move forward on a journey as your guys pummel the crap out of everything.", "hours": 23.9, "username": "Silly/byte/", "products": 585, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": false}

When I first played Dungeon Siege I was really taken by the simplicity of the skills mechanic and the fact that once you are in the world there are no loading screens - you just constantly walk through one giant map. There's not much story to the game, just some serious grindy RPG action with some side quests thrown in for the completionists like myself.\nOne thing I originally liked about the game was that there aren't any confusing skill trees, just specialisations and attributes in which you can level up simply by doing things - hitting things with a stick gives you melee skill and mostly strength, while casting spells gives you magic skill and mostly intelligence, etc. This is now the very thing I dislike about the game. While it's nice and simple it does kind of make combat slightly boring as you don't have an array of special abilities to manage (well, none unless you have a mage). Sure, mages have spells which they can switch between, but only being able to actively switch between two spells without some complicated process and having no autocasts just gets tiresome. I still really love this game, but I think if it weren't for the nostalgia I probably wouldn't be enjoying as much as I am today.\nIf you played Dungeon Siege on its initial release and enjoyed it back then, then it might be worthwhile getting for another play through, but if you're new to the series I would recommend skipping over this one and starting with Dungeon Siege II, which has much better gameplay.

TOTALLY AND UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE!\nSo it was either too easy and boring, or impossible!\nEdit: Until I tried again, on \"normal\" later. Then the difficultly *did* seem \"normal\" as you'd expect. The difficulty levels had become about right.\nI also soon got fed up with the constant combats, often they were big closeup toe to toe melee brawls. Not many tactic needed, especially ranged tactics. Unless also oppenents are ranged attackers, then you can have ranged vs ranged fight. If they have melee attackers you are pretty much forced to switched to melee as well.\nThe maps can be claustraphobic, and often they are heavily cluttered with needless trees and bushes, often reducing your visibility to near zero.\nThe game world is NOT open world, despite it's best attempts at giving the illusion it is! It is thoroughly linear, linear as a book!\nThere's constant little nooks and crannies to explore that usually have more goodies, or rather junk, but the constant side-tracking to explore those gets tedious too! Those are optional of course.\nYou collect WAY too much junk as well. But again you can avoid doing this yourself.\nYou also end up with too large a party..... I've already got six people and two packmules! Looks like the party managment part of UI has space to handle another 8 members at least! It becomes exponentially more cumbersome as you add more beyond five or so members! Again you could choose to only maintain a small party. But I don't think the game allow that to be feasable. Later on I imagine you will NOT get far without your own personal horde!\nGraphics, sounds, music and storyline are all thoroughly humdrum!\nThe game's pattern is you just go from village to village, those villages being just checkpoints where you sell your junk, buy new junk, and get a few more pointless side quests, and progress the main storyline quest. You then embark, following a linear, long-winded, tedious, twisting turning path to the next village..... being assailed constantly on the way with boring, pointless combats.\nAt first I was deeming Dungeon Siege to be a 7/10 (B-), but I've since reconsired it a 5/10 (C-).\nI should've saved whatever I spent on this for a beer or two.\nAll the reviews are raving 10/10ers.

What this means is that once you start the game you are in for the journey of a lifetime as this game has the whole map connected throughout. So if you want to walk back well its about 20 mins both ways through each town. Yes each place is checkmarked with a town so it is convenient yet a pain to walk back...just keep going. And fourth yes the COMBAT, the combat in dungeon siege game focuses on four classes melee fighter, archer, nature mage and combat mage. each has its own sets of advantages and weaknesses mostly the magic but its fun as hell to experiment with. (Imo the best class is the archer to an extent) That said dungeon siege is my alltime favorite h/s rpg of the century, it tops any other for 2002 if you can name one. One thing i cannot leave out is the graphics, because for 2002 these graphics are really well done for a dx8 game. The scenery the weather and the atmosphere are perfect for this game. So thats how i feel about dungeon siege a game that gives me nostalgia everytime i play it.\nHopefully you will get as much fun as i did out of it.  p.s. i still love this game to DATE.", "hours": 6.7, "user_id": "76561198171128827", "username": "PyRaMiDhEaD", "products": 378, "early_access": false}

It was quite original for the wanna-beat-Diablo game of year 2003, but now it can attract only a small group of players with the taste for \"old-school games\". With the slight remark that DS is not as much old-school, being just an Arpg (with emphasis on Action and not RPG).\nHowever, for an action-rpg it has very promising setting, with the story based on the heritage of the legion of a great empire, lost in the world of magic, and, the most noticeable - the clever system of character grading, where you \"levelling\" your heroes only when using specific skills. Shoot the bow - become dexterous archer, cast spells - and take a gain in \"intelligence\" and magic power. Or, well, just bash'em all with a stick or shovel - as you start your adventure with the \"child of farmer lost his home\" background.\nOther than character evolution, Dungeon Siege \"key features\" are not likely to take your interest, as following the story turns out too thankless task. Well, unless we return to the levelling system - as there you can hire companions (up to 7) and train them to fit your tactics. So you can gather a somewhat standard band, like 2 melee, 2 archers, 2 mages, 2 healers... or to mix all the roles at your leasure. You can even hire 7 mules to carry your stuff, and fight your way all alone... if you that attracted to the DS, which I doubt.\nOh, well. Do I like Dungeon Siege? Sure, it brings some memories, and it is still not bad, if you know the drill. The interface was fine back in time, and it is still quite easy to get along. Although... the gameplay not aged that well, for my tastes. What was quite alright in time between Diablo 1 and 2, now feels... too plain. Bland even.\nCan I recommend it to the people who are new to the plethora of games, made more than 10 years back? Barely. People, who started to play in time of Mass Effect rising, certainly will be having hard times motivating themselves to play Dungeon Siege I. It was good back then, but now... now it's worth buying only if you know already what you're getting yourself into.\nNostalgia project, with personal mark 7/10 - for the fun time back in the days.

Those who pretend some Steam version can be downloaded with Legend of Aranna included are pure liars. It's illegal content to update Steam version with cracked no-cd version. Square Enix don't own rights about DS1 & DS2 add-ons.\n- you must replace your exe files to anothers at your own risk\n- some guide's owners add you as friend, help you to solve all problems about DSLOA install but when it's end, come to beg you for free gift game.

{"product_id": "39190", "page": 36, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2015-12-23", "text": "NOTE: this game as far as I can tell is one of the most sporadic games on Steam. For some people, the game doesn't work at all. Others cant play in high resolutions, others can't get the multiplayer to work, and others can't get the expansion to work. I personally was able to get the game running (turn your shadows down btw) flawlessly, and I was able to bruteforce anti aliasing with Nvidia control panel, so the game looks great for 2002. Your mileage will more than likely vary.\nDungeon Siege is a fantasy ARPG with the blandest \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing story in gaming history. First off, this game basically plays itself. My party consists of 6 melee characters and I just send in the tank first into a fight and watch 6 characters beat the snot out of monsters while I hit a hotkey to make some people heal every now and again. It feels like an arcade game, where it's pretty god damn easy a lot of the time, but every now and again has a difficulty spike to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you up.\nAside from the fact that I've won many fights without even pressing anything, and has almost 0 strategy, this game is fun as hell. If your fun comes from winning challenging fights through tactics and strategy, you won't like this game. If you like to just watch a bunch of guys beat the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665out of monsters for a minute, then grab loot, and repeat for an hour or so, you'll love this game. The best part about this game imo is that its a journey. You walk down a pretty linear path, with your party consisting of up to 8 people including pack mules, into different environments, killing\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in caves, and finally hitting a town after a few hours to unload all of those nifty lil items you got from the monsters you mugged. Then you do this bunch more times and you eventually win.\nHey, if you enjoyed watching your crew beat the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of monsters for like 10-15 (tbh i forgot how long this game is) hours, YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN. Theres a wonderful man who published a guide on how to get Legends of Aranna singleplayer expansion for the steam copy of Dungeon Siege in case yours didn't have it. This is basically more of the same, just going down a road beating the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665out of monsters with a new gang, but in different environments.\nHey, if you enjoyed the expansion pack or the main campaign, YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN. This game has a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in multiplayer mode with IP and LAN methods of connection, so you and I think 7 other people can go around a NEW world thats much more open than either of the singleplayer campaigns, and beat the\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665out of monsters for a while. The multiplayer map is roughly 2x as big as the main campaign's map, and is much more open. I have beaten the multiplayer with someone and it was great. I haven't tried any, but there are mods that allow you to play the multiplayer campaign, solo, with a full squad of 8 characters.\nIts a pretty mindless journey of an ARPG, but if you want to just watch 1-8 people mug monsters for loot for a while, or do it with some buds, this game is great. Just remember this game does whatever the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 it wants in terms of it functioning.", "hours": 12.5, "username": "Cap'n Red Ivan\ud83c\udf55", "products": 405, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

Dungeon Siege 1 is old.  It came out in 2002, and the graphics are reflective of its age.  The gameplay itself is amazing however, it's a great RPG from days long past, and the ability to have up to eight party members was actually a breath of fresh air.  There are some definite balance issues, especially with how effective mass melee is.  Still, it provided a great atmosphere and RPG experience, with fun leveling mechanics.  The ability to change characters are you go is actually fun, although it felt like specialization was almost always superior.  The loot system had a few flaws, but overall was great.\nIt begins rather slow, and the first level farm + forest levels felt rather tedious.  After you begin to immerse yourself, the experience takens on a better form.  It feels almost liek Baldur's Gate, with a bit less character and world building.  For it's time, I think it was an incredible game, and I wish I would have played it back then, I think I would have found it amazing.  Despite that, I think if you are a fan of RPGs, this is a fun Action RTS with minor questing.  Some of the quests are more difficult, but in general it's focused entirely on the action and the character building.  While some later battles do require micromanagement, the game itself it's very long or difficult.\nI played on medium difficulty and finished the game in 14 hours, while taking a leisurely pace.

It has a great lore, gameplay, mechanics, beautiful world design, was moddable, etc., and was ahead of it's time when released. The graphics aren't super great, but it came out in 2000, so you really can't blame the developers. And the score is one of a kind, music like no other <3 I would reccomend this game to anyone.\nHOWEVER.\nThe steam release of this game is downright unacceptable. The game does not run on newer computers without fiddling of the game files after dowload, nothing hard in any way, but one should simply be able to jump right in. A game so grand deserves at least that much. And even when you do that, the game is still very hard to play. The screen flashes, parts of the HUD are not where they should be, and mouse clicks to not register in the correct location. These problems are due to the game being out of date and a simple update would make this game enjoyable once more.\nAnother thing I dislike is the fact that the multiplayer campaign is inaccessable in the steam release. There is a whole other fully fleshed-out world and a more in-depth character creation system that can only be accesseed via the multi-player tab.\nIf it weren't for these two issues, I'd say it's more than worth it's price.\nI'd like to request a developer make a modern remake/remastering of this game, make something along the same lines (because DS2 and DS3 are far too different and simplified in a way that makes them not enjoyable) or if someone could suggest a similar game to this that actually works, I'd be very appreciative.", "hours": 16.2, "user_id": "76561198145971926", "username": "Arcteeker", "products": 21, "early_access": false}

Besides that, the plot AND locations are pretty much identical to Dungeon Siege 3 but the graphics, controls, and AI are much better there.  So get Dungeon Siege 3 instead; you'll be happier with that one.\nThat said, if you really are looking for an outdated party-based dungeon-crawling RPG then this one isn't really a bad choice.  You start out ALONE but you can later recruit other warriors (all AI controlled) and/or donkeys that don't fight but have much more inventory space to carry stuff.  You can have up to 7 or 8 (I forget) people and mules in your group at any time; they all fight on screen together.  There are more recruitable characters than there are spots on your team, too.  A mule and a person take up the same space on your team, so you can either have 2 mules and 6 people, or 1 mule and  people, or 8 people without any mules.  You can only actively control one player at a time but you can switch your choice to another character (even one of the mules) at any time.  You can also give one or several of your party members individual commands, such as telling three people to attack a strong enemy and then telling the other five to stay back and let the mage heal them for a minute.\nEach character can develop various skills, and it's ENTIRELY up to you which ones to develop.  Warriors can use swords, maces, axes, etc. to smash foes and they use a lot of the strength stat.  Combat mages can hurl fireballs and summon creatures to kill stuff.  Nature mages can heal the party AND they have a few solid attack spells.  At least one nature mage (preferably two) is a MUST.  Both mage types run off of the intelligence stat.  Archers use bows to rain destruction from a distance and they use the dexterity stat.  Honestly though, bows are pretty crappy until you're almost 2/3 done with the game.  Only characters with high dexterity can use a decent bow.  Only characters with high strength can equip decent armor and smash/slash weapons.  Intelligence increases the effectiveness of magic spells; mage skill levels only determine which spells you are allowed to use.\nThere are no \"skill points\" to allocate.  It's all automatic.  You set the type of attack the character will use, and they use that one attack type until you tell them to switch to a different one.  CAUTION:  magic attacks use up magic power (the blue bar) and if you leave mages set to spell attacks they will stand there and do NOTHING until their MP recharges.  So you might have to manually change your mages to archers or warriors when their MP runs low.  Whichever type of attack they use, that's the one that will earn \"experience\" and slowly build up to the next level.", "hours": 23.5, "username": "dj_moyer", "products": 130, "early_access": false}

This is a Diablo like dungeon crawler, action RPG hack and slash.\nYou start out with one character, which you create yourself in classic RPG fashion, and set out on your journey. Along the linear path, you meet you adventures who will join your party, by the end of the game you will have up to eight different party members, and there are three different classes which your characters can take the role of, melee, range and mage. I found the melee and range characters levelled up a lot quicker than the mage but it didn't seem to make that much difference in the grand scheme of things.\nYou can really get into micromanaging your party once you get a couple of members, the game allows you to pause real time action to let you give orders for your characters. You can also just sit back and let the AI work it out with the very initiative behaviour system; you can set each characters default behaviour for certain circumstances which gives you the hands off approach.\nThe graphics show their thirteen year age here; although back when this game was originally released, this was one of the best looking games of its time. Bare that in mind before you judge the pixels!\nThe game play is very linear, there is no reason to back track in this game as enemies do not respawn, and you just need to push on forward. The zones are nicely put together, with lots of different hidden areas off the main track, allowing you to explorer and find hidden treasures or maybe a small side boss.  The dungeons themselves are massive, you can find yourself getting lost in all of the corridors; this isn't a bad thing though as you just keep on squishing all the enemies till you find your path again. You are playing a dungeon crawler, so you should expect that.\nI've been playing Dungeon Siege for about twenty odd hours now, this was to complete the whole game including side quests; as with all games of this type, it's highly recommended you do these as they give you extra rewards and more story to immerse yourself in.\nEven on newer operating systems I didn't have any technical issues, it was a shame I couldn't ramp the resolution right the way up, but I am sure if you look out there you can find mods that allow you to do so.\nIn this day and age, Dungeon Siege will only appeal to a certain audience, newer gamers will probably instantly dislike it because of the way it looks. However, if you want to try out a classic RPG game with tons of content, then Dungeon Siege is a pretty good starting point which you won't be disappointed in.\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I started playing this title when it was first released, and I still find myself coming back to it after over a decade.\nThe control and combat system is pretty intuitive, and camera only bites you when you have your back to a steep wall (extreme zoom).  That isn't much of a problem, however, since you can turn the camera around with ease.  The party manipulation options are somewhat in-depth, with multiple selections for formations, movement ranges, and aggression.  Probably more than what's needed to play through the game, but workable nonetheless.\nAnother great feature is the loading screens (or lack therof).  You load once at the beginning, and the game \"streams\" the entire world without a pause; the entire map from start to finish.  The maps are not huge by any means, but big enough that this is an impressive feature given when this game was released.\nCharacter development is also interesting; your party members develop thier combat effectiveness by how you use them (melee, ranged, caster, etc.).  You can also switch fighting styles at any time, just be mindful that a jack-of-all is a master-of-none (unless you grind all your skills on the multiplayer map).\nThe single-player campaign has just enough content to keep you focused on why you're stomping your way through hordes of hostile creatures, and doesn't overload you with too much \"lore.\"  The multi-player offers an additional map that you can use, and both the single and multi maps can be used for it.\nThere is also a massive mod community for this game, which also keep it alive for those who own computers that have left this old title in the dust.\nLike I said, it is downright fun (and cheap, too).", "hours": 0.4, "user_id": "76561198044988512", "username": "Pz79", "products": 128, "early_access": false}

I have to say it was a great journey back in time to a more classic feeling game with a wide array of settings.  The challenge was fairly good and would have been more challenging if I had played on hard mode.  I loved how a lot of the battles consisted of a large number of enemies and that you could have a large group of party members.  Some of the dungeons are very long (Sometimes I felt like I was playing a solo World of Warcraft classic style dungeon because of the roles of the party members, large battles and the length of dungeons.).  It was also nice to see that the items you could buy in the store were actually useful and that you would want to buy them.  There are so many ways to play this game that my playstyle of trying to be everything was hindered.  That isn't really a bad thing.  You could play this multiple times, being different types of characters, though I'm not really one to play through a game again.  I like to move on and try something new.\nThe music (in the majority, is very nice) reminded me a lot of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.  Some are repetative though (very short and then it repeats), making those annoying.  I didn't realize that it was the same composer until today.  Early on, some of the voices were annoying, but a lot were interesting and sometimes funny.  Hearing the click of selecting or opening a persons inventory became annoying, fast (and you did this a lot).\nAt the beginning of the game, the amount of inventory space is annoying (not enough).  It was a long way to the first town.  Also, with very large areas between two shop areas, you will find your inventory full and have to travel back long distances to sell things.  One other thing deals with organization of inventory.  I would group my health and mana potions together, seperately.  When I would use them, it wouldn't use them in order from top to bottom.  So, I ended up with a scattered mess that I would end up having to organize again.  In a shop with spells to purchase, it would have also been nice to sort and seperate the two types of magic (nature and combat).  It would have also been nice to be able to grab multiple items in your inventory to move around.\nWhen I would have multiple characters's windows open or just a shop along with one character, the inventory windows for the group would appear extra small (with shop window open this actually only occurred with the pack mules).  It made it harder to do what I wanted.\nIt took me to long to figure out how to clearly get everyone to play their roles in battle (some wouldn't move or attack, even though I had set things to do so).  I eventually figured out I needed to select a character and then hit ctrl-A to select everyone or press ctrl and click on the members you wanted, to get things to work properly.  This was after figuring out what the different battle options did and setting them for each of the party members.  It is also to easy to click on other characters, which then deselects everyone else.\nIf you want to take any screenshots and not have the adventurer's handbook open, you will need to go into the input options and change your hotkey for the handbook.  The default screenshot button is F12, which is also the adventurer's handbook.\nSometimes it is hard to get all your party on a transport elevator before it moves.  Then you have to wait to get everyone together.\nIt would have been nice if they had labeled the area you were currently in on the map and when you are entering a new area.\nI had a few crash to desktop occurrances and exceptions while playing through the game.  The last crash I had was a memory error where the game apparently didn't deallocate correctly.  This was in Castle Ehb.\nI disliked the dropping of a party members complete inventory onto the ground when it dies.  It creates a mess of text on the screen (you could turn the text off), as well as having to keep up with who was carrying what.  I also hit max gold and then when I would sell things, it would drop the gold on the ground.  This eventually created a pile of text.  I'm not sure if it was play style, to much stuff for the amount of gold one can carry or that to much gold can be found in chests or dropped from an enemy.  I also came back to the dropped pile of gold one time, after many, and found it gone.\nThe pack mules don't follow behind my party in a speedy fashion during battles, which can sometimes cause problems of them getting out of the way from being hit by an enemy.\nAs far as the ending goes, I had to watch it on YouTube.  I find this a very bad thing.  When you defeat the final boss and it explodes, it drops loot and then the screen goes black.  You are then returned to the start menu.  In the non-steam version, you are sent to a black screen with text and narration to end the story.  Then, you get the credits.  After this, you are returned to the game to be able to pick up the loot and do as you please (play multiplayer or expansions).  I guess since the steam version doesn't come with multiplayer and the expansions, they cut this out.  It still should have gone through the ending credits and then returned you to the game to pick up the loot.\nThough it seems I mentioned more of the negative aspects to this game, it is a very good game overall.  It is definately worthy of being played.  Hopefully steam will release a fix for the ending and sparse crashes.\nRating\n9/10", "hours": 84.2, "user_id": "76561198011981528", "username": "harrisonhash", "products": 70, "early_access": false}

I somehow actually stilll have the intact box and CDs sitting around in storage somewhere.\nYou control up to eight characters at once, including a pack mule to act as extra inventory space. Characters can be specialized in a few ways, with two different schools of magic, ranged, or melee attacks. If you are feeling saucy, you can combine and make a hybrid class, such as a spellsword or some kind of other variant. You can succeed with nearly any party combination, so there isn't much pressure to min/mix the perfect party combination.\nCombat is very micro-heavy, with lots of little subtle things needed to keep your party fighting in top shape. Although the game starts slow, you'll very quickly end up with a party of four to six characters and you'll be slashing through huge parties of monsters. You'll need to pay attention to what spells are being cast, positioning of your characters, and more; it's very consuming and very satisfying when you get through an encounter unscathed.\nWith a modern eye, though, there are a lot of rough parts to the game. Camera control is a pain, and controlling your party can get really overwhelming when you have a ton of characters. With casters, it can be clunky to switch between spells in combat.

Even when loaded outside of Steam, regardless of compatibility choice through Windows, etc.\nI purchased 3 copies of the Complete to play with my family over LAN, as anyone would know reading the Steam forums prior to purchasing anything, you'd quickly understand that Steam disabled the Multiplayer options by default. Configuring this is easily accomplished via command lines. zonematch=true. There are a list of command line codes all over the web, which will allow you hard change screen resolution, skip the intro, etc.  And if you forgot or didn't know, remember, no saving in MP mode. *sigh*  Personally this is the epic fail on this game.  You basically have to grind an entire day through each \"chapter\" completing all the quests so that you don't have to complete them again later, unless you want to...  Otherwise, everytime you exit out of MP and quit, the next time you hunker down for some MP over TCIP/LAN guess what, yup.. cleared maps & all mobs reload.\nCharacters save as does their gear earned/collected.\nThat all being said, it is extremely buggy in MP mode. Even more so than it EVER was.\nOne of the rigs used (oldest) is a 2010 2ghz P4 with max ram & 1gb GTX280 pcie, running vista x86. Bottom of the barrel, but the same rig I ran my hard copy of this game, flawlessly for 120+hrs on this game. Both single player and multiplayer. However on the Steam version recently purchased, you can't get more than 15-30 minutes with out the infamous Exception Detected crash fault..\nGranted it doesn't crash on single player mode, there is an obvious detection of wonkiness in the AI & game mechanics \"glitches\" picking up items/opening/activating issues. Very annoying, but totally playable.\nThese issues are 100% repeatable on both a 1yr old Windows 8 laptop with 8gb DDR3 & AMD graphcis as well as a Top tier Windows 7 gaming rig.\nAs for the perks? This game is still classy, beautiful in regards to many modern games, true to the fundementals of fantasy games, with some valuable lessions tucked in. Stop clicking yer brains out and enjoy some real time tactical fun even on Normal Mode. Want a challenge and step up to Hard and see how far you can get with only yer main character. Gotta love watching yer corpse explode and all your items shoot all over the ground. *laugh* Oh yeah, save much? ;)\nThe Music is awesome, it's Jeremy Soule for crying out loud.\nAs for the story and length of the game, it's old school, so if you think your going to beat the game in a single sitting, too into watching other gamers playing games instead of playing them yourself, just log out of Steam and go back to crushing candy..  Best 3x5$ I've spent in a looonnnggg time.. :D\n***UPDATED: Take that back, crashed on SP mode upon speaking to random town folk...\nAwesome...  *sigh*", "hours": 39.2, "username": "superpyter", "products": 449, "early_access": false}

Dungeon Siege should be forgotten, as it has two major flaws with the game.\nThe Bad:\n1. Easy: The game is too due to having regen health, 40 million health potions throwned at you, and the foes you faced being too damn weak.\n2. Boring: The game throws several dozens opponents at you on a small map. So every few steps, some might pop out, and you ever kill them or run to attract more of them. But the biggest sin is combat, as melee fighters just auto attack, which leads the game to be walk spot here, sit there as your guys hacks every 200 people on screen.\nThe Good:\n1. Presentation: The game has good music (because of Jeremy Soule being the composer), very good gwaphix (for its time, really out of date now), and the game is not buggy.\nConclusion: Just shock how this piece of\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665game is beloved by many people, and how this game made a franchise.

To some people who only favor the new generation of video games... Not so much.\nDungeon Siege is mainly a game you would play for nostalgia; or if you're just a fan of mysterious, old school RPGs that don't hold your hand or if you're just a RPG collector in the first place, and seek a new game to add to your collection.\nSince Dungeon Siege was the first game I ever played, my review may bare some bias: but hopefully, that shall not be the case.\nDungeon Siege MIGHT not have the most advanced combat system, but with the amount of interesting characters you can control (8 at maximum, if I'm correct) such as a dwarf, an archer, a alcoholic yet skilled warrior and even a half giant (in the expansion pack!) you can create a team of adventurers with all kinds of strategy and you can find and loot all kinds of accoutrement to independantly equip each party member you are controlling.\nThe game may seem very linear at first but if you're willing to playthrough the game over one time you'll discover many secret locations and party members which you may not have discovered from the first playthrough, something special Dungeon Siege always captured me with was the mystery. SPOILER ALERT: In one area, you find extremely large (seemingly dragon) bones... Who knows what that was before it died? I suppose we'll never know.\nYou have three classes: Melee, Ranged or Magic. There are many spells, swords (or even clubs or hammers or axes) and bows (or crossbows in the expansion pack) to collect, and a large amount of armor to follow.\nNot to mention the brilliant voice acting and enchanting sound effects which if you played Dungeon Siege awhile ago shall capture your heart with nostalgia.\nDungeon Siege is overall an AMAZING game. The first playthrough you will find incredible since you won't know what to expect, then there's always the expansion. The only complaints I have is that the multiplayer is disabled, I wish there were more party members and it wasn't as linear (The secret locations and party members does get slightly limited, there are many side quests though too!)\nThe final verdict for Dungeon Siege is... A 8 out of 10. The game is incredible (a 10/10 for the first playthrough) but there are a few flaws that could keep someone from playing.\nUntil the next review, seeya!", "hours": 13.1, "username": "ScorpioTheConqueror", "products": 122, "found_funny": 5, "early_access": false}

EDIT: Game is of quite sufficient length.  Longest mazes I've ever played.]\nFun game from 2002.  I started as a huge Diablo 2 fan.  I'm catching up and enjoying the era of now-cheap RPG/action games before upgrading my system to run more modern games.   Just so I don't spend before I really need to.  (currently a Radeon X-600)  This includes the Dungeon Siege series + Fallout, Torment, Torchlight 1/2, Baldur's Gate, Titan Quest, Morrowind, Oblivion ...before hitting Skyrim, D3, etc.  Bottom line: In many ways, this fits in the older era.  -- So, those are your ganeral Action/RPG + hack/slash comparisons.\n** Graphics:  It's 3-D.  Steam graphics are representative.  Sure, it's dated, but that doesn't ruin the game for me.\n** Team: You can manage 8 characters drawn from three general classes from which you can customize: Melee, ranged, mage.   Two kids of mages: Combat, Nature.  Former is mostly offensive; the latter mainly includes healing spells, etc.   Buffs and spell selection are typical.\n** Multiplayer: No multiplayer anymore.\n** Loot: Regular items for purchase and souped up loot (some have tradeoffs).  One of your 8 chars can be a moving mule: non fighting with 3 times inventory.  ... One /very/ cool minor feature is casting a \"transmute\" spell that turns items into gold on the spot at a fraction of the value.  Thus, there's no need to leave loot unless you want to leave mapping markers or don't want to bother with the super-cheap stuff.\n** Overview of Attributes with examples: 3 areas: Strength (perks: melee combat damage, eventually wear better armor), Dex (ranged damage), Intel (mana pool, spell damage, mage armor).  -- Dex provides minimal advantages.\n** Character development is actually more complex than usual.  Use a melee weapon, you build strength.  -- but you also gain a slight boost in dex and a very slight intel boost.  Reverse is true.  This enables your ranged character to VERY gradually build strength for slightly better armor.  Although you delay advanced specializion perks, I like a little flexibility.\n[EDIT: Recommendation: Specialization for fighters.  Don't broaden their attributes/abilities beyond strength.  ...Be very cautious about mage/fighters.]\n** Replayability?  The only replayability factors would be different party composition, which IMO is little to none.  No randomness at all.  I think it's a great one and done.\n** Monsters: Once you clear an area, the monsters don't respawn.  I expect that next game, they'll be in the same place.\n** Other: You can remap keys like a bandit.  You can raise/lower difficulty.  Quick save capability.\nNote one can purchase overview maps (which includes secret area locations), but it does NOT show caves since they're underground.  Sometimes unlit areas aren't obvious, both of which are authentic and nice touches.  I haven't investigated mods.\nEDIT: Just completed the game (12/12/14).  This game has a let-down for an ending.  Still worth the purchase, but oh my goodness, Steam version has removed all sense of closure!  Does this matter?  Think of it as a 98% great game, and subsequently see a therapist for any emotional damage.  I'm going to install DS2 now. :)\n** Advice: If you like the standard old ARPG like the above, get this game.  Cheap Steam bundles are occasionally available at humblebundle, gamersgate, bundlestar, etc.  Probably will hit gog soon if you want no DRM.

By swinging a melee you get STRength and your melee skills increase. Casting spells (combat and nature magic schools) gives you INTelligence. Using ranged weapons gives you DEXterity.

The dungeons feel overly long, as if they extended gameplay through the sheer length they make your characters walk.  The combat is pretty bland.  I went almost all archers with my squad since, at the hardest difficulty, 1: Melee gets decimated and 2: It costs no resources unlike spells.  It does fairly well but the gameplay is just blah.\n99% of the item drops fall into 2 categories:  Items you can't wear and Items you can't use.  Either all of the drops have stat requirements that are way beyond what my characters can use or they aren't even close to being an upgrade.  It's almost exclusively vendor trash.\nLeveling:  It's pretty much a use a skill get some auto xp gains system.  There is no decision making other than what to use.  I chose to focus on a single discipline rather than jack-of-all-trades.  That said, since I am ranged, my armor selection is pretty\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665since it's based on str and int for useage requirements.  The choices are poor even if I DID have the appropriate attributes to wear said equipment.\nQuests:  I'm sorry, there are quests?  Basically it's talk to the 3 npcs you'll encounter per chapter then walk linearly through a massive dungeon crawl, completing the quests.  Hardly what I'd call quests.  There's not really even a reward for doing them that I can see.\nIt comes down to this: I am playing this through JUST to beat it and play it, but it's not very fun.  I was hoping for a NWN-type game and it comes off as an overly long poor diablo clone with a bigger party and crappier combat.  My playthrough on the hardest difficulty is basically, set my party to hold/engage freely/strongest target, have them all ranged, then pull with a single guy into range and have the mobs explode.  I move the party about 3 feet then repeat.  Ranged is kind of necessary since even melee die in 3-4 hits and you can get swarmed by 5+ if you aren't careful.  It's a slow slog through dungeons that seem to never end.  Since I bought Dungeon Siege 1, 2, and 3 I am hoping the sequels will be much better.\nDo I regret buying this?  No, I paid like $2.99 or whatever the super Steam sale was, can't regret that.\nDo I enjoy this game?

I can only recommend it to die hard fans of hhaack & slash .\nWhere to start?\nFirst of all the textures are watered down and are not pleasent to watch at all. I found myself using the overhead map just to avoid looking at those low res textures all the time.\nYes it does add that oh so fascinating idea of progressing your character by using either a weapon or a spell. The idea is very interesting at start but when you actually get to play the game over a few hours you realize that only melee chars are viable in this game. Magic and ranged are practically useless or at least utterly inferior to melee chars.\nThe first few maps have a really slow progression curve,which is both satisfying at first but gets absolutelly frustrating way too fast. You get too many pointless drops and too little gold to actually progres the first quarter of the game and right after the game literally starts throwing thousands of gold at you and the sense of progression is really out of the question.\nAll monster drops dont really mean anything because you get tons of gold to buy all the best gear from the next shop. And by gear i mean just get the weapon with most damage for your melee chars and you are good to go. All the other items are absolutely pointless.\nOh and speaking of chars,its all fun  when you have one char,and get 2-3 more..but soon enough you get a total of 8, leaving inventory management a burden. Everything you pickup is esentially worthless anyway. You only need the weapon with most damage in the next shop for each of your chars and to fill your inventory with health potions.\nYes only health potions ,because the mana potions are redundent since most of the wortwhile spells in the game cost your entire mana pool in 2-3 casts. There are several spell options but all of them are completely pointless as most of them try out a tactical point of view to a game that literally throws hundreds of mobs at you for no particular purpose.\nThere is no feeling of progress nor of getting the next best item.\nThe story is almost non-existent,battle the generic utter evil that plagues the land.\nThe environments are very detailed though and vary a lot,unfortunatelly both the environments and the enemies fall in the generic hack & slash creatures and zones and neither stand out.\nThe music is probably the best part of this game.The main theme is one of the most memorable music display in my game experience, which is both a good and a bad thing. Why a bad thing? Because there is only one god damn piece of music that  gets recycled all over the game.It is sad to see a game stand out only through its music.\nSpeaking of sound, the sound effects just do their job but they are utterly forgetable and lackluster as well. The voiceovers ? They almost dont exist at all which is not helping with the immersion at all.\nThe story is poor to say the least,itt is another generic farmer that starts out to help a friend and ends up saving the kingdom, so unique .\nGetting back to gameplay. The progressing system is pretty cool as an idea as it does not limit you to a specific class.\nThe stats progression is insanely slow and limits the item usability tremendously. A huge amount of mage/ranger items require a high amount of strength for example,which esentially limits their use.\nAll this can be overlooked if it werent for the almost complete automatization of the game. You just need to run in and click in the middle of a group of mobs and the game will take care of the rest. You just need to have a potion handy from time to time,which does not make it challenging at all.\nThe game is overall all too tedious and it throws too many enemies at once making certain areas feel like they need an eternity to finish off\nConclusion? Dungeon Siege is awfully slow paced,non immersive and tedious to a point where you just stop caring about the quests,story and gameplay overall.

Bloated loot system with no town portal to sell said items, a difficulty step missing between normal and easy (easy is too easy and normal is punishing even at higher levels), scant story and an enviromnment that obscures almost every monster to come your way.  The game almost plays better being constantly on the map rather than the normal top down game mode, the party member's battle AI is atrocious, the pathing is specious at best.  Traps are either very deadly or inconsequential with no in-between.  The textures of everything blend into a hodge podge.  The battles do better than constant pausing (a la Baldur's Gate), which can be done at any time, but is really only suitable for corner cases.\nBasically, any advancement that had happened since this game was released casts a pall over the game which I think would have been much more revolutionary at the time than it is now.  It's old school and not in a fun, engaging way, but more of an, \"I'm only hanging out watching my guys fight just in case I need to press the 'heal' or 'mana' keys\" or \"I said kill the freaking wizard/cleric that keeps ressurecting the monsters, you dolts!\" kind of experience.", "hours": 46.1, "username": "Kalnaur", "products": 608, "early_access": false}

Although it requires some coaxing to get functional on a modern OS it has aged remarkably well and mainly only suffers from somewhat wonky controls (which get worse when you've more party members to manage), a rather awkward camera, and some exception crashes; though in my case that last one plagued the bandit cave area so horribly that it effectively ended my campaign, so your mileage may vary.\nThe graphics are still pretty passable and in some cases still quite beautiful, no complaints aside from character display UI issues in the inventory screen probably caused by playing on a higher resolution than the game was designed for. Throughout the game, a fairly dark, earthy theme is most-often employed.\nThe game features an excellent, genre-appropriate, soundtrack composed by Jeremy Soule (\n,\n,\n...) but has some weird sound effects issues wherein an item drop sound may play when no items are dropped. Some basic, often unconvincing, voice acting is employed for important characters.\nA pretty standard fantasy storyline that doesn't really stand out in any way, although it's not unbearable, it is very linear and can get boring pretty quickly, making it hard to play for extended periods of time.

The experience of this game is probably more akin to the idea of a Lord of the Rings type quest than anything more computer-game/zone-based, because as I have mentioned before you really get the feeling that you are blazing your own path, one that only occasionally intersects with civilization. Echoing ice caverns full of crystal avatars fill you with apprehension as the prospect of questing for hours without seeing the light of day is very real and a gameplay element in itself, and once you escape a gruelling forest zone midway through the game you are confronted with a seemingly impassable swamp, rather than the stereotypical sunny metropolis populated with traders.\nDungeon Seige is also a difficult game - an example being the afore-mentioned swamp which pits your squad - albiet experienced and doughty - against hordes of difficult creatures marshalled by witches and targetting your most vulnerable members.\nThe difficulty of the game, and the sheer distances of travel involved, is counterbalanced by the joys of a steadily improving squad. You have the choice to ally yourself with various squad members - more than you can ever hold in your total squad, in a feature that reminds one of the Baldur's Gate series and adds to the sense of blazing one's own path - and you can't wait for your hitherto skinny and ragged heroes and squad members to stumble across great shields, shiny helmets or keen longswords. Improving your skills relies simply on using related items - keep using a one handed longsword and a mini experience bar built in to your 'melee item' combat slot will reflect your character's steady improvement in it's use, ditto for ranged, nature and fire spells.\nIn summary of this ragged and ill-formatted review (for which I beg your forgivness - I am partially distracted) I assure you that this game is a worthy investment of time and emotion - love your squad, covet your packmule, listen to every word of pre-recorded dialogue and seek out all encounters, because you are living through a bonafide high fantasy advanture, and it does, eventually, end.", "hours": 35.0, "user_id": "76561198007539033", "username": "The Nac Mac Feegle", "products": 173, "early_access": false}

Watch every step, keep an ear out for ambient sounds which may be clues of a coming ambush, and don't rush in to grab loot unless you're sure your exit is clear!\nRPG aspects are a bit like the Elder Scrolls series, you get better at what you do most, and the skills that go with that.

When I first played Dungeon Siege I was really taken by the simplicity of the skills mechanic and the fact that once you are in the world there are no loading screens - you just constantly walk through one giant map. There's not much story to the game, just some serious grindy RPG action with some side quests thrown in for the completionists like myself.\nOne thing I originally liked about the game was that there aren't any confusing skill trees, just specialisations and attributes in which you can level up simply by doing things - hitting things with a stick gives you melee skill and mostly strength, while casting spells gives you magic skill and mostly intelligence, etc. This is now the very thing I dislike about the game. While it's nice and simple it does kind of make combat slightly boring as you don't have an array of special abilities to manage (well, none unless you have a mage). Sure, mages have spells which they can switch between, but only being able to actively switch between two spells without some complicated process and having no autocasts just gets tiresome. I still really love this game, but I think if it weren't for the nostalgia I probably wouldn't be enjoying as much as I am today.\nIf you played Dungeon Siege on its initial release and enjoyed it back then, then it might be worthwhile getting for another play through, but if you're new to the series I would recommend skipping over this one and starting with Dungeon Siege II, which has much better gameplay.

Spending well over 500 hours into its singleplayer and online multiplayer (now defunct -- LAN works great though), I never realized how much I would come to miss this game.\nA classic dungeon crawler where you're not limited by classes or levels. You can be whatever you want, a pure melee character, an archer, a mage, a combination of two, or all of the above. You have the ability to choose how you level up your skills. Instead of levels, there's strength, dexterity, and intelligence. These act as your levels towards what you want to use in combat, and progressively increase through combat. This is different from the timeless classic of Diablo 2, however has a great leveling system that's sure to let you play however you'd like. The storyline is wonderful, and with co-op multiplayer, it adds on more difficulty so your not running around finding too easy.\nUnfortunately, this doesn't come included with Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna, but if you happen to have a copy, you can install it over Steam's installation (plus with a little renaming of game executables) and be able to play it through Steam.\nOne of the downsides is that since its been over 11 years that Dungeon Siege has been released, multiplayer is now defunct. In Dungeon Siege, you'll find that the Multiplayer button gives you the message \"Disabled\". Is all hope lost? Of course not. By adding the launch parameter \"zonematch=true\" to your game, you can access multiplayer LAN and direct connection games without the use of warez, cracks, or patches. Its a shame that you need to bypass that message just for direct and LAN capabilities, but it gets the job done, and it still works perfectly.\nI would definitely recommend this game for anyone who's a fan of dungeon crawlers, especially playing them with friends, and for those who are looking to try something new.

It is a gem in the rough, lackluster hack 'n' slash genre.  Some of it is nostalgia, sure, but most of all it is a quality that whispers softly to those that will listen.\nThe most accurate and common description praises Dungeon Siege as being atmospheric.  The music from the now esteemed Jeremy Soule is top notch, fitting the game's open scenery, environments, dungeons, and caves very well.  The often peaceful music of the open outside landscape fits well in the different environments (wood, snow, desert, swamp, etc.) and contrasts with the sudden tense quiet of many caves and dungeons.\nThe other thing about Dungeon Siege, which I mentioned, is that it rises above the rest of the genre, simply.  Other games feel like an endless cycle to get a quest to go in this cave where you kill an unremarkable boss and destroy the crates only to find yourself looking at a bunch of junk.  So much junk.  And then the only thing you ever equip are the occassional super items that the boss happened to drop for your class.\nOk, so Dungeon Siege is also an endless cycle of wading through the countless monsters, minions, and grunts of the local denizens.  But what Dungeon Siege does is a journey on a highly linear path that winds through the wilderness of those monsters.  It's the same in the sense that it's another screen full of those enemies and you gotta punch through them.  But it really makes you feel relieved as you emerge from that dungeon and think, \"wow, that was a long dungeon, I'm really glad I got outta there.\"  The crate and barrel smashing is not as dull when they may explode, breaking others in the radius, and arrow traps.  Seriously, when is the last time a crate fired an arrow at you?\nEnemies will spawn from bushes on the side of the path.  Tiny swarms of little spiders skitter from passages on the ceiling to rush you.  They ambush you from grating in the floor and in the wall.  Small mage creatures appear on the edges of the snowy hills.  Ice creatures will shatter their frosty pillars and surge toward you.  Goblins go at you with...oops no spoilers.\nAlthough it may get tedious (if you let it) at times, you lead a party of up to eight(!) adventurers.  The story is the same cliche but I think executes it well.  It is however, sparse and far between.  Most of the game is in the journeying bit.  My favorite dialog from this game from a cranky mountain shopkeeper (maybe it's just me):\n\"Who are you then?!  Another of that short goblin's cussin' errand runners?  You tell that little green snotball...\"\nThe graphics are quite dated, and if you aren't someone who played games from the 90's period, you may not think they look good.  However, the environment still has a lot of detail that you might not realize at the first impression.\nI recommend playing this game for between two and five hours in a session, although I have been guilty of spending ten hours for several days.  If you enjoy the genre, I believe Dungeon Siege is a great pick.  Although the age of the game is apparent (there are no abilities), the sequel, Dungeon Siege 2, is also very good and has includes those more modern ideas in the gameplay.", "hours": 21.5, "username": "Bryff", "products": 341, "early_access": false}

In that respect, it is as sandboxy as Elder Scrolls. You gain skill by doing things, which allows you to do them better and equip better equipment.
