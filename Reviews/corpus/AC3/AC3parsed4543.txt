I like this game a lot, the graphics are really nice and interacting with your environment is what youd expect from an AC title. I do feel like the story line could have used some more polishing up, the main character seems to straddle the line and never really defines himself as an Assassin. He takes up the code, it seems, only out of a sense of necessity not out of real duty. The ending was a bit weird, but I hope its just because its a cliffhanger and that well get a proper ending to the series in a future title. This game is fun, but you wouldnt be missing out on much if you waited for it to go down in price.
