The only reason i thumbed up was because i played the hell outa this game on the ps3 which i poured so many hours into anyway the pc port is bad just because it requires  a ubisoft account to launch the game and get this if you forget your info your basically screwed because simply making a new account with your current code helps to no avail...Trust me ive tried.The control is better than previous entries because back in the ezio and altair days the controls were simply colored symbols displayed on the screen however this game is absolutley amazing graphics wise on the pc ,i can definetly say this game is a major improvement when it comes to parkour standards but before you start a red coat rampage and hunt with your handy bow and tomahawk you have to start with hayham the first few seqencesm,which slowed the pace down for me but once thats dealt with your good...would i recommend this game Hell Yes! atleast on console but could use some polishing PC Meh but just  a word of warning  please keep  your ubisoft info written down or copied so you wont make the big mistake i did because i paid nearly 40.00 bucks and now i cant even play..but its your money spend it how you feel.....
