Like any other game, this one has its up and downs, which changes to what you enjoy in a game. Personally, I loved the take on history, the attention to detail, and the combat systems. Screw stealth, its fun to just run in and battle no less than 20 guys and come out on top. However, in my opinion, the entire ending was horrible, anticlimatic, frustrating, and just plain dumb. The economy system was slow, pointless, and unrewarding. Some glitches here and there and a few moves that never seemed to work right. Regardless, still a pretty fun game.
