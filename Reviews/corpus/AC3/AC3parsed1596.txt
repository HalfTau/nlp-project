This game, in my opinion, is the most controversial in the entire series. I cannot say that it is mostly good most other games in franchise or mostly bad Unity, so I will list all pointsBad or not so goodGood points, making it really enjoyableSo, the game has a lot of good points, and a lot of bad ones. It is up to you to decide whether you want to check it out, or not, but I strongly recommend to get firsthand experience.
