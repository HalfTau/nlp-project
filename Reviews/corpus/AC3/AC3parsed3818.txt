Great instalment in a wonderful series! Everything I would expect and was hoping for. Really enjoying the story line and character development. This game is also some what educational as it does follow the history books quite well. The game play is somewhat difficult if you are not familliar with the Assassins Creed series. That being said it wont take long to catch on as the game is wildly entertaining and quite senic......
