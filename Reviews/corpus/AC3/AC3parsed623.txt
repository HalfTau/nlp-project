This game is boring. I dont know how else to say it, but I think it might be part of why others considered this the worst in the series. I started rushing it because I wanted to finish it and move on to AC IV, so I didnt get a complete playthrough like with some of the previous ones. I also took a 3year break from playing it, finally returning upon buying AC Unity. That should say something on its own....Connor was an interesting character though, and his personal vendetta against a single person overshadowing the tenets of the ridiculous secret organization he was a part of was a nice turn from the usual characters that Ive seen in previous games in this series. Their conflict reached a nice boiling point by the end, and it was neat to see him go off the reservation in his actions oof, sorry for the unintentionallyappropriate joke there.Theres also a bunch of gamebreaking bugs in the Tyranny of King Washington DLCs, to the point where I couldnt finish part 1 or part 3. Ubisoft is a garbage game company.
