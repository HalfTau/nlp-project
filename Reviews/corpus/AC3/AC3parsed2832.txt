I absolutely love the Assassins Creed series, but this game is complete garbage compared to their previous titles. Not only did they change most of what made the game fun to play, it crashes all the time or freezes my computer as its trying to crash and I have to pull the power on it. Any game that makes you have to do that 34 times every time you play it just isnt fun anymore at that point. Only reason Im finishing it is for the story so I can move on to black flag.
