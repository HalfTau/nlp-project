Assassins Creed III was a masterpiece. Brilliantly crafted story, hundreds of hours of gameplay, and countless hours of enjoyability. The main storyline involving Connor and Desmond is great, the only problem befalling this game is its quantity of glitches. The Benedict Arnold missions were pretty good I enjoyed them however they were really short and after completion everyone was trying to kill me in the area. Tyranny of King Washington is a great dlc with a powerful storyline, something that added great pieces of gameplay and made the game truly an experience. Also the ship sequences are beautifully crafted.
