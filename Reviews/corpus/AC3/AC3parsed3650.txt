Eight hours of tutorials to open the third main installment in the series. 5th if you include Brotherhood and Revelations. Only one decent plot element to tide you over in those eight hours. Following the mini twist you then play as an infinitely more boring character but not before another 3 hours of tutorials.Okay, I didnt get into the main bulk of the game, but ACIII seemed like it was diong its goddamned hardest to put me off ever getting there and it succeeded.
