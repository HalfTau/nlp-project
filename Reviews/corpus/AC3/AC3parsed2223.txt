So I got this game on sale a day or two ago and I made one fatal flaw in my decision. I believed my money to be going to buy a game in which I get to be an assassin killing some Red Coats.In fact I was buying a movie in which I got to walk, not run, the main character from cinematic to cinematic. Any time I would try to deviate from the Ubisoft Guided Tour of 1776, it would just put up insivible walls keep me moving towards the next cinematic.  No amount of detail and historically acurate architecture can keep me hooked when a game called ASSASSINS Creed would only let me kill 2 named characters in the first HOUR AND A HALF!Other notes against this game No gamepad support, only keyboard controls. Limited Graphics settings, no HD, no windowed mode.If you love really long movies about random pseudoaccurate Ben Franklin and the Revolutionary War, this product if for you,If you are looking for an actual game that builds atmosphere and connection, this is not for you.1/10
