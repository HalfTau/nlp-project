For me the segments where you play as Desmond and Haytham Kenway were more interesting than playing with Connor. The character of Connor was lacking. Other then that the game still has tons of issues with glitches, bugs, dodgy camera.The naval segments were really fun to play. Overall I think its a missed opportunity for a great game.Also credits you can not skip shouldnt be a thing at all.
