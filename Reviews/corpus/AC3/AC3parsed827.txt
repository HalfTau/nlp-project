The Assassins Creed storyline is boring, but the Assassins Creed III story is great, let me explain.From what Ive gathered, AC games usually focus on story rather than gameplay, so Ill just be covering that. You CAN play AC III without having played any other AC games, I seemed to enjoy the game and the story without having played any other AC games the story is broken off into two main parts, the real world and inside the animus where you play the game 1775s America, I would say that the real world part of the game only takes place for 10 of the game and you play 90 of the game within the animus. The story within the animus is GREAT, there are so many plot twists and things you dont see coming whilst still managing to keep a serious tone some parts have comedy and other parts have drama, it is so polar yet it manages to keep you hooked.Unfortunately the game really falls apart when you have to play the real world parts of the game modern day, not 1775s America, the story completely shifts as if they changed the writers and takes a completely boring/emotionless turn it reverts back to the boringassassins creed formula and just makes you want to stop playing . The story within the animus DOES have closure but dont expect to understand anything in the real world portion of the game.Onto the gameplay.The only other problem I had with this game is performance, this game is a console port and is clearly meant to be played on Nvidia graphics cards. Dont expect to get over 45fps if you are playing on an AMD card. I had no problem with saving my game progress and I could return to the point where I left off. I didnt encounter any glitches but there are some parts where the game design is hard to follow e.g. getting lost when following someone or not knowing where/how to climb a building.Also you can sail on naval ships on side quests and redo missions, so no need to get AC4 eitherOverall, AC III is a pretty decent game, it will endure you in with 90 of its story and will satisfy you with the gameplay, Id give it an 8/10.
