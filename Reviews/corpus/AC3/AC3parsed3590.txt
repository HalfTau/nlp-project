I have steam to play a game. you charge me and then you require me to log on to UPLAY? what the heck?This is my last time buying on your stupid site. this is why people play xbox or hard drive PC games. cloud games arent really ours are they? you guys wish to make yourselves look smart with your juvenile tactics.
