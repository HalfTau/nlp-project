Running mechanism is a bit weird, you can bump or jump unknowingly.To achieve 100 synchronisation makes you play the sequence a few times, thanks to reload checkpoint option.Story is a bit kinky, hard to follow.Other than these downsides, graphics are awesome, movements are so real, game is so much fun and lots to do, character is unique, despide people finding the tutorial so long, I loved it and Naval missions are the best, highly recommended.
