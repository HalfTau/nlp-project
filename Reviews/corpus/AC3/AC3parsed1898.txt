Gotta say, I was deeply disappointed with this game. I bought and played Assassins Creed 4, and I loved it, so then I bought this. A lot of it seemed like it didnt really work, and for most of it you just run back and forth without a real purpose. Even the plot never really had me. I was more interested in played as the bad guy at the beginning than playing as the main character. 3/10 Would never play again.
