This isnt a recommendation, Its a warning....Dont buy this game.If you look atCreed 1 it was about free running, free roaming and generally being a well thought out assassain, The missions involved sneaking around until you get the chance to kill someone important and then as a reward you get a bigger weapon to help you stab people that are even more important. The core mechanic of stabbing is brilliant and its pretty much the only thing you can do...but is that bad, NO its ing brilliant. I bought the game so i could go around stabbing people.But what aboutCreed 3, well, if you remove the horrible and very confusing plot, filter out all the minigames and  tower defense bits, try and act oblivous to the horrible perception of enemies and the mind draining 12000000 gameplay to cinematic ratio, Well, you may just enjoy the nonprogressive, glitchy, over exagerated and horrifically fun STABBING. KIDDING!!!!!Cos youll surely pass out after trying to get your head around the trading system that isnt even relevant to the gameplay in any way whats so ever, except making a few thousand pounds, which isnt useful in the slightest cos i was able to complete the game with ease with the starter weapons.But what about the new unique enviroment i hear some y 12 yo scream, Well if constantly slandering off the british and jumping from one weatherboarded house to the next, or better yet, hoping between trees like a flying squirral is your idea of fun, wellfriend, 1775 colonial America is where you belong, but be careful not to get killed by the bears roaming the woo.........oh wait D thats right, you can kill them easier than a blind deer in a shooting range because of the quick time events.Visuals did exactly make me horny and niether did new mechanics but to be honest i did enjoy the stabbing, but only the stabbing.This game deserves a 4ish out of 10 but because i just remembered i actually spent cold hard cash on this, I think for wasting my time effort and money this game deserves  sextillion/10I have no hope for Black Flag anymore
