Another great game from Assassins Creed series. I really like playing as Haytham Kenway the templar just a bit more than Connor, but taking part in battles was quite intriguing ... especially naval battles. It was a great conclusion for Desmond although, i would prefer to be given a choice rather than at the end side with Juno. I am looking forward to AC4.
