the game is okay but the characters are pretty doll. if you want a good assassins creed experiance, get AC IV BLACK FLAG or AC revalations. some of the uplay fetures are gone after a while but hey i play black flags multiplayer which is the same thing with more features. the game is okay and sorry if i mispelled something.
