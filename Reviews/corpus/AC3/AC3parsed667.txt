This is a weak installment in the Assassins Creed franchise and that weakness stems from the terrible protagonist, Connor. He is an unintelligent meathead who blunders along and is always reacting to problems rather than planning ahead and being proactive. It was very frustrating to play as such a tool of a character is who derided by other characters in game for his poor decisionmaking skills.Part of the reason for my dislike is I compare him to Haytham, the character you control at the outset of the game, and while Haytham is competent, charismatic, and practical, Connor is none of those things. The entire Templar vs Assassin ideology finds fertile storytelling in this game but the Templars the erstwhile villains come across as very rational and pragmatic while the Assassins seem more like kids stamping their feet and saying Stop liking things I dont like!The historical databse ingame was very fun to read, however, as you see the people and events of the American Revolution as viewed through the eyes of an Englishman. Enlightening and an educational read, as were the databases in previous games, so the game shines in this regard.This is not a bad game, but it is a bad Assassins Creed game. Good to play and see the modern day story unfold with Desmond and company but otherwise a bit offputting. Combat is good, parkour is good, interesting crafting system though I used little of it since I hate crafting but I can see the appeal, level design is beautiful, and the sound of your tomahawk smashing skulls never gets old. The previous installments with Ezio set the bar very high and despite this games innovations, it fell flat for me because of story and the main character.
