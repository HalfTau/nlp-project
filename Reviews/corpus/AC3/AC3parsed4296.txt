My expectations were way too high. The Ezio Trilogy was such a milestone that I wanted more of that goodness, and what I got was...a 7.5/10.The DLC was interesting giving you a new alternate universe and some interesting aspects but hardly worth the price. 75 off i would recommend it.I personally found the ship battles to be bland I hope they make the ship battles in the next one more intuitive not just circle firing cannons and missing and laughable wind mechanics. Being able to board enemy vessels or they board you would be a change of pace.Overall the gameplay and story wasnt as gripping as Ezios story because he is truly the most interesting person you will ever know.  Side missions were less appealing and collectibles didnt have the flair they had before.  As a fan of the series I will continue the support in hopes for more of that AC2/BH/Rev goodness.
