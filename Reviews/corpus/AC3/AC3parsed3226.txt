This is the best assassins creed I have played until now, and even if I say so because I am a huge fan of this game, I will try to be the more objective I can. There are many advantages that you will be able to find for this game, such as the storyline deep and  complete making of American revolution the base of a great fictional story, the gameplay its really nice and complete, you can do parkour that has been improved this time, making the trees the new obstacle of shifting the fights are very dinamic and realistic, the physics mecanism has been improved also, and you will not find any bugs in general. However, there are a few bugs that can be found rarely like the one in the crafting menu that disables the exit button, but it can be fixed quickly. So if you wanted to spent money in a complete and quite pleasant game, this would be a nice choice. I RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE. Anyway, it would be better if you play the previous games, to follow all the storyline.
