I consider 2 the pinnacle of the AC series Brotherhood a close second and like many had heard awful things about AC3.Wrong. Its a really well put together AC game. The setting is very good, gameplay is AC of course and Connor is a good protagonist.Grapically solid at 60FPS. Works with a 360 controller.5/7 recommended
