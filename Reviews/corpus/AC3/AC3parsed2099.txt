A fun, buggy mess. Takes everything you loved from Assassins Creed Revalations and expands upon it in this sequel. The story goes from pretty good to a little meh as you progress through Connors story. But the story keeps you engaged enough to make your way through a 20 hour story plus a ton of side mission content which can be entertaining too.That being said, Connor as a character is a whiny mess. Hell often shift between hardcore assassin and angsty teenager which can be annoying. But the biggest issue with the game are the numerous bugs. Ive had the game crash on multiple occasions. Ive teleported seemingly randomly more than once. There are many visual bugs, such as NPCs materializing out of thin air OR magically changing outfit before your eyes. Pathing can be another problem where Connor will go out of his way to parkour off of walls repeatedly during a chase resulting in plenty of frustration. At one point the game locked me in some grey void causing me to have to close and reopen the game.Going for 5 it is definitely worth the price, despite its many many flaws. I say play it for the gameplay and mechanics, which are both absolutely wonderful and will make up for the glaring problems.
