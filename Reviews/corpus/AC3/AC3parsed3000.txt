To be honest, this was my first outing with the series and I liked it. It got me into the series so I decided to start from the beginning after finishing Assassins Creed 3, and, comparatively, Assassins Creed 3 blows Assassins Creed 1 out of the water. The colonial setting is great and the game is smooth and looks great.I cant recommend the Tyranny of King Washington DLC though. Its broken and Ubisoft has moved on to other games and never fixed it.
