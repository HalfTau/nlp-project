A lot of fans of the series didnt like this game vs Assassins Creed 2 which is often considered the best of the series.I liked it well enough and got to one of the final missions. Gameplay wise I enjoyed everything within and they introduced ship battles which were epically fun and pretty.My problem with the game is the story is terrible. I thought this about all the AC games because I hate the future / past storyline. It is one of those things where I look at it and think yes I know you think your telling a smart and neat story but it is actually stupid and . I hate all the desmond and always hope I never have to deal with a cut scene I cant skip. Desmond is on par with Watch Dogs main character as the least likable progtagnists ever. The other main charater is much better, but is still leagues more likable / relatable.It bothers me that they make such a quality game  gameplay wise but have story that makes you not want to play the game. It is like proposing marriage to someone well taking a dump. Really dimishes things.But the gameplay is excellent and thats what really matters.I still give it a passing grade but wait for a sale as ACIV is far better.
