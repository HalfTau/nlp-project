With the already fifth installment of the popular Assassins Creed series Ubisoft uses for the first time the American continent as a venue to muster the Assassin again against the Templars.History and StagingAs every part is again the major conflict between the two organizations at the center, which has this time chosen a different approach. Instead of playing directly with Connor, you are the first few hours as Haythem Kennway, the son of Edward Kennway, go and finished the first missions. Throughout history, however, pass some twists that cause you take on the role of Connor. Time the game is set during the American Revolution and told this in a different way, as he is known, as the Assassins play an important role. This is all staged fantastic and comes partly already approached the quality of films. Thus, the game is never really boring and is consistently enthralling and exciting. What I also really liked, is the story of Desmond. In other parts has never been really fun for me this time it has, however, given a lot of effort in order to give to convince both times.gameplayThe gameplay is not really different from its predecessor, Connor, however, has a few new weapons get as the Tomahawk, the bow and throw ropes. Both the controller and the mouse and keyboard can control the game well, here so all get their money. What has still not come to grips with, is the difficulty. Actually it is much too strong from the outset, whereby the emissions are not a big challenge.GraphicThe graphics are as in every part of the series on the amount of time where you realize that the game has seen now for almost four years.ConclusionThose looking for an exciting game with great production and not a big challenge, this is the place. The story is fun, the setting is implemented great and the graphical implementation right.10/10 Amazing
