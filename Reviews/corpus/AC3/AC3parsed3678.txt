A nice and interesting timeperiod, more freedom and a new character could not save this game from being the worst in the series. Dont get me wrong, its still a lot of fun for fans of the franchise and world is impressive, but the main story the parts you play outside the animus gets rather doll and quite predictable. I will not spoil it for you, but dont expect an epic ending of the story that dominated five ACgames. One word Average.
