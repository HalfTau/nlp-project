I have played and completed all ACs until this one and specially enjoyed the last two games, Brotherhood and Revelations. But I cant keep playing past chapter V on this one Lots and lots of cinematics, you are playing only during few parts of the game. I think its like you are playing 20 of the time. Some cinematics tell you part of the plot but some others are a waste of time.The gameplay is not well designed. Missions are boring and urban cities have too many guards. They will chase you even when not seeing you. While you are trying to hide, you will face a guard after each corner so will be near to impossible to run away. You will have to fight 10 guards to stop them, but you will get maximum notoriety and you will be pursued again on sight.Even the parkour part is not funny, because you are stopping every few seconds to climb walls or after a fall or colliding with some little dispensable structure. So very bad design of the environment, without shortcuts to climb fast a building or jump from one roof to another. The challenges needed to full synchronize memories often are like a trial and error thing. Also, some challenges are easy, some challenges are too hard. The combat hasnt improved from previous ACs, the opposite, is more repetitive than ever. Batman games use the same kind of combat and are way better and funnier than this.I could speak about the bad QTEs when fighting animals, some missions that are terrible in every way, some bugs I encountered in those few hours...
