Just a rehashed game with new cities.  The only thing great and fun about this game is the naval battles,  It is more or less the same game as the previous ones except with a downgrade in gameplay and story.  I thought the combat was clunky and the cutscenes/story were poorly done.  For me it was the nail in the coffin for this series. I would only recommend this to a huge fan of the franchise, otherwise, it should be avoided.
