The game was great, the Altair outfit was hard to obtain because some of the fullsync objectives were just near impossible to achieve but in the end i somehow managed to do it. Initially I hated the game because I originally thought the series would comprise only Altair, Ezio, and Desmond. But this injun fuc boi was included and goshdarnit that ending was terrible. They deliberately did that so they could create more crappy Assassins creed games except for Black Flag and Unity.
