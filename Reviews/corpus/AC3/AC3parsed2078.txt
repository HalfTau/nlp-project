Assassins Creed III is a decent installment in the series, but could have been a lot better. Many of the early parts feel very constrained for an open world game. Many of the other elements feel pretty tired if youve already played many of the older titles. Despite this is does have a few new things to offer. One of this things is the revised combat system, which while still very similar to previous games it is a teeny bit more skill based with the removal of a block button and some other small changes. Graphics are also very good for a console port from the PS3 and 360 from 2012.6/10
