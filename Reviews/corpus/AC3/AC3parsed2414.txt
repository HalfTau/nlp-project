Best game of the Assassins Creed franchise in my opinion.The graphics are nice and it runs very smoothly unlike Assassins Creed Brotherhood where scenes got a little sketchy.They simplified the movement mechanic which I dislike because I enjoyed the technicality of movement with the original Assassins Creed.
