What happened to this series? Where the first and second AC had a good story, good characters and a great playground, this one botched all of them. The colonial cities doesnt have any epic buildings to scale, the controllers are even more horrible than AC1, Connor is the most bland and emotionless character Ive ever seen in a game and in all of this they even manage to utterly destroy any sense of sympathy with Desmond. I wont spoil what he does, but the acts he does after Sequence 10 is just horrible and made my jaw drop to the floor. The writing in this game has a bunch of flawes and leaps in logic.Avoid this game if you can. What started out as a mediocre Assassins Creedgame quickly deteriorated into a horrible mess of dissappointment, bad writing and a big letdown of an ending not seen since Mass Effect 3
