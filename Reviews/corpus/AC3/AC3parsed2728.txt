Im Sorry but i do not recommend this game because of its pure NONAWESOMENESS.1. The graphics are not only bad the animations and designs are bad even with a good CPU, AND I WAS ALL LIKE PEW PEW PEW!!2. If that wasnt bad the combat is almost the exact same as the Assassins Creed 2 , BAM NO CHANGE FOR YOU!!3. Now i dont mind using uPlay but for those who hate it, it forces you to play using uPlay, BAM NO CHOICES FOR YOU! !4 the story was realy boring, AHHHHHHHHHHHHH ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.UPSIES1. The sound did improve however,WAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLY!2. They went to a different corner store by adding hunting and the whole sea battle thing. THE ONLY REDEEMING QUALITY!!Note. AS I played this you can see clear as contacts that they put there intire time into the see battles which is the only reason i bought the game in the first place. HOLD ON TO YOUR BUTTS LAND HO!! !
