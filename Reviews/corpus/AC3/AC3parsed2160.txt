The first of the more modern day Assassins Creed, Following Revelations and Preceeding Black Flag in the series. It makes new advancements to the franchise after Revelations, it has a relatively interssting story line although to some it may be boring. Rather wide range of exploration, costume and weapon choices and side missions. It offers many things to keep you hooked and gives a fresh breath of air to the series. If you havent played it yet... well what are you doing!? Buy this game, its great and considering sale prices and decreased price it is worth it! 8/10
