The graphics change drastically from Revelations to ACIII, so its more demanding for the PC.The story its fine, I enjoyed the story overall, the gameplay has a few changes from the Ezio games, the combat system is still simple but took me a little bit to get used to it.The overall world changed, so it doesnt let you mess around as much or do parkour on buldings as fun as the second game and expansions.
