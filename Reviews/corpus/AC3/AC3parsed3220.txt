Coming into Assassins Creed III, you have to keep a few things in mind.This isnt Assassins Creed Ezio rehashed.There are pros and cons to this, but ultimately this makes Assassins Creed III a unique title in the franchise that introduced the Hidden Blade to us. Worry not, the Hidden Blade is still very much a weapon in this title, but there are enough changes in the weapon system, combat system, the Animus interface, and heck the climbing in my opinion to make this a different game.To keep it shortThe story is decent not amazing, simply because it seems very disjointed, but Assassins Creed games tend to skip around years here and there. Assassins Creed Revelations was perhaps the only time this wasnt really an issue. We finally get to do things with Desmond. Colonial US is definitely a new place. And holynaval battles. No wonder ACIV goes down the pirate route.Play it, even if you dont give a crap about the whole TemplarsAssassin storyarc.
