A very good Assassins Creed game. The story has its moments of awe when some things are revealed. However the story didnt seem to have the same impact as the Ezio stories. The colonies and frontier are great and the area is huge to recover. Some minor bugs do persist when it comes to killing animals, but that part of the game is enjoyable, not the killing but the gameplay.The side story of Desmond also has some great talking points and the end is pretty good leaving you to wonder what happens next, much like the murder of Lucy.The naval combat is very interesting, and tough. The mechanics are good and hopefully upgraded in the next installment which is more geared to naval combat.The game is a good installment and hopefully fares well in the whole AC storyline.
