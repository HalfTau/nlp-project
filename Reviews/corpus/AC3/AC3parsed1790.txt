Boooooooring........After playing Assasins Creed starting from the very first instalment to Brotherhood I started to get bored of this all assasinations... I mean the game seems to be fun, but only if you haventplayed the previous games. Im honestly fed up with this title. Also my wooden PC has enough of this franchise as well. As soon a sI got to Boston my game locked to 20 frames per second. Also the camera feels too close to the character which annoys me a lot.My recommendation If you are new to Assassins Creed series, buy the first game, If you arent, buy something else...
