No.Plays like a movie, constantly cutting off the players interaction to force them to watch some cinematic. Movement is kind of cool, but its Brinkized with the onekey does all.... So it quickly becomes borning and unchallenging and more often than not, it does something stupid, i.e. no i wanted to hide in the haystack, not jump and crouch on the rail next to the hay stack!... Fightings ok, looks cool, but you litterally alternate between two keys or more precisely button mash 2 keys and the game does the rest... Little player involvement and therefore extremely little challenge.Finally the game title is missleading. You are assassinating animals, like dear, rabbits, foxes. Yah, you have to learn to hunt. Wow cant belive i payed for this... I was expecting postal like wreckage and carnage... lay waste to everyone. But instead i got a go collect 5 feathers and 5 animal pelts... What is this W.O.W.? very little time if any assassinating... and when you do, its more like oh your within 20 feet of your target, time to enter the cinematic where you watch yourself kill the guy.If your looking for a movie, you might like this. If you are looking for a challenging FPS w/e this is that requires coordination and practice/skill i.e. mirrors edge, STAY AWAY.Finally requires Ubisofts stupid wanna be steam software to be installed... Sigh yet another overlay POS.HAHA Ubisoft, jokes on me right? haha cant believe he actually fell for it and bought it. Yah, neither can I. woooo
