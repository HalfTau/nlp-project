Pros/neutral The generally boring combat of assassins creed is quite a lot better in this game than in the previous ones. Interesting setting While i hate getting pulled out if the main game to get my butt fisted with lore aka desmonds story, its at least not just boring cutscenes now you actually get to play as desmondCons Bland characters Haytham was the only one that i liked Forgetable story The environments, while pretty and historically interesting, are not suited for a game like this at all. Every problem that plagues all the other AC games too. missions. Boring parkour due to the complete automation. Simplistic combat.Ubisoft does too little to fix the major flaws of the series, and in the process lose track of some of the things that made the series work in the first placeVerdict 4/10
