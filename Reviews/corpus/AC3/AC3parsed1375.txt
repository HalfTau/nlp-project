The game is terrible, only positive is that it leads to 4. Wiki the story, read the condensed version and thank your lucky stars you didnt have to play it through. The controls are not sensitive enough, there are too many guards at all times who seem to be extremely sensitive to the point that anything you do tends to set off city wide alarms and they are hard as hell to get out of sight from and if you cant get out of sight of them you cant get away. It is as if the game makers wanted you to complete goals but didnt give you a way to complete them, like needing to enter a store but there are two guards in front of it of which parameters say you cant get noticed. So I find I can open the front door by sticking my face in a side wall and open the front door through the wall, when I come out I have to stay near a guy I am talking to but as soon as I come out I am right in those 2 guards and I cant shake the alarm without running away and running away blows the mission because I am too far away from the guy I am talking to. I cheesed it by jumping in the river and the guy I happen to be talking to just barely manages to stay in range and the conversation completes even though I can only hear my end of the conversation and I am in the water 200 yards away.I kicked this game out of my hard drive in frustration after enough time to get past the parentage story and all the tutorials/cabin building jobs to the point where I could finally play in the city doing missions on the indian assassin. I consider all that time to be time wasted as the meat of the game is unplayable crap due to overly sensitive guards and controls that are not sensitive enough.
