Warning I have not completed the full game, but am reviewing it because I think its really good. With that being said their is alot that is painstakingly awful or rather irking. If you liked Prince Persia this is your game. Its like a way improved version. Both in story telling, and the ability to control your character is better.The bad Assassinate and strike attacks are the same button. At time you will have trouble because the auto feature for assassinate cant distinguish at between regular and assassin attacks.  This all could have been avoided by using and r trigger for stealth kills. Or rather use a diferent button for each seperate action.The other thing that should be painstakingly obvious is that the game limits and confines you. You dont get to free roam.You go to far you die, you do an assassination and it goes wrong you die. Well they dont call it dying in the game its restarting memory. Not only is this tideous and makes nerve reckly diffecult on your nerves as you have to restart alot, its time consuming, and takes you out of the immersion of the game while eerily being hand held at the same time.The most annoying is sometimes a wall will be by a bush and it will auto cover when youre trying to stealth kill, or visa versa.Desmond huh such a generic character. If youre going to have us crashing at least make Desmond show suffering so it actually feels like it affects his memory. I didnt like the fact that I just couldnt play with the main character Conner.  Perhaps its to introduce his background. But we are already in a background to background story here. I wanted to learn way more about the main protoganist. His father could have been a seperate dlc. This could have given Conner the better story arc that I feel sort of lacking.  I still recommend this game, because what game is perfect. Lets just hope Unity and Rogue hopefully comes to pc have fixed these bugs and implement a beter stealth/ combat system.
