This game is the best assassins creed game so far. The great part about it is that is set in an actual war time unlike Black Flag and Unity you are actually on a side in an army and fight for a cause that is an actual cause. The cities and arcitecture of the cities is the best in the series. The only con is that after the war is over there isnt much for you to do unless you download a DLC, unlike Black Flag where you can continue to plunder and fight against the British, Spanish, and Portugeuse. After you win the British leave and you have no one else to fight. Overall an amazing game.
