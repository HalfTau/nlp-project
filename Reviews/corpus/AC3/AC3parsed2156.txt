11/10 would play through tutorial again. jk never again i would play through the tutorial.but really this is lots of fun after you pass the tutorial, you learn the most awesome way of learning about civil war,  American Revolution. connor is too badass, two he is a master of continued kills, i mean i only got those type of kills maybe about max of 10 or maybe little more, but when you do, and you dont mess it up, its most coolest thing to see.My final thoughts about this game, that its fun  enjoyble, it a big open world, and even though they dont have big buildings its still sure fun
