Looking at how many bugs were patched I can see why it wasnt well received upon released. However I got it on sale for 12 and had a blast with it. Graphically its very impressive, especially during the ingame winter season and the combat is superb. More complex than previous Assassins Creed games with enemy variety requiring you to use specific methods for defeating them.That said the story falls apart abysmally at the end of the game. No doubt to apparent cuts late in development.Still, if you can get it on sale, its a pretty fun time.
