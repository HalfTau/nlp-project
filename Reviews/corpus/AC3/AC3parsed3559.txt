This is the worst assassins creed game Ive played. I have generally liked the others, but this fills me with rage and hate that I cant begin to describe. The game feels rushed, poorly designed. It is generally pretty, but that far from makes up for the crappy mechanics. Last but certainly not least, the game is an obvious port, which has been common in the others, but it seems to take the crappy port to a whole new level. This game just really pisses me off.
