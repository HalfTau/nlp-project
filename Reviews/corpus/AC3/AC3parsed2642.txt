I would LOVE to recommend this game, but I simply cant due to the fact its unplayable. There is the most painful saving issue with a lot of the Assassins creed games on the PC. Everytime you save your game, shut down or restart your computer the save will be gone. Its a ing joke. Sort this out and then perhaps I shall reconsider my review. Other than this it is a GREAT game.
