This game is the worst of the AC games. The characters are uninteresting, the story is boring, and all stealth elements are pretty much absent and what little remains is so clunky it barely works. Cities are boring, forests are barely more interesting, and the QTE hunting is a huge pain. And finally, the sailing is unbearably bad...nothing like the polished beauty of Black Flag. There is only one positive aspect to this game, and that comes with reservations the setting. Ubisoft does a pretty great job of portraying Colonial/Revolutionary America as well as the tensions between the colonists and Native Americans. The historical figures they have the game show thorough research on part of Ubisoft as does the scenery and props throughout the world. The only reservation I have is that an AC game has no place in this setting and completely breaks it. You can get away with street brawls and guard stabbings in Renaissance Italy, Byzantium, and the Caribbean but you cant convincingly have that in Colonial America. Just think about the Boston Massacre...barely anyone died in that, and that was one of the pivotal events leading up to the Revolution. You could never run through the streets cutting down British soldiers and get away with it. Not only would you bring down reparations from the Brits but the Colonists would probably reject your underhanded tactics as well. Washington did have spies but they still experienced the stigma associated with such a deceitful and duplicitous way of fighting. I feel that I am justified in this complaint because Ubisoft has always stressed the historicity of their games so it is a fair criticism.
