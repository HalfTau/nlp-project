i started shortly before unity came out, and didnt experience any serious bugs.  it has the usual assassins creed problems like climbing up next to a door youre trying to go through, but this time its also difficult to tell whats going on with the story or what youre supposed to be doing.  being able to run through treetops is about the only new good thing here, and the story is less compelling than usual.  id only bother with this one if you are looking to experience all the story of the assassins creed series.
