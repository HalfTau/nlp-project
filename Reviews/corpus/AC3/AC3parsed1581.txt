This is my favourite game from the Assassans Creed series, coz it has a very interesting story and the soundtracks accompany every situation.Climbing works better than in Assassins Creed 2Good graphicsThe combination between story and actual events from the past is interesting and fun to playShip missions are new and funThe settlement missions are cool to play and its interesting to see your settlement growing by thatGood voice actor german editionBeautiful LandscapesBad lipsyncUpgrades for ship are expensive as Combats are still way too easyThis game has some bugs but you can tolerate it, since it is very big and also they didnt effect my chances to complete a mission
