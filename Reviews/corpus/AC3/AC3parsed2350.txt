5/10After playing previous AC games I was very disappointed PLUS Despite popular opinions the main character is actually interesting and different from Altair and Ezio. Soundtrack is all right. Story of Desmond is interesting in AC3 and its amazing to see him transform into a true Assasin after all this time.MINUS Story is not very interesting, somehow putting an Asassin into the story of USA is not a good fit. New York and other cities look similiar and are boring. Fighting system is confusing, long range weapons useless. Side activities are not necessary to do as you dont really need money, as you cant really spend it like at other AC games. The ending is not very creative. Father of main character is way more interesting than the main character himself. The graphics are not much better than in AC2, however it has muuuuch higher tech requirements if you play on PC....Shall I go on? Its dull, theres no atmosphere and I wont come back to it. I still recommend it as a Asassins Creed fanatic.
