The game is okay. Story got a bit too political for me to really care about it. The gameplay itself is good apart from the occasional issue for randomly scaling up a wall when you simply intended to run past it. The game feels unpolished and a bit lack lustre. For example, fast travelling from one city to another requires that you first fast travel to one location, which then loads a completely unnecessary map, then from there you need to randomly walk into another fast travelling section, then you need to choose where you want to go, then from there it loads a different map, and then you need to fast travel again to where you need to be. Ubisoft simply could not be bothered to fix basic things like this. Why cant I fast travel directly where I want to be. Also, I dealt with the typical Ubisoft consolitus issues. My game kept crashing because I didnt have vsync enabled in the graphics settings...I mean, really? A game developed for pc, which is a platform that takes advantage of high refresh rates has to have the framerate locked? There are also some really pointless gameplay sections where you are literally just required to walk 20 meters into another cut scene. I think Ubisoft needs to start questioning why would player would want to do this?, or, is this a fun part to have in the game? and then simply remove elements if they dont check the boxes. They have some parts of missions and quests that really just make the game annoying to play.Overall though, rather buy black flag, it is better than this game in literally every way.
