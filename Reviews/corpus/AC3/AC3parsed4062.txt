Stabby, Stab, Stab.It may be the weakest in the series, I think that it takes up a lot to set a game in the American Revolution and make it interesting and Ubisoft are yet to dissapoint in this assassination outing. The combat system and the freerunning has been revamped and is much easier to use, yeah there may be no lockon anymore but really it makes sense as a design choice.On that note the combat animations look awesome and the double counters are pretty awesome as well.The stealth is a bit clunky at times but the AI has been improved so they arent as dumb as before but can be tricked pretty easily for some pretty funny mishaps and it feels much more hectic being chased as well.The setting ultimately lets the game down though, with too many god damn trees, which make the free running confusing and also it becomes hard to tell when guards will and wont stop you when your perched up there waiting for your next kill nor are the building high enough to be awe inspiring. The characters are great except the main character Connor who is unbearably arrogant and I swear at one point  I wondered what he offered for the creed or even why he was an assassin plus the tutorial is like a couple hours so get ready for a long journey, and dont think its going to be a super interesing journey either because the story lost me most of the way  and I just killed whoever they told me to to get to this Charles Lee guy who Connor seemed more interested in than Fangirls to Justin Beiber.But in the end its still a good addition to your Creed Collection Combat has been improved Looks Great Characters are pretty engaging Except for the idiot of a main character Setting choice wasnt the greatest Long tutorial sequence7.5/10
