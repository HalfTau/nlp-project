Bought this game cheap on summer sale, it was cheap, looked very nice and was popular with good reviews, so what could go wrong?Answer Everything.I really tried to play this game, but the controls almost made me ragequit instantly. Not that the controls are bad, actually they are too good and especially too easy, so easy that it feels that I dont have any influence on what happens.Just run and your character will do all kinds of cool parkour tricks and stunts fully automaticly, you cannot even fall down or miss your target, when you meet an enemy just press mouse button for a cool kill animation that plays automatically, you can also not aim with your gun, just press a button to shoot the enemy automatically, you cannot miss.The game also prevents you from all ways you could have fun, you cannot sprint, jump, attack etc when you are not supposed to. You cannot accidentally harm civilians or animals, the only way is to bump into them next to water, so they fall into it and disappear.It is nice to watch, but I prefer more to actually have control over the game, which normally is what a game consists of.I really tried to play the game, but I could not endure having almost no control over the game.
