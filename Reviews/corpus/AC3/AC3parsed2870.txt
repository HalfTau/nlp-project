Slated as the worst game of the series, this game has many faults... but is by no means a bad game.What it does wrong AC3 has trouble setting the pace, there are a few plot elements that are not fully thought out, there are a lot of bugs that a more thorough test could have ironed out, a few things like the crafting system were too tedious and could have done with work, the game could have done with a bit more polish.What it does right however, is expanding on the features available within the game, and not in a cheap way like within Revelations. You can capture Templar forts, hunt animals through the wilderness, attack roving convoys, build your own village Homestead, battle the British navy in your ship, rescue citizens from firing squads and oppression, not to mention all the usual features fans of the series know too well. Tons of collectables, many Templars to assassinate, a guild of assassins to train, and a few minigames to enjoy that are spread about.In AC3 if you can endure a very slow start, if you branch out between missions to fill up your arsenal of weapons and tools, and if you ignore the DRM uplay and the occasional bug... You will be rewarded with a highly entertaining game,  with a huge amount of game time.8/10
