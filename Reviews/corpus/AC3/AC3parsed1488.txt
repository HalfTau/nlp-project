This game is unplayable, thanks to Ubisofts Uplay.  My hubby and I played it for about three hours, shut down assuming that the auto save worked, came back after dinner and all progress was lost.There were a lot of bugs, and the game seemed incredibly rushed, simply because the franchise is so popular.Ubisoft really needs to smarten up, and test the games out a lot more...
