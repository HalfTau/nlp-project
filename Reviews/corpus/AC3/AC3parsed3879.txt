Ah, Assassins Creed 3. The joys of running around on the rooftops and killing your next target before he even suspects you and climbing up the towers to get that umpteenth synchronization. The series has come quite a long way since the first game, what with the repetitive missions we all griped about. Unfortunately, this entry is not worth full price. I got the game and the dlc for a total of 16 on a steam sale, and put about 23 hours into it, finishing the main story and the Tyranny of King Washington. I may have spent an hour tops on the side missions before I realized they were not for me.The story is eventually about a Native called Connor who goes to great lengths to not only aid in the fight for independence from England and rid the new world from templars, but also to keep his people safe from these murderous villains. He carries out assassinations on great leaders, some historical and others fictional as well as assisting in some of the famous battles and events of the Revolutionary War in the later part of the 1700s.The mission segments are decent enough to provide amusement, challenging the player to move from bush to hay to tree while eavesdropping on redcoats. The best parts, as the majority has stated, are the naval warfare missions. In these segments you get to man a ship with a crew and maneuver around enemy ships as you shoot them down. My major gripe with the game is that there are too many cutscenes. It would not have mattered if they had substance, but too often it feels like these cutscenes provide little to no substantial amount of significance. Gameplay is set up from these scenes, rather than having the player go from one place to another but there is quite a bit of that as well.Bottom line, too much of the game feels stale and cliched. I would recommend this game at a price of half or less, but nothing more, unless you are a hardcore AC fan.
