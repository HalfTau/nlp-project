This game gets a lot of hate. Personally I loved it, the game, and the main character, Connor, is a really deep character.The reason why this game gets hate is the super slow tutorial part, that lasts a good couple of hours. Once you get past that, the game becomes really fluid and fun.Dont believe anything other reviewers say, make your own opinions.Nothing is true, everything is permitted.
