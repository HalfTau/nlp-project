Not my fav in the franchise. AC2 to Revelations spoilt me rotten with its dense cities, big locations and awesome tombs that motivated me get the best possible armour and dominating the whole map getting dividents every other minute afterwards.Here you mostly run in an open field trying to dodge red coats because of reasons seeing that merica are the good guys, surprised? Made me cringe how this game strokes the American slong to get some brownie points on how great its founding fathers were according to them.Plus whats the point of giving us a cosmetic option to color of our clothes when in the dialogue sections before a mission you wear your vanilla suit the whole time anyways??? It isnt as if each scene is pre rendered FFS! The Ezio trilogy got it right... THREE TIMES, what happened here?? ?Someone needs to get fired for screwing that up.In my opinion, its a good game story wise. nowhere as good as the Ezio trilogy But not great. Im forcing myself just to get through it because I never saw how the whole Desmond ark ends to be honest.6/10
