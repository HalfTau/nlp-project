I really wanted this game to be good, and I tried my hardest to keep going, but this is total The PC port is a complete disaster. Bugs everywhere lips out of sync, horrible physics, items just disapear in to thin air. Id say this game is a prime example on why you dont set unrealistic timelines on your developement team just to get the game out so you can make profits at expense of the gamers satisfaction.Gameplay is fun. its actually extremely fun... but thats when you actually get a chance to play. Missions last less than 15 minutes, and youre then switched back to watching cut scenes. I wouldnt be surprised if after recording some of this, I would see less than 50 of the game actually being controlled by the player. Its a game, not a fing movie.Great work Ubisoft, you went ahead and killed an amazing series. I highly doubt Ill be purchasing any other AC games from you in the future.
