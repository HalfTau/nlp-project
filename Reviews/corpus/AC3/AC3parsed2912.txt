So you liked Assassins Creed I and II, perhaps even Brotherhood and Revelations? And now you want to continue? I loved them all, even though the present day parts I found a bit unattractive. But I really enjoyed all of these games, bought them for 30 each and praised them wherever I went.I bought this game for a mere 5, a bargain. I would not do it again. As much as I liked the previous game, this one I dislike and I would advise not to buy it if you dont want to spoil your favourite series. Forget likeable characters, beautiful environment, finely crafted cutscenes with nicely done lipsync. This game feels like a predecessor of AC I, with crude animation, uninteresting story and no immersion for the player. Also expect stupid gameplay, where you restart a mission a thousand times because you were unable to fully synchronize not because of your lack of skill, but because the combat/control system is glitchy and sometimes just wont do what seems like a trivial task. The fact that half the time you kill enemies by stabbing air next to them instead of their bodies is just a cherry on top.tldr Im really dissatisfied, would not buy again. Seems unfinished and unpolished, plot and characters uninteresting. I might edit this after I finish if I finish the game, but I doubt it will be different further on.
