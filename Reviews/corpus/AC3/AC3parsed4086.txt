This is not Assassins Creed III. This is... Abstergo Movie Factory I Differences from the last trilogy  Annoyance not a rooftop game fast travel unlock is quite tedious horse travel is nice, but control is clumsy freerunning control is horrid, simplied but horrid massive world, but missions dont really use it all Assassin element isnt really there.Good additions naval battle no meds required, but that means devs cheap out on armor design no armors, just gei outfits new way to get money, defend your convoy yesand etc...Uplay complaints actions not registered cant redeem code in single player, some can in multiplayer ubisoft server is currently unavailable, please try again later.7/10 game, not that bad, but not great and the Uplay crap isnt pleasant to deal with.wasted soo much time...
