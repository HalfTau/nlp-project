After playing this game I decided to give it a reviewGameplay 9/10The gameplay is quite fun, it changes from the old Ezio trilogy with new feautures. For PC controls they changed the free running controls which I dont really like.Price 9/10For 20 CAD this game is worth it but I never got into itFPS 10/10This game will run on a bad laptop, lowest settings. It will run but you will pay the price as the textures turn into potatoesSetting 8/10The game is set during the American Revolution, its a nice idea but I never liked it. It was always a cold feeling and it just felt cold much like the main characterCharacters 6.5/10The main character Connor was a piece of garbage, he had next to no personallity and did what ever other people told him to do, the community nick named him Connor What would you have me do? Kenway, as he always said What would you have me do? The best character in this game was the main antagonist Haytham he had a way better back story and a much more conflicted personallity, he was just a better characterThe Verdict 8.5/10This was the first AC game I played and it really destroyed my love for the AC series, UNTIL I played AC 4. So dont buy this game, buy AC 4  I know Im giving it a bad review with a 85 but I really didnt like this game
