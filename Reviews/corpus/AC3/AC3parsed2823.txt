Totally enjoyed the game. Small piece of advice, DO NOT RUSH FOR THE STORY. Instead try to do all those side quest first.  I never actually encounter any bugs in my entire playthrough but i guess it depends on your pc itself. There are a lot of complaints about how Connor was a shallow, forgettable character but for me I kinda like his plain, humble style so not a big problem to me. The graphic is great, just some minor fps drop in Boston thats all, no big deal, no need to cry like a baby because it is not game breaking flaw. Love the liberation missions, gives the assassins recruits more characteristic rather than plain forgettable AI that you cant attached to in the previous game. You need to have patience and will to explore because it is a huge world and unlocking fast travel location can sometime be a little annoying. Overall great game, love it, dont understand all those criticsm. All time favourite 8/10
