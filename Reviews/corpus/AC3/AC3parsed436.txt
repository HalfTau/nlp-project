I have many issues with this game. Overall it was unenjoyable to play because1. Controls felt unnatural and bulky. Fighting and shooting felt cumbersome and clunky.2. The map was awful. A marker doesnt give you a route like in GTAV, it just tells you how far left to go.3. Too many cutscenes. Throughout the game it felt like my character would wake up, walk outside, cutscene, walk to where I was told to go, cutscene. I never felt in control of the game.4. A mockery of history. I was looking forward to being immersed in colonial history but the cheesy list of characters made it a bit silly. Kotaku referred to this as also Gumpish.I have always had respect for the Assasins Creed series but felt let down by this one.
