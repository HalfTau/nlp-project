Consider this a mixed review. On one hand, the games core mechanics are GREAT. Fun weapons, new ways to kill some poor bloke, and jumping off of roofs, or freerunning or whatever makes you happy when youre not busy. On the other hand, theres the godawful stealth, lack of saves or reasonable save points and a BS storyline. 7.5/10.
