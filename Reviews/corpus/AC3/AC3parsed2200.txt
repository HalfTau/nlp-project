This has to be one of the best assasins creeds I have played I have played 1 2 3 brotherhood and rev. I loved brootherhood because of the fact that you can call in back up. In assassins creed 3 they left that in But they can now do more then one thing such as ranged attack assassinate and ambush. You can get up to 6 assassins I have 3 right now This game is worth the time. Its 5 right now so dont think about it just get it.
