The game mechanics and graphics are really good, ai is good but it tends to do weird stuff from time to time.GraphicsLevel designMechanicsReally big world to explore with lots of secrets, maps, treasures etc..Naval battlesThe story beggining is too dragged out and the ending is rushedConnor seems stupid and not as interesting as EzioThe crafting system could have been really good but it was too hard for me so i skipped the whole thing because you can get away with your tomahawk and defeat your enemies easily
