I loved assassins creed when it first came out. If I have to be honest, though, Assassins creed has become tired. They keep pushing out the same game with a new title without adding any sort of significant content to the games. Most of the time the plot doesnt even feel relevant to the gameplay. I would have recommended the first few, but the new ones are just tired.
