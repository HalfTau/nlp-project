Holy crap. If you are any fan of history, especially Revolutionary War history this game is a MUST buy! Thankfully, the previous entries problems with the user imput has been somewhat repaired, making the controls more intuitive and easy to use. The backstory of the previous games is also somewhat explained for those new to the series, so they can jump right in. Lastly, it has a naval combat system which is very addictive, most likely why the next entry in the series is going to focus on pirates. Overall a very solid game, laced in history.I mean, youre basically a ninja slaying redcoats. Whats not to like?
