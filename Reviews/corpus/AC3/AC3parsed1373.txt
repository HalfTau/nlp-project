AC3 is gorgeous, and.. About as challenging as reading a grocery store paperback. The character is running over obstables, performing technical moves.. I am staring at my hands. My only controller input is Pressing forward on the thumbstick.AC adds the difficulty as optional objectives. I would have loved to make the game harder in a meaningful way. So many times I just could not enjoy the controls. So I plowed through missions, skipping the optional objectives, and recieved the lowest scores.Uplay was a disaster. I must have put six hours into the game before I figured out how to get it to save. I had to uninstall uPlay, and download the most recent version. Then I turned off cloud saves just to be safe. So that is to say I restarted from the beginning three times. Not a good start.The characters lacked development. I felt almost no emotion for them or their relationships during the entire game. I just kept asking, why do I care about any of this?Its a beautiful world and almost none of it mattered to me. I didnt feel compelled to perform a single side mission. No motivating reason to go exploring.Why would I want to kill a troupe of redcoats in the middle of a sunny day in Boston? For their heckling a citizen? I wouldnt choose death.Why would I kill a merchant to give some kid like one meal?Why employ a bunch of people to work on the house that I care nothing about?Why raise money with bloody hands for goods that dont move the story along?Why murder a convoy in the middle of the forest?Why go hunting and kill like 7 animals in one day so I can sell their meat and pelts for petty change? The game doesnt require anyone to eat.. So why go hunting for sport?None of it was compelling.While the credits were rolling, I felt completely moved. Thousands of poeple must have worked on this.
