A huge disappointment after AC2s level expectations. Boring setting, boring plot, full of bugs and glithes, primitive battle mechanics. On top of that the main character makes an impression of an errand fool  half of the game consists of delivery of random stuff to random places. And when something real is to be done it leaves an impression that Connor cant make even obvious conclusions.
