Assassins Creed III is to me the game that represents the most what the whole franchise should be.This game is the only Assassins Creed that gave me a wow effect when playing it. You can admire the leap technology made coming from AC Revelation.There were improvements in either the gameplay, the game design and the storyline which in my opinion is the best one so far including the more recent ones.As Im writing this review long after the game release i can say that it is the last Assassins Creed I enjoyed playing and I hope Ubisoft will go back to this point in the franchise.
