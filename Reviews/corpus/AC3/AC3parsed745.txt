Cannot change resolution in video settings  the option does not exists. According Google this issue exists for years for those who connect more than one screen.I do not wish to reconnect cables simply to play this game.Moreover, far worse issue, which exists since 2014 according to Google, I cannot play Tyranny of the King Washington DLCs because the game shows that the Ubisoft servers are offline.I will refund this game.
