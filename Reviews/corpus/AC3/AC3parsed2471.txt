Well, choosing whether I recommend this game or not was a difficult task. First of, I am a AC franchise fan, so I like the story a lot, and of course, this game, like all AC games is a must have. Still, compared to other games, it might have lost some of its story factor.What I did likeNavigating a 18 century ship. Nice experience.Hunting. No, Id really NEVER hunt in real live, but the hunting in this game, due to its economics, is strangely rewarding.What I did not likeIts basically the same, isnt it?Desmonds FatherAt first, due to the possibility to travel between maps, the game is a bit confusing.This a very superficial short review, so I will just keep it like this short.Buy this game when its on a deal price.
