Uplay mandatory, and a tedious protagonist added to the fact that AC is a series to which innovation seems unknown make it hard to recommend, UNLESS you absolutely love AC.Disappointingly, it comes with a strong start and an interesting protagonist, before changing the perspective to a different one altogether who I can barely remember anything of on account of how bland he is.My conclusion on AC3 was that it was a game let down by Ubisofts undeserved loyalty to the AC experience, rather than doing something a bit different/unique in the AC universe.
