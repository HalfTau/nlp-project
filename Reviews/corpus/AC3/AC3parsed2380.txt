OK to be honest, at first I didnt much like the setting of AC3  but it is handled pretty well. Some differences in gameplay also were a bit off at first, but gotten used to them. It was nice knowing Conor and his adventures and also further the story about Desmond and the templars. Get it on a sale if you find it expensive.
