This game. Yeah this game was AWESOME. Merica before all the apache helicopters. If you liked all of the previous Assassin games you will love this one. 3 is a magic number in case you either forgot the song or are to young to know what in the actual f I am talking about. In which case dont get this game because you are to young. Youll put your eye out kid. ANYWAY, this recommendation. Buy this game. For everytime you dont buy this game a small goat is chucked off that same cliff that the spartans chucked the little deformed babies except that one guy who betrayed them. F that guy. But what do the two have in common blood shed.... just like an apache helicopter. See you thought all of this was just a giant rant. Look at that we came full circle. So either buy this or buy the first one you have not played. Because seriously who jumps into a series in the middle. You? Well you suck. Jumping in to this series in the middle is like getting married to a  in Las Vegas. You dont know how you got there and you dont know what is going on. You like it but there is immediate regret. Dont be that guy. You dont want to be that guy. So in conclusion buy this game unless you are that  guy and save a goat. Then go kill one in Skyrim which you should also buy. Steam should freakin pay me for this I swear.
