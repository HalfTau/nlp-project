Bought this during the Steam Sale expecting to have a good playthrough even though I already haD the game on xbox only to find out this game is poorly optimized for PC, my system far outweighs the reccomended specs however in city areas I recieve around 20fps at some points, that was even at low/normal settings, the game is around 2 and a half years old now and should have had an fps drop/stutter fix long ago.. Dont bother buying this game on PC..
