Hi all. Today I will talk about the game Assassins Creed III. I think the best game in the series that I review will try to tell you why. Lets start with the plot. The story I liked very much, it has everything for this game, great plot twists. Holes in the plot I was watching. Graphics/great Gameplay for games of that year, however, in one of the missions was a bug with the hair of Connor. The game also written a great soundtrack. The ending of the game is great, however, killed the main character of the series, that broke the series in my opinion. Overall the game is excellent and I advise everyone to play it. Besides the main missions, the game is available for many additional missions. Search for treasure, travel in the sea, to improve his estate, to liberate the city and to recruit new assassins. However, these missions are not so easy, but for them, you will get a good reward and enhance synchronization. This game changed the parkour, it was much better. My assessment of this game.The plot  10/10.Graphics/Gameplay  8/10.Soundtrack  10/10.Parkour 9/10RU .
