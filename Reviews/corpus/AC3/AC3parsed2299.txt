Compared to all of the other AC in this great series this one is by far the worst IMO. The story line is very slow and there is a twist in the plot which I was not happy about. I love this time period in human history and this game just does not deliver. Also I could not help but notice all of the social statements hidden within the game. That type of subject/material does not belong in the gaming industry.
