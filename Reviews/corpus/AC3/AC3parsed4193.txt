As the supposed end to the Assassins Creed Trilogy, AC3 does little to appease those whove been fans from the beginning.Single PlayerThe single player, while admitedly had vast maps, didnt encourage you at all to explore the area. The wide open ranges of the cities, and the twisting and confusing treeline of the forest left a lot to be desired in the parkour department, and completing optional objectives like building up your homestead seemed to be very unimportant to anything game wise. The oceanic portions were fun for a bit, and the original twist at the beginning left be wanting more, however the plot just didnt follow through. The ending was a large build up that left in dissappointment, and the main character for the majority of the game made me yearn for the Desmond scenes. Overall, I wasnt that satisfied with the approache taken for this single player campaign.MultiplayerWhile entertaining, and an improvement on the previous versions, it still falls trouble to what plagued those before it. Those whove played the game longer will have better weapons, and this kind of multiplayer isnt raking in the people like a game such as Call of Duty would. Thats not to say it wasnt fun, Ive spent many hours playing the multiplayer, and its still as thrilling as ever to be stalking your prey and swing at the right moment to get buku bonus points.Overall, I feel the main reason to play an AC game is the Single Player, and I would have payed around 1520 for that. The multiplayer pulled through offering improvements, however you could find yourself waiting for a game for a while, and then instantly getting sniped by those who have more playtime/dont care about stealth.
