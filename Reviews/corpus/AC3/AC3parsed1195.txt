Clearly not the best Assassins Creed, but not the worst. The story is good, but Connor is just bland. Hes just like a dumb tribal, blinded by rage. Haytham though, HE IS AMAZING! One of my favourite characters of this frachise.I dont want to spoil anything, but the final boss is very lame! Youve made the wroooong decision, Ubisoft!If you are a fan of the franchise, you should play it now! If you are just into history, you should just give it a chance.The combat is very good, but the upgrading system is tottaly broken. I played the entiire game not knowing you could get better gear!I enjoyed it, but after I finished the main story, there isnt a reason to continue playing.Its worth buying on a sale. 8.2/10
