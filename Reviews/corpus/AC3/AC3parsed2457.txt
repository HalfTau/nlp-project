Took a break after AC2. Figured Id give the franchise another shot and ended up with III. While it was fun to get back into the whole Assassin scheme again this one just fell short in so many, many ways. Story wasnt interesting or engaging to me, the control changes just made me want to headdesk and so after walking away from it for a bit I just had absolutely no reasons to go back and finish it. Unfortunate, but thats me.
