A lot of people seem to dislike this AC entry because they dont like Connor, and that is their loss. Ezio is a bon vivant, Edward is a salty rascal, and Connor is a stoic Native American. His character isnt as fun, but he is spoton when I compare him to other Native Americans in my personal experience.The gameplay is by now vintage AC, and it is somewhat less sophisticated than Black Flag. The sailing missions are also much more limited than BF or Rogue, which is appropriate given its placement in the series. But where the game shines is in the story, with actual characters and development that makes sense for a change. The modern scenes are a bit offputting, but stil fit into the narrative. If you know the history of the time, many of the characters become more interesting and it creates greater immersion in the story. Think of Ezio as a swashbuckler movie, Edward as obviously a more serious pirate romp, and Connor as a fine period drama. If that is your thing, this is a great title, and one of the best. If you are looking for a wellcrafted story, this is also a good choice. If you know nothing of US history or dont care for a more realistic depiction of Native Americans than we usually get in games, then keep on walking.Update Hundreds of hours of AC gameplay later, I still like this one for its story. I wish that they would have crafted some of the later, more technically gifted, games with as much subtlety and nuance.
