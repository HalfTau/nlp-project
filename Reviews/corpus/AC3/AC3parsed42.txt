Pros Massive open world Provide hunting experiences Get a glimpse of early USCons Simple battle tactics Mindless parkour, unlike the the Ezio series Too many plotholes, cannot get what the story is Ignorant main character, after a complicated and interesting tutorial character Prepare to be a brute, rather than an assassin
