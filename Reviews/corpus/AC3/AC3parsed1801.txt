If you have not played this game, I do recommend you to get it!!!!You play as the main character, Ratonhnhakton I do not know how to say this LMAOOOOOOO  or also known as Connor Kenway, as you try to stop the British Forces they are templars too from stopping the independence that the patriots are trying to put against Britain. Connor is just a badass who helps people achieve freedom. oh  btw did I mention his dad was a Templar?The idea to use history as a guide is incredibly smart and the way they put in the Assassins and Templars hidden war within is very smart and awesome. I am super into history, but I am born and raised in Canada, and yes our history sucks. It is very dull and boring, not compared to American history. So much more rich and full.The storyline of this game is incredible and the graphics are dropdead gorgeous, even though this game is quite old.I think this is my favorite Assassins Creed game sofar, I still have to play the ones after this.
