Its not the story, cutscenes, no rooftop to rooftop jumping etc etc. Its the bugs. Usually when i play a game that is 4 years old i find bugs here and there occasionally. Things that dont really frustrate you just get your attention and make you go meh. But this game is a whole different story. Constant stream of bugs just blasted on your face even from the early hours of the game. And no not small bugs, annoying bugs that make you wanna rip your hair out of your head one by one. At first I just thought the game was hard, but after luring a guard from his post and realizing that another guard just spawned right back at that post i figured that its just so unbearable. I really want to complete this game, but its too damn frustrating to deal with these bugs id rather play AC 2, Brotherhood and Revelations than waste my time.
