A visual and cinematic masterpiece! The setting takes place during the american revolution, a time period that has not been thoroughly explored in 3d games, and for this reason, adds an intriguing and different feeling to the game.Great attention to details in sounds, movement and atmostphere. Movements of haytham are fluid and responsive. He will lower his centre of gravity when moving side to side while running, and make aggressive faces when performing brutal moves. This game shows lots of polish.This scenery is just beautiful...Trudging through snow, beautiful trees and countryside.Great storytelling that will keep you on the edge, make you happy, angry, and sometimes very shocked!This presents a unique experience of playing as the mohawks and the settlers/british during the 1750s Plus.They took the series into a more story based plot, as opposed to a run everywhere plot MMO,Much to my liking. The naval battles added a whole new atmosphere and were very well done, it eliminates any doubt as to why the next installment was Black Flag.A masterpiece, should not be missed! !
