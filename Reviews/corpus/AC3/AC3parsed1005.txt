Definitely a waste of 10 bucks. Combat system is okay, but the movement system is awkward and jilted, the story is slow, and the awkwardness of the movement system carries over into the combat. Most common way to get shot cant walk towards your enemy properly. In addition, there is no way to change the control scheme, and you have to look it up online in the first place. Asssassinating enemies is easy, except when your guy decides to kick him into his allies instead of quietly stabbing him.
