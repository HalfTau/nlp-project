This game is the most frustrating experience out there.  controls and whacky animations, coupled with telepathic and ly agile AI, makes it extremely hard to have fun. Prepare to have your throat ed up because of how much youll scream at this game. Checkpoint system is also absolute combat is extremely easy like other AC titles. When youre not screaming or crying at this game it is pretty fun. Has more features relevant to revolution than Unity, you can start riots n Too bad you cant kill orphans.EDIT Came back after playing suffering some more, with more complaints. Outifts dont show in cutscenes. Outfits like Ezios and Altairs do show, but the dyed ones do not. You would think Ubisoft would fix this little quirk after all this time but nope. Story is extremely weak. Too much Desmond bullsht, fck that guy. I liked Haytham who is supposedly the mastermind behind the bad guys more than Connor. You would think that as soon as he sees the bad guy he would just go up to him and ravage hisbut no, he just talks to him democraticaly, am I playing a Native American or a democratic and ethical mastermind? Just stab him and save me 15 hours of buggy sht ffs.You can literally kill everyone in a fort, but not liberate it, and go outside the area, come back and EVERYONE would have respawned. The AI is absolute bullsht, they see you a mile away and its literally impossible to outrun them.TLDR Buy this only if youre a saint with abnormal amounts of patience, youll need it. Youll probably lose your sanity within 10 hours of playing this.
