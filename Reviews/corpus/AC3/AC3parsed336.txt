This is my favorite of the Assassins Creed series and I put it up there with Red Dead Redemption for open world games. The game does both cities and wilderness very well. The combat is visceral. While the ship content isnt open world, it feels tighter and more epic than the Black Flag ship combat.To me, this feels like the most complete Assassins Creed experience.My advice to those starting out The games intro missions are lengthy and can turn some people off. I would recommend powering through these tutorial missions until the first big turn of events happens. Theyre great missions for story, but arent representative of the majority of the game. Stick with it!
