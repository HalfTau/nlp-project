As this was the third Assassins Creed game I had a chance to indulge, I was at first extremly excited to play as Connor. The idea of playing as a native american had ample chances for the Assassins Creed universe to really indulge upon the unique nature of the culture, rather it seemed to stray away from it for the most part. Which is I suppose alright, though the story would have been a bit more believable if poor Connor had more obstacles in his way pretaining to his Native American Roots. After all the time period was known for its harsh outlook on the natives. Still for a game, it was fun to play and the mechanics though watered down were enjoyable none the less.
