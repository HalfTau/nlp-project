I recommend this game however this is the weakest in the Series and lacks the excitement of previous games the protagonist is dull and bland. The start of the game is a lot of handholding and is super slow. The best part of this game is the ship battles Id recommend getting this game but only when its on sale really lackluster compared the other games. Also Id recommend the Tyranny of Washington DLC.
