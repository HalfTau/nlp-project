As a history person i love the AC series and love everything about this game. Probably my favorite of all AC games, basically standard AC style do missions same combat system blah blah blah but I feel that the map its self is the best part endless options for running around and killing red coats and havent had a terrible issue with Uplay although sometimes Uplay or the game is a wee bit laggy but my stystem is getting older and I have a older graphics card so these are things on my end but I would suggest getting this game havent got to play much due to work but during my next day off I plan to play it
