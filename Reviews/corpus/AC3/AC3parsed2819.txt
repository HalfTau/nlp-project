A polarizing entry in the AC universe  this one barely scrapes through as a recommendation.The yearly release schedule is showing an everincreasing degradation of quality. AC3 is a rushed product with several bugs, spelling and grammar mistakes, and a seeming downgrade of combat mechanics from previous AC games that lends itself more to frustration than challenge. New players will likely be overwhelmed by featurecreep popups with no clear explanation of where to go or what to do.The main storyline is overshadowed by the protagonist Connor a selfcentred, selfrighteous, indignant ignoramus. Not the most empathetic of characters and irritating for the most part. The collection quests are mostly a time sink which add little to the game. Unfortunately or fortunately I couldnt explore the crafting system due to lack of instruction, buggy controls and a terrible interface, so I was forced to use Cheat Engine to earn cash.For all its faults, the naval excursions saved this game. Ship battles are excellently executed and have kept me invested in the series and looking forward to playing Black Flag.Surprisingly, The Tyranny of King Washington DLC outshines the main game, introducing three new abilities which  without giving anything away  are worth playing it for.
