I had some fun with the previous games and Altairs, Desmonds and Ezios stories was something I immensely enjoyed. It was well paced and fun, just the right pace to ensure a pleasant playthrough with a nice story.Also, I learned some interesting stuff about history.Assassins creed III, on the other hand, is really boring.It introduces some new elements  fine. That is something to work with, but the setting is something you see pretty much every year, at least once. I get it that for the Americans their Civil War is super important, but everybody  the whole wide wolrd  has seen it throusands of times and Im pretty sure a random kid in Amsterdam or Warsaw could easily pass an exam on Civil War due to all the exposure this topic gets in movies and games.And one of the selling points Experience the truth behind the most gruesome war in history the American Revolution, are you serious? Have you ever been to Africa?The gameplay is barely different from the previous games, just because there are some new tools doesnt mean its suddenly so innovative.The story is another cliched one  the lone survivor, abandoned by his father finds a father figure and takes revenge on father. I dont think I can digest the same story AGAIN.Naval battles are ok I was glad they went farther in that direction in Black Flag and made it actually really enjoyable, hunting is also ok terribly repetitive though.Crafting was fine too, but the delivery/shopping/running around in circles instead of just handing in a bunch of quests in a more convinient, smaller area was a little too much.If there was a scale here, I would give this game 40 out of 100. It was a pretty thing to look at.
