Probably my favorite Assassins Creed game, simply because it takes so much time to introduce you to the world it builds. Youll spend hours playing this game before you even get to play the actual protagonist. This might not be for everyone, but if you love games with an immersive atmosphere, you definitely have to jump into this interpretation of the American Revolution. The snowy landscapes are one of the most beautiful and memorable things Ive seen in my history of gaming.Dont expect this game to be perfect, the main character is lacking any distinctive image or personality, the frame story is negligible at best and the AI is as terrible as it has always been in the AC series. BUT. The atmosphere is freaking amazing and the actionfilled gameplay is pretty cool. Jumping and climbing through the woods of this huge open world is a lot of fun. You should definitely play this game at some point.
