Its...ok. The game itself is beautiful, however the combat system is lacking. I switched back to this game after playing Shadows of Mordor and found the combat system frustrating. The storyline is unnecessarily complicated, its getting a little silly.Also...theres now UPlay bundled with this game. I cant stand vendor bundled crap like this.
