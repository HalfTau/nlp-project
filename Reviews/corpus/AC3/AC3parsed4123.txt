Say, for example, you like shouting at people. Or perhaps you had an emo phase in high school and are pining to go back to those days when you could act like a pessimisticto everyone with little to no repercussions. And say that currently, your video game habit has destroyed all your real life relationships, and you dont have family to shout at or a social circle to discuss with howthe world is any more? Then step on in to the assassin themed boots of Connor Kenway. Shout at people! Act sad! Pat a dog! Find Charles Lee! Shoot a horse! Horses are dumb, am I right? Look at their legs, wtf? Climb trees! Fall out of trees! Assassin a man! Wear a hat! Drive a boat! Stab a bear! Hate your dad!So much to do. What a great game.
