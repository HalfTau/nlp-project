Ubisoft Lets make a game in which we say  YOU to physics and anatomy in which the main character can climb all sort of ed upbut cant climb up a pallet stack or a fance, let alone shelves.Great game though, especially if youre craving for something set in the 18th century. Beautiful graphics, huge world. I recommend a controller so you can sit back and just enjoy it.The present time side quests are completely useless and I have no idea why they included them, also the present time character are PAINFULLY stupid.Requires Uplay malware
