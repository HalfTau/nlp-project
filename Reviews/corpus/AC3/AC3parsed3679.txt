For the base game, AC3 is a really inconsistent game. It starts off intriguing for a while, then shifts to a really long, boring middle, and then escalates to a pretty satisfying final quarter. Downsides include the tedium of frontier navigation and overly tenacious guards throughout the game. Upsides include a pretty entertaining look at a historical fiction version of the American Revolution and the naval combat. It was fun being a character inserted into major events of the birth of America, albeit with the AC3 twists applied to them. And the ship sequences were very entertaining and easily one of the best parts of the base game.The DLC expansion is a solid 6 or so hours of gameplay, but I only found the last two hours truly engaging from a story perspective. Each of the 3 chapters adds a cool new animal power that changes up the gameplay in interesting ways and overall I was satisfied with the experience and especially the conclusion of the story.
