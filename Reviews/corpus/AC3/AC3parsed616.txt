Summary of AC 3 Great new mechanics and fighting options, the new bow and the rope dart are the main focus. Great plot twists, you dont have to like the main protagonist but you will definitely like the main antagonist. It brought us the naval combat for the first time, which led to AC 4 later on. Hunting as well, if albeit repetitive and boring sometimes. Trip mines! we have it, it works great and i love messing up with redcoats and blowing them up with it.If you like AC series you have to play it, simply because it brought so many new features and options to the series.
