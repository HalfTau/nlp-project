This game is ing I only was able to play the first missions till I arrived in Boston. Then the game crashed again and again and again. I couldnt even close it. I had to reboot my PC to get back to my desktop. And after I decided to give it the hundreth chance, it didnt let me continue in Boston. The game wanted me to play the whole Intro again. So I said,  this ing and closed it. And its not only these bugs that are totally annoying, its also the part that i could play a run from cuntscene to cuntscene. Worst AC Ive ever played.
