Assassins Creed III reminds me of the very first game of the series in a few different ways. It seeks to bring something new, but it is a bit unrefined. The story is interesting, but it does drag on in some parts.Those things dont detract from the overall experience in my opinion. The new setting is just as captivating as previous ones in its own way, and the new main character, Connor, is a multilayered personality, who starts out somewhat arrogant and naive, but by the end, is something more. ACIII also has what seems to me to be the best and most interesting antagonists. This is the first time since the first Assassins Creed where you might question whether or not the villains are actually right or not except ACIII does an even better job of this.
