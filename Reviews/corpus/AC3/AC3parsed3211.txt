Assassins creed now with 500 more glitches.Enjoy flickering models that slow the game down to a crawl, riding an insivible wagon, shooting a guy and having his ragdoll stretch to 50 times its size while rocketing into the air, detection icons the size of a mosquito, and best of all, enemies that can see through walls and have psycic abilities to detect when their buddy behind them has been quietly taken out.All graciously delivered through the best DRM service ever, UPlay.
