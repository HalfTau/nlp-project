Wow  what a dissapointment. I have been playing thru all the AC games in order, and this was the first one I really had no fun with.  Yes, I did finish the entire main game, and the George Washington DLC, but just cannot recommend it.  Looking back at all the hours I spent with the game, I really had very little fun and most of it was just a chore to get through.  You can really tell they farmed out the work to like 50 different teams to work on with seemingly no overall vision or management.  What comes together then is a mess of different types of gameplay, seemingly too many types, but never really any fun.  Yes, Im glad I picked this up on sale and slogged through it in my attempt to play all the AC games, but this was a total letdown from the previous games in the series.  And I even liked the Vita pcport Liberation and liked that one wayu better than this.  I really hope the next game in the series is better than this one!
