After playing the first few Assassins Creeds, I decided to buy this guy. So far, I have been very disappointed. The story line seems meh and doesnt pull me in. There are several individuals you want to assassinate. It seems like rather than developing a story, they throw in historical events in Americas history. What youre left with is something that feels disjointed and frankly just boring. Rather than wanting to turn the next page or play another hour, you want to just hurry up and get it over with. For this, I give it a thumbs down.
