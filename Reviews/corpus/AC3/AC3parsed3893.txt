NOTE REWRITING FOR PROPER CRITIQUEA lot of people didnt like this game particularly because it contained quite a few bugs at launch, and because of the infamous Boston FPS Drop from the porting to PC. The mission bugs and general gameplay bugs are still present, the Boston FPS Drop from my knowledge doesexist anymore.In my opinion, the removal of some parkour mechanics from the older games was not needed, such as being able to run up a wall and back eject, or run up a wall and jump to another ledge. I do like the fact though that only one key needs to be held to freerun, and not two. However, I prefer the older twokeyed freerunning because you could control the player much more efficiently.This game should not be hated but rather avoided in favor of the older titles or IV if youre starting out in the series. Its enjoyable in itself but not to a lot of people.
