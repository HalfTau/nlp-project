While it has its flaws and the Assassins Creed grind, I enjoyed the game the first time through, enough so that Im playing it a second time.The default control scheme is awkward as far as I can tell, this is a concensus, but a few things make it less so.

However, they also include most of Connors ranged weapons such as the Rope Dart, Poison Dart, Pistol, Bow and Arrow, and Musket.  Having the activation key on E made it more comfortable in combat.  Also functions as reload when appropriate.Interact on Shift means youll start missions with Shift, but it also delegates a number of other actions that previously wouldve been done with shift in past AC titles.Q as Weapon Selector is to keep it close at hand, which youll want since you only have four quick selects while keeping as many as four main weapons I think and at least half a dozen frequently used tools Bow for Stealth, Pistol for combat, Rope Dart for combat, Horse Whistle, Snares, and Bait just to name a few.  Personally, I use Quick Selects for combat options.  1 Hidden Blade 2 Primary Weapon 3 Rope Dart 4 Pistol.  Everything else will be less frequently used inside of conflict, meaning more immersion.
