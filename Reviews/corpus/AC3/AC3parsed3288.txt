I may be done with Assassins Creed III. 12 hours in, still in the tutorial and now its turning into a  colonial homestead simulator. Ubisoft, if I had wanted that I would have bought Banished I didnt want that!I think Ive been an assassin for 1520 minutes so far in this game  gopher running back and forth doing stupid  boring tasks for people the rest of that time.I keep thinking This has got to really get going soon! but then they decide to introduce a whole new batch of stuff I couldnt care less about.In the last mission I completed I got to send some wood I bought through a menu option to a merchant via another menu option. I was shaking with excitement!The next mission Im supposed to attend to entails going to buy a few cannons  hire some guys for my boat... really!?! FUN!I played some of AC1 got bored, all of 2a, 2b  2c burnt out on these and took a long break before this one. It would have been really nice if they would have added animus tutorials accessible from a menu for newcomers so that veteran players didnt have to play through all the initial handholding of both the old  newer mechanics. Popup some tooltips while Im playing if you want, but dang guys, just let me start the game when I START THE GAME.Ill update this if I keep going and change my mind, but it shouldnt take this long to get to the good part in any game.
