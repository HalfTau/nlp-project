I would have to say that ACIII probably has the best plot since the original game, and returns to the war of ideals in a much better way than Ezios plot ever did. It sort of got lost between his snarkyness and trying to be a Renessaince James Bond. Anyway, the characters are memorable, the depictions of the United States founding fathers are very, very grounded, and the character of Connor is refreshing, shifting from a sarcastic womanizer to an idealistic, strongwilled youngster. It also finally gives a lot more rounding to Desmonds character, and John freaking de Lancie is the VO for his dad.Long story short, best game of the series, always worth the cash, pick it up if you love good stealth games.
