I bought this, because I wanted to continue with Desmond. I have played for about 8 hours, and am beginning to wish I would not have bought it. So many things to not like, including bugs. The first bug was near the beginning, when I finished saving someone, but a few seconds later, the game told me to save him! And it said it again a minute later. In addition, many times during fights, I was empty handed, but still could not pick up a weapon, even if I was standing next to it. Many times, I got tired or bored and quit playing. Also, I suppose indian music and dialog were added to lend authenticity. They used English subtitles, which meant that I had to divert my attention from the action to read. I wish the dialog was in English so I could pay attention to the action. Hopefully, this is in this one small part, and wont last long. I also do not like Native American music. I have been hearing it constantly for awhile now, because I have to keep starting over. Tooo many times, I could not figure out what I was supposed to do until it was too late... in this section and others before it. In forests, there were many times that trees blocked my view. I hate that. And there was one part in the forest when I kept getting killed by wolves. I had a sword and my blades, and I was not allowed to kill fricking wolves! That was not even an option. That does not make sense at all.
