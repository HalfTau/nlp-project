before i started playing this everyone told me this was the worst assassins creed game until unity came along, i dont know about unity, but i must say i was pleasantly suprised by this game, im playing them chronologically and so far this is actually my favourite, the camera can derp sometimes but i really like the story and the mechanics, so far it seems like something id highly recommend.
