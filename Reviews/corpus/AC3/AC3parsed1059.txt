I think that this game has a good story in it, besides that, I think its better to have 6 items in our main inventory, and not 4 as when I have to change to my rope darts or flintlocks, I still have to enter the inventory to swap them, its annoying.Other than that, the games good, just a little lag and my FPS is always 24, pretty annoying.
