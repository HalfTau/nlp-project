Love how the guards would see you so easily and when they go looking for you, they try looking for you forever. They dont move and they just keep looking for you. Love the AI. Also, some of the missions for full synchronization was just plain rtarded. Like in that one mission, you have to air assassinate a grenadier and not get detected when the ship was full of guards walking and standing around just to get full synchronization. And why do you reload for like 5 seconds when the guns in older AC games would reload immediately?!
