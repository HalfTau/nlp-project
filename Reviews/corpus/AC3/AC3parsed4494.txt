Great action adventure game with a variety of side missions to do to keep any avid gamer thrilled, from collectables, assassinations, brawls, hunting and not for getting the new Naval Battles where you get to captain your own ship.  As well as these the continuation of Desmond Miles story a nobody thrown into a world of the Assassins and Templars. Enough said before I start writing spoilers been playing it for 30 hours and not yet bored, so what you waiting for?
