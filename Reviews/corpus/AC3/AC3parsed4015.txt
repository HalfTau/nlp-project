I found this game to be too much of a departure from the previous AC games. Where I found that I could previous games with either mouse and keyboard or controller, this version was unplayable without using a controller. Even then I found it difficult to move smoothly and I felt I was battling for precise controls of the character rather than the being immersed in the story. I did not find the story line particularly appealing nor were the characters very interesting, though I must admit, I not an American. The graphics were stunning, but most of the scenery did not do it any justice, as the winters sparse white and the rest of the time it was usually ditry browns and greys.I found this game to be disappointing and fact I put it way for several months. I only returned to the game when the AC4 media hype began just to finish off the story line.I would recommend this game only to people following the entire series. Otherwise, perhaps skip this version, and hope for the best with Black Flag. For this game, the storyline was forgettable, the controls were frustrating, and the visual panoramas that usually come with the game were disappointing.
