Excellent game. The hunting feature was my favorite of all features. Although Parkour and Mountain climbing come in at a close second. I was very pleased to have so many options besides following the main story line. With many diverse weapons and characters alike, I rate 9/10.Side note I would of liked to have throwing knives as a weapon like in Assassins Creed 2 but beggars cant be choosers
