I love Assassins creed games and I liked Assassins creed 3 A LOT but I prefer the Ezio Trilogy.  I havent played AC 4 yet but I can assure you that AC3 is woth the price of admission.  I currently havent played through the Tyrany of Kind Washington expansion packs although I own them because they seem to not hold my attention.  I simply cant get into them and do not like the playstyle introduced in those expansion packs.  Id say GET AC3 and avoid the expansion packs unless you get them dirt cheap and even then, dont be surprised if you start them and quit because they suck.
