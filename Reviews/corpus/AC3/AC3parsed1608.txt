Really good game. In my opinion its the best in the assassins creed series. It has a very good storyline with some pretty good graphics to go along. Some people are complaining about only getting like 15fps, but thats not the case for me. I have a GTX 660 and im playing on all highest settings with AA on just high and achieving a solid 60 fps in all environments, cutscenes, and fight scenes.Negatives1. Ive noticed that groups of people sometimes disappear or just spawn right in front of me.2. It has UPLAY
