The story is very good, I especially liked howgraphics are also very good. But it seems for every new Assassins Creed title that comes out, there are more glitches Ubisoft missed. Usually the side missions just include retrieving something, which is boring unless its in enemy territory. In my opinion, the series should have ended here,and there seems no use in playing any more games, as the story should be finished, but Ubisoft must milk money out of it. But aside my rambling, good game, buy it, play it a few days, you will be satisfied.
