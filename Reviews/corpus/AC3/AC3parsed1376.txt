I played this when it came out on the Xbox 360 back in 2012. It was great and I picked up the PC version on sale and I have to say the experience is even better.Story This is the conclusion to the desmond miles storyline and I dont know how to explain a synopsis without spoiling the game but the story is indeed a selling point of this game. The game is beautiful it ran 720p 30 FPS on the 360 and if your rig is moderate it can kill this game. Got 1080p 60FPS no problem on a gtx 750ti and an I34170 processor with hyperthreading. I was able to run it at 1536p 60FPS on High settings so that sould tell you something. Overall the story is great and should not be looked over.Gameplay Classic Assassins creed you will be jumping, climbing, stabbing, sychronizing viewpoints etc. So what makes this game special from the past games? Well besides new weapons, new parkour abilities, etc. its the open world. In the American Revolution setting you can go to Boston, New York, the Frontier as the main locations. You can hunt animals and there is also Naval Combat but its in missions and not free roam If you want that go play Black Flag. Multiplayer returns as well and like the multiplayer from Brotherhood and Revelations its fun and intense so do not skip over it. Gameplay is once again a reason to buy this game.Bad Stuff Besides a few flat characters I really dont have anything to complain about the game is Very good. I will say the first three hours of the game is a glorified tutorial thatll make even the biggest AC fan cringe. It uses that to set up the story and its worth getting through.Final Verdict Back in 2012 I thought this game was worth 60 so at 20 on steam you need to add it to your collection right now. DO IT!
