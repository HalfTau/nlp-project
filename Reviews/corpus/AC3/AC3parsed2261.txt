A great game. I have played through all the previous game, and a chunk of Black Flag, but while many people seem to think      it fine tuned the rough edges of III, Im not sure. The killmoves are much more intense with Connor rolling under attacks,disarming enemies even when not using fists and finishing with brutal blows in the no threatback or face. The tomahawk, while not being a traditional assassin weapon, is small and effective and suits Connor well, as does the replacer of the crossbow as a long range stealth weaponthe bow. The crafting can be complex, but the homestead missions cover a nice story aside from the vicious mission of revenge. The naval missions are not as immersive as Black Flag, as you cannot simply jump in your ship and go exploring, but then youre not a pirate. The hunting is perhaps easier than Black Flag, although that does make it somewhat less interesting a bear attack has little chance to hurt you, so poses no real threat but a leopard could single handedly kill you if you dont shoot it first in Black Flag. Overall, many new additions that compliment the game particularly the freerunning in trees and the ability to attract enemies by whistling, though it was a shame not to be able to use it when hiding in the new hidespots that you can move around in.And my favourite weapon rope darts from above!
