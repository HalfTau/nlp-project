The Story really goes toin this one, the gameplay is basically like watching a movie, the stealth is pointless since you can just single handedly murder an infinite amount of dudes, and the platforming is not as it was in previous games as Boston and New York in those days have only single story buildings to climb around on.The best thing about this game is prbly the sailing but that is entirely optional in the story line.I loved AssCreed before this game, havent touched another since I played this one.
