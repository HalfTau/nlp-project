Decent episode wich brings the basis of the boat elements furtherly developped. Many interesting missions, memorable warfields, enjoyable tree climbing, wild exploration and tradeskill management ... but an overall impression of less originality compared to the striking 2Brotherhood  4Black Flag. Decent but not mandatory.
