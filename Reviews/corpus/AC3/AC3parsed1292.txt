I do enjoy the game very much. I know this game in the series is not one of the well rated ones but I like this one. It has wonderful art and it works great on my P.C! my P.C is not a high end one at all! Its made to run windos XP for crying out loud! But this game some how runs great. I also got this game when it was only .69 cents so that made me happy D
