After playing the epic Ezio trilogy, Connor felt more like a wannabe assassin rather that a real one. That is why I did not like this one that much as the previous ones. Wanted to play it to know what happened to Desmond but thats it. Game is ok, I had most fun with all the glitches it had DAfter all I think I would recommend it, it has pretty nice combat system and new features like hunting and ship battles  for me it just doesnt feel like an Assassins Creed game.
