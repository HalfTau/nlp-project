Story and character was bland, couldnt access the DLC because the Ubisoft servers were down, so theres even more money down the drain. Tons of graphical glitches that made the game nearly unplayable. Its a miracle I was even able to force myself through the whole story. 10 of my hours alone were spent trying to fix the issues in this bugged out game. Avoid at all costs.
