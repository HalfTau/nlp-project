I mean, I find this game fun and interesting. Im only about 13 percent done with the story, but its really fun so far!ProsFighting is awesome, and the combos are deliciousYou actually need some sort of skill to fightThe running animations look goodNice storyConsDoesnt explain too much about the charactersBodies sometimes disappearBlood on your enemies disappearsEnemies get alerted even when youre not facing themOverall rating 9/10Great game overall, really give it a good try! Pretty cheap on the steam discount now, only 7 bucks. Worth it.
