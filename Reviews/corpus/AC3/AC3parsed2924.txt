What can I say.....well AC 3 is great! Storyline is fun and can be a laugh. Graphics are pretty good. As this for me was my second AC I started with Black flag the next one I was used to the way the game ran, controls that can be changed, the very friendly UI that guides you if you wished it to. Thier are many side missions that divert you away from the main mission that it is easy to forget what you were doing. It is enjoyable and fun, the animations of the charachters are great, actual key pressing for movement/actions is easy to pick up even if this type of game is not really your thing so it wont put you off playing.I bought this very cheap and got a lot of game for the small amount I paid for it. I got the extras included with my purchase so am very happy about that. I recommend this for sure and at the time of writting this, this AC was just 6.50ish for a delux edition incuding DLC, and extras. 8 October 2014. Get it while its cheap, you wont regret it even if you only play it once.
