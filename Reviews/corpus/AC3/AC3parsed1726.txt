Many people say that this is the weakest game in the Assassins Creed series, but I would have to strongly disagree. The first time I played this game I hated it. I thought it was extrememly slow and boring and only made it through the first few hours before quitting. Many years later I picked it up on a steam sale for 5 thinking I would play through it one more time to give it the chance it deserves. I am so happy I did. I really enjoy Connor and his story. I also really enjoy the setting, which is unlike any AC game before it. My only complaint is the very ending is extemely drawn out and very boring, much like the start of the game. But other than that, I really enjoyed it and cant wait to start AC4.
