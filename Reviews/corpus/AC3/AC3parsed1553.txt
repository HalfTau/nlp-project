Tried AC1 years ago and got bored after a few missions. Bought the rest of the series on sale the other day because I had read somewhere that the rest of the series was so much better than the first game. I deeply regret it so far. AC2 was utter crap from the very beginning I was actually unable to finish the tutorial because I had forgotten the key combos and the tutorial didnt bother to actually remind me and after the first few missions in Boston Im getting fed up with AC3. The combat is tedious, the open world design would have been neat if you didnt get tagged as a criminal simply for climbing a rooftop and the eavesdropping mechanic is just garbage.Uninstalled after 2 hours. Not even sure if Ill bother with Black Flag.
