This game is great! It builds upon the previous Creeds as the game play and graphics improve. I have played the console version and I did not like that version at all. I own the PC version and have invested a couple days worth of gameplay. There is so much to do. The Assassin Assignments mechanic is improved from Revelations. The combat is also very fun. Variations in fight tactics are easy to implement and do not take a lot of button sequence memorization as other games. Often you are rewarded with some cool move Conner doles out as he fights which is always fun to watch. I would say if you like the combat action in the movie The Patriot there is a lot of cinematic similarities as you chain kill redcoats. The rope dart is a fun addition to the game as well.Buy it play it youll love it.I can see why some people would rate this game negatively if you played AC4 Black Flag first. You cant go backwards in a game series as most elements will devolve.
