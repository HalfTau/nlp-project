The main character is insuferable and annoying. The game is playable but the story is a big downturn from the acceptable Assassins Creed II trilogy. The ship combat is topnotch however and the DLC can also be pretty amusing, but the main game suffers from a terrible main character and a shody story.Only play this if you want to see the end of the Desmond story, you dont need to play this if you just want to jump straight to AC IV.By the way, the game uses two wrappers. Steam and then Uplay. Uplay is awful and will often just lose your save or be down randomly. Ubisoft support is nearly nonexistent and very unhelpful.
