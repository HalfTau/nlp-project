I dont know how they could publish this game. So many bugs Falling throught the floor while dismounting, running against walls and no climbing, suddenly guard appear in front of you where no patrole was close, getting detected while no enemy is around, ...Especially when you try to play it as a real RPG with normal walking and sneaking it becomes super frustrating, that u want to punch every soldierin the game in the face.
