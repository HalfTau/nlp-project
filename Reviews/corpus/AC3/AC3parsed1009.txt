I swear man, Ezio may be charismatic, but Connor is a fckin badass. Yes he didnt have the best personality, but, this dude took down 2 battle ships on his own Also roasted Putnam by proving hes wrong about how connor will fail to take the battleships, run through a battlefield and survive and commanded a batallion. Plus, he have an awesome  asshol3 of a dad. Whats not to love?
