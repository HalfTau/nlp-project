Great game, no idea how this became the biggest disappointment of 2012, this was so much better than ME3 screw that game. The traversal and combat is the best of the franchise, the scope of this game is bigger than any other non mmo Ive ever played, story was great Conner, not as good a character as Ezio or Altair, but Hatham and ever other character in the game easily top all of the other games. Not sure where they go from here, they seemed to wrap up enough that another game wont have much to work with. Only criticism this game has a few of the worse action sequences of the entire series which was surprising given Revelations being the best in the series in that respect.
