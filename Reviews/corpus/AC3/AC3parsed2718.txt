Finished AC3 today and it was okay. It takes place during the colonial America period and you play mostly a native american called Connor. He acts kind of serious and sounds monotone. Whats really great about this is the navel combat and the hunting mechanics. While playing this you feel like the pawn instead of the hero in the end.At the end it feels like nothing was acomplished for both Connor and Desmond. Also that Connor was just trading one tyrant for another during the end after the credits rool. Its both equally boring and exciteing even though theres  a lot of handholding. Still it can be pretty good when it can. Havent really tried the multiplayer and probably might not.
