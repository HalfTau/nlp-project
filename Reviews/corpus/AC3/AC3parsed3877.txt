If youre new to the series, dont buy this game. Buy the second or Brotherhood and enjoy it. If youre already a fan, buy only if its on sale.Its certainly my least favorite game from the Assassins Creed franchise. This is the only one Im sure Ill never install to play again. I have been playing the series since the beginning and I must say this one has the most boring story. The fact that I dont know much about the American history must help, but still.The characters are flat and underdeveloped. I didnt sympathize for any of them. In the past games, I didnt quite like Altair and Ezio from the start, but they won me over. Connor just didnt.The main story that is shared between games is just procrastination.The side missions and things to do in the world like crafting items, hunting, catching almanac pages and others dont feel like fun tasks that you want to do neither they help you in the main story. They dont seem to offer much of a reward for the time they will consume, so I chose to ignore them.The combat system is good but I wouldnt say it was an improvement over the other games. Just different.The stealth part became more difficult because the enemies became more aware and the game didnt give more tools to deal with them. Its pretty frustrating sometimes.The full synchronization conditions of every mission that I enjoyed so much in previous games is just broken. Most of the conditions are stupidly hard or just plain stupid. At some time I just didnt care anymore about them.The game had some annoying bugs and it froze more times than I thought was normal, but it wasnt game breaking.At the end, its a good game, but not a great game. Might be worth your play, but not its full price.
