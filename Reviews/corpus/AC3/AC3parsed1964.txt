If you want to know how I reached the following conclusions, read the far more detailed impressions.Overall, I thought it was pretty all right. Better than Revealations, at least.The modern day plot was batshit stupid, but the modern plot was always stupid. At least there was some actual gameplay this time around. Definitely better than Black Flag Minigames and Office Meetings.The final fight was quite the step down from kicking the pope in the groin, but the thematic conflict was good.I kinda assumed that the fact that the game made a specific point of showing off the Assassin recruits before the final mission meant they would play a big part in the ending, but... well, thats Creed writing for youIt was buggy as hell, but so was Black Flag, and obviously so is Unity.Some of the systems were really really annoying to use, but some were actually quite interesting, and Im sad they were abandoned.I certainly dont regret playing this. The cheats are also pretty awesome, and at least arent tied to synchronization grrr, Black Flag
