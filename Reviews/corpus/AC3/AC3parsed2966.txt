This may be a pretty old game judging by how 4 new ACs are coming out or already is. The only why I prefer ACIII is not because only is it a good or beautiful game, but the fact that my pc can actually handle it pretty well on the lowest graphic qualtiy possible, well not the story, but multiplayer yes. I dont have pc gaming tech beside downloadable software running on Windows 7. Sure I might not be getting the full gaming experience and there are problems here and there, but nothing is ever perfect even if they say it. The onnly thing that I hate is that... is that there is no lower graphic settings than normal to boost performance to give you the speed you need. All I would want is an AC game for multiplayer to be atleast 30 fps without having to tweak it. Most of all the story!
