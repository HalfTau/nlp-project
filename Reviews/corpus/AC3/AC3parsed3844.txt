I really dont get why people dislike this. The only reason Ive found people dont like it is cause they changed out Ezio  but that doesnT change the fact that the game has fun gameplay, gripping story with some historical accuracy to boot and lovely visuals.Also, a major WTF moment, those are rare for me in games. 4/5.
