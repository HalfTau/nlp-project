Im going to keep this short. If you are a fan of the series and enjoy the overarching story I would recommend a person to play it. however it is a weak entry, the gameplay elements are there, but the execution is lacking, some parts of the game offers no real incentive to do them, and something about the way missions are structured is a bit lackluster. Though if you can look beyond some of the games weaker points it can be pretty enjoyable
