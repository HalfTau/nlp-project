I still enjoy the assasins creed formula but 3 has serious issues in terms of storytelling. Connor is the most unlikeable character ive ever seen with a one dimensional personality and bland voice acting, with an ending that makes you wonder why you even payed attention to the story of the series. However the gameplay is good and freerunning is fun as usual. get it in a steam sale and skip the cutscenes and you should be pretty happy with it.
