I am no die hard fanboy of Assassins Creed. I played Assassins Creed 2 Which was pretty amazing and part of Brotherhood. I bought this on sale here on Steam and was pretty excited to play it. After putting hours and hours into this game, I was beyond disappointed. The story has its flaws and almost no character development. The gameplay is laggy and feels almost moody at times. The graphics are one of the upsides of this game, so for what its worth, good job Ubisoft. I do not recommend this game. Im sure AC4 is much, much better  and Ive heard it is from people who also agree AC3 is terrible. Im not writing this because Im just mad and want to vent about this experience, But I just want to save you a few bucks. Dont buy it and instead bu AC2 or a newer AC game.
