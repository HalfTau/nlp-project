Full of game breaking glitches, really weak storyline, dull characters, weird combat  too weak ranged weapons, too overpowered close combat even without any special weapons. Worst AC experience between 1 and 3 havent played the new ones yet. Played it until the end for the sake of the overall series story. Wouldve abandoned mid game otherwise.
