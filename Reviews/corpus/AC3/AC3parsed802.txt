Being a fan of AC series I will not judge this game too much. Yes there are bugs where you stuck in textures, or instead  running to target you for no reason climb on the wall and hold it, but the story is good. But much worse than AC 2 music, story, characters. But combat is more interesting, Connor had couple more moves than Ezio. Ending could be better.6/10
