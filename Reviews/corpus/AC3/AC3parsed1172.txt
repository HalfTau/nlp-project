This is a very expansive game, you can clearly see a lot of work and time went into it.And Id say its a work of art, it has a lot of these very small but significant details which add a lot of believability to the world and the characters, and you wont even see most of it if youre not paying close attention. It has a few bugs as well but nothing game breaking.Overall theres just so much to this game, itd be a disservice not to recommend it.
