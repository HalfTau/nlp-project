It had the potential to be great but it just wasnt. The 16 hours you see on my playtime starts and ends at the main storyline with nothing else, not even the epilogue, because I couldnt bear to go through that dullasslog any further. It shouldve been a great story of an angry revolutionary in someone elses war, instead it was basically a guided tour of the American Revolution with most of the game comprised of tutorial.
