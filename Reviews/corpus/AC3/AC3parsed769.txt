Very enjoyable overall, no other openworld game has ever given us a setting thats as impressive to observe or as full of things to do as this. Connors story has its lulls but it still tells a tale much richer and more compelling than most other games manage, set in a fascinating period of history. Its still up there with the best that the series has achieved, even if it isnt quite the best.
