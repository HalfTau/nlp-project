Ok let me start with the cons1. story great as always2. Graphics a great bump from 23. Introducing guns adds a new twist even though 2 had long range weapon too but still guns are coolerNow for the con, only oneThe controls I use a xbox 360 controller feel really awkward, its hard to explain, but I just cant feel the fast movement I felt when playing 2, I even tried playing 4 which is the sequel, it was was better, so that is a good thing FOR THE SEQUEL.Overall, a recommend for sure, but if you really want to experience the best of the series, assassins creed 2 would be my choice.
