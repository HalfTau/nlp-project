I was appealed by the theme and the beautiful graphics. While theyre still absolutely stunning and gorgeous, I decided to stop playing this game.Utterly disappointing. Very convoluted controls. Its really like playing a console game. One button does many things, convoluted menus, uncontrolled movements, very unnuanced. Complete lack of freedom. The game is extremely linear with no customization for your character, let alone the path youre taking. Very slow plodding along of the storyline. It bores you to death. Combat goes from ridiculously easy hacking away 20 enemies without breaking a sweat to inexplicably difficult with four enemies beating the living daylights out of you without you even knowing what happened.Extremely not recommended.
