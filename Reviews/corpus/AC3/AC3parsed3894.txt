Way too many bugs. The free running and targeting systems are bad and free running seems to bug more than ever. Ive been a fan of the AC series since the beginning, however, I found this one to be a let down considering how often something bugs out/glitches. The story also has many and major plot holes that leave the story to be like a book with dozens of torn out pages. The game is not all bad, but compared to the rest of the series, I thought it fell short. The major thing that kills it for me, though, is the bugs, and with Black Flag being out for some time now, I doubt these issues will be patched.
