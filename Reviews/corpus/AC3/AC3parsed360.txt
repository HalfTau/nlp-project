 Visuals are nothing groundbreaking, but still look wonderful Sound effects  voiceacting are extremely well done of note were the audio effects during shiptoship combat Both the freerunning mechanics  the combat controls felt very tight  refined Main protagonist was hardly spectacular, but was presented well with ample development through his lifetime Hunting mechanics are basically unnecessary to further the storyline, but are a lot of fun in their own right Historical snippets from the little nodsofthehat to fans of history to the background info to major events and players, the game does well to tie in actual historical events to the games plot with a few minor exceptions that felt somewhat forced Cinematic executions  fluid combat more fun than challenging, but its enough to keep the player engaged Fast travel is available  the player will be grateful for it Homestead  eceonomy mechanics much like hunting, these are hardly necessary to further the story, but feel rewarding to partake in  are generally wellimplemented Story was passage nothing spectacular, but wasnt poor enough that it stood out in a negative way Environments are very detailed, particularly the frontier areas Naval combat was more than just a gimmick it was extremely entertaining, very immersive,  one of the unexpected highlights of the overall experience This game requires uPlay This game requires uPlay This game requires uPlay Poor selection of display  customization options The game is not without a few jarring bugs  glitches NPC reactions are often jarringly unrealistic a prime example would be the hohum reactions by civilians who witness violent altercations in broad daylight they often dont seem to react at all  definitely takes one out of the experience a bit Midgame has some definite pacing issues, although on paper its basically understandable given the plot elements at play Repeated issues connecting to Ubisoft servers naturally, connecting to servers is necessary, even for the SP campaign Acquiring new items  weapons is fun  looks great, but you can finish the entire game with only the default weapons  the experience will be precisely the same Multiplayer is completely unpopulated
