This I by far the best assassins creed I have played and I have played almost all. The only things I would change is to make your assassin recruits killable, make you liberated territories and the homestead defendable due to the colonies being war we would think that there would be skirmishes at the very least, and last would be how the price to craft goes up, i know it is there to stop spamming and it goes down, but for a pickpocket who takes what he steals and turns them into commodities, its a little Annoying. Everything else is perfect
