I love this franchise, BUT!!! This game keeps crashing about ten to fifteen minutes into gameplay. Never had this problem until this game, and yes I have played them all up until Assassins Creed 3. I spent too much money on a game I cant even play  let alone enjoy. Needless to say, I wont be purchasing Assassins Creed 4 for pc since this is the second computer I have had this problem with this game now. This computer more than meets the required specs.
