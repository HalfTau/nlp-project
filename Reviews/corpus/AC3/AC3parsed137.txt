This game needs a lot of work when it comes to the timing of the checkpoints. Both earlier and later games did a better job with that. The game is also not very good with sticking to corners, often sticking when you want to stand near them, or awkwardly humping walls you want to hide against to assassinate someone. The key to move a body is on the same key as to loot, and only sometimes seems to show up, and the tutorial also prompts r to reload, which only brings up the weapon select screen and then automatically makes you drop your picked up weapon. Even the assassination doesnt feel too smooth, as it automatically happens around corners rather than being timed with an additional key press, which can cause some irritating moments in gameplay.The story so far is good, though several hours in, and I have not seen anything of this native american assassin the game totes as its main feature.
