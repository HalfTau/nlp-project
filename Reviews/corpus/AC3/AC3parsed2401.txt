otherwise known as WHERE IS CHARLES LEE? takes Desmond to a new frontier with Ratonhnhakton, a Native American Assassin who goes by the name of Connor.has always been my favourite of the whole AC series. Ubisoft took many risks with the game, especially with Connor, who is definitely neither an Altair or Ezio in terms of personality. Many see him as dull and lacking any character, but I saw a man who uses the creed to seek justice and revenge. I found the story nice with an interesting moral behind it.It may be my favourite game but I can see why it gets a lot of hate. The intro/tutorial sequence lasting multiple hours where you play as Haytham Kenway drags on, but is necessary to set the story in motion. Story has never been Ubisofts strong point, however, instead capitalising on the other aspects. Combat is brutal, but stealth is sadly absent, with the missions feeling very linear. Connor prefers the direct approach aside to taking assassinations slowly, which didnt bother me as much. None of the characters appear more than twodimensional.Environments are beautiful and detailed, with new weather patterns and summer/winter seasons. Snow adds a new dimension to the world, making you want to travel by horse or tree. The frontier in iteslf is massive and ready to be explored, but there is barely anything to do. Ubisoft missed many opportunities to really makestand out here. The Hunting mechanic is very basic at hunt, sell, hunt, sell. Crafting feels largely inaccessible, with side mission progression keeping the higher level items locked up.I could find everything thats wrong with, but I would still recommend it. It sets out and dares to be different than the previous games. The firstlook E3 gameplay trailer made the game look a lot cooler than it is.
