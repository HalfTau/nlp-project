After a  first good game and a second excellent one, the third Assassins Creed feels like a waste. The tutorial is badly made, the difficult is inconsistant and nonprogressive impossibly difficult objectives alternate with extremely easy ones, the controls make playing Connor frustrating and managing your home base feels like a shore. As a matter of fact, the whole game feels like a shore, and the two reason why Im playing it is to see the ending of the original trilogy and the naval battles. This is a purchase I regret, even if I made it during sales.
