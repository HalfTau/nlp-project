This one is a disappointment. I really wanted to enjoy the game, but the first half of it just has Haytham or Connor running from cutscene to cutscene to quicktime event back to cutscene.Yahtzees review is very accurate  the series has lost its focus and needs to get back to stabbing people. You can PLAY CHECKERS with people. Why do I want to do that? Naval battles are a ton of fun, but theyre also not related to the plot at all.Connor isnt nearly as engaging as Ezio, and the voice acting is partially to blame for that. The missions seem to encourage one specific mode of attack rather than leaving the player to choose what to do.I really want to like this game, but its just served me disappointment after disappointment. Stick with AC2 or Brotherhood. If you really want this, wait for the price to drop.
