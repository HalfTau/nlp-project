Assasins Creed was the first Assassins Creed I have played in a while. The game was breathtaking right from the start. The storyline is well narrated and combat is actually fun and unique. Missions are always exciting, ranging from huge armies shooting at you, to chasing down important targets. I made a real connection with Connor the assassin because of the tragic events that happened to him at a young age, and the threats the Patriots and Loyalists made against him and his comrades, familiy, and friends. The storyline also has many twists and turns sometimes having a completely different outcome then expected which keeps the game interesting and fun. Sea missons are probably my favorite just because of the fact that you get to command a boat!! All mission are challenging, but not impossible, which I found to like a lot since the game was never too easy but hard enough where I found myself dying because of foolishness and lack of strategy. Some missions are loud gun fights and others are stealthy assassin missions. Whether you are a long time AC player or a begginer to the series, you will find yourself in love with this game.
