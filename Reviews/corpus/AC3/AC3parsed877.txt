I enjoyed previous AC games on console so decided to pick this up since another AC game seemed promising. It has some very bad optimization issues. It did not live up to expectations, or rather I will never know if it did until I either play it on console or find a machine that can run it, and according to what Ive read, a better machine does not necessarily mean it will. For me, it is unplayable. Not recommended.
