9/10 Stunning graphics lots of side missions and things to do outside the story questline the war of independence is very nicely done and you can read additional information about the history if you are interested. As a non american, I basically learnt most about it from this game lol development between main characters, overall story not as good main character as Ezio kind of slow start, first few hours of gameplay can be boring and straightforward storyline in the present  Im not really fan of it. Especially the ending. Missions with Desmond are a nice change though. A lot better than putting you out of Animus in the best just because Desmond needs to take some rest or have some boring conversation like in the previous games
