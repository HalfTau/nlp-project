The thing I hate about this game is it has to be installed with uplay but this game was avery good game not going to lie it was one of the best Assassins Creed games that I ever played. I played Assassins Creed Unity and it wasnt as good as I thought but this is way way better I think ubisoft did amazing with this series. And I got to drag a guy in a haystack 40/10
