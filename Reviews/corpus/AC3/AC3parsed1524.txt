Disclaimer  I have yet to play Assassins Creed IV, and that may or may not become my new favorite when I do because its apparently spectacular.  Time will tell!Update to Disclaimer 1217/2015  Ive played all of Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, and although it was an ok game, this one remains my favorite.  See my review of Black Flag if youre curious why.Despite all the guff that this game gets, its my favorite in the series so far.  The environment and story outweighs the bugs that the game once had most of them are gone/have been fixed.  Dont pass it up just because it was at the bottom of some Assassins Creed ranking list such as this one.  People get way too overcritical about these games and make them look terrible.  Why?  They all have their own charm.  Assassins Creed III is as much an enjoyable experience as the other games, and the Tyranny of George Washington DLC is a blast as well.  I thought it was better than every other Assassins Creed game except for Assassins Creed II, which its on par with.Overall 9/10 if youre fan of the Assassins Creed Series!  If you really want to get critical about an Assassins Creed game, tell Ubisoft to optimize Unity so it actuallyon PCs other than the Large Pixel Collider.
