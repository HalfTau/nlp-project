Let me just say that this game has blown away my pre concieved notations from past AC games.DO NOT listen to the reviews as most are for the consoles and when it launched for them they had tremendous bug related problems that reviewers and gamers BOTH dropped the score for.This game is as impressive a title as there is in EVERY aspect.The Graphics are simply stunning if you have the pc that has some muscle.the sound and music is some of the best in any game in history PERIOD.The gameplay is so good at imes you will be literally thinking you are playing in a movie. It is the seemlessly between the cutscens and the flow of you either while out exploring the beautiful 18th century countryside or jumping from tree to tree to set up that OOO so impressive assassination or in the cobblestone city  of Boston oor many others once you open up the world.I honestly can say that the single player campaign is the most fun story I haveplayed in over a decade! I am more of a multiplayer guy so I am quite shocked at how trhis game has taken me away one the story alone.Ubisoft had truly outdone themselves with this gem.Aside from a few missions feeling a bit stale or slow paced it is truly something that every gamer should own. Do yourself a favor and play past the 3rd hour and then the game will suck you in and take you down a trip to when the U.S. was just a bunch of colonies.the history you will learn is pretty neat too if you have forgotten alot of it since your school days
