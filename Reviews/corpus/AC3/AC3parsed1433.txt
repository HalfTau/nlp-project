I bought this game a year or two ago, and I had only played bits and pieces of Assassins Creen 2 and Brotherhood, and I had enjoyed the game enough to buy it. After buying this game, I did not regret it. At first, I was a little upset about the 60fps lock on the game, but after upgrading my graphics card from a GTX 285 Yes they still exist to a GTX 960, It made the game all the better, the graphics were not too demanding on the 285 on minmedium settings, and it ran fine, but after playing the game with my 960, the game looks beautiful. Not only the graphics of the game, but the overall story, as well as the gameplay make this game appealing to anyone looking to get into the Assassins Creed Games. The only thing I seem to have problems with, are sometimes the missions are a bit hard, but not unbearable. This is a good thing, because a game without a challenge is not a good thing. Anyways, the game was very fun to play and supports controller almost perfectly, but I still prefer mouse and keyboard. I would rate this game very positively and would highly reccomend playing this. It is an experience you wont regret.9/10
