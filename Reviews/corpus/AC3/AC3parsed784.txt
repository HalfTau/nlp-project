I love the entire Assassins creed franchise and ive played and beaten almost every game in the series minus Unity. For me AC3 is probably my favorite AC game since during the time this came out I was learning about the American Revolution in school and it just fit well, ive beaten the game 3 time and i decided to go and play the game on PC but that was a bad mistake the port is poorly poorly optimized the game will run at a locked 60 then you get anywhere near populated areas like boston your fps just dies it honestly became unplayable for me. Beside the shawty PC port Assassins creed 3 is a good game in the series and if you have a god teir PC itll probably run fine but for the lower end gamer wouldnt recommend the pc version just get the console version or something, unless your fine with some not so good performence
