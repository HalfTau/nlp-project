Assassins Creed III is basically more of the same in a good way if youve enjoyed the preceding titles. The story improves from the Ezio triology, by really connecting the Templars to what is going on the present with Desmond whereas with Ezio it was just the Borgia being clowns instead of fighting Templars. The unrefined features such as crafting and assassin recruits do detract from the experience a little bit, but not enough to make me want to stop playing. Basically if you have any connection to America youll appreciate the story. If not, still give it a shot, but be warned that it doesnt quite live up to the quality of Brotherhood or AC2.
