For starters, I love this game. Years ago when it originally came out, I fell in love with it instantly. It was a childhood dream come true.At the time, I wasnt allowed to get it, but I did a few years later and it was a blast.During this recent sale I decided to purchase it, to play it again properly and just enjoy it as I would normally.Well, let me tell you. If youre playing this on PC, you need a controller.Im serious.The devs even said when this was being developed that PC players would require a controller to play it properly.Let me give you a few examples of why you need a controller.1. Parkour is ridiculous with a keyboard/mouse setup. You cant climb trees and you cant hang onto anything really. Not sure why, but apparently you need a controller to do this.2. Combat is a bit wonky, moving the camera around while fighting can be very slow.3. The layout and controls of the game in general on keyboard and mouse just leave much to be desired.Also, on PC, there seems to be a pretty popular issue, where the screen freaks out and shakes uncontrollaby whenever you do anything in the game. Im not sure if a controller itself fixes it, but if you make Uplay launch in offline mode while playing it, it works perfectly.TLDRI adore this game, its so much fun, and it makes me sad that I cannot replay it unless I buy a controller. I dont want to purchase a controller for a single game to never use it again.If youre not willing to buy a controller as I am, then dont get this game on PC.For this reason, I cannot reccomend it.. atleast with PC controls.Either way, still an amazing game, if you can play it right.Thanks for reading! UPDATE You can climb trees and free run just fine without a controller. Haytham cannot free run nor climb trees. Get this game, definitely!
