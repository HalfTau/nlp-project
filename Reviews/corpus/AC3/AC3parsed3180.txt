The only one in the series that is horrible. I am not really a fan of of Black Flag, but it was playable just to casual for me. HUGE boring maps, boring lead character, boring everything. They should have called this run forever to the next destination creed. The game loses all the charm of previous entries. The combat is a joke all QTE, and there is regenerating health which is also a joke. Play them all, except this one.
