Well in the end the story is whats important here, however the game was lacking in all previous features. I would go as far as saying this was a step back from AC 2, was gutted with the game as a whole and would only recommend it as far as getting through the story goes.The next one will be even worse considering the deveolpment time giving to it. To me this should have been the final one. The multiplayer is going to kill this game in every way possible.AC was never about the multiplayer it sold all the copies prior to multiplayer coming into play based on the story, this would have continued to be the case untill they decided ACCOD
