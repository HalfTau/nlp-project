ive mixed feelings about this game. although i played the hell out of it, most of the times i saw myself struggling. sometimes because of myself, but overall the controls are a bit broken. the story for me is unimpressive, but the length and the amount of things to collect, makes the games worth your money but the rewards you get for collecting them are worthless.Its the weakest in the series no doubt, if youre into to the series i recommend just plot wise. but if youre a newcommer try the first ones first.
