The graphics was quite beautiful, The storyline i felt was amazing, I agree the characters lacked that kind of.. connection? in terms of connecting to the player but never the less the game itself made up for it vastly, I played this game for a total of 25 hours and that was without finishing over half of the side missions and stuff like that,The Naval Combat is awesome and very smooth, The game is smooth, This game is a must buy on or off sale, You wont be dissapointed even if youre a creed fanboy who insists Character  Game.
