AC3 is one MASSIVE grind.The grind is interspersed with many cutscenes and idiotic, freedomrobbing extra requirements akin to steal from this man while undetected on horseback and standing on one leg, that appear right before or even AFTER youve taken action Kill this guy... oh but dont kill him yet!  DESYNCHRONIZED.The open world is nearendless, mindless and pointless busybodying for scant if any rewards, whereas the main story is basically on rails almost as onrails as Max Payne 3.Take what you love about Assassins Creed and...pretty much either throw it out the window or amp it up to where its too much.You can hardly ever upgrade your character in any functional, noncosmetic way or even buy much in the way of improved weapons and no armor anywhere, stealth is largely impossible because of so many guards, but you can usually bruteforce the combat anyway.  And not that Im a fan of crafting, but you cant craft until nearly the end of the game or ...geez I hope Im near the end of the game, in Sequence 9 and what you can make is pretty much only useful for getting more money...so ironically its worthless at that point.   And youre telling me a Native American needs some white dude, and a Level 3 white dude at that, just to make arrows?While cutscenes in AC2 were great for moving the story and introducing characters, in AC3 youll start skipping them because a you dont care and b you just want control of your  character back!  Alternatively, you can maximize your efficiency by scheduling your many Googlechecks of How do I ? during the cutscenes.Thats right, it is often very unclear how to do what you want e.g., to send assassins on missions, you hold down T and then click the mouse but dont just click anywhere near Contracts, you have to click right on the mouse icon!.Much of what went wrong in AC3, they fixed in AC4Black Flag.So, if you dont mind gaps in your antiAbstergo narrative, skip from AC2 to 4.  Brotherhood was still pretty good, Revelations not so much.For those who will point out these are optional requirments yeah, a giant red X that shows up repeatedly throughout the mission, and that robs you from getting any reward, is optional?Re. dont care One reviewer complained of the love story between Norris and hunterlady that you basically have to do everything for him short of guiding hisinto her .
