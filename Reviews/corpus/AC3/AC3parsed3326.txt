I think that is defintely my favorite Assassins Creed game of the series. It introduced free running that seemed that logical from the start. Being able to parkour through trees just brought a reinvigorating organic feel to the series. As may will say because of this and the choice of area in the world, it leaves some areas with nothing to jump onto. This is true and a drawback, but does not take away in my mind how wonderful of a game this is. The plot line is soild and advances the story line the flaw in revelations and brotherhood and is set in the american revolution that although is not fair of a comment but is indeed one of my all time favorite time periods. Worth it, especially now that it is down in price
