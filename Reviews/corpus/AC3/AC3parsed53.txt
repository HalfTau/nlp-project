Good Game, but its nothing close to the storys the game had in the past AC Games. Its more buggy more glitchy then ever. The Season Pass Activation System is horrible for Steam Users you have to start MP to activate ingame keys....because in SP Mode you cant. And the The Tyranny of King Washington DLC is story based so much better and funnier to play then the base game. But still after all a very good game and nice graphical trip to the 18th century even in 2018.
