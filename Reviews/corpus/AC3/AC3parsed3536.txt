Its hard to recommend a treeclimbing simulator with such a boring set of characters. You may be thinking Why does my tree climbing simulator even need a story, and truthfully, it doesnt. So, Im not even sure why they bothered recording all this voicework for this game, because youre just gonna keep skipping it to get to the next tree you gonna climb. Save your money, and buy a better outdoor simulator like DayZ or Chivalry.
