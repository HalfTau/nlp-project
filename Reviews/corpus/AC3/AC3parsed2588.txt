As a long time fan of the series ever since first playing as Altair, I had high hopes for AC III. Having just finished Ezios amazing story that spanned three games as well as a bit more info about Altair from Revelations, I felt the series hit a high note. AC III, however, seems to be the beginning of a decline. Everything about the game exuded grand scope, pure awesome  it just didnt hit those notes. The ending was a bit of a shocker too. Everything about the game just seemed to meet its potential halfway. However, the naval combat mechanics and the tree roam were interestingly done.All in all, I would recommend this game as it is indeed a valuable sector of the story arc of the original Minerva series.7/10
