worst interface ever. Looks like a bad console port. Just to give one word as example Crafting menue.Performance is good. NVidia DSR also works which is good. But too many rage quit / annoying parts inside the game. Not enough quick travel points, too many gap fillers. It just annoys me too often.Didnt worked at the beginning as well. I had to modify the permissions of this stupid Uplay directory. Go to hell Uplay.Just to annoying to give a thumb up. Maybe 6/10Just a sideinfo. I just stepped into this bug.
