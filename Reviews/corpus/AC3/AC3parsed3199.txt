This game is very well done. The acting is pretty good, the graphics usually look very good with a few poorly rendered areas that do occasionally manifest themselves. The setting is very interesting for history buffs, or more likely, the individuals such as myself who take a casual interest in history.My only complaint is play style which is largely effortless. Whilst running the protagonist jumps and scales and climbs over all sorts of objects automatically. Combat is largely the same and it makes the player feel fairly uninvolved in whats happening.Still, I think this game is a worthy title. The main downside is that you will be using the uplay system which always makes me a bit irritated since I am already buying into the steam DRM.
