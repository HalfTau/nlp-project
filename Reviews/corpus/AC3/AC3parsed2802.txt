This is an awesome game! I have played this on PS3 long time ago but now I cant play it on PS3 anymore, so I bought this from Steam. Well back then I did not know anything from the storyline, so I was confused about the story and the strange missions, mainly due that I was some kind of CoDkid which i remember with laughter now. I enjoy this part as much as the other parts from the AC series, if not even more! The story was exciting and kept me interested. I have almost played the side missions. They are not that bad, not that good, something to spend free time for. I do recommend this game for those who like stealth and actions mixed. Some say the controls are bad, and yes, they were. Assassination from V, what the? I changed them a bit, and now theyre almost the same as in Brotherhood or ACII. I play this with Win8 HP laptop still. As in the previous ACs, the fps is a bit slow and laggy, but that doesnt bother me much, as I have familiarized with that. No doubt, Ill give 10/10!Still one thing that is strange, is hunting. The animals are stupid as heck, and spot you when you are 10 meters away. I do have experience of hunting mainly birds, and with run and catch tactic the hunting would never success in real life. Still, it is fun and EASY way to get money.
