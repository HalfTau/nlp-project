Launched game... Like if the American Revolution was at 20 fps... Same old, same old, except with a protagonist whos more boring than a brick who likes The View ... and is an accountant.Same stabbing fun, however be warned that Connor has a serious affection for walls and buildings as he tends to molest them if you get too close.Also, its a bit easy. Probably the worst of the series, havent played Unity or Rogue yet, so might change in my opinion. Its a shame since its set in my favorite period of history. Great edutainment for the kids...7/10 Would play again
