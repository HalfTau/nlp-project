Damn thing wont stay working, crashes at random but mostly after cut scene, anyone know my problem, shoot me a line if u know a fix... so i recommend if u r good at fixing games, but im really writing for help.Edit forced vsync in my nvidia control panel seemed to work w/ less crashing and no more flickering objects, wish me luck...
