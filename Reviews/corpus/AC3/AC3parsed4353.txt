A lot of people complained that they didnt like Connor. Personally, I feel like hes more intersting than Altair, but he comes off as a weaker character than Ezio. Both are very driven by revenge, but Connor does a lot more of stumbling in the dark than Ezio does. Gameplaywise its better than Ezios triology and I find the Native American angle than Connor has to be really interesting. But can you lower the cost a bit, Ubisoft?
