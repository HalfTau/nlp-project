8/10  This also happens to be my least favorite Assassins Creed game.Heres why Amazing opening story that makes it the best opening for any Assassins Creed game and then goes mild midgame and the ending is so boring and lame, even Destinys ending is better than that If it had any......Rest of the game is really good, AC3 doesnt milk the series, its truly a whole different gameplay system than the previous title in the series. Main character is not very exciting either, has a very robotic feel to him, no personality, only driven by revenge and vengeance. Should have been called AC3 Revengeance, suits it better than MGRR.Other than that, its a pretty good game, worth your money..... on sale ofcourse! DBut dont bother buying it just for the multiplayer, few peope play it, but its dead, all thanks to Uplay and its horendous servers.
