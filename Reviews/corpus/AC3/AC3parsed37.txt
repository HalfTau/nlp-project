Ubisoft has a terrible problem with their website and game ownership credentials.I purchased this game and Far Cry 3 from Steam, and I can no longer log in and play either game.You have to log into their UPlay service before it will let you launch the game, and if for some reason you can not do that, you cant play. Doesnt matter that you paid a fair price for their products, you can be deprived of access to the software.
