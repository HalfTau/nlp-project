The gmae is pretty good but I HATE dealing with uplay.Their customer support is complete rubbish. It took over a year to resolve an issue I had with them. Also, having to have  a seperate uplay account apart from my steam account is absurd. I am not sure if I would bother buying another one of their games after this.
