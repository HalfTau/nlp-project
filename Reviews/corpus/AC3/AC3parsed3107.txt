I Bought the DLC from summer sales and I was both surprised and disappointed how quickly the first episode went. It lasted only couple hours when I played the main quest and about 50 sidequests. Though it was nice to return to AC3 world one more time but its totally different now no shops or own home atleast in first episode which changes the gameplay quite much. Im going to check 2 other episodes naturally next and HOPEFULLY those will add much more to this story.I only recommend these DLCs to true fans who want to see Connor one more time.
