A good game, but not brilliant. Certainly a good game, but it just doesnt feel like an AC game. Rather than organically planning how and when to strike your target like a shadow in a candle lit room, you find yourself either in a linear chase sequence, or get caught in an all out brawl. The main character, Connor, had all the character of a cardboard cut out ofCheney, and the characterisation of the templars was pretty poor as well. One minute youre playing as a badbritish bloke who goes about saving slaves, and the next minute you see him kerb stomping puppies like a british super Hitler. It says that the portrayl of the British and American forces are meant to be balanced, but I dont buy it. The easiest way to figure out who your next stabbing target is is to ask them if they watch eastenders. The combat does the job and is smoother than the combat in 2, but I eel its a stepdown from brotherhood, which came closest to perfect combat controls. Despite these flaws, I would recommend it. It has a lot to do, such as the amazing sailing missions which essentially make up the 4th game... Actually, you know what. Just go buy that. This whole review feels a little bit redundant.
