Not the best AC game probably my least favourite but its not a bad game. The story does take a very long time to get started which probably puts a lot of people of, but once you are a few hours in its quite enjoyable. The main story doesnt really start until 5 hours in and you spend the beginning of the game playing as a different character from the main protagonist which might confuse some people. The main protagonist of the game Connor is pretty boring and the American setting is pretty weak by AC standards, but this was also the first AC game to run in a new version of the anvil engine, which brought a lot of new features to the franchise like climbing trees and rocks, better and smoother climbing and better stealth, and future games would not be so good if this game didnt exist. This game has its flaws, but Ubisoft did actually try and innovate this time after 4 previous games with copy and pasted gameplay, animations and sound effects. The modern day in this game is one of the best in the franchise and is a fairly good conclusion to the original story they were trying to tell with Desmond, before ubisoft had to screw it up in later games.To summarise, its not the best game or AC game, but its still fun if you can get past the boring start. If you are new to the franchise then I wouldnt use this game as a starting point but if you are a fan then I would recommend it.
