The game could be a lot better, but other than some minor graphics glitches, I have experienced no problems with the game. The gameplay is very fun I espesially loved taking over the British forts and the sailing sections of the game, the controls are a HUGE improvement over the previous games, but my biggest issue is with the story. Conners personal story, what with SPOILER his mother dying at a young age, him having to kill his best freind and his father, and his mentor dying, that was all fine. But the overall story is full of too many plot twists randomness to make sense o it all. So, in conclusion, the gameplay is fun, but the story sucks.
