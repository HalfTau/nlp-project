The most unstable game I have ever played. Constantly crashes on certain missions, or on the menu. The crashes/freezes keep you from actually enjoying the game. Whats even worse is Ubisofts official response was our team is aware of this issue yet it still remains. To me thats them telling the PC community two words, and they arent happy birthday.
