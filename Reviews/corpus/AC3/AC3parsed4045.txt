I really want to like this game. I was a fan of the series and everything in it is fun.The only problem is its BROKEN.This game is definitely not finished. Im playing a year after release, and still Its only mostly finished. Several parts of the game are still obviously malfunctioning. Though there are workarounds, and it is possible to complete the game, there are things that definitely dont function like you think they would or should. I can tolerate games being a little rough on the edges, but this game needs a sandblasting. If this game were working 100 Im sure I would love it except it isnt. Given that over a year has passed, I doubt it ever will be finished.With Revelations being a bit lackluster, and 3 simply not finished, I am definitely not in a rush to play 4.
