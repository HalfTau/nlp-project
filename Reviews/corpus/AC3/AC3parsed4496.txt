So... i personally love american history so i found this game really interesting and fun despite some bugs and the ending. Without spoiling, the ending did nothing butme off.Ubisoft  off. You did it wrong.The story starts off slow and then almost seems to get rushed to an abrupt end.. It reminded me of watching a comedian who starts a long joke and then rushes the punchline because his time slot was about to end. Which kind of ruins the build up and impact of the punchline.The lore was confusing and odd, and left me wanting to punch a story writer for getting everything wrong.The way it is written they almost have you thinking the templars are the better tribe, while the assasins are kind of depicted as a irrational crazy woman who cant be reasoned with. I swear.. its like they fired they guy who wrote the first half of the story, and then hired someone who smoked wayyyy too much pot to finish it up in 3 hours.Anyways... uninstall the game once you get to sequence 12 and you will have a better opinion of this game.Also... Some tips to remember if you start playing this gameYou can change weapon types during the naval missions by pressing R wish I knew that earlierIts way too easy to make money, so dont bother saving it... Spend it all you want.Ignore the feathers... you can spend a decade collecting them, and all you get is a damn outfit.Almanac pages yeild craftable items to decorate your house with... better than feathers, but also stupid.Purchasable weapons upgrades stop becomming available very early in the game, you need to work on your homestead to get better ones.
