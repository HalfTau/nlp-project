Main Game music is excellent graphics are alright interesting side missions to upgrade your settlement hunting can be addictive, but I dont like QTE combat is satisfying and fluid mostly, but can turn to unforgiving and infuriating despite all the hype, I didnt like sea battles that much forced camera angles can be a pain in the a... some optional objectives are almost impossible to complete, saving your progress right after you fail themTyranny of King Washington the new abilities are refreshing and cool for a while, but then the game forces you to use them until you get sick of them side missions not worth the time and effort boring and annoying boss fight at the endVerdict I recommend buying the game and the DLCs as well, BUT only when they are on heavy sale. 7/10
