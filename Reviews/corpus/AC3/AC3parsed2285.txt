You continue to play Desmond, who is playing a new Father and Son within the lineage that came to the USA. One is templar and one is an Assassin. So at least you arent playing a goodie two shoes the whole time, but for whatever reason this game is more about the boats. You will play the game in order to unlock those segments of gameplay.Instead of a commerce empire in each city, in this you build a cult around your homestead and those who reside there believe in you somewhat fanatically. Particularly when you will kill a dozen or so men in order regain the blueprints for the folding chair. I mean, wow, its the folding chair.Well, I guess these things need to be done if you are to save the earth from the Sun.There is DLC here where you see a Crazed King Washington, but it was too buggy to complete so I gave up.Overall Not as good as Brotherhood, the overhaul in combat is welcome, but the fact that whenever I want to run fast I have to put up with the fact that I will want to climb on crates and fences instead of skirt around the sides of them still has not been solved Hint Ubisoft If Im pushing all the way forward make me run fast, when I hit the right trigger, change the animation to more of a hunch, leave the speed the same.  This will give me the ability to gladly opt into the insanity of freerunning over milk crates etc when I choose to.. The ship sequences are awesome.TIP During the finale, throw some food into the oven or microwave, because after you chase the final boss the rest of it is pretty much a cutscene.. and believe it or not a nonskippable set of credits.. Which you need to hang around for because there is an epilogue which then leads you to a map mini game that I think only two people understand I sure hope that does not show up in the next game.
