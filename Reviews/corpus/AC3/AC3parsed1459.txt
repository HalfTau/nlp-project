Assassins Creed III is very enjoyable overall, but its not consistently brilliant. Not everything about the game gels together convincingly and the missions unnecessary prescriptiveness sometimes undermines the sense of freedom that the rest of the game works so hard to create. But it achieves so much that you cant help but respect it. Connors story has its lulls but it still tells a tale much richer and more compelling than most other games manage, set in a fascinating period of history. Assassins Creed III has got all the same triumphs and flaws it isnt as huge an improvement upon its predecessors achievements as many players will be hoping for, but its still up there with the best that the series has achieved. Even if it isnt quite the best.
