Assuming you are a fan from the previous games and you really like the plot history from Assassins Creed AND youre trying to finish ALL the sequel, then you should  get this one. Its not a bad game but its pretty far for being great. It have a terrible non intuitive gameplay. If you are aiming for full synch, good luck because you will fail a lot of times. Probably will search on internet for what the hell you need to do. The game itself doesnt explain much of almost anything. You dont understand very well how economic works. Until chapter 9 I didnt even know that I was able to get new weapons from vendors because I was never told.The ambientation, graphics, soundtrack, sound effects, history, killing animations, they are all good. Dude, you can control your own ship and battle against enemies, you can climb trees and hunt animals. There are a lot of amazing things actually I think I just told all the amazing things about the game. They improved a little the characters movimentation, it makes you puke a little less comparing with the previous ACs. But its still lame. They can do better. Naughtydog can, for sure.The protagonist is not awesome like Ezio or Altair, but hes doing his job ok.There is a great thing on the game. You really play with Desmond. You do some missions with him. One of them its a terrible adaptation from Brazil, I might add. Im from Brazil and... WHAT THA  IS THAT? Is that hard to put brazilians to do the voice acting? On the game they speak like North Americans studying portuguese for 3 months. Still... I was happy for being able to play with him Desmond. Am I the only person who likes him?7.5/10
