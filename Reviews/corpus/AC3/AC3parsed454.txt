I love this game it was not well accepted in the fanbase but i was able to put over 200 hours in this game and i enjoyed each one. The story is the weakest part in the game in my opinion the main character is bland and boring and the whole thing is just unoriginal, that is why i spent almost all of my time free roaming looking for secrets and just dicking around having fun. The combat system is what you would expect in an assassins creed game nothing mind blowing but it works, the game also has a bit of character custmization you can change weapons outfits and such but nothing special. The map is big not the biggest but it has alot to do plenty of cities and forests for you to explore. So when it comes to it get this game sure it aint the best assassins creed game but i enjoy it a lot of stuff to do and hours of fun to be had.
