The PC version of Assassins Creed III definitely has its problems. It is buggy and unoptimised, and even worse is the forced inclusion of Uplay.However the game itself is pretty enjoyable. The sea sections are the best part and you can see why Ubisoft focused on them more in the sequel, Black Flag. The era is well realised and can be quite immersive, and the new tree running abilities feel so core to the gameplay that its a wonder we didnt have them in previous entries. The combat is fairly easy, press X to stab redcoats, but the music is good, which really adds to the setting. It works well as historical tourism. Also, the side missions are pretty essential if you want a full experience, as there is a major spoiler at the end of one of them.Though worth noting is the protagonist, Connor, has less personality than a potato.
