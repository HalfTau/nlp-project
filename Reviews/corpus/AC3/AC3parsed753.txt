Buyer BewareThis is a information for those interested in the DRM functionality of this game. I have nearly 1200 games in my library and recently went on vacation to an offline location where I was unpleasantly surprised with the mandatory online requirements of a few games that had no reason or labeling other than a one time key activation.This is not A debate post I will not go back and forth on the quality of the game as the quality is meaningless if the game fails to function under its own requirements, or the fairness of this issue. It is clearly unfair as it is not presented to the buyer and if it was it would still be unfair as much as a car not being able to crank without being connected to its manufacturer. Trust me its a selling point on an outdated broken concept. DRM of any kind is a virus, those that cripple a purchased product is theft.OK rant out of the way!This Is about the simplicity of the FACT GTAV does not work offline  indefinitely yet GTA IV does. Or that DOOM as an ID/ bethesda product does not function offline indefinitely, but their other products like wolfenstien does. MGSVTPP does not while MGSGZ and revengeance does, and finally FFVII does not yet FFIX and the others do.Again this is NOT A DEBATE about the semantics of it all, but a FACT of information that needs to be given to any potential buyer of these products. YOU WILL HAVE TO ALWAYS HAVE A CONNECTION. They will function offline for a period of time. As with any software that is purchased I think the FTC should force not only the type OF DRM like Denuvo to be labeled but the function of said DRM and what information it collects, requirements and the system resources it uses.Fair trade laws do in fact apply to the video game world, especially for proper labeling of products, and functionality, as well as fair contractual agreements are still a legal obligation.
