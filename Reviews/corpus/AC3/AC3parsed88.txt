I was disappointed with this game. I started with Black Flag a year ago and have since been working my way through the game series from the beginning. Revelations was an amazing game, so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, I cant even force myself to play this game anymore. There is an insane amount of walking around trying to get from place to place. It just sluggishly creeps along and I wont be finishing this one. If you want the storyline youtube is a good place for that.
