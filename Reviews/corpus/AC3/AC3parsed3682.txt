There all a lot of cutscenes. It sorta brings you out of the game and it feels like a movie, but overall its not that big of an issue.Its nice. More nice than AC2 or Skyrim or fallout. This game will make love to your eyes.The soundtrack is amazing too. The ship battles. Yeah, its a learning curve, but its not terrible. It becomes really fun lateron.Climbing on trees and freerunning are smooth like butter. It feels fresh and natural. Connor is a very easily controlled character and youll just have fun running around in the forest, Connor is a really interesting character. Hunting is fun.Theres no better feeling than stealth killing a bear from a tree. I was worried at first about the setting but its really turned out to be a great experience. The graphics first off are great. Landscape and buildings are good enough to interest you in walking around old america to see the original cities.This game is an amazing new iteration for the Assassins Creed saga, a worthy successor to its awesome predecessors, and an epic tale where you can enjoy the incredible amount of work that Ubisoft surely invested on it.Great game
