The only reason I would recommend this game is for the sake of knowing what happens in the story, but honestly you could just read the synopsis on the Assassins Creed wikia. Trust me, its more interesting than this game. I really wanted to love it, because I love Native Americans, their history, and their culture. But the story and characters all fell flat for me. I never actually completed this game because it was just too painful to force myself to play it.Gameplay wise, it DEFINITELY introduces some great gameplay mechanics I enjoyed like the ropedart, tree climbing, etc. But it wasnt enough to keep me interested, unfortunately.
