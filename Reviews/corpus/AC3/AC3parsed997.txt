This was the first Assassins Creed game I ever played, and I honestly feel it is one of the best in the series. Connors backstory is very compelling and you cant help but relate to him. It is also interesting to play as Haytham as sort of a prolouge. I highly reccomend this game to anyone looking to start playing the series.
