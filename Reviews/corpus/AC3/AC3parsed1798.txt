I never did like games that absolutely hated you using stealth to complete a mission yet had missions that failed you if you didnt stealth them. Assassins Creed not content to start off with bad footing then decided to to castrate itself at the same time by making sure that it gave me no indication that the missions I was completing were in fact stealth only missions until they promptly failed me for trying to complete one in a way I deemed logical.I think Id be able to grin and bear it if it wasnt for the fact the entire time Im playing, captain render glitches couldnt let go of his favourite humping stick long enough to do anything other than sound like a ponce.
