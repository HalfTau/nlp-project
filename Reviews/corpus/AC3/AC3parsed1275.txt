7/10I had a lot of fun in this game. So much, in fact, that it was hard to put down until I beat it. The storyline is good, the characters likeable, and the interactions between the protagonist and antagonist humorous.I dont like the whole cliche storyline about saving the world from an exploding sun. The cutscenes were way too long and boring. Connor was underdeveloped, and you spend a while at the beginning playing as someone else.To be honest, the parkour and assassinations were glitchy, and it was hard to get Connor to do what you want. Also, you could fight your way out of most goofs, so sneaking wasnt an emphasis.So although it wasnt the best executed, it was still good. Freerunning is always fun, and getting to work with Ben Franklin and other historical figures is a blast. They do a great job of weaving fact with fiction.The graphics are amazing, and the tried and true assassin gameplay is fun, although no Ubisoft, I will still not waste time hunting.I especially liked the chances to play as Desmond, because the lack of HUD made it much more of a challenge.So if youre a hardcore fan of the series, get over the fact that it deviates from the second game and enjoy it for what it is the video game version of the Avengers. Not much depth, a whole lot of fun.
