I will list a lot of bad things with Assassin Creed 3 now, but it is still a relatively good game, especially if you like the series. They added the ability to climb the trees and run around in nature finally, plus the naval fights are the best thing the game can offer. Yet, it has one of the least sympathetic protagonists in games, arrogant, selfcentered , main villain is far better and I wanted to play as him all the time, not just few chapters. It gets boring in some parts and the first 7 hours of game are basically tutorial, where you go on rails doing exactly what game tells you without any freedom. Trading is totally useless, I never bought any new stuff and I finished the game without problem.
