This is another assassins creed game, and to be honest it is good but the series is starting to become a bit of a money milking thing. the game as an assassins creed game is good and gets away from the italian thing and the ship combat is cool however extreamly repetitive as it is all pretty much the same. This game is what should in my opinion have ended the series, maybe black flag should have been added as an extra just for the pirate things but that should have ended the series, sadly that is not to be. anyways, this game is a good game and even though i am not really an assassins creed guy i reccomend the game.
