ProsInteresting storyInteresting timelineHell even the DLC wasnt that badGraphically quite pleasingHuntingTown simulatorConsSame bugs, same fails trying to run away and then trying to run up the wall when you dont want it.Its so much easier to just kill troops than to escape, there just seems to always be someone ready waiting.Certain items are just like yeah just accept this is canon now, dont question itThe time skips feels a little too long, and a little too broad. Ugh.Despite this, it isnt a terrible game, and I enjoyed it at least.
