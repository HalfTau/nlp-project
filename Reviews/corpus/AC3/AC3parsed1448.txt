At the time of writing this, Im still playing it, but I thought Id share my experience...Story is pretty goodConnor is a very likable guy this is important to meCombat is pretty niceAreas are prettyGraphics are goodExploring the forest is a nice idea I like desmonds side missions Lot of effort went into finishing animations I like connors general unbias towards the two sides in the story Connors dad and his relationship with Connor is interestingIve found bugs... most have caused me to randomly dieAccountancy book doesnt make sense, and isnt explainedWeopon system doesnt make sense... I go to upgrade, apparently I own it, for some reason its at the house, Ive gotta go there to change it... often new items arent better, so theres no point anywayHomestead missions are very boring and are easily skipped if you dont go to a certain place boston usually and you get behindTheres an awfully designed assassin mission tab I didnt know about until sequence 10Combat isnt difficult.. but theres some mobs I cant counter and they usually end up wrecking me.. Im obviously missing somethingBIG GRIPE Too many small things. Pages, liberation missions, chests, feathers, delivery missions only recently found out what they do, courier missions, ships I dont do these, peg legs.... They add to the game, but I dont see any benefit to doing themHunting doenst really make sense and do anything for youMoney/finance system doenst make sense... sat on 60k and its useless to meGuards start combat with me randomly when im incognito, dont know why Cant escape combat as easy as Id likeClimbing is repetative same trees, buildings No general sense of character development/progression no new stuff/mechanics/tools yet Underground system isnt well explained General repetitionStop trying to make multiplayer happen, it just wontI bought the deluxe game for 5 or something in a sale, and it was well spent. I doubt Ill play the DLC as its most probably super repetative. In fact for me, unlike how Ive played the previous games, I doubt Ill do much more than the main story, as its so repetative and there doesnt seem to be any benefit to the player.
