100 Completion146 hours of playtime Boston, New York and the Frontier are all fantasticly rendered. The world is very fun to explore. Its enjoyable to capture forts. Building your Homestead and learning about your citizens is the best part of the game. Very well written. Most sidequests are enjoyable. Story is just on the verge of interesting. Fun naval missions until they get dreadful. Combat is... well, regular meh combat. Bow was a nice addition, as well as the tomahawk. Freerunning is ok. Least likeable protagonist out of any AC game. So bad it makes you want to root for the Templars. The repeditive nature of the game slowly drives you insane. Dont 100 this one. Dont make the same mistakes I did. As with all Assassins Creed games, there is zero replayability. The resource missions with ships and carriages should be turned into a CIA torture method. God awful DLC. Adds a bad sword and a quicktime event.55/100, worth maybe 14.99 on sale.
