Im a huge fan of Assasins Creed, I loved the way the game builds on the past and present. However, this game is where it starts to go downhill for the series. I never really get to like the protagonist and I never like the setting. I did spend a lot of time in the game since Im pretty much a completeist. If you like the series, sure, play the game. If you are looking for a good game or to start the series, I recommend Assassins Creed II instead.
