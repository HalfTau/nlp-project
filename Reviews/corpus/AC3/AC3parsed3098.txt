After spending 80 hours with this game, I would say that yes, this is a great game.  There are a lot of conflicting opinions surrounding it, but I feel diving into both the side missions and the main story equally balances things out and presents Conor the hero as a more complete person and a complex and interesting one at that.My suggestion for getting the most out of your experience is to take on the homestead side missions whenever they become available.  Not only are they needed for some of the upgades, they help flesh out Conor and provide more context for things going on back in Davenport while youre off tracking down Haythem.  They also seem key to keeping Conor seem like a total jackass amidst his heroics.
