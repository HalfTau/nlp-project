Ubi really put some interesting ideas into this installment. I wouldnt say this is a big step up from the Ezio trilogy but definitely Ubi is putting some work into this one. The hunting system is fun but could be a little annoying if you dont like grinding. The ship trading system is a little bit lacking but it connects with the next installment.Overall I would recomment this game.
