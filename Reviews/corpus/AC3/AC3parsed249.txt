Assassins Creed III is an okay game, like every other Assassins Creed titles, its nothing great but nothing bad either, it has a great story, thats it.So whats bad about it?Ill get directly to the point, Uplay and Ubisoft.Uplay is one of the worse crap I ever encountered in my life, seriously, what the heck is this !?The reflection of incompetence and stupidness.Apart all of its problems, the one I found the most annoying is that I recently lost my saves, Uplay cloud? What cloud? Does that crap even works?Oh well, I have backed up my saves, Ill use them and.... Damaged saved games? Oh well, after 50 hours?...Seriously, I hope that Ubisoft will go bankrupt soon and that there will be something done about that crappy DRM.And honestly, you guys at Ubisoft should check up your brain cause it is actually your brain that is damaged.8/10 for the story.7.5/10 for the game itself.10/10 for both Uplay and Ubisoft.Edit They say that they fixed it but it still havent changed anything, it is just a proof of how incomptent they are, honestly, you should just all stop buying Ubisoft games, they dont derserve your money at all.
