Sigh.I enjoyed Assassins Creed 1, despite the repetition. I loved Assassins Creed 2, having fixed almost all its predecessors problems. Brotherhood was an excellent refinement of AssCreed 2, with the ability to call in your students to cause distractions, the almostasgoodasBatman killspree combat improvements, and excellent characterisation. Hell, I even liked Revelations for tying up some of the stranger plot, even if it did nothing significantly new.Then along came this sorry waste of time. I dont know just how Ubisoft managed to make a massive revolution so soulless and boring, buy by gum they found a way. Having the main character being a really dull, unlikeable bellend didnt help. He was worse than Altair for crying out loud.Uninspired combat that totally broke the nearperfect flow of Brotherhood, far too much emphasis on building up a homestead instead of assassinating people, a boring, unfulfilling ending, boring, unfulfilling missions, boring towns that were no fun to freerun in, a wilderness that wasnt used nearly enough, a plot that was vague and confusing even by the standards of the mindery that came before...It was an absolute chore to play. I picked it up in a Steam Sale and still feel hard done by.
