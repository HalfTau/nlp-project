I dont like this game as much as the previous games, mainly because of the change in controls. There has been changes earlier, button changes and such, but in this game there are much less buttons to use at all. In previous games you feel more in control, one button for running, sprinting, jumping, climbing. In this game it is more or less just holding down one button and he will automatically run and jump from things where necessary/possible. It feels more like a movie you can steer sometimes but not as immersive as say, AC2. I never managed to finish this game, but I tried, I just didnt find it as fun as the other ones. Not a fan of American theme either which might add to it.Boat is fun though.
