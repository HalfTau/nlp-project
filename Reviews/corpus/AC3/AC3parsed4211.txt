This is a fantastic game! I love how it is set in historic Boston. It is beautifully crafted and it has an awesome open to world. I was at first hesitant to play the game but after checking out the videos and reviewing the game, it looked great! The game play, the story and the graphics make this a wonderful game. Playing it on a Gigabyte 7970, I have the game set on Very High settings and the game and graphics flow freely and without issues. I would recommend this game to anyone!
