This could have been a great game, but Ubisoft does it again.Rather than having fixed the annoying aspects, the controls have actually become worse, and on top of that the repetitive aspects of the campaign have increased. Even though it becomes obvious after awhile that they have been trying to upgrade the controls, they actually feel less intuitive now than ever before.Then, as always, theres UPlay. No escaping it.
