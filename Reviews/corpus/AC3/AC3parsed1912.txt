I love this game with all my heart, it is one of my favourite games of all time and it hurts me to give it a negative review but I originally played it on my Xbox. On PC its a different story, the game is unoptimized and unplayable despite the fact that I Exceed the System requirments. I would only get it if you are on a very good rig.Other than these problems its the best in the series and Is amazing, an easy 9/10
