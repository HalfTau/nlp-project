Only for those who want to finish the Desmond story or people who are interested in something Civil War related. I find the Connor the strongest Assassin at least now that Ive played until Unity.../ yes that sht. The only bad thing I find about this game is the segmentation of the map and the storytelling at the fist half of the game which has one of the worst paces Ive ever seen in a media content. At the second half things get better, music has some good moments and its good for its ending. Its a shame that they didnt achieve something more open world with such incredible landscapes.If youre fan of AC or you want something else better than this I fully recommend Assassins Creed IV Black Flag. The PS4 version if its possible which I consider the best one.
