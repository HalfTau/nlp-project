I am still in the middle of the main story, but I believe thats enough to make certain conclusions and have an idea of what the game is all about. First off, compared with previous Assassins Creed titles this game is improved on every level! Spectacular graphics with interesting story and fleshed out chatacters as well as AMAZING voice actors work thank God this time around Italian/Arabic accent wasnt required, so you can for once enjoy the real English and a refreshig setting at the dawn of America with its breathtaking landscapes no matter where you go. Plus endless number of subtle details whether its a dog barking at the cat or hares and other animals populating the wild world of the game. On top of that here you have a vibrant soundtrack, which has always been a strong point of any AC. The first game in the series that really immersed me from the beginning and never let go. I could go on and on describing advantages of the game but Id rather jump back into the game and play another sequence and would recommend you to do the same. Peace out!
