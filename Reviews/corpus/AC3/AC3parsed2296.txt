Really enjoying the game so far.I guess I am a reverse Creed player. I started with Unity, loved Paris, went to Black Flag, great graphics and everything about boating is splendid, now Im trying AC3.Although the first 4 hours is slow paced and tunneldriven, it gets better. I love the story, art, design, and gameplay. And wow, when you go from Sequence 3 to 4.I love playing awesome games on an awesome PC especially when older games still look awesome.
