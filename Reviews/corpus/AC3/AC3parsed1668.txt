meh..after AC, AC2, and AC brotherhood i was left with wanting more.. .after this game i feel as if i have had my dose of AC. I didnt really like the navalbattles that much, it was hard/akward to keep track of where you sailed, and where the enemies where.  never did any sided quest as i didnt really feel like it in this game, and it really didnt matter anyway. also there is this mission called chasing lee..  that mission, it is one the poorest designed missions in any game i have played. there was a few glitches, but nothing game breaking, mostly just hilarious.all in all i would say if you enjoy the first entries to the serie and want the conclution to the story they go play this game,  if your new to the game i would say dont bother, or play one of the first games.
