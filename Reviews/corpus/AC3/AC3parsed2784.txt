Finished this game in 67 hours on the count.I think it is a good game in terms of combat mechanics, new features such as controlling a ship. Fun idea with homestead instead of just workshop.The bad things  sometimes the combat gets a little messy, mainly due to main character trying to climb an object instead of just running. I still havent found a sensible way of combating brutes  imagine one of those guys can stop your combo and smash you in your teeth with his head for damage similar to officers sabre.Some people complain about the health regeneration, but I actually love that feature. The combat system is simply so much fun, that in many cases Id rather jump into the fray and do some slashing.Plot  this is my personal opinion, so take it or leave it. The Main protagonist connor is a complete retard. Literally, in a how stupid and naive one can be from 0 to 10,  he scores a bag of rocks score. Naive as a child, stubborn as a mule and often plain foolish. In many cases I felt by all the Hells, why are we going to do this?! This makes no sense! And in the end proceeding with another display of idiocy in a cut scene. I will refrain from spoiling here, but seriously  I dont think there ever was a more stupid assassin
