If you are new to the AC line of games, go back and start with AC2, and many will say go back to the original AC. I loved AC2/Brotherhood/Revelations.The open world stuff seems very well done, but...I am absolutely hating the actual single player campaign missions in AC3 they are an example of how to turn what was creative, flexible fun into sheer grinding boring labor. Ive had real life jobs that are more fun and less like work.I dont do multiplayer, so I have no opinion.Update Just finished game after managing not to ragequit early on. There is a fun game under here, and if you want to take the time to play, go ahead.Two suggestions1 Understand Sequences 18 are training/tutorial, so will force you do do things exactly how they want. This is also half of the game, and they kill much of the open world feel, that do as you will feeling AC games are known for.2 Dont try for 100 sync. The 100 sync goals in the AC2 series were usualy fun and tricky, and rarely a chore. AC3 reverses this badly. Few of the optional 100 sync goals are fun and thought/technique provoking. The vast majority are a horrible tedious grind or QTE, or worse, you wish it was QTE Most require tens of reloads to reherse the EXACT sequence of moves to get through. ZERO FUN for 100 sync, culminating in the worst 2 minutes ever produced by Ubisoft in the AC franchise, Seq 12 Mem 2  Chasing Charles Lee.More than a few posts comment how by the time you get to the endgame, you just want to get through it to the end and be done, like getting a root canal without painkillers. That is how I will remember the game not particularly fun, wont do it again, and it will take years to get the nasty tase out of my mouth, so it will be years before Ill consider buying AC4.Finishing AC3 is like a bad night at the bar, all you want to do is puke the next day, marvel at yourself for being dumb enough to to put yourself through it, and then swear never ever to do it again.
