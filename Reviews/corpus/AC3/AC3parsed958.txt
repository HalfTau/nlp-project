The reason why this game remains my favorite assassins creed is because it takes you back to our countrys founding my favorite era, both in America and in Europe. There are hardly any games out there that give this much time and devotion to this Era. You get to aid in the founding of America and see the historic events in essentially real time, like the tea party, signing of declaration or the battle of Lexington and Concord. Its a game that shows you different battles of the Revolution, but the dying words of the Templars contain truth however about the fate of the Natives.10/10 for innovation and high level of historical accuracy.
