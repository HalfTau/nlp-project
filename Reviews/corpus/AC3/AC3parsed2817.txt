I was unsure to rate this up or down to be honest i would rather stayed neutral on this one,in this one they surely went quite a bit more overboard with the optional quest also some of them only showup after youve failed them forcing you to go to the start menu just to see which optional quest are active. beside that new money management system to earn some extra money like buying shops previously is now replaced with some overly difficult and incredibly time consuming trade system that will most likely loose you some money before you figure out how to earn some with it sell your own furs, works best ps beavers  bears also assassins you hire are predetermined and never wear assassins clothing  also you start out having all your skills practically but you still go through training that will train you in the art of everything while you learn nothing .beside that you have your list of glitches quest characters stopping to move, RANDOM guard chases! like wtf really?, anyway there are more but ill let you have the fun of discovering them.More negative points Bad weapons switch menu slow, refusing to exit a map causes you to reload your current map like wth, game can crash now and then , some enemies your not allowed to counter or even punch 2 of them in the whole game and they require you to go close to a barrel and throw em in to one of em over and over..., hard to spot wanted posters like some of them are half inside of the wall, no hiding in bushes while being seen like literrally you cant crouch, he just wont crouch..., ultimate d moments where the cutscene is going kill someone you dont really want dead so the cutscene forces you to press a button so you feel responsible... to much to keep going... ps very long prologue, your custome is not being used in most cutscenesSome positve points Tomahawk pretty fun, Assassins even though not best version, still better then not having them like in 4, Boat euh i mean ship diff from as4 but pretty nice its own way, nice story but then again thats one of the strong points of as, atleast if you can follow x, op bow like who needs gun, build your own community sort offHints in the trade system craft your special items it has weapons you can use and pouches  even if you dont really use it this part is quite useful collect the pigleg trinkets included fun extra levels and a sweet reward in homestead interact with your people they unlock more homestead missions which unlocks more recipes dont sell your stuff to a general store unless for hunter guild objective doesnt work trough trade /  Upgrade your ship it will be necessarily in future missions both main and sidePS either way if youre an assassins creed fan its quite worth it to play, if youre new then dont start with this one id suggest 2 or 1.
