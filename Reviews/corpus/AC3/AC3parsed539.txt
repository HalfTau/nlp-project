Truth to be told, I forgoted this gem when I bought it few years later.Done the first missions... never get to connor... all seemd mehhhhh....Start playing black flag then unity and then sydicate. After a while even bought rogue. But this one seemed not so polished. I WAS WRONG. Sure u need sweetfx to clean all the milky, maybe a bit color more too... but DAMN, the game is real open, real great. De voices, acting, story, side story, crafting, upgrading... everything is neat.Doesnt seem old, nor buggy, except for one mission messing with menus when MUST NOT use your mouse and de fact u kant use veryhigh ambient quality or my frames drops to somewhat unacceptable even a monster laptop. But U kan not notice the difference anyway.BUt the rest.... its long... complex... rewarding.... I gave good reviews to blackflack for exemple but the fisrt time i took the ship in this one I feelt something epic. Dont know...music, more compeling charathers... They spent sure a lot of time making this one.and theyve done it.
