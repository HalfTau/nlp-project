Love the AC games, but this is the lowest contribution thus far.  Its not that its Boston, and the American frontier  I love that its come to the New World, and Connor, though hes a bit too solemn and colorless for me, is not the worst hero Ive played.  But what does it for me are the glitches and mechanical errors, and the problems in pacing.  The menus are obviously developed for the XBox, and are only halfheartedly converted to the PC mouse  keyboard which is how I prefer to play these games.  Sometimes WASD, sometimes scroll wheel, sometimes arrows, click with mouse, confirm with enter, youre moving all over the keyboard just to exit the game, reload a checkpoint, or sell something.  Weapon select and assassin send menus are bad.  Since these werent issues in previous games, why are they now?  The mechanical glitches are bad horses get stuck, etc.  The pacing is also bad it puts you into a mission, just to walk for about two minutes.  Why? Either walk further, or focus on the important bits.The ship sailing dynamic is good. Boston is nice, though the assassin/templar contest for territory seems less American than European would a quebecois butcher really swear allegiance to me?.  I think it needed another two months of playtesting on the PC.
