8/10The voice acting, the story, the controls, the main character are all not as good as in the previous games.  It is much less involved, less interactive.  Its barely a video game.  Its a 12 hour movie where you occassionally have to use the controller.  The controls arent as tight so it makes it frustrating a lot of times.But its still very interesting.  While it starts out extremely slow, it gets a lot better toward the halfway point.  Good story, some good plot twists.  There were some confusing moments, so even the story isnt perfect.Worth the price of a movie ticket and just that.
