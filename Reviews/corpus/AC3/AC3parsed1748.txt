Not my favorite game in the series, but nonetheless it is still a nice game to enjoy with multiple big maps to explore. While the story might appear dull at times, there are times where it ramps up and keeps you going. In my opinion, I found it less interesting to be in the colonies during the American Revolution, and I really disliked the new assassin Connor because of his arrogant, selfish demeanor he mostly carries on in the main story. Not a bad game overall 7.5/10.P.S. What happened to Desmonds face?
