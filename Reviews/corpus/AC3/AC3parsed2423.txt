So AC 3..... I expected great things, only to be let down by Ubisoft. The graphics are great, but thats the only thing thats good about this game. I found the story a great let down. Spoilers are coming here, so if you are thinking of playing this part of the series you should stop reading right here.It takes you to independence war era America, where you are taken along every great person murica has in their history. How tough the war against the British was, and how you, as Connor, are making the critical assassinations. You are a puppet from the assassins, then templar and then the ancients, whom also kill Desmond. Great ending Ubisoft thumbs up. So thats the main story line, which btw you can play without upgrading any of your gear. So it is a very hard game. Why they put a crafting interface and huntingskills in this game is beyond me, cause ya dont need it. The story didnt motivate me whatsoever to do any sidequests, and you have a hillsman, messenger, freeing people whom are getting bullied by redcoats, something with a drunk and finding treasure and something with your boat. All real Assissin stuff......Worst part of the Desmond saga. Raced through the storyline to see how Desmonds story ended. Did not like it. 4/10. I am not spending my money on any more Assassins Creed games. I have been cured by this game.
