I love it.Its a nice piece of progression of the series.The hunting aspect and Homestead is alot of fun, the naval warfare is great, and the story compelling.The gunplay is a little fiddly and slow, but so was power and lead balls.The hand to hand combat is enjoyable though a little too easy sometimes but the combos when hit are certainly interesting and great to watch.The graphics are great and not too taxxing on systems for the quality and the enviroment is large an varied.Occationally I find myself losing immersion with the game at certain points but they arent deal breakers.Id recommend it to anyone
