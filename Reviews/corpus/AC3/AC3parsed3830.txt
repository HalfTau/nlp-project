A  decent game, and I quite enjoyed it, barring some technical issues.The main technical issue I faced are frequent dips in fps at very regular intervals every 2 seconds.A quick fix in the ini file helped to alleviate this problem, although I may be wrong I did notice some slight dip in graphical fidelity.Another issue is that sometimes the character does not go where you want to, causing missjumps especially when youre chasing down the almanacs. However, I believe this is a problem in almost all AC games, and Ive also encountered this same issue in the new AC Black Flag. Probably just the way the engine deals with pathing, or maybe my fingers are not doing as what my brain tells them to.Technical issues aside, I quite enjoyed the story and was interested to continue on and see how a part of American History is perceived in an alternative manner.The Washington DLC is also quite decent, especially with the powers that comes with Ep1 and Ep2. I was wishing such powers would be available at the end of the main story, or unlocked in the main story once this DLC is completed.Not much of a MP person, so cant say much on multiplayer.
