Greatly improved melee, moves much faster. Countering will still win most fights, but not all. Your ranged tools are more fun, and by design the game has improved its guerilla and stealth tactics. Unlike the rural areas in ACII and brotherhood, ACIII suffers no navigation problems. You can move through the countryside easily and quickly, which allows you to toy with the soldiers.  If i have a complaint, it is that the ship battles were underused, and that is a crying shame. The ship handles well and the combat is great fun.
