I am extermly picky about my PC games. I own a playstation 3 where most of my AC games are saved. But with this summer sale deal I decided to get AC 3 to finish my collection. I waited for the download, got it all set up and the only thing that doesnt glitch is the cut scenes. I try to walk and I walk around in circles. The screen is all sorts of wobbly and spazzing out. I could only play it on my PC for about 5 minutes and then I uninstalled it. So glad I bought it 50 off and not at full price. Ill just keep playing AC on my playstation.
