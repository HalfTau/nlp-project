The final chapter of Assassins Creed saga, what brings it all together? What ties up the pieces of previous games? Find it all here. Travel through 18th century of Civil War as Connor Kenway.a mohawk assassin. Beautiful Graphics and Atmosphere, Average Gameplay, Great Story with some twisted plots, tons of hours will be wasted in this adventure, and it will worth it. Except the final ending of Desmonds story. IT SUCKS, RUINED MY LIFE, FKN HATE IT !!!! 6 out of 10 is my final verdict. If you like naval battles, multiplayer and solid single player as Connor, buy it, if you seeking for best ending ever? look somewhere else. Ending here utterly sucks as much it did in Mass Effect 3
