Uninstalling this game before finishing, I will probably watch a lets play on YouTube for the remainder. There are a few reasons for this, but what made me decide to quit it early was the insane amount of crashes I experience on Windows 10. Getting to the end of the storyline, the game froze and crashed almost every twenty minutes. Also, I should mention that you cannot run this game off an external hard drive. Long story short, if you want an optimized game dont buy it.As for the game itself, Assassins Creed III is in a bit of an awkward spot between the very well received Assassins Creed II and the next gen Black Flag. It is cleary experimenting with an open world, naval battles, original story elements et cetera, but cant quite execute them in the envisioned way. The open world is not really open, and many of the forests are bland and repetitive. Much of the world is sort of empty and without much to do. Also, AC3 tries to give a huge depth to its story, featuring an unusual protagonist and antagonist, and generally throwing lots and lots of characters at the player. Personally I didnt like the protagonist, even later in the story, whereas I could grow into Ezio in AC2, and AC1 had a much shorter story to make up for its relatively generic protagonist. And then the game introduces even more weapons and gameplay elements including naval battles than its predecessor. It is admirable, but I would say it gives the game a lack of focus. Altogether, some of the game was fun, but a lot of it also felt like a chore.Playing this between AC2 and Black Flag, you will have probably overlooked many of the games rough edges, but if you have played Black Flag or any later part of the series, going back to AC3 will feel clunky and uneasy. Therefore I would not recommend it, at least to anyone who isnt a huge fan of the series and will have probably played it already.
