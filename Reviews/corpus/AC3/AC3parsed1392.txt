here is game that would deserve an award for the most bugs in the PC version at least. This is not a bad game but those bugs can render some situations very frustrating. Once you pass the first five hours of the game, then the story start to pick up and AC3 turns out to be a fairly interesting game. The fight system is not as cool as the previous one nor is the weapon selection system.I would recommend the game but not the DLC. The DLC has to be the dumbest DLC I have seen in a long time. Really, you spend most of your time killing blue coats. It is getting to a point where it is absolutely ridiculous. Also, if there were bugs in the main game, the DLC has so many, you would loose track of the count. I ran into one bug which is so far preventing me from finishing the final episode of the DLC.
