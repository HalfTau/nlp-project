Honestly I enjoyed playing ACIII very much. The content is big, the world is incredible beautiful, and the history and characters are brilliant. I loved the hunting, building up the village and also the treasureseeking part. But the Sidequests in the village, or the seeking of treasures all over the giant world would be a lot better, if there would be ANY Connection to the Story. It was really annoying, that building up the whole village or trading with products from the different people of your village did not do anything good but giving you the feeling of doing something useless.All in all the game is very cool, but also the bugs annoy me personally very much.Much fun!
