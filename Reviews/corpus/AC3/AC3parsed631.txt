I liked this game, it was pretty cool  despite the fact that about 90 of menus and UI elements are designed to annoy instead of assist. Deliberately slow weapon selection, hidden assassin contracts, the slowest minigame trading menu ever, a similarly terrible crafting UI, and notifications that take ten thousand years to scroll across your screen are among the bad design choices Ubisoft made for this game. Thank god the gameplay is good and that Haytham is the coolest  on the planet.P.S.
