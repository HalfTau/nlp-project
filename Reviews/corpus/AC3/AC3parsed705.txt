Overall I would say AC3 is quite good. A must try for an AC fan.Pros Assassin trainees can do new skills Big maps  many places Improved freerunning Easy to kill enemies Kinda Hunting is something new, and its quite fun Ability to assassinate while moving Variety of weapons Awesome killing animationsCons Ending cant be chosen Short  bad story Not enough boss battles Glitches are just hilariousIf I was able to play the game one more time, I guess I wouldnt. The story isnt exciting as AC2 although it has many new animations compared to AC2.
