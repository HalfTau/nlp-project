Main quest is kind of boring in the second half but doesnt overstay its welcome too much.Open worlds not too big or too small, doesnt feel restricting nor too barren.Especially the freerunning mechanic makes it really fun to move around and interact in the world, I usually dont really do collectibles in games like these but AC3 made it fun.Runs like ing butter on PC, even on low to midspec machines, so if you see this on sale, by all means buy.
