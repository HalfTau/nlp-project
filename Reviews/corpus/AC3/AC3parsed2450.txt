I tried to get through the bad parts of this game to get to the good stuff, but i just couldnt gave it two attempts to stay with it but failing yet another misson due to getting stuck on environments for the 14th time has worn my patinence out. Im done. Im uninstalling you AC3 and its very doubtful ill come back. It even makes me hesitant to install and play AC4.
