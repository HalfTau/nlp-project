The minigames in this game are pieces of Wonky movement, glitchy executions, absolute worst ing lockpicking controls EVER for PC, and you have a game that is far and away the worst AC Ive ever played.Not to mention for some reason the lip syncing looks WORSE than it did in revelations.There needs to be a this is an okay core game but an utter disappointment to the series rating.Id still recommend anyone that plays AC to play it, but prepare for disappointment.
