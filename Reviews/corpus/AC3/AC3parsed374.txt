By far one of the worst Assassins Creed game Ive ever played. I had bought it just to complete the set. The game is overall a cross between Assassins Creed IV Black Flag and Assassins Creed II but takes most of the negative parts.One of the major dislike is the range weapon shooting system where it is complicated and very slow to the point it does not make sense to use a pistol/rifle. Parts of the missions are somewhat buggy such as certain scenes/animation gets stuck and you will need to restart a mission or checkpoint just make it run properly. The missions are especially difficult if you are playing a perfectionist playthrough due to the mentioned problems.I will eventually finish the game with a perfect playthrough, but it may take a while. Also, I am running the game in the highest possible settings with 60fps. There may be a possibility that the game is bugged due to certain graphic cards and/or due to Windows 10 Operating System Currently running in Windows 8 compatibility mode.
