My personal favorite AC game for the place  and setting. Im a history uff so this assassins creed game comes to mind in particular. The graphics are decent, the story is powerful and like I previously meshioned, yhe setting is totally kick My only complain would be that the cities are not as big compared to previous AC installments but the frontier is so big that makes up for it. Id give it an 8.8 out of 10. A must buy.
