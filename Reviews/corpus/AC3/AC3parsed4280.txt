Honestly? I dont understand the problem people have with this game. I thought it was visually striking, bold in its setting and premise, and just allaround fun. I was sick of Ezio after the extremely disappointing Revelations, and Connor made things interesting again. The assassin mechanics have been reworked, and while many remain waaaay to easy combat, others have changed for the better. I for one am glad that Ubisoft finally decided to change things, and I eagerly await AC IV.And seriously, the warship battles were amazing.
