A waste of time. I loved the first 2 AC games but this one seems to be nothing but moving between cut scenes. Walk here talk to him, run 130 feet and talk to him. Boring as hell, I shoudl have saved money and watched the ending on youtube. I really hope AC 4 is worth my time.What crap....Finally finished this rubbish. There were times when the only interaction you have is to painfully walk 10 feet and watch another cut scene.
