ACIII feels and looks like a tech demo for their next engine. Its good, the combat feels fun, albeit easy, the freerunning is simplified but improved at the same time, and climbing trees is a whole lot of fun. The PC port is pretty bad, but not unbearable. May require a bit of tinkering. Story is standard, good but the setting is vastly different in a notsogood way. Connor is boring, and the Native American VAs arent the best. I dont know too much about Cherokee culture, but everything feels bland and forced, especially their native tongue. It may be authentic, but authenticity does not make a good character.Also the consistent problem with the Assassins Creed games is there, the disjoint between the story in particular the themes and morals and the mechanics. It feels weird when the protagonist is slaughtering thousands of guards one second, and then is easily tackled by his significantly older father, as if he was no match. It feels weird and disjointed, and the fact that dyed costumes arent visible in cutscenes, like they were before.Overall its an imperfect game. Good but imperfect. Worth it for fans of the franchise like myself, but for casual players, its a no.
