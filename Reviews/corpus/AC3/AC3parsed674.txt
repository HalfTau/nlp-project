Excellent game, kept me occupied for a fair few hours. Worth playing whether you have played previous Assassins Creed games or not. I didnt 100 complete everything as some parts seemed trivial but I did do all the collections type things and hunts which were ok.Does require you to use Uplay which isnt exactly troublesome beyond having to setup yet another account.. But if you have an account from any other Ubisoft games then its no trouble at all.
