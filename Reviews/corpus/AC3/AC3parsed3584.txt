Its better than the critics gave it credit for, but theres a pretty big asterisk. It doesnt really take off until a good 6 hours in, and the movement just doesnt feel as good as in previous titles  something I primarily attribute to the architectural style of the period,  which was somewhat unavoidable. Play it if you need closure on Desmonds trilogy, but be prepared for a painfully long intro. Everything else is similar enough to previous titles as to hardly warrant a mention, though the addition of naval combat is a fantastic new direction, and foreshadows AC4.
