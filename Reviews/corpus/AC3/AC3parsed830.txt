Ohhh how much I liked the games? A lot!How much I liked the main protagonist? Not much. Its not Ezio.How much I liked the antagonist? A lot of daddy issues.And there is something about the end of the world, but who cares.It is AC at its peak. Recommend if you liked the Ezio trilogy.If this is your first AC, buy AC II.
