Meh, this was a soso game. I expected a lot more from this. The one thing they did well was the hunting. The worst part was the unsatifying ending of the game. It is frustrating to start over, guessing how you are supposed to finish a quest, or what direction to go in. I personally would not recommend this, because I didnt feel like I was rewarded very much for my efforts in the game. There needed to be more upgrades. Ships battles were..... ok. I really looked forward to it, but I was disapointed in how they didnt have very many options as far as boarding or that it didnt seem to tatical.
