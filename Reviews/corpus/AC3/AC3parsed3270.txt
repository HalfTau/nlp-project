What I consider to be the low point of the Assassins creed series. Unlikable characters Connor is always angry while maybe reasonable due to his past makes him unlikable especially in the way he treats his friends. a new setting that doesnt play to the strengths of the series the cities of America are just being constructed and are small decreasing the height you can climb from past games and even 2 years later it is littered with bugs.
