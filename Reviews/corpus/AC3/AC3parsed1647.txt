Really good game in my opinion. With this Assassins Creed your either going to love it or hate.ProsTime Period Wonderful Setting for an assassin to roam aroundInteresting and fun missionsAwesome real life figures to meet up withTree Running was a nice additionConsConnor is pretty boring but badass on the other handUpgrading weapons is pointless. using crafted or upgraded weapons will make no difference in combatPlaying about 5 sequences as everyone but connor smh.7.5/10
