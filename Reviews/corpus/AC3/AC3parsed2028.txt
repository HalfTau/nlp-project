Apart from the sea battles which are fun, thought this was... meh...Played and loved AC1, 2 and brotherhood, but AC3 is a definite step backwards, and the whole thing feels decidedly rushed and unpolished.First off, the first 8 hours or so intro gameplay is dull. You spend most of it in cutscenes, or just wandering around with little to do hey  let me spend half an hour assassinating rabbits!. Zero tension, and way too drawn out. The whole thing could have fitted easily into a 5 minute tutorial.The whole release is also full of bugs. Multiple mission events dont trigger properly and require restarts, some missions appear on the map but cant be triggered at all. For some strange reason theyve also changed the default key controls from the AC12 ones, so takes a while to get used to.Finally, a lot of the missions seem very prescriptive. Instead of AC1/2 style missions where your goals are generally very broad, AC3 missions and not just the optional objectives required for full synchronization are very specific kill this person with a pistol from this location. Instead of the immersive experience you get from earlier titles, you end up just feeling like your task is to figure out which route the developers want you to take.
