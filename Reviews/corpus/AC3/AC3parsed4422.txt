To me this is honestly the best AC game so far. Almost everything is an improvement from its predecessors. Freerunning, combat, and the atmosphere is better. The world feels more alive than the past games. It also looks really great. Though naval combat is a bit easy, especially if one doesnt try to do the optional objectives, it is still a great break from the the usual gameplay. Connor is a great character and he seems more human than Ezio preACR and Altair.Though I love this game there are a few things that annoy me. The missions were fun, but the optional objectivers werent. The removal of grabbing and throwing is a dissapointintment. Some of the features are not explained well and there is always is a bug here and there, but thankfully I have not encountered anything too bad.
