Compared to the rest it falls very flat.Im a fanboy. Ive played every AC game including this one and this one just doesnt measure up. Pro and cons.ProsGreat setting  Personally Ive always loved The Merican RevolutionConsThe maps are too flat, and too large. Theres too much space between everything.You literally cant kill anyone within a mile of anyone else or youll be discovered.No sense of progress, no armor upgrades, or weapon upgrades or anything like that. Theres nothing to work for that isnt the main storyAll in all I would reccomend anyone playing through the series to AT THE VERY LEAST only play the main quests and ignore everything else. Get through this game as quickly as possible. Otherwise just read the synopsis and skip from Revelations to Black Flag.It really is a shame, I love the series and the setting, I feel like it could have been a greast game but they screwed it up.
