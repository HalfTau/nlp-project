80/100Nice, different, but far AWAY from the Ezio Trilogy AC 2For itself its a nice game with Assassination Theme during Civil War times in the United States.Combat style is more Bruiser/Tank.. lacks the stealthy part a lot.But to even it out, you get a ship.. and you can equip it.. and become a Pirate Captain  AC3 is good to kill some time in a nice setting with average Story! It fits between 2.5 Brotherhood and IV Black Flag...just dont expect AC2 EzioTrilogy features or the better Overall Story and Combat from AC4 Black Flag
