Probably the most boring and without a reason to play on AC Series.First of all, you are Tarzan and not an assassin, jumping from to tree to tree,setting traps and hunting animals in order to trade their skin etc.Tragic.The immersion that had the previous games,this has not.Even the name of our hero is not true and he is Indian, like Pocahontas.P Bring back Ezio to be a captain on a Man o war style ship and not you. .
