Its a glitch factory....How can a Tripple A title be released in such a state? Youve got guys walking through train walls in cutscenes, PEDS walking into the middle of cutscenes, soldiers holding meter long muskets like a handgun.... glitch after glitch....It still has some good points  good story / acting / world. Maybe get it for 5 if you like assassins creed.The glitches just ruin the immersion something awful, and its apparent the main missions have been left in a rough state.
