Why would you play this game? Go get AC2 or 4 instead. Connor is boring as hell, the story is ridiculous, the music is forgetable... The first two chapters are interesting, and then the entire rest of the game is downhill. Maybe YouTube the Desmond storyline, which has a ridiculous end, but is sort of important to the overall arc.Dont play Assassins Creed III.
