The buggiest AC of them all, and coming from a typically buggy game series, this without doubt takes the cake. Avoid this game, if you feel like playing AC, go back and 100 revelations or brotherhood or something, but avoid this. If I could write just the name of the bugs ive encounted on a notebook sheet of paper, e.g. Dual Pistol Bug, it would be filled front and back with no space left on it.If you need another reason, basically all the features of Brotherhood and all of the ones from Revelations arent here, even basic stuff like armor, property, health potions is MIA. This has the fewest gameplay features since even AC1, so your not missing much. Connor makes Altair or even freakin Desmond look like a cult of personality.
