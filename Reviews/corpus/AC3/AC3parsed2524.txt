I played this game with the expectation that it would have an excellent storyline that would get me to the finish regardless of any major cons. I have to say that it did just that. The story itself is quite strong, with the majority of it, surrounding your main player character helping defeat the Templars and win the Revolution against the British. The game had its share of bugs and rather bad performance, though you can expect that from Ubisoft. If you can get this game on sale it is definitely worth a playthrough. Especially if you enjoy games with historical contexts and killing a lot of red coats. 7.5/10
