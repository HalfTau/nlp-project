Assassins Creed 3, set in early colonial times, you play as Connor Kenway, a Assassin warrior who fights for Freedom of the American people, He suffers alot and accomplishes much in this game. The majority of people who play this game think it was bad or horrible, are right in their opinion, in mine though I loved this game entirely. The Graphics were great, the gameplay was great, and the story was well presented with a twist in the game as well. i HIGHLY recommend this game and you will like it.
