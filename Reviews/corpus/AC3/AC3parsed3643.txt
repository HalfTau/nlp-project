After seeing this game getting lower reviews, Ill have to say that this is actually my favourite of the series so far.Gameplay more fluid, story more engaging better twists, the animus/supernatural fiction finally makes sense kind of, interesting side activities naval battles....This game is quite good after I was feeling the Assassins Creed series start to get stale and way too easy the older Ezio got.Gameplay is still not challenging if you were good at the others but its more engaging and tuned.Yes there are minor glitches here and there and the game is not really a stealthy pick your target carefully kind of game that stopped really after the original AC, but the game is well worth it and really pleasantly surprised me making me care about the AC4 pirates sequel.
