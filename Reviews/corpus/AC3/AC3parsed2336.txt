This game tries to do too much too quick. it tries to add new concepts and mechanics that dont really work or fit in. the story wasnt intereting to me, i couldnt understand or relate to any of the main characters and was bored for the majority of this game. the controls are broken and free running ends up doing this you didnt tell it to do. overall, if you want to finish the story of Desmond Miles, then play this game, you will get an ending to that story. if your looking for a good Assassins Creed game, play one of the previous games.
