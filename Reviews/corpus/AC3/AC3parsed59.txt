Assassins Creed 3 is OK  I was expecting for more but it was still decent.There is a lot of story  cutscenes  over and over and over which made the game go so slow. Felt more like watching a movie. Story was not bad though since charater background was built up very nicely  didnt leave you wander who is that person.Gameplay character control was very smooth and animationwize excelent. Fighting was very easy but looked interesting. Lots of different weapon choices. Hunting possibility  which was not nessesary but I take it. Lockpicking was a hell though  took so long to get hang of it  not sure what I was doing wrong so next time when I saw a chest I didnt even bother picking it.I will still recommend the game, but keep in mind there are 4 other games before this one. I missed 2 and was little lost that how did we get there and what happened to one charater. Now Im replaying those two other Brotherhood  RevelationsxTzharkz Eric.
