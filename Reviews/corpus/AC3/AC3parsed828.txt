Brilliant game, very atmospheric and beautifully made. The places you visit and the people you meet are made with care for details and the historic accurate.The gameplay is great and the sidemissions are fun to play, especially the hunting part which is always fun to engage in and reap the reward of convoys coming back with a  of cash for you to buy all the things you need.All in all i think it is one of the better assassins creed games.
