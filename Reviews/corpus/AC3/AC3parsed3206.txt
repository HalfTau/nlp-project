All the side activities and side missions except for the story naval missions felt pretty dull.There was very little customization for most of everything compared to the Ezio saga games and though Colonial America was pretty to look at it wasnt very fun actually exploring it. There was a charm in the previous AC games with its huge amounts of architectures to run through and above and this didnt really have a lot of that but instead were replaced by smaller, more spread out houses and trees which are actually pretty cool to climb and jump on.Also Uplay is doodoo.
