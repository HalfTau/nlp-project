I thought the story was a great 20 hours. Of course, the Desmond parts were fairly boring compared to being an Assassin badass. Nonetheless, I seem to be having more fun with the game after Ive compelted the main story, and roam around, tearing everybody apart The PC requirements for this one are low, at least compared to this games successor, Black Flag.Interesting setup, fun gameplay, but a slow story which drags out a little and leaves you confused at points there are several plot holes.
