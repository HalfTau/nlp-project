One thing that most people ever fail to mention is the gameplay within Desmonds life, to most gamers it seems that the primary draw to content within the Assassins Creed games is the gameplay within the animus as the ancestors. But I have to say one thing, the designers make it that way. There was so much potential for where they could have taken the main characters gameplay and storyline but instead they choose to focus him lying on his back in the animus and toss him a doggy bag of gameplay every so often. Now with that said that does not mean that I didnt enjoy the game. On the contrary it was my favorite yet the second one aside. The graphics were great blah blah blah but the true draw to this game is the content of detail within the sub stories and the fighting. The use of firing lines and human shields amused me greatly and was very realistic so I am happy about that, the hunting was pretty good but the animals I felt werent skiddish enough but who knows I wasnt around back then maybe they werent as jumpy as they are now. The sailing was amazing if not a little buggy on some missions but never annoying or to bad so as to the point of frustration. To finish this all off the depth of story and emotion won me over again, 9.5/10 for Ubisoft. claps congrats you havent ruined the franchise yet!
