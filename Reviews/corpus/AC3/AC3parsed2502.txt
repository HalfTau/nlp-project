This game has an improvement in controls and facial expressions and an updated economy and setting is always perfect in these AC games however the game aside from the optional quests is very boring. The story is fine but the main character is very monotone and takes away from the other characters in the game who DO have personalities.Theres more to do and a lot of open world, hunting and sailing and THOSE are great but not enough to it.
