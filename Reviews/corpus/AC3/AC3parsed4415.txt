Brings a new point of view for the franchise, not as Ezio.The story is really strong and doesnt really rely on previous games, you encounter many famous peopleGeorge Washington etc. which shaped America. The combat was also redone and significanly changednothing bad tho, the AI is quite dumb and there are bugs here and there, but overall, its one of the best games in the Assassins Creed franchise, if you are an actionadventure games fan, this one is definitely worth a try.
