Play the other Assassins Creed games ACII, Brotherhood, Revelations, Black Flag are all better unless youre a big fan of the series and are playing this for the story. The fact that I could put this game down after less than 20 hours in boredom given how much I loved its predecessors still boggles me.Fortunately, Ubi Montreal got their act together for Black Flag, and Id highly recommend just reading a story synopsis for III and skipping to the Black Flag instead of putting yourself through this.
