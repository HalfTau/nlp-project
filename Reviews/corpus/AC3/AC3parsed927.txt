Assassins creed 3 follows Connor Ratonhnhakton kenway. He is half indian half british.First of all im a huge fanboy of ac. So i think even unity was okay. so all of this is my opinion. And i know a lot of you have a differnt opinion about this game.StoryI think that Connors story is unique in this franchise. And that its very, very good. Im a HUGE fan of the series. And i played this game 2 times now.  the 30 hours i played was only one playthrough! And i still have only 44 completionDesmonds story is also amazing!gameplaySince the you know have a frontier you can parkour in trees! You can still acces rooftops in New York and Boston. The combat has changed. Its really has a different vibe. Connor can use a sword, tomahawk or a club. He can also use some more weapons but i dont remember. Connor also possess a robe dart. He can use it to let his enemies come closer or to hang them wich looks amazing!. Connor also has a bow, a gun and bait and a trap. He can also use trap mines. however, i never used them. Hunting is a way to  earn money. You can explore the frontier and hunt for animals. It works very good. Instead of what ac 4 did they let us see the area where an animal lived You know had to find the animals in the frontier to add this information to your map.graphicsThis game came out in 2012. So the graphics arent stunning anymore. However, this game looks better on my pc than ac 4 because i just cant run ac4 on anything above medium. I just cant.VerdictI would recommend this game to most people. Assassins creed is an amazing franchise imo. If you enjoyed ac1, brotherhood ,revelations, 4, rogue , unity or syndicate, youre gonna like this game.
