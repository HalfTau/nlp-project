What can I say about Assassins Creed 3 that hasnt already been said? I wont say I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed the previosu three titles, but its still very much the same parkour, assassination and swashbuckling game but in the setting of The American Revolution, which was nifty. And of course you play as a new character, Connor, who replaces the much more charming Ezio. The naval battles are probably the best part of this game. There is also a trading mini game, but it winds up coming down to you just producing 1 item over and over and becoming very rich, so thats kind of broken.In any case, there is a lot of side content and I was compelled to complete it all which speaks to how fun this game really is. If youre an Assassins Creed fan its more of what you love and a few new things to love.
