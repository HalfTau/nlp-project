Assassins Creed 3 is one of the better games in the series. The combat is fun and has been greatly improved since the last game in the series, the free running is also greatly improved bow you can free run in trees.The only thing i found dissapointing was the money you earn, you can get the best stuff early on and i found myself with piles of cash at the end of the game with nothing to spend it on.
