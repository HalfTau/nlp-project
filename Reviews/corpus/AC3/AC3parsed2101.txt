This is one of the best games I have ever played. This is the game where Ubisoft did almost everything right. Although the multiplayer doesnt work for me, the combat system was perfected, the mini map was there and the health bar was better. It left more room for customization with an entire homestead, and even after you finish the main story, there is always something to do. I believe that it is much better than Black Flag, especially in its hunting. The only thing that isnt better in this game than in Black Flag is the sailing. Other than that, the rest of the game is spectacular. 10/10
