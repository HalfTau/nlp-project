Bought on sale for 5 or 7.50. Played 50 hours.A fun sandbox game, lots of diversions. Never got into crafting/trading much, so I might be missing out. I liked the ship mission mechanics  very pretty but very little tactics.Combat and freerunning are still very satisfying, though theres still the odd time where you jump out into space instead of that haystack, and the guards all feel like squishy paste or cheating s. Tree running and hunting are fun new bits.It tells a nice arching story. Incredibly heavyhanded all the time, but best taken as a parody of something.Also, John de Lancie.
