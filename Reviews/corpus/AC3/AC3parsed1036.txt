In Assassins Creed III, players continue to follow the ancient struggle between the Assassins and the Templars through Boston, New York and the Frontier during the American Revolution. The protagonist, Ratonhnhakton commonly called Connor, is a halfMohawk, halfBritish Assassin who aids historical figures including George Washington, Benjamin Frankin, and Samual Adams in their fight for freedom. Set in an open world, Assassins Creed III offers loads of collectibles, side quests and random adventures to discover while not playing the main missions. Often times, however, the time spent outside progressing the story mars the great storytelling and fluidity of the storyline. All in all, Assassins Creed III is great game worth playing, especially for those who enjoy a storyrich, vastly openworld game.
