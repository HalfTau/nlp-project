This was a game i was very reluctant to play. As i found assassins creed enjoyable upto revalations which seemed to go a bit of the rails, but to my amazment i sat down with this game and thought where did the time go this game has a great story up to where i currently am 9 hours in and has improved upon the combat from previous games and would definately recomend this to any fan of the assassins creed series or just likes to play a cross between GTA and any 3rd person RPG.
