Nice story, but nothing new. Player controls are again bad  responding very slowly and the game selects itself the next target in group fights with more than 4 opponents. It feels like Ubisoft tries to control your gaming. The character also continiously jumps and climbs objects nearby although player is directing the character movement elsewhere as happens in other games in this series. Some on the Homestead missions are really annoying, for example the Fightmission is frustrating to get though with keyboard controls. Its nearly impossibel the keep on eye the fighters action meters. Also the fighting controls sucks once again. Also many of the mission are boring and mainly pure The worstt AC so far  not going to by Unity and Rogue  enough is enough. Although, I like Far Cry series 23 most, I almost hate the Assasins Creed series execpt Black Flag. Not worth of full price, maybe 10 . If you have too low bloodpressure I would recommend this game for you .Update The game is really peace of crap. Controls doesnt work in the figth in the prison. The mission is really no sense at all. I dont recommend this game even to my worst enemy. No more AC III, ever.
