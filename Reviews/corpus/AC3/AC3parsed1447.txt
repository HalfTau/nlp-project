Great game. The combat inst too bad once you get used to it. This was my first AC game. The game ran well, only one game breaking bug in the 1st part of the Washington DLC but I found a way to get past that and posted how I did it in the forums. Graphics and sound are first notch IMO. It has a very open world feeling to it although the stroy is quite linear. There are side quests in town you can do but they really dont amount to much. The DLC pirate quest is good as well as all of the naval batltles and quests. Overall a very satisfying game and I got 60 hrs of play out of it, play just once through everything. Got my moneys worth!
