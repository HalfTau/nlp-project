You know, if this is your first AC game, its really not that bad. After playing some other ones though, I realize why everyone complaining about this. I would recommend it, but lets just say its not the best in the franchise. The game is super easy, I didnt have to upgrade Connor at all...I didnt even use a different weapon throughout the story. I just used the weapon they started you out with. The combat is way too easy. All I found myself doing was pressnig E, which is to counter, and clicking which automatically kills most enemies. They actually dont tell you that, but its there. Ill be honest, the story was...meh. I barely followed along with it, but to be honest I barely followed along with AC 2s story line. They all get boring when it comes right down to it. I would get this game if you just like to hunt things, or murder people as there are tons of people to murder around the cities. Its not a bad game, just okay.
