This game in the series lets down all of the good work that the others have built upon.The positives that can be said about it are as follows, the world is very pretty and mostly well thought out, the naval battles are new and exciting. Thats where the praise ends. For the most part this game is mediocre and i found myself rushing to finish it to see if it would get better, it mostly doesnt.The story is disjointed non sequential and mostly boring. 90 of the content feels tacked on, including but not limited to the economy system, the assassins missions of whom never came in handy at all, the sidequests, the checklists, the hunting, the crafting, Most of it was tedious unoptimised filler, such at the crafting and trading which took about 10 minutes per trade to set up for a miniscule income.The economy and homstead building had none of the exictement that was found when building up in previous games. The swordplay was lackluster and was even more counter oriented than previous titles. The new two button system feels dumbed down compared to the limb based system and means for more freerunning errors than even before.The voice acting is terrible and the characters are all unlikable.Apart from looking nice this game is a feature creep substance lacking crapola fest and has hurt the series more than its contributed.
