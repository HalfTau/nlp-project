One of the most frustrating game i ever had to play the control are totally unresponsive and not precise at all the tutorial chapter ask you to do things that are bugged  he ask you to parry 3 times in reality you have to parry something like 20 times, Its boring cutscenes after boring cutscenes after an other longer cutscenes for 3 min gameplay then an other boring hella long cutscenes . the your stuck in place in a position where u have no clue what to do and nothing happen so you quit and uninstall the write a review to make sure the people doesnt do the same mistake as you . I hope it helped .
