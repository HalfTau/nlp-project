Assassins Creed III is a good game, but it doesnt live up to what an Assassins creed game should be. Sure it added a few new things like updated graphics, actual hiding, and more user friendly menues. But the game lacked in some areas. The story took to long to get started and by the end I was more wanting to skip the cutscenes then watch them. It seemed like they were trying to make it really epic but ended up just plain over the top. The game is buggy I lost count of how many times I got stuck in rocks.
