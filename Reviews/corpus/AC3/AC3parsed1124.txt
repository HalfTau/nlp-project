Well, now the game has glitched and wont save my progress. I entered a mission, and I keep completing the objective but it doesnt register it, since the game glitched and left me stuck in another mission. I still have the target markers from that mission, and the people are dead, but they wont go away. So that save file just doesnt work at all now. GJ ubisoft, this is the unity before unity
