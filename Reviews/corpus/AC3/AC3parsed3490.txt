I recommend this game to a majority of people, not all. It has great looking graphics, senic enviroment. But the rough points it belittles Americans, Christianity, Butchers the charactor of George Wash. Sure it Exists in an alternate reality., Also your character you play is sorta racist against whites and vise versa. I do recommend it for anyone who enjoys touring cities in the 17501800. it is true the desomond levels are sorta crappy but the Animus is almost always interesting it can be quite addictive but it can get alittle repetative
