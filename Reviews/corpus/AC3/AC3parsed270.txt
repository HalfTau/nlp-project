EDIT Steam user Finoderi found a way to fix thisI have deployed this fix and my saves work again. Ubi clearly doesnt test. As of this edit, there is still no official patch that fixes this.Patch on 9/12/17 broke my 88 hour save. Been working my way through the game, collecting all achievements. I cannot continue my progress, and have lost all my enthusiasm for this game.I have opened a ticket with Ubi support, but they seem completely unaware of what has happened or why. There has been no public response to this issue that I can find in the week since they issued this patch.I can no longer recommend this game to anyone, and would caution anyone against buying future Ubi products due this lack of communication and lack of support for this literal gamebreaking issue.
