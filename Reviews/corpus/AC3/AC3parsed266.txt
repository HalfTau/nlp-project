Convoluted and tedious. I wanted to play through to continue the story from the first bunch, but this one is hard to get through. This installment of the AC franchise continues the tradition of clunky controls and execution, but also the tradition of showcasing interesting facts and stories from history. I feel like this was some kind of beta experiment to test out new features for future games, but they tried to pack too much into it and it just ends up being a bloated mess that doesnt do anything very well.
