Was working fine for about a month i.e., around 30 hours. Really started to enjoy the game and then came an update after which i cannot launch the game at all. Tried everything on the internet from uninstalling and reinstalling Uplay, VC redist.., DirectX, .NET Framework, editing MonitorDesc in the game ini as i read somewhere, Disabling cloudsync, Moving the game to a different drive, Verifying gamefile integrity on steam, Running Uplay and AC3SP.exe as admin, updated to the latest Graphics drivers and hell i even uninstalled the game and redownloaded it, all of this to no avail. The game randomly boots up and the next time it doesnt work. There seems to be no permanent solution to this crap.I am so fed up of  the stupid service called Uplay and Ubisoft in general for effing up most games. Whats the point in buying your games if we have to put up with all this nonsense and the only way to play is using a crack?
