First off. I have to say that this is by far one of the best AC games. The fighting style is great. The graphics are great. And the voice acting isnt that bad at all.Although it does have some bugs like very other AC game but some can be gamebreaking.I recommend buying this game if you want to get caught up on the story.BUY THIS GAME WHEN IT IS ON SALE
