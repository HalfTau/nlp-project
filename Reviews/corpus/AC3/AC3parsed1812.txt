If youre looking for a fast and easy way to lose your eyesight.. then this is the game for you! In the first two hours Ive counted over 90 cutscenes! each with a flash with the intensity of a sun before and after, so dont lose hope! You WILL be blinded by this game. Also.. horse sucks, cant even jump over a small rock or log and unless youre on the road... just run, its faster. The game even takes the liberty to change your secondary weapon/tool choice. Also.. remember the cutscenes? loads of em are for 20 foot walks meet me over there walk 2 seconds youre here!... Voice acting is terrible!!! Only Achilles and anyone who gets drunk has some spirit. The terrain though beautiful, is terrible.. Sure in real life you dont get easy acces on mountains, but the game is extremely picky about where you may climb a mountain. Back to the flashes.. if the cutscenes wont do it for you and there are an awful lot of them using the map will also give you a completely free suckerpunch to your eyeballs.. before and after ofcourse. What else... oh right.. controls were pretty steady from AC1 till AC revelations.. but someone decided to completely ruin it and changed everything!! There is some recovery possible with the keymapping, but .. youll see.. or not ofcourse.. I seriously feel they HAVE to put a warning on this game, extended playtime WILL ruin eyesight. It blows, I want my money back.. all 5 euros of them.Wait.. ehm.. the naval aspect is pretty nice.. so theres that.
