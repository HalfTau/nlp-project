Black Flag is one of my favourite games, but this just didnt live up to what I thought it would be. The story was confusing I never felt attached to the characters and it progressed way to slow. Five hours and only 15 percent done, and thats doing mission after mission, without taking the time to explore or anything. I just didnt find this game enjoyable.My advice Play Black Flag or Rogue
