8/10This is my first review on steam.Ive played this game for well over 100 hours on my Playstation when it first was released. Ive recently started in to computer gaming and this was a game I felt I needed to buy again.ACIII was/is an amazingly fun game to play if you are someone who enjoys the ability craft, explore an open world, and of course assasinate. I enjoy the story very much I wont reveal any of it here to avoid spoilers and the upgraded/tweaked gameplay mechanics I feel make this title a very well designed game. Even with my PS4 copy of Assassins Creed IV, I still prefer this game.This game is not perfect however, I  have found significantly more bugs on the PC version over the PS3 but nothing that I would call game breaking.In addition, if you are a Free Mason such as myself or are knowledgable of Free Masonry, enjoy the subtle and abundent references left by developers.
