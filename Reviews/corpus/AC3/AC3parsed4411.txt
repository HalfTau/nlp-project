This game!! O M G!! THIS GAME!! I had a great time playing it. Unlike AC1 and AC2 I didnt skip all side quests to get to the end of this game. I savored it. I did every mission. Granted I didnt get all collectables but I dont do that in any game.The ship missions are awesome, the graphics are amazing. The game has so many features and mechanics that just make it immersive. Not all features are a must do sort of thing., You can get by without doing any of the brotherhood stuff or any of the crafting/homestead missions. But If you do it adds great depth to the game.The game is also very dynamic. it changes as the games story  advances. The changing weather is also pretty awesome. The story is odd but I found it to be very entertaining. I cant wait to see where the next game leads. If you got the cash this game is definately worth the money.
