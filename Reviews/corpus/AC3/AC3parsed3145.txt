Spoilers!When I heard that this game wasnt going to be gungho proAmerica, I thought it might offer a perspective you only find from old, boring historians a proBritish one, that supports America and its people, just not its release from an orderly country. In their words. Frankly, I was hoping to beat up Colonists in the British Army. I was disappointed by the fact that the game exhibits an antiAmerican and antiEuropean view, where the main plot involving Connor asks the question At what cost is independence good?You see the cost through the oppressive acts that the British conduct on the colonists and that both of them do on the African slaves and native Americans. You doubt Washington for what the game shows that hes done. You doubt the British, but you probably did anyway, especially if youre from the U.S., France, Germany, or inner London. You ask yourself, Is peace really going to come about because of freedom? And this is what Connor asks when he works with his father and the Templar Knights. Eventually he warps his idea of freedom into an idea of equality, where his goal is to remove oppression in America he fails of course. Where the Assassins ideal compared to the Templars changes nothing. So Connors own Order of Assassins is different, fighting the oppression that comes with ultimate control rather than the lack of freedom that comes with it.The game is far too political, and in a direction that is largely irrelevant to the world situation in 2012. It shows antiAmerican and antiEuropean bias way too much. But it sure is fun to destroy things and leap around in true Assassins Creed style, and while I probably wont play Assassins Creed game again, this one was pretty fun the first time regardless.4/10
