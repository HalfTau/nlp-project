I am a pretty big fan of the Assassins Creed series, and I thought ACIII was one of the best out there. It had many hours of good quality gameplay graphics, plot, freedom as to where you can go, etc., and the multiplayer option was fun too. I have ACV, and ACIII was MUCH better compared to ACV thanks a lot bugs P. ACIII also kept the Desmond Miles plot going in the background, which I like since it sticks to the original idea of the series. I would recommend this game to anyone who doesnt mind a bit  of blood and a lot of fun.
