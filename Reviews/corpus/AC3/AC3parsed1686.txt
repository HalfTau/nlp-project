I thought AC U aka AC 5 was the glitchiest AC to rule them all but then I played AC3 and now I can say I know what a glitchy AC game is REALLY like. Killing deer only to have them flop to the top of a cliff, dead soldiers suddenly become slendermanesque in limb length, this game takes the cake. Also random crashes. And all this is from a supposed final code.At least ACU had the excuse of being glitchy at launch, AC3 is glitchy 3 years after release.Still, its a fun game, stupid random jumps to modern time aside who gives a fudge about Desmond, seriously?, just a low point in the AC lineage. Ok maybe Im a bit of a biased AC fan...Also, f Charles Lee. Seriously, worst mission ever.I give this 6 mehs out of 10. Id neg this game, but its too much effort.
