Fun game, engaging story, likable protagonist. Lots of things to do other than the main plot. Was not, however, a huge fan of the trade/market system in this game. It felt like its own separate minigame, and I could not be bothered to craft things or trade things other than the bare minimum required to obtain enough currency for upgrades. Some of the full sync requirements proved to be frustrating. Overall, enjoyed it a lot.
