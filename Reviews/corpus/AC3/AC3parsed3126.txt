Poor untight controls that cause easy mistakes, glitchy textures and terrain, long sneaking missions that send you back to the beginning if someone looks in your direction even if they cant see you. Weak story and lack of 3d landscape of previous games. Overall, a poorly mad cash grab and total disappointment.
