This is a rare instance where I recommend console over PC. the PC port of this is one of the worst in living memory.Seriously, so many graphic glitches that it just is horrendus, the movement is wanky, and if you try messing with the framerate in your GPU control panel, you either get forced to deal with drops or you have to witness people losing their hair faster than a concentrated dose of chemotherapy.Its a terribly underrated game, but not a good one on PC.
