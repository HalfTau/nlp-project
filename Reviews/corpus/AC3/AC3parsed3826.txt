Reminded of an entire filler season of Bleach. Yknow, where instead of progressing the storyline, Ichigo fights off killer stuffed animals or something? Yeah, this game was fun, and innovative, but was lacking in story. Clunky mercantile systems and other things turned me off from playing, and there just wasnt enough oompf! No ZIZANG! I still support Ubisoft, despite their disgusting client that we must be forced to use instead of a default like Steam. Curse your inability to conform!
