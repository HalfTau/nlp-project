In personal perspective, this must the best game in the Assassins creed franchise to date. This game consists of an epic rich storyline of American revolution no need for Assassins Creed Black flag or even Unity as it has the same naval combat and revolution type feeling to an extent. This game is a bundle of all the possibilities you can achieve with a vast open world map with this highly award wining game.
