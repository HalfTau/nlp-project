I am a fan of this series from the first game to the latest. Though the game has minor glitchs here and there, it overall has a good game concept. The only problem I have it is that the backstory is confusing to a certain point and I completely lost interest in it as the game progressed because of not understanding it fully. Id give this game a 6.9/10 but I would not recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good narrative with good gameplay. This game has great gameplay, not a good narrative.
