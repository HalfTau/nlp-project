If you havent played this game then i urge you to save your PCs life and completely disregard this game and move straight onto Assassins Creed Black flag. This game is the most buggiest peice of horsei have ever played.Seems to me that half the Dev team was murdered to save money and was replaced with Sea cucumbers.Nothing works the way it is supposed to, not the game play or the mechanics, nor the visuals and most importantly the quest challenges do not register half the time.On the other hand Black Flag  all over AC3 better gameplay and story line and very minimal interest destroying bugs
