Kept me engaged and mildly frustrated throughout most of the game. Theres a lot of tiny quirks that accumulate over time and like to ruin what wouldve been a really good experience otherwise. The very last part of the game is where everything starts to crumble. Sudden change of pacing has really confused me and the level of BS in terms of difficulty and resulting frustration was off the charts. Its one of those times when you can easily loose your temper.The core gameplay is mostly the same as in previous games  not much to say here, thats where most of the fun is and theres quite a bit of it.Storywise the game approached a very critical moment, therefore it is a must if youre a fan of the series and are willing to play the rest of it.If you were to ignore the overabundance of minor issues and the last part of the game Id say go for it. Just make sure to stay patient, otherwise youll have a bad time.
