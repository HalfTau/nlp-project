A lot of people dont like this one for some reason. For me, personally, its my favorite of the series. I maybe a little biased as I have always loved history, and the American Revolution is on of my favorite parts of history. I found Connor more interesting than Ezio or Altair.The free running and Gameplay is also more fun in this one, imo.
