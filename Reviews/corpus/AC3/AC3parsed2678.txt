The Assassins Creed mushrooms special effects include getting the user to believe that they are playing a video game where they control video game people who do things that video game people do such as swinging through the air onthat comes through the wrists or having a gunfight with the entire Nazi army by ones self and winning. There are currently five flavours that are considered part of the chronological order of growth alongside a few deviants.Each consecutive mushroom adds a number of improvements to the users hallucination such as including a storyline where the user controls video game people who do things that video game people do when they have a story to follow. The hallucinations are described by survivors as being a mixture of third person actionadventure platforming, stealthily killing people unstealthily, stealthily hiding with weapons all over body unstealthily, and another that makes them believe that they are named Desmond Miles and that they can, with the help of a machine called the Animus, read their ancestors minds.
