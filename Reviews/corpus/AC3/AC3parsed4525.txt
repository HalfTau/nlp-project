My journey trough this title of Assassins Creed was exactly as I expected  for me this game is the Game of The Year 2012. Excellent gameplay, story and a delight for the eye when it comes to graphics. Unmatched multiplayer experience, with a new engine and great gameplay. This game its a must have in your collection, Ill give it a 10/10.
