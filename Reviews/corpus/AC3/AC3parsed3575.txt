Bland, repetitive and frustrating to play.  Constantly pulls the rug out from under the player in a bad way particularly at the end of the very long prologue, and has a terrible ending to a story weve all been forced to sit through as we tried to get through the Ezio goodness in the previous 3 games.  The new world setting means the game lacks the impressive scope of the buildings in 1, 2, Brotherhood and Revelations, and the open world frontier sections just feel empty and not at all fun to play through.  The sideactivities have lost all charm or interest, I didnt care about trading lumber for barrels or getting salt shipped over to Boston and ended up ignoring almost all of them/forgetting they were there.Most frustrating of all is the feeling that all the emotional or story beats the game is trying to hit dont feel earned  Desmonds relationship with his father Connors socalled anguish over HIS father Achilles conflicts with Connor dont feel genuine and the homestead lacks the family/community feel they seemed to be going for.A massive letdown after the Ezio trilogy and not at all a game Id recommend.  Read up on what happened and skip to Black Flag, or just wait for the new French Revolution game.
