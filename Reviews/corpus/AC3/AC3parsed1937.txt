SPOILER ALERT!!!.........In my opinion, Assassins Creed 3 is the best game of the series and Connor is the best assassin ever. Not because he has special skills or something, but he is the only one who makes mistakes just like everyone he fights for freedom at first he wanted to save his village, but after killing his first target, he realised what being an assassin means, he sacrifised so much and he saw his mother burning alive and a lot of his close friends dying. Although his life was terrible and full of pain, he helps people without asking something in return. This is very inspiring for me. His life was the most poetic, close to me and realistic of all the assassins so far. Connors sad story still makes me cry sometimes.I am not going to apologize, I am sure my English were not so good...
