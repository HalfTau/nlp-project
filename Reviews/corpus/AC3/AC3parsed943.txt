A disappointment the controls were changed and reviewed, some for the worse, few for the better.Some mechanics end up being completely useless i.e. viewpointsThe story doesnt even try to deliver a satisfying ending to the huge buildup of its predecessors.The setting doesnt quite work with the mechanics at hand, the world is filled with mostly open enviroments and short buildings leading to very few impressive moments naval battles, Desmond sequences.If you want to know the story, just go watch the cutscenes on youtube.
