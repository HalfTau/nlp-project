Always been sceptical about this series of games without really playing any, so i figured id pixk this up on sale and see if it was any good, all i can say is jeez its fun if not a little slow at times, has a well written story from what i have seen so far Do feel like not playing or knowing what happened in previous titles hurts me though.There is a lot of exploring, collecting and item hunting you can do with some nice little additions later on too i have been playing about 10hours now and think im only 20 done, Lots to see and do and well worth the purchase, so much so im considering pre ordering 4 at full price........
