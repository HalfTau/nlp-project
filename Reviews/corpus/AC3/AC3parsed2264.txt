My least favorite of the AC games. The change of setting is nice, as are the naval battles, but thats really the only positives I have about this game. Connor is a very dull character and I found  yawning during the cinematics. The storyline is very mediocre and the gameplay is about the same as any other AC. Nothing has really changed. I may have given this a positive review if I had not paid full price for this game but unfortunately, I did. Probably wont be making that mistake again with the AC series in the future.
