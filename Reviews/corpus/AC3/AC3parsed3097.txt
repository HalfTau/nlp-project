This game gets a lot of crap for being awful. I would say that is an exaggeration. While the game doesnt always do a great job of explaining all of its mechanics, it is still highly enjoyable. The graphics are highly detailed, the sound is sufficient and the music is fitting given the time period the game takes place in. The combat is much improved from previous games in the series and the addition of ship sailing is a breath of fresh air for the series. If you are a fan of the series, this game likely wont disappoint too much. If you are new to the series, do yourself a favor and start elsewhere. Assassins Creed 2 is a far more polished game and when combined with its direct sequels Brotherhood and Revelations makes a great story.
