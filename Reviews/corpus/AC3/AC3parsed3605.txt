Previously without having played Assassins Creed 3 I was being negative and quite biased when speaking of Assassins Creed series. It all changed upon meeting Connor, the main protagonist, of this entry. Now, I am absolutely positive that this is one of the best action games I have played in years. There are a few misfires that could jeopordize some aspects of the game, yet the good things undermine the significance of the not so good things.The good thing is the relative freedom thats been given to the player in how he or she interacts with world. Not only you can explore vast cities of Boston and New York you have a whole wilderness in between them to explore. You can harvest, craft and even build your own village. And lets not forget about the sea battles, that are the absolute best of the game.The story is also satisfying as is its main subject  Connor. I am not a big fan of the animus thing as I would enjoy the game more if it was a Connor only game, but, hell, all stories need a plot machine.Now onto the not so good. Lets start with saying that some aspects of the game feel quite dated. The auto run is not good as Connor in times could get stuck in numerous cluster scattered around as well as jump onto the wall you never intended to jump. Thats annoying and Ive been yelling at my computer at times in desperation.Overall, the game is fantastic, I do not regret neither the money nor the time spent on it.4.9/5
