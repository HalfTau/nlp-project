The game is an assassins creed game. The plot is bonkers, there a a metric ton of collectibles, and combat never particularly hard. But it introduces naval combat which is amazing, and you get to run through the trees which can be a lot of fun. If you like the other assassins creed games, there is a good chance youll like this.On the downside, HOLY CRAP, THERE ARE TOO MANY HOMESTEAD MISSIONS. JUST TOO MUCH.Also, stay away from the dlc Tyranny of King Washington. There is a bug that can make sure you never complete the first chapter. Ubisoft has never corrected this, their recommendation? Reinstall the giant game.
