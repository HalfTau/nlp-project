ok, look, i know AC was never particularly strong storywise. AC2Brotherhood were fun, though they were basically glorified tales of organized crime in italy. and thats my take on BEST this series ever had to offer. but here, oh boy... somehow were expected to be interested in a completely dull story, of shallow characters, forced motivations, lots, lots and LOTS of bloodshed and manslaughter... and thats just the prologue! whats the point of trying, really?some may suggest gameplay... its usual AC block1shot combat, a very confused parkour segment, boring town i miss you renaissance italy   but well, if youre a colonial american history nerd, this might interest you. otherwise... well, go play mirrors edge if you desire good parkouring so bad that you can bear a bad/mediocre story, or dishonored if you really want to be a nonmodern assassin of sorts. if youre looking for a good story? too many candidates to count here, im sure you can find something.Edit ok, there WERE some plot twists relatively early in the game. Still, seeing some both sides! storytelling in fall 2017 is... not helping games case, to say the least. Well, at least we can say that life imitates art!
