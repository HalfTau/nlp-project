I have been a fan a of Assassins Creed since the very beginning.. the sequel was a great, great addition to the original concept and was really awesome for the time. Then brotherhood was meh, then revelations was a bit more meh, and now finally we have 3... I expected something revitalized from the original, some unique concepts or something, but all I got was all the other previous games just skinned over to be in the colonial United States. The only real addition made in this game is the naval warfare, which even that isnt anything great. Long story short, if youve played the past games you can skip this one and experience the same thing.
