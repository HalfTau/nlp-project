At the beginning I was mad with the controls, but once I used to it, the game is perfect. I even like the sidequests such collecting feathers or hunting animals, it is something new and when you buy the maps to avoid aimless hourslong searching, it is great. The gampelay is fine, in comparison to AC II, you have a lot of new tools available. Very good.
