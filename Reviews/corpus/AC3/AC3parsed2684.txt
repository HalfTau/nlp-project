Console port by Ubisoft. They give no  about quality as long as they get the profit.Terrible controls with even worse response from them. The inaccuracies from the parkor makes this game cringeful.Completely unrealistic objectives plagued with absurd optional objectives that you must complete a portion of them to be able to progress the story does that even ing make sense Ubisoft? Why the  are they called optional objectives?I would only recommend it at 2.50. It is worth no more money than that. Terrible game.
