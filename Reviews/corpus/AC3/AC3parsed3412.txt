I love assassinscreed 3. I am hyped to play 4. The setting does make for some awesome gameplay, but i do have some issues with the game. The assassin recruits are weak, you dont need to use them, i use them only for xp, i mostly send them to missons. The giant battles are pretty linear, and the infamous time it takes to free roam and do what you want. Other than that, the games is awesome. There are so many things to do, and the areas are vibrant with wildlife or fighting with the red coats and even patriots. Getting the deluxe edition on a sale was totally worth it. The muliplayer is also pretty awesome.
