So I finished the game and sadly this is the first Assassins Creed game I dont like and cannot recommend. Its still full of glitches, main character is stupid, naive and boring as hell, he doesnt even deserves carrying Assassins uniform. Opening chests and killing Enemies will sometimes driving you nuts, as well as climbing on trees, unlocking fast travel is also boring. Upgrading homestead is great however crafting is poorly made and could be improved. Getting new weapons and equipment seems pointless because you can pretty much finish the game with equipment you start with on the beginning of the game, and you dont really have to craft a single thing to beat the game. Sea battles are well made and I enjoy playing those mission, but you should probably consider buying AC black flag to experience real naval combat.I also tried to play Washington DLC but in the first 5 minutes I experienced two glitches and one game crash.This is Ubisoft first failure in AC series and probably not the last. Its a must own for Assassins creed fans if not for gameplay and Connor, then for modern Desmond story which comes to an end in this game.
