I wish that for this game I could only recommend this game partially, because its a really meh game. Compared to Ezio and Altair, Connor is the least likable main character. I found myself to be interested more interested in the first playable character, Kenway, than Connor. All of the optional side missions are exactly that, optional. I did not complete any of the side missions or climbing vantage points in this game because they are unneccesarry to this Assassins Creed game like previous editions.One of the only reasons to play this game is to complete the Desmond storyline, otherwise skip it.
