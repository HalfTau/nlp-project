Well, I have mixed feelings for this oneI love the missions about Connor, Haytham and Desmond, Homestead missions are entertaining, but the rest of the missions are hardto achieve full sync and mundaneThe new combat system, whoo, are satisfying and easy, make you forget classic method to assassinateWhich, leads to another problem, the new assassin Connors style leans more to warrior instead of assassin, and the simplistic style of American buildings encourage that, most of the building have only a body and roofHowever, other places like forest, prairie and snow coated ground are beautifulAww, one aspect of this game is that you have to run a long way to fetch missions, frustrating as hellOne new and surprising feature is naval combat, very fresh and exciting at first, then many repetitive missions ruined everything, although steering your own ship in various weather condition is a unique experienceWeridly, this game reminds me of Witcher 3, its still a good gameFor the DLC, at first I dont really like them because the story s based on fantasy and Conor gained super powers, but after finished playing it I got the picture, it s a vision of another possible timeline, also it was fun and packed with decent gameplay
