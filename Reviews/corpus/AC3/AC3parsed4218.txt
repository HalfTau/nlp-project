As a big fan of the Assassins Creed series since the first game, this  in my opinion  just improved on what already was a perfect game, yes there were and still are some bugs but I didnt experience as many as people has claimed there was. The setting for the campaign is good  really enjoyable, again with the Templars seemingly in control and the Assassins on their last legs, only for them to rise up as always and well, you can probably guess what happens. The multiplayer is fun  enjoyable also, but for me, nothing will beat Brotherhoods multiplayer. Apart from that, its a game I definitely recommend but then again so is the entire series.
