An amazing game that you can really tell took a while to make, I wasted a good 30 hours on beating this, and I can tell you that its worth the cost. You get to play as multiple characters through out the game and all of the perspectives are unique.Graphics  7/10Gameplay  8/10Story  9/10Sidenote I did buy this when it was on sale for 5 around 4
