I know its the cool thing to do to just write udontplay and leave it at that ...But yeah. Exactly that.Im in China for work. Again. What that means is that trying to play Assassins Creed III, a game I paid for, always goes through the exact same stages for me.1 Click play in Steam a storefront which doubles as DRM2 Wait for Uply to boot.3 Wait for uplay to realize Im in China.4 Contemplate writing a review promising to note when exactly Im done waiting and deciding to go through with it.5 Wait for the unavoidable, unskippable Uplay error oh here it is6 Tell it to skip why dont I have that option to begin with?7 Play.This tacks a solid 67 minutes onto game start each and every time.Is the game good?Maybe, but Ive had time to type all this up and it still hasnt booted. Oh. There we go.Who knows, maybe Ill change the damn rating later.
