After 70 hours i have finished the game and pretty much every content. How i felt at the end ? exhausted .... Connor and his storys are sooo much to explore this time that sometimes it starts to begin like going to work. Anyway is assassins creed 3 the best assassins creed ? I would say no. For europeans the whole american revolution story might be hard to get, nor is connor a character like ezio. The last emotional bit you need to get connected to the game is not there. Interesting to say Connors Father Haytham should have been put more in the foreground. He is the character i wanted to play in the game. The whole micromanagement stuff about hunting and earning money is better of course then in the last parts where the money just kept flowing not knowing where to spend it but do i really have to put in so much work in that ? Assassins Creed 3 has his place in the AC Universe but only as the resolution to Desmonds story.
