One of the most infuriating games Ive ever played.  Everything that was monotonous and irritating in the first two games is magnified here.  Hours of insulting, boring, handholding tutorials.  Long scenes where you wander around doing nothing, listening to people talk.  The story, which was always absurd, has collapsed in on its own stupidity.  If you know about or care about anything related to American history, logic, narrative cohesion, or free will, this game will drive you insane.  This is the first game in more than a decade to actually make me rage quit while shouting at the screen in rage.  The other one was Mario Kart.This game was so bad I have sworn off Ubisoft forever.  Now, if I see their logo on a game, no matter what it is, I just walk away.
