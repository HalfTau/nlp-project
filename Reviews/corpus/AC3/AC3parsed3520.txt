The game has a very good story.The main mission changed my thought about the Templar and the game have a huge side mission with many interesting story. Most of the glitch have been fixed since my last played.I must admit some part of the game are unnecessary like convoy etc and a very complicated crafting system  but aside from that everything is enjoyable.Got deluxe when it on sale at 10 and it worth every penny .The Main Theme soundtrack in one of the best i ever heard.
