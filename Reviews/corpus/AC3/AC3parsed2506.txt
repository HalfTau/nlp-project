This game has only slightly improved in some areas over AC2, the graphics are better and the mechanics have been tweaked. Unfortunately the game takes an interesting setting and draws it out enough to become tedious. The story has an interesting concept but I dislike how slow things move.The character development and currency system also feel like a step back, making money through the settlement system feels overly complicated and slow. I also had issues with the weapon system and never felt the need to purchase new ones.Still an enjoyable game but not the leap forward that the second game was.
