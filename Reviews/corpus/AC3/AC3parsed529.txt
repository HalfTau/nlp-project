Assassins Creed Ill   A continuation of the Assassins Creed saga that threads through the turbulent flagwaving of the War of Independence. The vengeful Native American, Ratonhnhakton Connor carves a bloody path to personal vindication, stopping off at the usual historical tourist spots that gives the franchise its flavour.VisualsA photorealistic depiction of North Americas changing face really shines in AC3. The variety of environments does the game credit with changing seasons and day cycles adding atmosphere and character.Animations have a few traditional Ubisoft bugs but theres a continued cinematic quality to scripted scenes. Still not a fan of ACs menus though.AudioStunning soundtrack, a highlight in the series for sure composed by Lorne Balfour. The blend of sweeping orchestral pieces, blaring brass and the emigrant folk stylings perfectly capture the period and sustain action set pieces.Brilliant voiceacting shines with an impressive dedication to the rarely heard language of Connors people.GameplayA leap forward in the franchises signature freerunning sees Connor moving through urban environments with familiar ease AND the rugged landscape of the American wild that conjures a feeling of skill that truly suits a Native American master assassin.Camera controls as always plague the game however.Crafting and collecting helps lengthen the game but border on laborious at later stages.Naval combat makes a triumphant debut in the series that inspires further development.WritingConnor lacks the depth or growth of his ancestor Ezio but channels wrath from scene to scene that starts as a blazing fire but soon gives way to a repetitive sizzle. His involvement in the bigger picture narrative feels sadly reluctant being a less than willing soldier in the great war between the shadowy factions.Supporting characters however display some great depth, namely Templar Grandmaster Haytham Kenway who continues to show that the Templars are far better written than the good guys.The appearance of significant historical figures feels contrived much if the time but kudos to writers Corey May and Matt Turner for not indulging too heavily in pandering to the unassailable image of George Washington by showing the darker side to the American hero.I really enjoyed the effort Ubisoft Montreal put into AC3 and while a weak ending and a less defined protagonist hold the writing back but the level design, new mechanics and frenetic setting help liven things up. The mere combination of the ropedart, forestrunning and the tomahawk executions made for a strong entry in the Assassin Creeds franchise.
