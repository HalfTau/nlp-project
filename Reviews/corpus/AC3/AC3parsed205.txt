Amazing game for its time  equally amazing bugs!This is not only an incredible AC game, its just an incredible game! There is so much to love here, but if you compare it with newer AC games, then it will most definitely fall short, so stop comparing older titles to newer ones allready.I had a complete blast playing this game, but i have to say, this is the most buggy game i have every played in my entire life. Most MMOs are not this buggy during alpha testing...I have have been really unlucky during the install, or something, but man it has sure been a frustrating playthrough.So, SUPER INSANELY BUGGY even though it is almost 6 years old!!!, but also very, very fun and good, so that should tell you something, the game is more fun than its myriad of bugs are frustrating.Not any gamebreaking bugs as far as i know in the main campaign, but in the DLC? Beware. During the first episode there is a gamebreaking bug, but the internet and most likely the forum here on steam are full of threads dedicated to the reigning workaround.So yes, i absolutely recommend it, for AC veterans and newbies alike.
