Haytham is classy as Hell!Connor is undoubtedly the best fighter in the Creed Franchise.Parkour is more fun than ever.The game is really beautifully designed.I find myself humming soundtracks from the game from time to time.But everything else was just frustrating.Admittedly though whenever i wanted to calm down id open up this game and parkour and fight for a while until im bettter.
