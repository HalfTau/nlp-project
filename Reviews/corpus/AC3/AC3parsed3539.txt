Stunning graphics and realism, great story and characters. However there are some downsides. For start, there is limited combat options compared to previous games, however there is the addition of fire arms which I really enjoyed. In previous games assassins could grab and kick and step etc. In this game you may only attack, block and shoot. Some of the weapons of other games have gone but there are some really cool new weapons. Overall it is a stunning desomond saga finale.
