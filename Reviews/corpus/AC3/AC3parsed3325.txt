While i found the main character Connor to be a very boring and bland character the game itself was fun to play. Experiencing AC gameplay within an American Revolution setting was pretty exciting and the world is large and interesting.There are quite a few annoying movement and climbing bugs that get annoying.Overall the story and setting was worth it for me to play it once, but i hope they seriously never revisit Connors story hes a very boring protagonist.
