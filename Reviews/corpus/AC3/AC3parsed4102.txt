7/10First things first If you enjoyed the STEALTH action of Assassins Creed 1,2,Brotherhood and Revelations, I would not play this game. It absolutely ruins the franchise in that regard. An assassin game with basically no stealth.The gameplay is fun otherwise. Free running is alwasys good, the fighting is still super easy, but at least the kill animations make it seem more complex. I prefer the controls from the first 4 games but its not that big of a change. There is hunting and naval missions. I didnt even realize there were naval sidemissions until the end of the game, I actually never did any of them, because I played this game to be an assassin, lurking in the shadows, killing only specific targets.... not blasting other ships with cannonfire or leading revolutionary war armies.The story is coolish. I always like alternate history story concepts, but I never really felt engaged in it. I did not feel attached to the main characters at all, which was the biggest dissapointment since Ezio was the effing man! I still enjoyed Desmond and the gang. But I wasnt really a fan of where that story went either.Basically if you want to play an action game with a decent story then you can play this, you will likely enjoy it. But if you were hoping to play a stealth based game with a moving storyline like the first 4 games then you will be dissapointed as I was.I am not recommending this game even though I gave it a 7, because it is not stealth action, and I was lead to expect that from the franchise. I still gave it a 7 though, because as a standalone game, with no expectations on gameplay you will likely find it an entertaining action experience.
