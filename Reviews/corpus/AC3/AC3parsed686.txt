So far I like the game a lot, but it seems to crash whenever it tries to pull data from some server. For instance, in the skills menu Pressing Y for more experience  which I assume takes you to some inapp purchase. The first crash happened at the end of the first mission with the male character. Theres a assessment screen of some sort, and it crashed there.Since the game doesnt want to be played, I dont really know how much more effort Ill bother with putting into this.
