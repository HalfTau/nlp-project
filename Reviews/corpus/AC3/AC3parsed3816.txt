Terrible and repetitive game mechanics. This game is riddled with bugs and is even more crippled by the Ubisoft uPlay client. Ive given up on finishing it because it is no longer worth it to me. Error after error, force close after force close. The game starts out quite well, but after several chapters it becomes apparent how haphazardly the story is thrown together. The inconsistincies in the fighting and stealth leave me irritated and bored. I would not recommend this game.
