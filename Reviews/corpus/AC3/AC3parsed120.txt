This AC is diferent. Period. Its still fun, it added several new features to its gameplay, but i gotta be honest with yall this is, so far, my least favourite Assassins Creed. The story is all over the place! I mean the plot is really poor, and on top of that its seems very forced and we never really seem to connect with the main character.Good graphics, but some glitches.
