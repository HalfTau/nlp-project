Yes please.This is the best Assassins Creed game in the franchise. Now, dont get me wrong, there are several flaws, but they are easily outnumbered by the positives.Early on, you play as Haytham, the master of the templars, and also Connors father. This is an ingenius way to become familiar with the games controls and mechanics as well as being comfortably settled in with the plot. You cant help but get attached to Haytham and the Templar Order at first, but then you are transferred to the control of Conner as a young child, and to keep away from spoilers, the change is masterfully emotional, and perfectly executed. You immediately gain an emotional bond with Connor  and it continues as you control him as he grows into a man. The game leads you to find and kill the men responsible for the act, and every single assassination brings the plot in an interesting and thought provoking direction. Excellent Revolutionary Boston storytelling.Now, if the game were to take place only in the past, the game would be an easy 10/10. But the modern time excerpts are just aweful.Work in Progress.
