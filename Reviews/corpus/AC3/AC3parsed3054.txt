many people say that this game is not as good as some of the other assassins creed games well im here to tell you they were wrong. in my opinion this is one othe the best assassins creeds to date it has smooth controls, a load of badass assassin weapons and tools, a load of different costumes and some of the best side quests i have seen in an open world. the only beef i have to pick with this game is conners character and the characters voice acting it was shallow and bland with only one emotion so it was off putting sometimes. so overall an awesome game fully reccomend it
