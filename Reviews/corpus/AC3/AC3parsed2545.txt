I could take or leave the American based plot but I love the native american influences and the setting, free running on trees in forests as well as just rooftops. Im not sure why I like this AC most when others like it least, or why I like Connor when a lot dont. Maybe its just that its different from the rest, and that he isnt the usual charming type but it feels more honest that way.
