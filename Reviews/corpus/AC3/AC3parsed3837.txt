I mean, I really wanted this game to be better than the two before it. But having introduced so many game mechanics as they did, the devs never even bothered to make any of them matter in the slightest. The only rewards you get for finishing dull quests of type X that are no different from the dull quests of type Y in the slightest is that you get an achievement, thats not even showing on Steam.Instead of trying to make side quests more interesting, they simply lumped various quest lines as some roadbumps for the necessary and at least somewhat more entertaining homestead village quest line. I was sitting on the recepy for a cool sword for 8 memory sequences out of 12, because it required a certain level of villagers to craft it, and those levels could only be raised after certain quests, and the quests only appeared after certain sequences, and you see how you started yawning even from reading about it...So, overall, I think the games not good when the most joyful part about it is reading the database entries with historical excerpts...
