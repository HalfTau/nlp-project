This game is a really good one, with a long story line and nice graphics, however, i do highly suggest that you play the Ezio triolgy first AC2, AC Brotherhood, AC Revelations because the plot of those three games are directly linked to that of this one. so if you havent played the triolgy, then you might be a bit confused at the start.
