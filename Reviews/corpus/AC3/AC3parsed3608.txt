A very addictive game, although the pc port can be very bad, with many glitches some even breaking up the gameplay. I did feel slightly disappointed with this assassins creed with it being the weakest in the series. That being said it was still incredibly fun and a pretty good game. I dont regret buyinh it! I did get it on sale for 10 though!
