There are a lot of positive factors in AC3 that you can work with A large, wellcrafted world openworld content smooth combat system great story related to the American Revolution Naval combat. All of this provides a great deal of potential for this game, but theres not enough refinement in the whole package to make this game great.The world is sometimes seemingly too big with not enough to do. You travel very large distances toward your next main objective marker between missions, only because you havent discovered the fast travel point yet. The wilderness looks really nice, and thats great, but theres very little to do in it. The openworld content is almost exclusively put in the city settings, but they impact your character and story in no significant way. Its basically all the bad about openworld, and none of the good.The combat and naval battles are quite good. However, there simply isnt enough of either unless you go out of your way to make it happen. The whole game feels like you move from point A to point B or attack X groups of enemies until you trigger the next cutscene to advance the story. But even the story becomes tarnished because it keeps breaking immersion by going back to the whole overarching presentday story.Assassins Creed 3 is a deeply flawed game that, despite its shortcomings, still manages to be a good experience.6.5/10 Okay to Good
