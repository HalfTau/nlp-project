Great game, this is very fun and the open world is pretty cool, but i wish there was customization and the story line is very week towards the end. For some reason this game only get 4060fps ultra on an R9 270 and when the anti aliasing is maxed out, it glitches the picture. Like all ubisoft ports, excluding Far Cry 3, badly optimized. Overall 7.5/10
