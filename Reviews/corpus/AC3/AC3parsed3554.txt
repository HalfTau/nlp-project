I enjoyed the previous AC games but this one has been difficult to get attached to. For starters it has far too many cut scenes for my liking. Yes, I suppose a rich and deep story is essential to these kind of games nowadays but the fun of the previous games was in the exploration. I am hours into it and it feels like Im on a rail. Essentially  attractive but a bit of a yawn.
