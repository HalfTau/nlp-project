Assassins Creed III is a monument to everything you SHOULDNT do in a video game, especially the third entry in a highprofile series. Its so foolishly ambitious that it trips over ever flaw it could possibly have, not stumbling, but falling down a flight of gamebreaking glitches, buggy mechanics, shoehorned features, and the smallest focus on actual assassinations in the entire series.I do have to give it credit though, the story they went for was a good idea. Setting up Haytham as the main character only to bait and switch him is clever. The issue was making an interesting character out of Conor, which they downright failed to do. Conor never seems to change gears throughout the entireity of the story, helped by mediocre voicework.4 times I had to restart the game due to glitches, either being unable to complete a mission or due to the world disappearing around me. Not to mention crashes I encountered.In all honesty, just skip this game and go straight to 4. If youre really interested in the story, its available by Wikipedia or in cutscene form on Youtube. The game itself is not worth the time of day. I gave up on the game after I realized I was still going through what was essentially tutorials 8 hours into the game.
