A bloated mess of a game that tries to cram in too many collectibles, systems and convoluted menus, with a bland and uninteresting protagonist and a story that tries to tie itself into so many of that eras historical events that it becomes an illogical, incoherent mess, with an ending that fizzles out to nothing.On the plus side, the sea battles are excellent and definitely the highlight of the game, but at this point youd be better grabbing AC4 instead, which by most accounts is a vastly superior experience.
