Graphics and some new mechanics such as the new combat mechanics are the only things I actually enjoyed about AC3.The story is quite boring, as is the main character. Missions can be a little confusing, specially if youre going for full sync.Overall it is an OK game. not nearly as good as AC2 or Revelations. I only recommend it if you want to follow the main plot like myself.
