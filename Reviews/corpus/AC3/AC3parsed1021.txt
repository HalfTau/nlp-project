Great game if you get it on a sale. The gameplay is great and it also introduced the ship battles that most people liked so much in Assassins creed Black Flag. For some reason people keep saying that the 3rd game is what made Assassins Creed bad but overall it is still good. The other AC games Ive played were on console and this was the only one on PC and I can say that sometimes there are bugs but very minor. The only real bad thing about this game is thaf you have to get Uplay.Now to the story. It starts off as a bit boring but gets good once you move further into the game. Overall this is a great game that can make you happy while playing it.ProsGreat gameplayNormal story continued from the first 2Introduced ship battlesConsSometimes youll encounter a bug sometimes you dont.Uplay.
