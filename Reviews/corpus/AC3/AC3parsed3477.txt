is a new format again but is improved apon greatly in black flag. storyline was not bad but didnt really like connor. He is better character in the dlc though. there is a lack of flow when free running in trees and the lack of a parachute disapointed me as there are some great potential jumps. overall the game was enjoyable and acted more as a filler in the desmond storyline than a game that follows his ancestor.
