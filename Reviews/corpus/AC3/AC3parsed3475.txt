The first game I ever bought on steam, I only learned in WatchDogs to NEVER PREORDER VIDEO GAMES.promised a lot,The game was revolutionary for its time, when looking back, the game disappoints me.In terms of gameplay. The game just adds so much, of course the gameplay is not polished, but it offered so much activities. so yes, gameplay is funIn terms of plotline, the modern plotline is better than Connors. means that the plotline sucksIn terms of graphics, all I can say is that the terrain are fantastic, but the Npcs, are not.
