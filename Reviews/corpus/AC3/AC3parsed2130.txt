This is probably the weakest entry in the Assassins Creed series. The setting is boring, there is less assassinations and the game is just a bit bland and generic. There is nothing which really stands out nor is there any mechanics or reasons to want to play it to the very end as the story isnt as interesting or contextual as the previous games in the series. Also, I really despise how the map works as it is confusing and poorly explained so I got lost frequently. Only purchase this if you are a diehard Assassins Creed fan. If you want the best game in the series then purchase Assassins Creed 2. The only thing that is really well done in this one is the graphics which are pretty stellar.
