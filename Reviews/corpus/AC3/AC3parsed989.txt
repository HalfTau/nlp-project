Ive never been a huge fan of Assassins Creed, I keep trying out the games to see how theyre going. I do not blame the developers or anything, I just dont think the style of game is for me. I will say that this game is fun to play, and is absolutely beautiful! I kept taking screenshots to show off because of how great it looked.As far as the series goes, this was a good addition to it and I think its one that all fans should play. The main character was a bit annoying as he kept complaining, but to be fair he did have a good reason no spoilers. Honestly, thats my only gripe with this game, and it was pretty easy to get past that.I cant remember a ton about this game, but I do remember having a pretty good time with it. If youre a fan of the series and havent played this one yet, definitely pick it up.
