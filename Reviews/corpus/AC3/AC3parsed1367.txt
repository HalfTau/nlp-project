Havent really caught on the story beacuse I and many other may have or have had some graphical issues with the game.IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SUPPORTED VIDEO CARD, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I have a AMD Radeon R9 280X 3GB and it should run atleast high graphics. BUT NO. It runs about 3045 fps when Im in the bigger cities like New York. CHECK THE REQUIREMENTS PPL! CHECK THEM. P.S.  If you have any solutions to these graphical problems please help. Ive tried mostly everything. Even lowering my graphics to very low and still the fps is the same. vSync doesnt affect anything. Please fix this Ubisoft!!!!
