Jeez. Im going through the whole series and... First Creed was nice, little boring but quite OK. II was quite nice along with all the expansions but III.... its crap at best. Its boring. Controls are stupid More than quite a few times I ended up jumping in front of enemies while I wanted to stay hidden, climbing trees is just ridiculous. Story is nice but the game is unplayable. Im going to remove it at about 22 into the game seems like it stopped progressing at about 20 and maybe Ill be back when Im bored with other titles. Also, in previous installments additional features were easy to do along the way repairing shops, buying art etc but in III? Stupid. Really hate this game.
