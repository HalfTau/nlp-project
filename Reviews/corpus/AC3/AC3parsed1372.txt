I love Assassins Creed saga, but uPlay makes me to NOT PLAY AT ALL.The Steam  uPlay  Game system is rubbish, and this stupid uPlay is ALWAYS updating!! !The only way you can play Assassins Creed is DOWNLOADING IT PIRATE!Im like one hour waiting for the uPlay to finish the goddamned update, and its less than in a half!When finally the update ends, I cant connect with my account, and ALWAYS says that it couldnt connect to the uPlay servers.Im sick and tired of trying to play my favourite game and go to sleep raged and feeling regret of paying for your products, when in THE BAY are for free and running better than the originals.For me, I go to look for a NOCD crack to play my ORIGINALLY PAYED game.Thank you Ubisoft
