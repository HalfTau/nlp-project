Overall, ACIII is a decent addition to the series, although it still carries over some of the same frustrations that were present in previous installments. The chief offender is still the controls as Connor will often jump in completely ridiculous directions either to his death or inconvenient locations, especially during chase sequences which are some of the most annoying portions of the game. The story did have a couple interesting twists, but Connor is so angsty and annoying it ruins some of the impact. Its not a bad game by any means, but its also not a great one.
