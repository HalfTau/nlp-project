Although Ive only played this game for a limited amount of time, it feels like it is a chore to play.  Im more focused into the singleplayer aspect of the game, so nothing will include multiplayer gameplay.Too many escort mission so far. Theyve removed the auto following during these parts from the previous games, so you have to hold hands with whichever boring character is rambling to you.  Way too many cut scenes, I felt like at least 40 of my game has been cutscenes.  Synch points on top of buildings, specifically churches, are a farce, showing your hero perfectly balanced on a tip of a cross with your second food on a invisible plane.Some of the early missions are pretty flawed. An example of this is the freeing the slaves and killing the slave trader mission. Right at the beginning you have to ambush the convoy, and the game encourages you to do so by shooting from a rooftop. Doing this draws all  the agro from the 13 enemies to you,guns blazing, giving you the option to hide in cover or go down and fight. If you decide to hide, your TWO assassins obliterate them in under 30 seconds. Then thats followed by another escort thank god its automated where all you have to do is press T to get your assassins to clear patrols.Its just boring! These escort missions make the game feel linear. Pretty disappointing.
