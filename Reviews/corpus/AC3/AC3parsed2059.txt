Assassins Creed III feels like opening a box the size of a fridge on Christmas morning and finding a Furby inside.  As weird as that analogy is, I think thats the best way to describe the shift in the storytelling.  Whereas Ezio was rather likable, Conner is rather dull.  The American Revolution setting sounded promising at first, but its execution felt very underwhelming, and as nice as it was to be able to climb trees, I find that I preferred Renaissance era Europe as my jungle gym.Still, if this games on sale, its not a bad buy.  The boat sections are fun which Ubisoft certainly picked up on for Black Flag, and the gameplay just about as satisfying as any of the other games in the series.  Honestly though, I find myself a little bored after playing through the last three in the series if you want a great game, play those, and then feel free to skip to Black flag because you arent missing anything here.
