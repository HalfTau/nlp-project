So I will admit, this game is a year or two old and Im just a tad late to the party. Despite that, this game still kicks The storyline was the biggest plot twist at the beginning I was about to throw my keyboard across my room. But then again, thats just me.To sum it all up, if you havent played this game, its never too late to get it. Srs. Get it if you havent.
