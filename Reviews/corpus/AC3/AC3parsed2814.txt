A very bad Assassins Creed game. This game is nearly unplayable due to bad camera angles and trees blocking your view. the horse riding makes missions almost unbeatable as the horses will not get within 3 feet of a rock, stump nor tree, and comes to a dead stop if near any impedament. Requires UPlay launcher. Desmond missions dont really advance the plot in any maningful way. as a fan of fun i can not rec this game to anyone, even the setting is boring.
