Forced use of UPlay? Check. Counterintuitive consolecentered controls? Check. Constant crashes? Check. Even from the standpoint of core gameplay, missions are long and tedious with no way to save progress until poorlyset checkpoints. If you are a fan of the series go ahead and pick it up, but AC3 is a console port at its best, and tedious at its worst. You can and will be disappointed.
