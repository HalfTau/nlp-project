A dissapointment in the Assassins Creed saga, an incredible amount of bugs and glitches. Biggest issue is not receiving a standard income from missions, only by hunting  selling and crafting  selling after doing nearly worthless and buggy side missions. A credit to the naval battles, small combat techniques and scenic gameplay made me continue and finish the story. Although a poor attempt at continuing the back story  left me confused when I needed answers.
