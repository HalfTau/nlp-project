Wow. No wonder I skipped this One. WORST addition to the series. Actually it should be called a Series of Unfortunate Quicktime Events. Doesnt come close to any of the other AC games in terms of...well...being even remotely interesting. Drab locales, BARELY any mission play time You just keep jumping from cinematic to cinematic without doing literally anything in between at times and oh god why did they make this.
