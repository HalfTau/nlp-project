Loved this game on the 360. Now since the release of the XboxOne ive moved back to my PC fulltime though always came back for RTS style games that the 360 couldnt do.One of the first titles ive dived into was this since moving back and its much better than the 360 Version. Apart from the fact came with all the DLC, looks prettier and plays smoother when the action really gets going.
