Really tried to like this one, but the game simple didnt gave a .Prettier graphics compared to its predecessors plus naval fights are the only good thing that I foud good on this game everything else was really shallow and dull.I  just didnt even care to go stealth as It simple wasnt worth, just jump on your enemies and kill everything.Side missions were boring and felt cheap  made, brawlers missions, assasination missions, delivery missions, courier missions, felt like your generic MMO quests of the likes of WOW.Homestead and crafting was a huge t that shouldnt even exist, crafting in special since it was so terribly made but you MUST DO IT IN ORDER TO UNLOCK UPGRADES FOR CONNOR like more pockets to carry bullets, poison darts, etc, but to do them you ned to do the homestead missions with mostly of them were really boring, the really fun thing IS THAT THE GAME DOEST TELL YOU ABOUT THAT.I just discovered that I had to upgrade my stuffs via crafting when I was scroling there, caravans are your main source of income but its just more proftable to send away a bunch of raw materials like pelts then crafting itens to sell them awayseriously why the  the price keep rising after every succefull crafting this is totally retard IMo as it cut away your profts even more.The background was now in colonial america, and I already expect the towns to be simple and mostly dull overall, but the frontier was a trully beatiful and giant map that the game unfortunatly doesnt give you a lot to do there besides collectiong more feather and chest and more dull misssionshunting missions now instead of kill/beat this guy we have a kill this animal mission sigh.BUT HEY THERES A REVOLUTION GOING ON THERE, we are testimony the birth of USA so plot should be awesome right? But no it inst, actually this is the most boring ever plot created for the game not only everything felt shallow and emotionless but the characters were also so unispiring, they should just stick with Haytham the whole game which was the only great but underdeveloped character on the game, the main character Connor is far from being good as Altair or Ezio, and on top of that the ending both in Animus and out Animus were tottally crapsryously Ubi why you had to  everything up so bad this time.On top of everything said before the game is still full of glitchs and bugslike map icons disappearing, soldiers appearing right at your front and some of them attacking you without any reason at all and crashing are rather seldom.To Sum up the game was a huge disappointment, especially about the plot for me, I fell like i had to push my self to finish the game, still tried to go for that 100 sync but gave up because Had to do a lot of more dull quest and collecting more items crap. Buy it and try out if you are a fan of the series, otherwise skip this one.
