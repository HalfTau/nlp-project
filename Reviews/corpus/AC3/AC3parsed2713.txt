Another addition to the AC series and another set of problems. Which is really what this series has become.Assassins Creed III offers players the same usual triedandtrue method of freerunning, quick combat, and strategic third person platforming that all the other entries in the series have offered up til now but, like its predecessors, also brings with it a myriad of bugs, problems, and unpolished features.As usual, AC is never well ported to the PC, so the first thing to understand about this game is that its not meant to be played on this platform. At least not if you want to enjoy it without frequently running into bugs, errors, and other issues.The second thing to understand is that if youve played AC before and its safe to assume you have if youre playing the 3rd then youre not going to get much in the way of new. Ubisoft saw fit to add some new features and the ones that theyve added are admittedly somewhat nifty. But the bulk of the game rests on what weve been doing for the last 4 iterations in the series.Story is good, but not great. There isnt much more to be said for it. It is begins picking up after a cliffhanger and ends on a cliffhanger. Everything inbetween is just getting from one to the other.Atmosphere is decent. I enjoyed the frontier of freshly colonized North America but deeply missed the mosques, temples, and spectacular history that filled the other titles.All in all, AC III isnt a BAD game, and it definitely isnt a GREAT game. Its simply an AVERAGE game. The only problem with that is that AC III is a AAA title. Its not unreasonable to expect a great game. And yet...here we are.TLDR  Good, but not great. Lots of bugs and minor issues tend to ruin the game.
