AC3 is one of my favourite AC games despite being other peoples least favourite. The story line, map and overall feel of the game all help to make the gameplay experience one of my favourites. Pros  Beautiful map to explore. Nice range of weapons to use and choose from Story line is very good Open world continues to offer gameplay even after the main story is completed with side missions and collectibles. Cons  Multiplayer is not that interesting and gets boring after a few matches. The AI are a typical stupid Assassinss Creed feature where hiding in a bush or on a bench will make you completely invisible.
