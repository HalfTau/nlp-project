Okay, heres the thing. I want to enjoy this game. I really liked brotherhood and revelations so I kinda held high hopes for this. But it is not what I wanted. I mean, sure, the gameplay can be fun sometimes, especially when you enter a killing spree but it can be tiring to constantly trying to hide from dozens of guards that exist in every corner. Hell, Connor can take all of them but Im a stealth player. And having dozens of guards on my trail because one of them looked at me for too long is tiring.But, that wasnt my main problem with it. My main problem was that I wasnt immersed in it as I thought Id be. The tree parkour wasnt as good as I thought and I ended up unable to climb a tree because of my positioning several times. The story was meh, cause the setting doesnt offer much. Boston aint as immersive as Rome. The consumable items and weapons were pretty much useless why use a smoke bomb when there are three guards around every corner ? Why use a rope dart when there arent guards that the rope dart can be used on without triggering an alarm ?. Connor himself was kinda nice but I found myself hoping that I could play with haytham more, idk, he seems better as a character. The manor cant be compared to the auditore villa, it kinda sucks. The hunting and the naval battles were awesome af, the combat system was nice and Id buy a DLC that would offer more large scale battles.In general, this was a mediocre game but I can see why people enjoy it. It has some nice elements in it and it IS an assassins creed game with some modern features. So yeah, I wouldnt really suggest it to players not experienced with the series. But for a regular AC player, its a pretty good game. To conclude, it is enjoyable but not as good as youll find yourself hoping it was. 6/10Ps. The sound desynchronizes with the animations and it is very irritating. Although that is probably a problem for old computers like mine.
