Ok so I dont even know where to start with this mess. Ill start with the good. 90 of combat is great, and the ship battles are fantastic. Ship battles in Assassins Creed... what? You heard me, the naval missions are the best missions. Now onto the bad. That 10 of fights when youre near something like a building, a person, an animal, suck. Try and ride a horse through the woods? Good luck not getting caught on just about every little glitch that will snag you. You want to pick lock on a check, how about 4 times for the same chest, and when you finally open it how about you drop your main weapon. The story is choppy, buggy, full of plot holes, and leaves you saying WHAT? 2/10 Wouldnt wish on my enemy.
