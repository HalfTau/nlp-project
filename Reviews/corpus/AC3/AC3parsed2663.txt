I fully recommend this game.It is fun, it deviates a bit from the standard city environments to the intresting American frontier.Connor is a great assassin to play as  a lone wolf, very naive and conflicted.The upgrade system is implemented in form of a homestead construction  you must gather various tradesmen and help them upgrade their home and in return they craft items for you that upgrade your combat abilities.The naval combat is amazing.Story is great, music is awesome.Not even the uPlay makes a lot of trouble once you are past the initial registration process.
