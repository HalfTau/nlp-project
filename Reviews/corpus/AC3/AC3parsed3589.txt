The story about an assassin during the british colonies war of independece is quite interesting and can not be found often in games like Zombies, World War II or Medevil based games. The game itself is pretty amazing. A huge world to explore, many sidequests, an easy to learn combat system and a crafting system that gives you the cherry you are looking for on the whipped cream of your ice cream.
