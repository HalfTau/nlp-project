Has to be by far the worst AC game ive ever played ive played them all.It feels so rubbish, so linear not a little bit of freedom at all. Also the way your character runs and bumps into everything and everyone is so , its worse then previous AC games. Also when youre riding your horse in the forest it just bumps into every little rock, instantly stops running.Game is very boring and dull, bad story. Im glad i bought it during a big discount but its still not worth it.. maybe if its free  2 play
