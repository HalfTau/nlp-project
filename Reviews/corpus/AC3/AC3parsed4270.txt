This game is absolute I hate it. I would rather have someone take aon my hard drive than reinstall this pile of boring slurage. Make sure youre not playing on an expensive keyboard because the E button will be all warn away before you even get to the free roam. Seriously, at the start of the game, you walk 5 steps and then there is a longwinded and awkward cutscene, then a loading screen, then 5 more steps before a cutscene. SERIOUSLY. It took about  an hour to get to the first nonscriped kill because of all the cutscenes, AND I WAS SKIPPING THE CUTSCENES. Combat is easy, push E to counter and then click. Repeat until everything is dead. this game. I have never hated a game so much. I would rather shove a vibrating cactus into eyesocket  than have a single atom of data that contributes to this painful anal prolapse of a game resting in my computer. This game is so goddamned boring. You can recreate theCred 3 experience by going up and then straight back down the evevators at your local John Lewis, walk a few steps and then stand aroud for the ride. This game is not fun in any respect. Remember the cool trailer where Connor dives into a pile of redcoats and beats tem to death with a tomahawk. That doesnt happen, well at least not within the first 5 hours of the game, instead get ready for 5 hours of slow NPC escorts, easy stealth missions, fetch quests and tree climing that REQUIRES YOU TO HOLD DOWN 1 ING BUTTON BECAUSE IF YOU PUSHED ANY MORE BUTTONS IT WOULD ALMOST COUNT AS GAMEPLAY!2 stars
