Certainly a step back from the rest of the series. The story is actually very compelling to a degree. But the gameplay is just not there for me. Still many flaws in movement and the game just felt hollow. Liberating towns from the British is pointless because neither faction likes you so it doesnt help. It forces you to take things slower because anything you do now is suspicious and could cause a big fight. And building a homestead is pretty pointless. I stuck to the main story, and made it through the entire game only changing my costume. Even if you are the type of gamer that likes to upgrade everything, its all for nothing. Upgrades to your ship cost a fortune and its a pointless upgrade. I did every mission with my ship the first time with 0 upgrades. They made it a puzzle just to do trivial things as well.Story aside, I was pretty dissapointed with the game itself. I did feel like I was helping the fight and being a sneaky rebel but it wasnt all that fun to do.. And the final mission was one of the WORST sequences Ive ever seen in all my years of gaming. At one point I considered just quitting and uninstalling because it was so frustrating. We shall see what AC4 brings to the table.
