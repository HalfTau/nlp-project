So, here we are with another of the Assassins Creed games in the series where you pick Demonds story where it was left in Assassins CreedRevelations and you relive the memories of Connor, an assassin from North America living the events of the American Revolution.Some nice features were added to this game, lets start with The combat system was simplified and getting hold to the combat mechanics is something you will do in a very short period time as it is kinda simple to beat like 15 guys without getting hit Parkour and controls overall feel was way more improved for this one as you can run in trees as well as buildings pretty much by pressing one button moving around is much simple and faster now Exploration it was way more improved as you have like 4 huge maps to explore and if you are in for collectibles and exploring everything, you will find spending a bunch of time running around and exploring the surroundings and the wild life in it yes, there are animals around this time and much more... I could keep going, but dont want to spoil it for you...Story wise the game gives you the opportunity to play more as Desmond, you will do some missions with him and as far as playing with Connor, unlike with the other two Assassins Ezio and Altair he is a weird and not as interesting character you might think, or at least thats what I thought while playing it.The music and the soundtrack overall is quite good, even though when they are like improved versions of some of the songs from previous games.Multiplayer mode is pretty good compared to the other versions of the game as it keeps the modes from the previous and add some more to it. Matchmaking is fairly quick and you will find yourself playing without of waiting. Almost if not all of the modes reward your play style rather than the number of kills or deaths you have, in other words the sneakier you are, the better score you will get.While this game has a lot of improvements over the previous installments it is poorly optimized for PC and even if you have the latest hardware you will find your computer struggling to get stable FPS in some portions of the game. Of course, there are quite a few of workaround solutions to have the game as playable but, among all the possible solutions you need to find the one for your needs strangely enough the performance issue is mainly in the Single player portion of the game as the multiplayer runs smoothly.Overall, I had a blast while playing both the single and multiplayer modes, if you like the Assassins Creed series, this is going to be a good game for you, so if you dont have it yet... well, I dont know what are you waiting for? get that hidden blade ready and get it now...
