I loved this game on the xbox and couldnt wait to play it when it went on sale for 4.99 USD, I was so excited to play this game with my new gaming rig that easily runs BF3 at Ultra in 1080p at an average of 155 fps. I wanted to see what fps i would get on this game... I have been getting around 20 fps AVERAGE. This game is far beyond broken as is any Assassins Creed game for the PC. I gave up playing the game on my PC after logging around 20 hours. IF YOU HAVE ANY GRAPHICS CARD THAT IS NEWER THAN THE RECCOMENDED GRAPHICS CARD YOU WILL GET SY FPS.
