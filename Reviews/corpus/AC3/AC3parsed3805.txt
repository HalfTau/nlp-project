Look first off. It is Assassins Creed and just like the previous the basis of the game is pretty good.The one problem with this one is is that its far too rushed which causes a lot bugs and popin/out problems.I was walking on my horse through the streets of new york and saw people dissapearing  and appearing around 100 meters in front of me. Thats far too close.The Graphical and quests bugs do not really help either as far as im concerned
