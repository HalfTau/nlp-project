this game is a complete mess from top to bottom.nothing feels right, nothing feels polished or elegant. a textbook example of too many cooks 900 cooks across many different resturants to be exact. even the basic movement and gameplay feels clunky. and christ, dont even get me started on how guns work hint THEY DONT AT ALLthe story is somewhat interesting but even that dies the death of a thousand cuts when connor is shoehorned into Literally Every Noteworthy Moment in early american history.i cannot tell you why i played this game for 100 hours. i dont understand it myself. for every moment i found myself having fun, there was an hour of boredom and moments where i just left the game running and went to do something else did you know the entire run of transformers is on netflix instead. i looked forward to the game ending just so i never had to play it ever again.the ONLY justification for this purchase is if you are an insane completionist like me and want to see how the story pans out.ill save you the time, it ends with a bunch of twists and then a wet fart of an ending.dont play this.
