Loved it, really, really loved it. You get to hunt wildlife and craft things such as bags to store items and such with the animal skins, you get to shoot a bow, you set traps and snare to catch wildlife, and yes, other games give you that, but they made a good mix in this one. You explore the land during the homesteading of some parts of the US, get a highly cleaned up glimpse of what life used to be back then and what things were important to early settlers. You get to experience a lof of wildlife interaction, ride horses whistle for horses and they magically appear  I like that. You can fast travel but youll find yourself taking the horse most of the time. If you see wolves, find the nearest tree and climb it, seriously, the fight mechanics when you get attacked by a wolf are horrible, they are similar to how they did it in one of the Prince of Persia games thanks Ubisoft where you have to time your attack to the flashing on the screen, well, they took that crap and added different buttons / keys that you have to press at different moments to push away a wolf that has attacked you. Seriously, go up a tree, take it/them usually in pack 10/10 for realism out with your bow.You get to sail a largeish ship sort of a preview to Black Flag, which is nice. There are many references to historical events, depicted with you in the middle of them spoiler alert for example you walk up to a group of soldiers and hear the dont shoot until you see the whites of their eyes speach being given. Overall very well made game, great experience, def recommended, if you can grab it at a sale, even better.
