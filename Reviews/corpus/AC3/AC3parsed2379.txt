Oh, you thought unity was bad? You casual! This game is the WORST game Ive ever played. I have to restart nearly every mission because they always glitch out out me. Ive had to glitch JUST TO PROGRESS in the game. Thats basic level stuff! If ubisoft cant even make a game that functions as intended, how can you expect the gameplay and story to be any good? Speaking of which, the gameplay is cluky, due to the horrendus controls and glitches. The combat system is completely broken. The counter action doesnt work. Half the time, Ill have to replay an ENTIRE MEMORY just because it didnt save at the end, despite the fact that it saved MULTIPLE TIMES inbetween. Its repetitve, much like the first AC. The story itself is not engaging. Thats the whole point of the assassins creed series is the storyline, and this game manages to mess that up. At one point, you literally watch connor sleep. What a fun mission that was, watching him sleep.The only reason Im planning on finishing this game is so that I understand the overall story of the series. Other than that, I dont recommend anyone waste their time on this. Ive never done this with any other game ever, but Im so upset with this game that Im actually seeking a refund from ubisoft.
