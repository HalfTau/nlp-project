What a dour, dreary thing this game is. The lack of imagination on display here is utterly depressing. Some things1. Tailing missions. Again.2. Escape from a burning house. Again.3. Ancient precursor race plot. Again.4. Instafail enforced stealth missions. Again.5. Your character controls like an oil tanker. An oil tanker which is trying to climb trees.6. I finished the game without upgrading/buying any weapons, armour, ship, homestead, etc. The whole economy is completely superfluous!7. The worst fast travel system I have seen in a game yet!8. The protagonist is about as interesting as watching beige paint dry on a beige wall.Its almost as bad as Assassins Creed 1, I would avoid it if I were you.
