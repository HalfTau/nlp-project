I recommend this as the last Assassins Creed game I have played.  I looooved the first two Assassins Creed games, and I am a huge history nerd  not that these games are historically accurate, but seeing just some old culture and cities is beautiful. I loved the revolutionary setting, even if the main character of this wasnt nearly as cool as Ezio or Altair.  The game had some slow bits, especially in comparison to AC2, but it is worth a play through.
