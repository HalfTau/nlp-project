After frustration due to controls in the first 3 sequences, you even start to enjoy this game. And the further it gets, the better. With tasks ranging from simple freerunning to stearing a ship, you get to do pretty much everything imaginable for the period.Some tasks however are impossible and not worth your time, e.g., minigames. Unless you enjoy all those antique board games, there are more convenient and faster ways of getting money, like looting soldiers or selling the hunt.After getting acquinted with the game which might take quite a lot of time, if you havent played AC before, it becomes a world you want to immerse in again and again.With all the alternative history and action, this game is like a combination of Dan Browns novel, parkour and Skyrim
