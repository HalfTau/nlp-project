Finally beat it. Connors story was really interesting from the very beginning. Its is not as good as the previous ones, but still worth a try.Various things got changed, I dont like all of the changes, but can say that I like what they did to the climbing  its much easier to get everywhere, you no longer jump in random directions while doing so. Its simply more dynamic.One thing that bothers me is the fact that I didnt have to buy anything. I mean, in the previous AC games you had to buy armor to increase your health and stuff. In this one, there isnt such thing, so there is no reason to buy anything. You still can change the way you look by equiping different robes, but thats pretty much it.What about skinning and hunting? Its cool way to get extra money, but... It gets really boring after not more than 15 minutes of setting traps or simply jumping on the preys.Another part worth mentioning here is sailing. If you want to take a break from regular AC stuff, feel free to get onto a boat and plunder! Argh!
