This is the game that made me stop preordering.When it came out in 2012, I was a pretty big Assassins Creed fan, and couldnt wait to follow up on the Ezio trilogy. I preordered it months ahead of time, and got whatever the superdeluxe toptier version was. When I played it then I chugged through it because I liked the series, but I was so disappointed that I promised myself I wouldnt preorder a game ever again.Browsing through my library recently, it caught my eye and I decided to replay it, thinking It cant have been that bad...I was wrong. It is that bad.The first three hours of the game are incredibly slow. You dont play as the main character for that time, and the only reason is to shoehorn in a lame twist. That three hours of gameplay took me five hours real time because the game crashes a ton. I gave up after that.TLDR, Boring gameplay, boring story, crashes frequently, dont buy it. If you want a good Assassins Creed game, get AC2 or Brotherhood instead.
