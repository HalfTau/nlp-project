Buy at your own Risk. This game requiers UPlay to work otherwise youre not launching the game. As before, the games lock picking system still stinks and try not to let the game bug you if youre Character doesnt go into sneak mode when in the brush. Some stages are reptitive but once you get through you feel like the Hulk picking up Thors hammer. Not reallyAs side from stuff you cant avoid due to storyline prgression its very beautiful and realisticish. They actually stayed close to the traditions of the aborigonal people of that time struggling to stay connected to mother earth while still trying to stay out of the forginer way since there is nothing that they can do without having their life theatened.However the hero of the story is not the typical aborigonal person out there. So if you hate the main Character dont A.ssUMe all aborigonals are the same way. Far from. Actually my uncles show more stupidity then this murdurous hero of the story. But its not like they jump from tree to tree and onto roof tops to get to vantage point to grusomely take out your target. Keep in mind they coding of the soilders may have possibly been enhanced. That or I seriously lost my touch since AC 2 and AC 3 on the xbox 360.Not a bad as the Dead Island Ryder White DLC.screamer
