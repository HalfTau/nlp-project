Impressive Game, great Graphics,great Story about the American Civil War.This is definitely the Best Assassins Creed Game.Only that the Tutorial is over 5 Hours long sucks abit , but its not Boring only abit to long lolThe game length is Around 50 Hours if you do all Sidequest/hunting missions ect.So you get alot for your Money  If i could rate it , i would give this Game a 9/10.
