I wanted to like this game so bad. I didnt want to believe all the bad reviews so I tried hard to spite all the naysayers. However, 9 hours in I had to submit to reason. This game just sucks in every way possible. The story is sluggish, the gameplay is completely off, the controls have been changed again! why??? , the menu interface is a nightmare to navigate, the good additions from revelations and brotherhood have been taken away instead we get useless extensions within the game that no one needs Im an assassin not a hunter, yet you rarely get to assassinate anyone....or maybe I just didnt hold out long enough.I eventually gave up.  I may even have kept going if it werent for the stupid glitch in the ledger that froze the entire game. I just have zero motivation in finding a fix for that bug. I loved AC1Revelations and Im really gutted that AC3 is such a failure. Save the money and play another round of Brotherhood, Revelations or good old AC2.
