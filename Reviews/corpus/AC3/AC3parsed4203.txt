Unfortunately, the Assassins Creed series hit its peak with AC2/Brotherhood. AC3 is still alright, but just not really worth the time to play if youve already played the previous games. Also, the first several it took me 7 hours of the game are essentially a tutorial. By the time you finish it youre already burned out on the mechanics.
