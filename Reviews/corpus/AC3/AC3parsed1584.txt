I really love Assassins Creed franchise so this is not the first one I play. As for the story, I love the Ezios the most, but this one has something different in it, that makes it also a good one in the series. The story of revolution, names of those well known and great gameplay. I have to say   warmhearted recommendation for those who love history or need to learn it D , great story and entertaining gameplay.
