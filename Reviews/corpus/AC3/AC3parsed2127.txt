I dont often review games, however this game is an exception. Firstly just playing through the storyline is incredibly boring, I have absolutely no compassion for the characters, or their goals. Not to mention the ridiculously annoying cutscenes, playing this game is like watching a boring movie, the number of cutscenes quite frankly baffles me, they are simply boring and have no place in the game. Another thing that I must mention is the poor quality of the cities. In Assassins Creed 1 and 2, I felt as if the cities were actual cities, yet here they are like small towns, the buildings do not feel as if they belong in an urban city environment, and for that the cities are awful.The gameplay pains me even moreso, when Im not dealing with bugs such as losing control of Connor, falling through the world, or something involving the incredibly buggy NPCs then Im trying to wrap my head around why Ubisoft made the decisions it did with this game. For some reason unbeknownst to me Ubisoft thought it would be a good idea to combine the sprinting and parkour under one key, which is a real bother when youre running through the streets and find yourself jumping upon carts, up walls and other such places. To me it seems completely unnecessary to make this change. In Assassins Creed 2 you could purchase health vials, to be used in combat, another feature removed which was beneficial to gameplay.Another fault which Ive found with the game is the poor performance, this is one of the most irritating factors for me. I spent money on a relatively powerful computer, which has higher specs than what is recommended for the game, yet I still find that frame rate dropping, sometimes as low as 3035. Another port from Ubisoft which little effort has gone into.There are many more points that I would like to make as to why I dont recommend, I could write to no end about the faults, but unfortunately this review must end.
