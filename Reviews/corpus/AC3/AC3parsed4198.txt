While I am recommending this game there a couple of places were some improvement is needed one is the ridiculous repeditivity of climbing the same style elm tree over and over, second is the requirement to get the timing just perfect in some sequences to achieve perfect sync. The game definitely picks up in sequence five when homesteading gets added, especially if you are a fan of more openstyle gaming.
