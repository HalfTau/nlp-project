Buyer Beware! Do not waste your time on this, you need to create yet another online account UPlay and have yet more crapware UPlay  running on your machine just for the privilege of playing even the single player game that you paid for. This is no longer stated on the Steam Store page. Guess I should have known better than to give money to UbiSoft, but I trusted Steam. Oh and you also need to fool around with CD keys for the game as well as all the DLC. NEVER AGAIN!I forgot to mention that even if you uninstall the game, UPlay will remain. You have to go to Control Panel and remove that separately.
