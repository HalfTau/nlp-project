Good game but kinda disappointing of the ending which connor was left alone with no one with his side. Moreover i dont have buy any weapon because all of them useless and only cause minor damage but craft weapon are pretty good. I love the naval missions in this series. Outfits are kinda lack in this game not much different variety in the shop but unlockables outfits looks great. Finally, there is not much stealth in this game but some point connor always engage on combat and some other point he become stealth assassin. The story of the game is good as native american who tries to protect his land and kinda fails at the end of the story.
