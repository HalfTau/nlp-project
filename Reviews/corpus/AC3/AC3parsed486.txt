terrible UIpoorly explained / unexplained mechanicsTOO MANY CUTSCENESmissions are either a few seconds long or drag on for eternitythere is always a correct way to do each mission, if you stray or try your own method, prepare to ragefull sync conditions are incredibly annoying and sometimes virtually impossible chase a man through crowded alleys without touching anybodyprotagonist voice acting is bland and slow and sounds mentally challenged, i cringed through all dialogueso much preachy selfrighteousness, especially from SJW protagonist. eyerolls upon eyerollsranged weapons are awful. in combat you will be lucky to get one shot off, it may or may not kill the targettargeting enemies from a distance is awkward and difficult. if they move your target lock will probably break. you will probably air assassinate the wrong person many many timesglitches and bugs eg. combat music can get stuck on a loop even when not in combat, forever, unless you start a new mission my convoy got stuck on attacked and made one of the three slots permanently unavailable with no way to resolve a few times during freerun i was magically thrown 60 feet in the air and died sometimes a mission location thats supposed to be map marked will become unmarked and frustrating to search forin combat it takes like a 12 strike sequence to put down a single guard, with 50 chance your sequence of stabs will be interrupted by another enemy striking youstreamlined freerun using one button means no way to differentiate between types of movement ie sprinting, jumping down to ground, leaping to catch another ledge, running up a wall and many frustrating instances where the dude does what you did not intendtoo much dull filler content mindnumbing underground labyrinths, lockpicking, large sections of map you have to explore by walking with nothing interesting to see, checkers and similar boring minigames, grinding challenges where you have to perform various actions many times over, having to visit stores to manually send out convoys every couple minutes to sell items which takes like 400 clicks each time, hunting which is cool at first but ultimately pointless except for the grinding challenges and too easy.....there are some positives environment, animations, animals, ships but the negatives vastly outweigh them IMO. I did enjoy this game at times, but there were far too many annoyances sucking the fun out, and finishing it is a chore, especially for a completionist.5/10
