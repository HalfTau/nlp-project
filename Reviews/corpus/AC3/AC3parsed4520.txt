Singleplayer and storyline are really good, but im sure other reviews already described it perfectly. Here im gonna speak about multiplayer.While the idea of multiplayer is as always very unique and interestingyou have to target and silenty assasinate other players, while you are surrounded by civilians in the same clothes and also having a player targeting you, its completely unbalanced. Abilities let you straight out instantly detect players out of the NPC crowd, prevent direct closerange assasinations, stun and kill players at range, etc. Not only that completely destroys the aspect of being a silent assasin and turns game into pointless deathmatch, but many abilities are also available only on highlevels, and matchmaking doesnt take level into account.TLDR dont purchase the game if you have hopes for unique multiplayer of being silent assasin and art of hiding. Overpowered and unfair abilities turn it into regular deathmatch, completely dominated by highlevel players.
