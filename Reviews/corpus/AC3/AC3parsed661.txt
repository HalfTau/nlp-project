Ubisoft, ubisoft , Ubisoft. This game could have been so much better, for starters Uplay, why? Secondly for me this game kept glitching, some graphics glitch which made unplayable. This meant restarting over and over to reset the game so which  was only way of stopping the glitching, read plenty of forum suggestions none worked. This game is just poorly opitmized.Game play is same as previous versions, including the fustrating bits like connor picking up a body instead of the highlighted weapon in the middle of combat or Connor climbing an obstacle like a crate in the middle of a chase scene.Story is Ok, Desmonds story Ive found boring the whole series and dislike the bits outside of the animus.Thumbs down due to glitching and game unreliability
