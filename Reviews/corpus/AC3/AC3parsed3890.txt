VERDICTGeorge, Age 36, computer literate, gamer for last 22 years. Played all previous major titles. Own over 300 games Unfortunately a general dissapointment compared to its predecessors. The game overral feels like its a BETA. The storyline does not have any coherence and a feeling of progress. The game menus are complex and confusing and game controls take time to understand. The many cinematics seems to jump in and out and feel unneccesary most of the time although this is subjective. The graphics are fine and character detail and animation offer what someone would expect from Assassins Creed. As a great fan and owner of previous Assasins Creed games I play this game JUST for this reason. I have stopped after few hours of gameplay and will uninstall the game soon. My advise is to play CREED 1 and 2, SKIP 3 and try 4 black flag. If u really want to buy this game dont waste your money unless its under offer for less than 12 Euro.
