This game overall is a ok game you can say. It has its moments,but can feel dull. For example you can be raiding a fort,then be bored going somewhere on horse. Dont get me wrong it has its good parts,but compared to the hype and excitement it had,dont expect a jawdropping must have game.The verdict,its a ok game and honestly dont feel like your missing out on anything.
