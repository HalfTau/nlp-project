This game is fascinating in how quickly it swings from good to awful at the drop of a hat. The naval combat is superb, the hunting enjoyable, the free running decent and the presentation mostly great. It is, however, plagued with glitches, absolutely horrendous pacing in the main campaign, optional objectives that seem to view enjoyable challenge with open contempt and side missions that dont really do anything. Not to mention that the UI for crafting and trading is needlessly tedious. I played this game to see for myself whether or not it deserved the hate thrown its way. It doesnt deserve to be crucified, but it certainly doesnt deserve a glowing review. Again, this game fascinates me in the swings of enjoyment.I could write for hours about this game, but Ill keep this brief This is a sometimes extremely enjoyable game plagued with many problems and, well, I played it mostly out of curiosity to see if it truly was as awful as some say. It isnt. It is a mixed bag however.
