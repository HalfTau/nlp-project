This game is absolutely awful. What can I say, Ive loved the AC series from the very beginning. From the historical accuracy to the intriguing characters and the gameplay thats different from any other franchise out there. This game is the exception to all of that. This game just feels lazy and rushed, no matter how you split it. The main character, Connor, is nothing like ezio or altair who had depth. Basically hes just an angsty child with a knife and a hood pretending to be an assassin, and that is a completely unintentional personality that emerged from them completely botching this game. The only character worth rooting for is the bad guy and connors father. Connor actually BREAKS the tenets of the creed on several occasions. Now what can I say about the gameplay. Oh, the gameplay. Where the others were a little frustratingly buggy at times, this one completely crashes and burns. They had to pretty much tear the engine at the seams to get it even sort of work. The whole thing is held together with duct tape and hope. Buggy? that doesnt even begin to describe it. Drop through the floor, taking fire damage where there is no fire, being shot through solid buildings the list is endless. Bottomline? If you love AC, steer clear of this and pretend it never happened. Youll be a lot better off. It was my favorite franchise, now its been completely ruined. Dont buy this.
