Quite possibly my favorite Assassins Creed game so far. It throws a lot of good twists at you, and they make you not want to put the game down. The story is fantastic and the Naval Battles are quite possibly the coolest thing they have added to these games. The multiplayer is fun so far, though ive only played around an hour of the MP. Overall this game earns a 9.9/10.
