AC3 should have been a good game. It has so many intriguing elements and yet none of them come together. Conner should have been an interesting character. The War of Independance should have been an great backdrop. The changes to movement and combat should have been good changes. Naval combat should have been thrilling. But no, Conner is boring, the War is just background, the controls suck and the naval combat is a chore. Everything in this game feels like an after thought too many elements and yet no focus on any of them.I really wanted to like this game but after playing through it once at launch and trying to pick it up again recently I just cannot get into it. The only positive thing I can say about this game is that I like Conners design and animations, he is a bigger man than all the other main assassins and he uses his size and strength well.Skip this one and pick up Black Flag instead, it fixes all of the above and its about pirates. Who doesnt like pirates?
