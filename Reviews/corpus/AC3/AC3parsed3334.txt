Brilliant game, lots of end game things to look for and find and quite a fair bit of content, the story is gripping and keeps you focused, you find yourself fixed on the plot instead of drifting away and getting bored. Dont really know what else to say, its just really good. Nice world to play around in, just mind out for those pesky animal quite time events that are really annoying.
