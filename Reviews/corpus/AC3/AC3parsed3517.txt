People told me this game was srsly boring. Unfortunately, they told me that after I bought it, but before I played it. I thought the concept was pretty cool, because youve got a native american assassin fighting British redcoats in the American Revolution, and the only people who are more fun to kill than redcoats are nazis.Ive played an awful lot of AssCreed games, so while Im more likely to be fed up with its gameplay, its also pretty hard to get the ridiculous storyline without having played them.So with that preamble, let me say, this game is actually pretty fun! However, it overstays its welcome, and the tech tree is really dumb. There are too many collectables, and I just dont have the time or inclination to work through unlocking its fast travel network, which is laid out in the most unhelpful way possible. The Rope Dart is a welcome addition to fights, but many of the melee weapons and guns were useless, because of poor stats and no real other difference.The tech tree is a really unwelcome addition, requiring you to assemble a tiny village and do a bunch of sidequests and gather materials and money and its just really boring. They tacked it onto an industry and shipping system that I refuse to believe anyone anywhere cared about.Naval combat is really cool, which is probably why they made the next game about that.The King Washington DLC was also really cool, what part of it I played, but I was already so bored with the game that I couldnt stomach more than part of the first episode. I wished I had not played so much of the game before that.I guess you could buy this game if it was cheap and you did nothing but the main quests and skipped all the optional objectives and collectables and went straight to DLC.
