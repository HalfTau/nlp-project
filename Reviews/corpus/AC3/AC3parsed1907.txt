Assassins Creed III involves a new gameplay mechanic different from its predecessors. The new counter system and enemies reaction are revamped. The combat are somewhat more difficult at first, but is very easy when you already mastered it and know the type of enemies youd face. The freerun technique also differs slightly and includes new animations. The graphics of the game is great, one of the best in its time. Also, there are lots of new weapons in the game, ranging from muskets, tomahawks, pivot hidden blades, gun stocks, rope darts, flintlocks, etc. The game is by far one of the most brutal in the series expect to see more blood and combat in the game. Fists also have new combat mechanics and are deadlier than ever. For the story, it is told in a fun way and will put you in twists and expectations.ProsNew Combat System Counter, Enemy Type, etc.New Animations Brutal Combat, Freerun, etc.Weapons and Tools Guns, Rope Darts, etc.StoryGraphicsSide Missions and Contents Lots of ThemPivot Hidden BladesAssassinations using ANY TYPE of WeaponPresent Day MissionsCrafting Items, Pouches, Custom Weapons, etc.Map Area FrontierNaval CombatConsSome Bugs not Game CrashersUplay Integration Might be a difficulty on some occasionsPlain Present Day ResolutionLack of Optimizations in some part of Map Boston MostlySome Lags and Frame Rate Issues not hardware problemCant Kill Civilians Freely Only using Precision Mode to able Kill CiviliansOverall Score 8.9/10
