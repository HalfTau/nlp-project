After Assassins Creed II, it feels like most Ubisoft games have been remakes of that title, recycling similar systems and UI elements. ACIII is no exception and feels worse. Like an engorged tick, ACIII often seems ready to pop with  the plethora of systems vying for player attention. Fix the homestead sail the ship hunt in the forest repeat the same mission types youve done sicne ACII. Its unfortunate as there are moments that shine through.The most obvious of these is the ship combat, which had enough potential to make a whole numberedentry on. Less obvious is the moment I enjoyed most being a native child in the forest. Running through the trees as a teenager while laying traps and stealing horses was wonderful in a way that few video games have been. Sitting on a brach while watching patrols and animals pass by was serene. Its a shame that Assassins Creed got in the way of it.
