I am rating this game a bad review for th following reasons. Firstly, you have to sign into another account to play the game. Why cant you just use your steam account to play this game. Secondly, it does not work unless you have this account and you have to launch the game with the launcher provided with your account. And these reasons do not matter now that the game most of the time says this The procedure entry point cefbrowsercreatorsync could not be located in the dynamic link librarylibcef.dll. I do not reccomend this game.
