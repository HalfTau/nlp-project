A great game, but its terribly slow to start. The first 8 or so hours are more or less a glorified tutorial, which really doesnt do anything you havent seen before in the previous 4 ACs. Its worth persevering through though, since once the real game opens up, its absolutely great.My personal highlights include the settlement you get to upgrade, which now comes with a lot of NPCs who each have their own little story lines and fun little quests the ship you get to command in naval combats and hunting, which is really quite spectacular. Besides this, there are also various smaller improvements, such as assassin recruits that are no longer identical, and improved controls. The game is also bigger/longer than the previous ones, and the story is the best since II, though Conner is a bit dour compared to Ezio.All in all, I highly recommend this game. Just make sure youre prepared to persevere through the terribly long prologue.
