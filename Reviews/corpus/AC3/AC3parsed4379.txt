Red Dead AssassinThe GoodNaval battles were awesome !!!!! and the hunting mechanic made me happy.... and lo I am become death, sky assassin of beavers!  The tree mechanic is a little clunky but I did enjoy some of it.  The weather feature was fabulous... Ive never seen walking in snow look that real in a game before.  Although Im not a fan of the collect all the things busy work, it did have me playing for about sixty hours to get through the end. the last hour was the end credits alone, oy!  And the scenery is very beautiful at times.The BadOverall the story is mundane and uninvolving.  A Revolutionary War where the war takes a back seat to it all...its muddled, has no definition, and completely ignores pretty much damn near everything in the Declaration of Independence and dumbs it down to a Civil War and predominantly tries and fails to push the British perspective.Then theres character development...  Connor is an inconsistant, emo tool.  I stopped playing the main missions to do the side quests just to avoid him.  Thank Jah the modern day story is over, cause Desmond sucked and I wanted to stab Sean in the head with an icepick since the get go.The UglyConnors mom... woof.7/10
