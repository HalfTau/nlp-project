Ive already owned this game before and lost the copy of it so I decided to buy it once again. After playing some missions, I figured that theres one map thats been unoptimized giving me 30 FPS while other maps doesnt drop as low as that.The map Im talking about is Boston and upon doing my research whats causing this FPS drop, it seems that Im not the only one experiencing it.If you really want this game and that boston map doesnt sound like a real issue for you then feel free to try it out. You may want to refund it before 2 hours so youll be obliged to refund it.
