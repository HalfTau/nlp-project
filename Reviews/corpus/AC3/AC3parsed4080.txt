Great Fun! Nice graphics combined with great gameplay. Lots of stuff to do.Also preferring Connor over Ezio as a character. Its good to get some change from that Italian accent pI have completed AC Brotherhood  Revelations. This one ive played about 20 completion and already choosing this over both of previous.Story start is somewhat boring but when you get to play as Connor, the fun starts!Theres still few complains ive seen so far.Combat system is way different from previous games, but i got used to it pretty soon as i started.Also some controls are different.Highly recommending if you liked previous Assassins creeds!
