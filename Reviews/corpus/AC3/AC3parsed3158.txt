When I first started playing this game I thought the keyboard controls were horrendous and progressing through the story was confusing at best. Since Ive gotten back into the game, Ive progressed to the point where Im now playing as Connor. Ive also switched over to using a controller as its not as horrendous to use, but still bad.Im finding that if I do the side missions along with the main story, that Connor is actually a good guy, his father is aand seemed to switch sides, and both the redcoats and Patriots need to be put down for good. Too bad the natives didnt have enough power to get rid of these loser Europeans.This Assassins Creed is good if you like Native American culture, and if you want to know something about how the USA got started. While the game has taken liberties with the real history, for the most part it is fairly accurate to say that NA, blacks and any other people that werent white were treated terribly. Both voice actors for Connor and his mother are actual Native Americans.
