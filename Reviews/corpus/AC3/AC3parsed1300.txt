Do you like running around and stabbing filthy redcoats in the neck?Do you, perhaps like to set traps and go hunting in the wild hours at a time to make a few coins?Do you love runnning your own settlement and earning people trust and respect?Do you like to have pirate ship battles?Then this game is for you, because if has all of that and more. I cant think fo the countless hours I have soent hunting a deer or a fox and selling them. I have so much fun hunting and climbing trees and killing redcoats and finding cool new places, and meeting historical people I have only read and learned about.This game was truly an amazing experience.
