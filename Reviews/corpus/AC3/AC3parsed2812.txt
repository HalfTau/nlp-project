This game has been hard for me to complete, not because of difficulty, but because it feels alien when compared to the cadre of AC2 games. It is similar to the differences between AC1 and AC2, but in a worse direction, not a better direction. I have heard excellent reports on AC4, so I will hold out hope. I may finish it someday.
