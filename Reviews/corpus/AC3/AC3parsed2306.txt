I apreciate the effort put into this game, but the result is not woth it.The plot was never a strength of AC series, but in III its blandness showed the most. Not quite consistant Star Wars knockoff plotwise, and most twists made me raise my palm and lay it upon my forehead.The second act was an improvement, Connors relationship with his father, who is way more threedimensional, seemed interesting enough.Gameplaywise controls are as always clumsy and not changeable that was a drag for me, cause holding RT and A at the same time is uncomfortable. Fights are boring, chases are not engaging, stealth is not rewarding.The games a mess. Highbudget detailed product that is not worth spending time on.
