This game is a poor port to PC  the main challenge is not the game itself, but the awkward control system.  A great many parts of the control system are poorly implemented, for example a multiple dog attack is a certain death experience  despite on screen instructions on what randomly selected keys you are meant to press and when, I die pretty much every time 2 or more dogs/wolves attack.  Another example is when you are on a stealth mission, trying to run between areas of cover, when you walk past a ladder and find yourself accidentally climbing it.  Yet another example is when you jump into a cart of hay to hide, but sometimes your character just jumps straight back out again.  Its just a frsutarting mess.There are also too many set piece missions where its not made clear what you are meant to do e.g. are you allowed to kill soldiers, are you meant to achieve the mission with no kills, etc  so it just becomes a process of trial and error determining what it is you are supposed to be doing.
