Assassins Creed 3 gets a lot of hate, and I imagine a lot of it has to do with Connor, who is kind of a after playing 3 games as Ezio who everybody loved. The gameplay in AC3 is pretty solid though, and when Connor is helping the homestead instead of killing redcoats, hes easier to like. The PC port doesnt run very well though. And I wish they could have made a few more tree models for the frontier viewpoints, got pretty old climbing the same tree 10 times.
