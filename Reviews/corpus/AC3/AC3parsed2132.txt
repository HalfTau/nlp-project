Its not that the game is bad persay, but that it has a couple of situational detriments that make its already obvious shortcomings more apparent. Several things about this game are both arduous and boring. The new crafting system is annoying and pointless, especially when one considers the fact that it may be a substitute for the lack of an armour system. The writing is bland, the story is convoluted and uninspired, so much so that the Desmond storyline is actually more interesting than the historic one. This is easily the worst of the AC games, especially when compared to its predecessors.
