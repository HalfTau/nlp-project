Having played this game previously on the PS3 I know..., I decided to replay ACIII as I enjoyed it so much the first time. Maybe it was me looking only seeing the good parts about this game that made me want to play it again, but now I realise this game has many problems.It has one major issue, which is with story pacing. You go from actionpacked sabotage missions, to having to go back and forth to an old mans house 3 three! times. This really makes the game drag. The bits where you come out of the animus are riddled with stupid flaskbacks to the weird stories of the ones who came before, which suck.The things this game does right are the things it has to do because it is an Assassins creed game the free running is fluent and fun, the combat is good if a little easy and predictable, and the scenery is great. The rest is forgettable and AC4 makes up for all of this
