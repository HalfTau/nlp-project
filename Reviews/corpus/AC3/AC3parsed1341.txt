Its pretty distinct from the previous assassins creed games some for the better some for the worse.  The story line is pretty cool and has a cool plot twist like a third of the way in.  The climbing on the trees and cliffs add a more fun element to the parkour aspect of the game.  There are also ship quests which could be fun if you like that type of gameplay, otherwise it could prohibit your liking of the game...I thought it was ok.  You could also hunt various animals which is kinda cool.    I also like the setting, Ive learned more about the american revolution than I have in schoolthings textbooks dont tell you like how George Washington was brutal towards certain native tribes yeah I actually read the database tidbits.  If I was an american history teacher, id assign this game to my students and have them do a project or test on it.  Also the DLC tyranny of George Washington is a must download for this game.  On the downside of this game, the economy part of the game is so much worse than the previous games...so confusing and they dont do a good job explaining how to earn money from trading goods or building up the house.  Also there are a lot of bugs, in the underground tunnel images for the puzzles wont appear which make it impossible to progress through that aspect of the game.  In addition, the brotherhood aspect is virtually nonexistent.  But overall, its a good game and Id recommend it for an Assassins creed fan.
