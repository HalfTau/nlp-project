I played Altairs chronicles and discovery for the Iphone 3 years ago when I was about twelve years old. Those two games were possibly some of the best experiences Ive had when it comes to action/adventure games. Assassins Creed III, despite the occasional body disappearing glitch and somewhat limited AI, is a great experience for any fan of Ezio, Altair, and the series as a whole. Early in this games developement, and I mean when it was just a thought in someones head and a few bullet notes on a sheet of paper, that someone suggested that it would be about a female assassin in WWII. Then somebody else reminded the first somebody that one of Assassins Creeds unique traits is that it visits time periods not common in other action games. The American Revolution is a great setting for a young, budding assassin to make his mark. Comepletely packaged with beutiful graphics and some entertaining cutscenes, this game is a work of art.
