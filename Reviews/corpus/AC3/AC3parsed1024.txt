Its an absolutely amazing game, with plenty to do and a great open world. The stroy is slow at first but becomes very immersive and entertaining, the music in and out of combat is great as well as the actual combat. The graphics are also great for its time and it almost never lags because of its low requirements, I had a great time playing this game cuz of all of its features, and I higly recomend u get it regardless if its on sale or not
