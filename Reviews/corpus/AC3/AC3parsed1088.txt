Very glitchy, VERY.. GLITCHY.. GAMEPLAY GOOD.. COMBAT GOOD.. STORY...GOOD.. JUST VEERRYY.. VEERYYYY... VEEE 400 verys later.. GLITCHY! I litteraly just 5 minutes ago tried to corner assassinate the ship in the part where youre in the war with Pitcarne, and Conners like OH IM GONNA CORNER ASSASSINATE YOU, OH BUT WAIT LEMME JUST ING GLITCHPAST THE WALL SO I CAN BE SEEN WHILE YOU JUST DIE FROM A GHOST ALONG WITH MY ANIMATIONS!! HUEHUEHUE Seriously I am REALLY annoyed with the glitches.. some glitches I dont mind, but when they mess up my stealth abilities and such, NO. NO LIKE. Dont get me wrong, this game was my FIRST Assassins Creed game to own, I got it in 2013 or 2012 near December. I played through it without that much stealth because I wasnt as experienced. NOW that I am I can see how TERRIBLE the glitches are. Seriously, sometimes I can just kill someone behind a wall and the Brits are like OI AYE SAW YEW KEEL EM! OMMA JUS FOOKIN SHEWT YEW THREW A FOOKIN WALL m8! ALSO WOULD YOU LIKE A CUP O BAD ANIMATIONS?! I rest my case.Conclusion Buy the game, greatest one Ive played so far, just BEWARE OF GLITCHES.. BE...WARE...
