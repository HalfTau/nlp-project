It was decent. I really dislike having to gather and craft things in single player games. Probably some MMOon the dev team. Character isnt nearly as cool as Esio. Hes actually a pretty big . I personally would have cut George Washingtons throat but our hero es out. If you like the AC series you HAVE to play it, why are you even reading a review?
