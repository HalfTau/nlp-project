Pros Looks great, fairly emersive, cool story. The addition of firearms is a lot of fun!Cons Some game engine issues, slight bugs, this franchise is repetitive and expensive. Each game is pretty much the same.Seeing as I have played all the AC games up until and including this one, I doubt I will buy another from the franchise. They are all too similar for the price point.
