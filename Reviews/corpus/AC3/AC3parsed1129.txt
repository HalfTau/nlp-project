The main plot outside of the animus is strange, and not terribly interesting to me. Connors plot inside the animus however is very enjoyable. Connor is an interesting, conflicted character. His relationships with the supporting roles are all fun to watch and really pull you in to the story overall.The gameplay is excellent. The parkour stuff in the Assassins Creed games is unlike anything else out there and is something to experience. The level developers did a wonderful job crafting areas where you could really let fly, leaping from ledges, swinging on beams, and sneaking about is wonderful. Combat is enjoyable though at times a little clunky, especially when it comes to using ranged weapons, and waiting for opponents to attack so you can counter while still the best strategy can feel a bit tedious.Graphically the game is absolutely stunning, inside of the animus. Outside... everything is awful. There were some really odd glitches and popins quite frequently but they rarely detracted from my overall experience.Overall I recommend the game to just about anyone.
