AC3 was a massive disappointment.  Half way through, I realized the majority of the gameplay was a short cutscene, followed by another short cutscene, where then you were given the mission of traveling, and after that, traveling back to that place, to have another cutscene.  The gameplay was uninspired, and it felt like a real letdown after brotherhood.
