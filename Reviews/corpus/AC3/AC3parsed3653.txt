If youre looking for a game thats polished, this game is not for you. It has bugs, the controls sometimes dont work when they should, not to mention the controls are horrendously bad, and sometimes I think a seeing eye dog could navigate me around Boston better than the ingame camera can. Overall though, this game is really, really, fun, and at the heart of it, thats what games are all about. Assassins Creed III is definitely a quick fix if youre looking for a game to keep you occupied for a few weeks.7.5/10
