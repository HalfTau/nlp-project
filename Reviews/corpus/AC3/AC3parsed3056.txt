Ive played every single Assassins creed game to date and this by far has the best story out of all.  The climbing can be a bit tricky since they changed the controls around but the combat is even more fluid than brotherhood and revelations.  this is also a great game to play for beginners who have never played an AC game before.  graphics are beautiful, the soundwork is quite good, and the character speeches and voices are very well done.
