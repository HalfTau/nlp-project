I recommend this game to fans of the Assassins Creed series.Its not without flaws though. When comparing it to other titles in the franchise it seems to fall below par and a lot of it feels rushed. The stealth and combat in the game are nothing compared to the previous titles, you feel less like an assassin and more like an axe weilding psycopath. The menu systems and mini games feel really poorly designed and you would expect them to be far more intuitive, it wasnt until I had completed the main story that I truly understood the homestead missions and by then the bonuses served very little purpose.The story is interesting and probably the main reason to play, its a key stepping stone in the series. I enjoyed the addition of the hunting and sailing mechanics and the parkour extension into wooded areas was quite nice, although cities felt flat and repetitive.Overall a good game, but probably the worst game in the franchise up to this point which is a bit of a disappointment.
