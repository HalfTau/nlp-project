I bought the game so I could kill redcoats on the 4th of July. It was goo for that. The story line is confusing. There doesnt appear to be any controls options to look up what key does what. All I have to do is hold the sprint button and steer. Fighting is kind of just clicking the same button over and over, a little more to it. There are a lot cutscenes which then just drop you in a different part of the map, and then I spend 10 minutes trying to get to the next blip on my map because Im lost. The soldiers may attack you for no apparent reason such as being on a roof or walking by them, even when you have your wanted level all the way down. Redcoats, or yankees, they will both attack you if youre wanted by either. I have zero clue how to manage my trade carts? I guess I have them. That menu doesnt seem to work well.Ive played this game several hours trying to give it a chance, but I am angry at how confusing it is the entire time.
