A good game that I enjoyed playing, good fights, good story and nice environment, specially with the diffrent seasons and weather conditions.The ending however was a bit lackluster.It never gets old to use the dart rope to strangel/hang your enemy from atop a tree or rooftop.There are a few things that are bad in this game and that is the glitches and some bugs in the game, the walking around underground in the tunnels was really boring and nothing exciting to find.The DLC is crap avoid it if possible, I was greatly disappointed.Overall I give this game a 8/10, an enjoyable experience.
