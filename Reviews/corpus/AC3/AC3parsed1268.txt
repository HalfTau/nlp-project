Stop playing AC after Revelations and pretend the series ended with ezio. This has absolutely killed the series for me.Definitely the worst AC games and one of the worst games Ive played overall.Bad voice acting dont blame the voice actors, the writing is pretty bad, bland characters, boring missions. Stupid controls the old ones worked great! Why the change?Lots of unnecessary filler and gameplay that feels useless. Most things youll only use or play once.Watch a lets play or the cutscenes on youtube, if you want the story. But be warned. They arent very good.
