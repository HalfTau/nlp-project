Its a pretty long game with decent gameplay, good graphics, decent music, decent story... but it doesnt really excel in any way. It took me multiple years to finish it because of how dull it is.Perfectly functionalGood graphics, interesting settingFurthers the plot of the AC SeriesDull gameplay, no surprises to an AC playerStory missions are poorly written, lots of why would protagonist do that or why would bad guy do that momentsNonstory missions are repetitive without much rewardMost of your tools dont come in handy. The useful ones like the Pistol and Bow are clunky and hard to useYou have no stealth tools not even a crouch but there are several stealth missions
