Probably the most monotonous of the Assassins Creeds Ive played so far. I normally like to do as many side missions as possible but I ended up mainlining the story after coming back to it sprodacially. There was something about the map, the environment, the AI, the controls, something, that was pushing me away each time. I finished it more because I felt like I should rather than wanting to, which is part my fault, but I hoped it would get to AC2 levels at some point and there were definitely some parts I enjoyed.It runs fine on a midspec PC though and if its cheap and you like AC youll get your moneys worth, hence I just about recommend.
