Refined combat mechanics and mission structure, as well as an engaging plot make this one of the best games in the series. The number of side missions, from hunting and growing your homestead, to assassination contracts and the excellent naval battles are staggering. I only wish Ubisoft had integrated these into the plot. As it stands, the meat of this game is purely optional.
