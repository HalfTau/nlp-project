Remember playing in Italy? All the excitement of having an excellent story with relatable main characters, amazing gameplay mechanics and environments? If you did not then you might want to get this game, it does away with the Ezio storyline and gives you control over an angsty kid with a name I do not even remember rakakakananananahakumamatata or something fighting in the most boring era of the most boring country of all time. Fight in wars using poorly controlled cannons in long events which means nothing get a boat and sail the seas in this terrible edition of Sailing Simulator 1760.Exchange the beautiful landscapes of Italy for a bland background I guess you can call the game realistic if you look at the present state of the country of a country founded by traitors calling themselves patriots. And if all this has not made you completely ecstatic about the game already, feel free to kill an animal and be forced to stay within the map as you forget about their corpse and realise you cannot move on without skinning it. I would rather replay Brotherhood, that is how I feel about this game, next time, lets do an interesting time period, shall we?
