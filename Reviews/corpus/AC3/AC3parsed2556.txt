I really did like previous AC games and I had high hopes for ACIII too  especially due all hyping of the game in media. Ive played it now about 7h and Ive to say I dont like this game at all! Im very disappointed actually. And here is why1 Gameplay is horrible. It is even worse than in previous versions. The shooting and aiming is hard perhaps that is the point cause firearms were not as good as they are nowdays.. The combat is too easy. Its all about pressing E and then mouse button and you always succeed in killing. In previous versions you actually faced hard times if you faced too many opponents at the same time. Why games today has to be too easy? Im kinda missing 90s when games were difficutl2 Graphics. Hey please! Who honestly can say this game has awesome graphics!?! Have you ever seen Crysis? Or new Deus Ex? or Witcher 2? Even Witcher 1 has better graphics than this game! It is horrible! Draw distance is low, all faces are just about same and mouth sync is HORRIBLE. And gamers say the graphics are good? No they are not. And yes  all my graphics settings are as high as possible.3 I just cant sync with this character. What was his name? I cant even recall and I played the game few hours ago. It was easy to sync with Altair. Easy with Etzio. But not with this one honestly Ive no idea who the guy is!. Horrible.4 Gameplay... hiding etc is horrible. corner kills doesnt work always cause well.... even blind guard would see if halfbody is lurking behind the corner. Come on!!! And all tasks and the prize you get from clearing all missions 100.. Im glad I read how pointless the prize was and stopped even trying to max the game.5 Buy this game only if you want to finish AC series. And buy only if the cost of the game is less than 5. Even that is too much for this game.
