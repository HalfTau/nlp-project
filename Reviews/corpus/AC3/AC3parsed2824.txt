This game takes you through a tragic and dramatic story from 2 peoples point of view. At first you are Haytham, the father of connor and a templar determined to control the world. While helping a tribal women they fall into a relationship and have a child called Connor.Then you play as Connor. He grew up with his mother until she was killed in a fire caused by Charles Lee, a templar, since then he is soul bent on getting revenge and will do whatever it takes to achieve it. He becomes an assassin by asking an older member of the order for help.This game is an improvement on the past onces as it introduces some new things, hunting, traps, town creation and a lot more therefore giving you more control.I would recommend this game because it has a unique and intrigueing storyline therefore making the game exciting. The new features make the game seem more interesting and make there be more for you to do than just go around killing people.
