Hi, I just would like to ask for help in actully being able to use this game. I acedentily liked it to an account that I cant get back to, even though it is valad. My problem is that I forgot that I already had a uplay account, and regestered an new one for the same email. Now, I cant play the game, and this really annoys me. If anyone knows how to fix this, please tell me.
