I wanted to like this game after playing Assassins Creed 2 and enjoying it but I must say Ive found it a bit boring. The game just isnt very captivating, engaging, or compelling. Its just a bit ordinary. Maybe its because I am playing it long after release. I can see that when it was first released it would have been good but now it feels a bit dated. Still, if youve got nothing better to do then you can still enjoy it, it is just that I cannot justify the amount of time it is taking to play the game when there are better games out there to spend my time on. Im not saying this is a bad game, it is just that it is not a top game by modern standards.
