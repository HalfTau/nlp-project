This is a great game, but let me explain the beef I have with the AC series as a whole. Ok, so Im chasing down Templars in Jerusalem or Im out hunting game in the American Frontier, then I decide to progress the story and BAM! all of a sudden, Im pulled into the present to deal with this Desmond ahole and this Animus nonsense!!! WHY??? The entire Brotherhood/Templar/Illuminati/what the hell ever crap is garbage and totally breaks immersion. Ubisoft, I love you dearly but just let me play in the time period in which the majority of the game is actually set! I dont give a flying fk about all these modernthat use some machine that can explore a persons memories. If you can look past these insanely stupid segments, then this is an incredibly great game. 8/10
