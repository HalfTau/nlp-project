Do not buy this game.The gameplay is dull, with a few new interesting features that you dont actually need to use at any point. More of just the same.Multiplayer doesnt work. If you plan on buying this game for the multiplayer, DONT. It is broken. If youre that desperate go play it on PS3 or XBOX360 instead, at least there you can get it to work.You are forced to use uPlay yet again. That sucks.Bottom line, Ubisoft hates PC. Dont buy it.
