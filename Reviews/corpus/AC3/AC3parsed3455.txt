This game its simply amazing. Not Perfect but a well over 9.5. The Graphics are still pretty good and not at all outdated. The storyline interesting,could not wait to finish the game.  The price its definitely worth it, soo many hours of gameplay plus the DLCs make a well over 30h of gameplay. I definitely recommend this game.
