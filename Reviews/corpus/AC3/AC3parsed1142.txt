One of the best Assassin Creed games in my opinion. This game introduces a revolutionized fighting style in the AC universe, offers a wide variety of weaponry, has a very gripping story line, and truly makes you feel as though you are a part of the colonial life style, what with all of the seemingly unlimited amount of side quests, a new hunting system that only a Native American would understand, and the views on tyranny and racial slurs spread throughout the game which were very common themes of the 18th century. I highly recommend this game, and is undoubtedly worth the buy.
