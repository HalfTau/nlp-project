Ive started this game around 6 times on various formats  played through the slow Haytham beginnings over and over, losing save games like no tomorrow. Finally  getting to Connor and the open scope of the frontier gave me an insight no matter how short lived it was before losing yet another save  thanks UBI into what this game is epic in every sense of the word. A true acheivement in world building. You have to respect the designers of this game for taking their time with the story and attempting a true saga with an entire frontier with weather systems, intoxicating atmosphere and immersion, wonderful animations and combat. Your time, no matter how flawed aspects of it will be, will eventually be worth every minute you spend in it.A flawed masterpiece, only bettered by its sequel / prequel. 9/10
