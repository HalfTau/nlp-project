Very enjoyable addition to the AC family. A great improvement to many of the familiar aspects of the AC engine. Naval battles are a blast and although very easy once youve fully upgraded your ship nice and quick little mini games. Guns are fun but a pain to reload. Ending is quick and fells very thrown together while the rest of the story is incredibly deep and thought out. 8.5/10
