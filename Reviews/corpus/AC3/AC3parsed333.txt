my least favorite setting in all the ac games so far! cities are boring...  missions can be frustrating especially if you aim to get 100 pct sync..  some parts of the main mission are meh.. the tyranny dlc ones are much better...main protaganist is okay not as exciting as previous games but badass.. .... combat is kinda better than the ezio trilogy..the frontier area looks great and I ended up collecting as much as all the collectibles..I am kinda late in this ac business but for me this is a 6/10...
