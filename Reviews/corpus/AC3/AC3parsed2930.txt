Im not a big fan of the game. Its decent, but feels rather generic.The reason I cannot give it a recommendation, however, is because you have to install uPlay in order to play it. We already have a game client Ubisoft, its called Steam which doesnt suck, unlike uPlay. I dont need, nor do I want your crappy uPlay client.I will not buy anymore Ubisoft games until I no longer have to install uPlay.
