Assaasins Creed III represents the American Revolution and the final part of Desmonds journey... As such, it is a big ambitious game for the Assassins Creed series... The game stars a native American named Connor who is characterized to be a freedom fighter for his nation and for the new American lands...The gameplay is great aside from a few performance hiccups and Multiplayer is phenomenal. The story does take a dive later in the game but overall is a very fantastic. Make sure to do Homestead missions...Highly recommended!!!
