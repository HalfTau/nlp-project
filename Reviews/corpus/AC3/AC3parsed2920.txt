i bought this game last night and i waited anxiously for it to download. when it got done downloading i realized it made me play it in a thing called uplay which seemed alot like steam but nit as good. at first i didnt mind but when i got off it, a few hours later however, i couldnt play it. it showed up as if i never bought the game... i dont know what to do but if anything i would like a refund.
