I was lucky I got this on Steam Sale.. Well I played through AC1 and AC2 and liked the idea of this one but it hurts.. hurts not in a good way.. pretty graphics and nice sound the preachy patrotism makes it feel like im stuck in a propaganda machine. I was going to play through this and then play AC4 but sod it its just not worth it so bring on the Priates!
