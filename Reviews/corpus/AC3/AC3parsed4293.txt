In some ways, this may actually be my favourite AC game so far. I can see why its received all sorts of gentle pummelling from all sides, but it deserves major accolades at the very least for boldly venturing into quite different territory from the previous titles all too rare in a huge budget sequel! and actually pulling it off, absolutely superb handling of the historical material and some truly excellent, nuanced and thoughtout writing  though admittedly the protagonist mostly feels like he was written by three different people who didnt quite agree on what they want to do with him. Yes, the feature creep is getting ridiculous, and some of the story missions are much too linear. But its a splendid experience all the same.
