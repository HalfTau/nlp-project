All I heard was that this game was bad, ok, Connor is a little painful to listen to sometimes, but the gameplay, the hunting, the story, crafting the things you expect from Assassins Creed are there.Its definitely worth buying, as I enjoyed mytime playing it. Havent completed it yet but I think Im 3/4 of the way through and enjoyed my time.
