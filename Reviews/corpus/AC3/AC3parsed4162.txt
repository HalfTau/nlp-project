Overall, I enjoyed the game. The gameplay is better than the previous games, and the quality of story remains consistent. There are still issues with the combat system which have been around since the first game and, to be honest, will probably never really go away, but in general, it was a quality sequel that brought a couple new fantastic elements to the series.The first incarnation of Naval combat is presented here, and is well thought out. Its a bit rough, but still a fresh new aspect to the franchise that was worth including. The first incarnation of hunting was also brought forth in this game, and was also a bit on the rough side. But, again, it was a nice inclusion to what would have been an otherwise decent conclusion to the initial trilogy.The protagonist Connor is an okay protagonist. While he does not strike out with bold ambition and clearly defined goals and well rounded personality, he manages to stay interesting enough that you dont think of him as a character better suited to sit in the background while other, more interesting characters take the spotlight.Overall, its worth picking up, if nothing else, then to play through the conclusion of the Desmond storyline.
