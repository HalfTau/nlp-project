Assassins Creed 3 is the final installment in the series of Assassins Creed games featuring Desmond, an unambitious man turned hero of the Assassin order. From a story standpoint, Assassins Creed 3, honestly, didnt live up to the title. It almost felt like the writers were running out of ideas, and really fell short in this big finale. Now, from a gameplay standpoint, AC3 is, well alright. The mechanics are easy to master, and, with only a combination of pressing e and clicking the mouse buttons, become quickly repetitive. I found myself growing bored of the gameplay halfway through the story, and found myself taking several breaks in between sessions. Now, dont get me wrong, though Ive been harsh on this game so far, that doesnt make it bad. The game is solid enough. For the hardcore Assassins Creed fans like myslef, AC3 didnt deliver, but for the casual gamer, its a great game, and definitely worth the 20 price tag. All in all, I would rate Assassins Creed 3 a 7/10.
