The first real new game in the AC series since AC2. Unfortunately, whereas AC2 was a masterpiece of a game, this game just doesnt live up to that high point in the series.There are a few good points, the fighting system allows you to do more things, Connor has a few new toys to play with compared with Ezio, and the naval combat is interesting. Desmond in the present finally learned how to fight I think that playing as Desmond in the present working to stop the templars would have been much more interesting for AC3 than trying to introduce a new character after Ezio.Unfortunately, this game also has a lot of negatives.First off, the introduction is very slow. You play as a different character for the first few HOURS before you even get to Connor. Im also not sure that the American revolution was the best setting for an AC game since the cities just arent really that interesting and the frontier, while fun to explore, looks like it belongs in a different game. The story with Desmond in the present is unsatisfying and boring with a copout ending.Because of this, this game has the opposite problem of most games in that it feels almost TOO long. Granted, Im a completionist for these types of games and by the end it was just tedious trying to get everything.Then theres the bugs. This is by far the buggiest AC game in the series. And this is several years after the game released and they still havent been fixed and probably wont ever be.Overall I still tentatively recommend this game because it still has the core AC gameplay, and theres a LOT of content here, but make sure you buy it on sale.
