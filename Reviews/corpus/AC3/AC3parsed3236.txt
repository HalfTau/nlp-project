Big step back of the all AC2 series ... OK you have some new things ship, hunting, trade to do and ofc i like it  BUT   do you think it have mater when all other is so crappy? Controls are weird on some places you fall down, cant do catching right, cant make the jump, you go to other direction of that you want, AI beat you or block all of your hits no matter what combo you try, guards popup from nowhere after you kill all that was my favorite, because i have limit of kills  , too much restriction in the missions i just cant get why is need to be cut the player style  after all it have so many options and weapons to do the kills and I need to follow some restrictions, trade is a bit weird too and it have  need of improvement and not at last place is a STORY   I never feel so bored with AC It is just game for hardcore fans  all other will be a bit disappointment and it is not the game Assassins Creed I like in first place
