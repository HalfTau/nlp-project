Very glitchy, they did a terrible job porting it to PC. I suggest not buying it until they come out with some huge patch. They very first day it was released, they had to patch 40 something glitches, the very first day. So people without internet were basically ed to live with a terrible and glitchy game. Although the campaign is unique and pretty cool, it uses a lot of historical events in the game, which actually is pretty cool.
