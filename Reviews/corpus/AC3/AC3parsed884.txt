FRUSTRATING!The main missions are too easy to the point of being rediculous. The optional objectives are difficult to the point of impossible, the controls are very random.If you want 100 completion, hope you like watching the same unskippable cutscenes over and over again for a two second chance to push the correct button.The side missions are fun and the game is quite educational I live in Boston and have learned a lot of new things, but I dont know if I can stomache to finish it.UPDATED I did in fact finish it, and, in retrospect, it wasnt THAT bad, although I probably wont be playing it again any time soon.
