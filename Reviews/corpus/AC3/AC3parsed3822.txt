The game itself is mediocre at best.  However, I was infuriated to find out I had to sign up for a useless Uplay account just to play the game.  Steam of course buried this information at the very bottom of the description and the hardware requirements in hopes that people wont notice until its too late.  Im tired of having to sign up for an account every time I want to play a new game because somebag developer cant wrap their tiny brain around the fact that stupid, useless crap like Uplay accounts are exactly why people turn to the black market.  Its ridiculous that people who break the law actually end up with a proper gaming experience where they arent constanly nagged by DRM or subjected to Ubisofts idiotic delusions of competing with Steam.  Meanwhile I have to jump through fiery hoops, and hand over personal information that can be sold, just to play a game that I actually bought.Congratulations, Ubisoft.  Youve convinced me.  I wont be buying any of your games again.  Thank you.
