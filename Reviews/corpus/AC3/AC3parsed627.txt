My original impression of this game was mixed, duo to its large collection of bugs, but at least it worked.Flash forward a year, and uPlay does something to break the game now I cant access it.Ubi fixes the problem, and I play for a bit.Ubi releases another update to screw up the game.Thank You Ubisoft,for managing to screw up a game that already sucks.
