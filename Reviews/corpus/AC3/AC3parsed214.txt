About the worst assassins creed yet while it introduces a few nice features to the assassins creed series like a nice hunting system in general in comparison to other AC games like brotherhood its absolute trash the side missions are all together a huge repetitive joke, the guards can practicly never lose you so if you ever end up doing one of the side missions within boston you better prepare to fight at least a few houndret guards before you can become anonymous and no there is practicly no way to just run as there is about 3 guard groups on every single street, 60 of the game are collectibles and fillers like the side missions of which there is only like 4 different once ? and on top of that the first 10 hours you are basicly playing the intro of the game. If youre interested on the main story and on a hunting simulator then there you go but dont expect anything else from this game and best wait for a sale.
