Love this game as you can tell have over 900 hours in it i still play it sometimes. Story is great, freerunning is one of the best things about this game. people are complaining about optimization, i understand its  bad but if you are a PC gamer and cant run this game well you got a problem with your PC. Story is very long though looking for a little bit shorter one although. Mulitplayer is OK only sometimes its fun amimus hacking is one stupid thing that i dont like though. And it takes to long to rank up and get new weapons is mulitplayer. All in all great games one of my favorites.
