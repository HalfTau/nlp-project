I dont have a clue, as to why exactly this game received so much hate from the community. I personally feel it more than lived up to its predecessors, and I cant really say that anything bothered me. With the exception of the lacking option of using the animal spirit outfit from The Tyranny of King Washington DLC, in the main game.
