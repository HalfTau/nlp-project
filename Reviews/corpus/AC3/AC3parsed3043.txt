Conor can be a lil annoying some times , but put that aside, still a very good game from the series. Love the badass combo techniques , the naval missions , and the plot itself is kinda good. But I hate that the game has a lot of glitches and I will need to force quit the game from time to time and the DLC is like... mehh..  But overall, still a pretty good game to play.
