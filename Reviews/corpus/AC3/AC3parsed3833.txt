Next to the other Assassins Creed games... this one just feels forced. If youre on a PC, youre getting shortchanged. The interface changes are mostly beneficial to those who are using a controller, and are a major shift from the previous games in the series... and they feel like they were changes just for the sake of looking different, not being improved overall.If you want a more thorough review, Id suggest Yahtzees review on Zero Punctuation by the Escapist Magazine. Im not going to spoil any plot, though, for those that want to torture themselves with the game.
