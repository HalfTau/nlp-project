This game is a lot of fun and adds many cool features to the series, one of which is hunting which I really enjoyed. It is probably my least favorite game of the series, but I still really liked it a lot. I would say it is worth a play if you enjoy the series, but should try the others before jumping in to this one, especially if you want to follow the story.
