The best Assassins Creed game to date.Fantastic, gripping storyline, wellwritten with intriguing and developed characters. I personally love the storylines that weave in and out of historical events which this story does excellently.Sprawling openworld maps that houses an incredible level of graphical detail and activity.Superb new game mechanics in the sailing, treeclimbing, hunting and fighting. The overall HUD of the game has been vastly improved and tweaked.I think it acts as an excellent departure from Renaissance Italy and Ezio significantly better than AC Revelations. Reignites the excitement I first felt from AC2.
