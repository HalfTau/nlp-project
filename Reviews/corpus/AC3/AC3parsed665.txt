Assassins Creed III is the... 4th? 5th? game in the AC franchise. Now, before I get into all the details, I would like to remind everyone that pretty much all AC games have the same basic components sweg combat, stealth missions, crazy citizens, and bad lip synching. However, after playing AC Brotherhood, I was excited to see the new changes that Ubisoft added to the game.
