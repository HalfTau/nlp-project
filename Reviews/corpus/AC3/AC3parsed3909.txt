This is a VERY GOOD game they campaign is really good there is so much to do even when you have completed the campaign.If you played other assassins creed games then you should definitly buy this game.Its a little bit about they American Revolution but that is fun because it is something else then they other games.I do not play they multiplayer of this but couple friends say that it is very good but i only do they campaign.This game is definitly a 9.5/10
