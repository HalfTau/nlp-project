This game does not deserve the title Assassins Creed III. Assassins Creed III should have been the best game ever, the epic ending to one of the best game series in history, and whether or not you like the Assassins Creed series, it doesnt matter. This series is incredibly popular with an incredible story.Id hate to spoil the game for you, so I wont. But trust me, this game can wait. I wish I had spent the 80.00 yes, thats correct on something else. I mean this game dissapointed me almost from the start, and it had way too much hype goin for it.As a game in itself, sure, this game is o.k. But they just missed with this one. I mean a complete miss. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot miss. BlueonBlue situation miss. Swing and a miss.And dont say this game was for the multiplayer, either. Because its not. Its for the storyline. And even if it was for multiplayer, they still missed. Even harder.I finished the single player days ago and just stopped playing the godawful multiplayer just an hour ago, so Im not in a terrible rage. I almost cried. Yes.The only reason you should buy this game is for the sake of continuity.On a scale of 110, dont.
