Overall its an ok game. But there were control issues that made me go into a rage. The horse is a god damn retard! Oh look another invisible wall! Also in missions that you had to chase something you be rumming and decide oh hey! lets climb up this wall, and now you lost the target! you tard assasin! Another weak point is the story line. I found myself skipping through every cutscene after the first few. I want to suck G.W.s balls, now Ill kill you if you cross me! Stupid. Spaking of skipping, when I finish your game, let me skip the credits. Not that I care there are cutscenes, but holyit was like 25 minutes of scrolling. Overall, skip this AC. Play the pirate one.
