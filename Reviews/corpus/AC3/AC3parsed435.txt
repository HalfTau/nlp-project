I have incredibly mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand it has a great setting with the Revolutionairy War. The great moments of the US struggle for independence are there and you can really feel a part of this era. Furthermore, developing your own village is fun although the impact could have been improved and some of the quests are a bit repetitive all in all its a great way to expand your influence.The flipside is the incredible amount of bugs. I cant play for more than five minutes without running into one, and some are close to game breaking.Take simple movement. When climbing Connor will frequently just refuse to go where I want him to go, which is particularly annoying if youre on a very high spot. My horse would get stuck in rocks, unable to move. Connor would fall through ledges. Its all massively annoying.Or suddenly my minimap only gives me a minute overview, meaning I have no clue where I are, or where I can go to avoid enemies. The only solution is to reboot the game.Entering a printer shop, immediately exiting, and having the printer shop somehow changed to a portal to New York really, dont ask me what happened there. And obviously at the moment a patrol is walking by, so I can start running/fighting again.Boarding a ship and mid animation I already have to start over. Thats right, the game had me fail a mission before I had even started it.The list goes on, and it is massively frustrating to go through. Completing the game takes perseverence at some point you just want to see the ending. And it certainly has its moments. But better not to begin at all. Ubisoft should just have delivered a slightly more bugfree game, because clearly spectacle is more important than decent gameplay.
