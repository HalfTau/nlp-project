A natural continuation of the Assassins Creed series, nice sidequests and improved game mechanics from the other series. Graphics and sound does not disappoint even though they dont stand out on my quad core machine with a good ol GTX460.Good story as always, and many more sidequests than before. You can build your little empire if you so wish, which adds to the depth of the game and made me put in 80 hours....but it is STILL to easy to just slaughter the entire defences of a city and take on 25 soldiers by yourself. Would like a harder game mode where you actually would HAVE TO run and hide instead of just countering all the attacks and kill every soldier in sight.8/10 Good entertainment! If you liked the other Assassins Creed games this one is definitely something to consider, even more so if it is on sale.
