I like this game more than some of the other AC games, but dont buy this game on PC. Buy it on console, where it actually works. It doesnt work for me and I have a PC which can run CODBO3, Fallout 4 and Just Cause 3 with no problems, so its a problem with the game. Bad port I guess. Or maybe UPlay is the problem. Who cares. Just in general  dont buy Ubisoft games on PC mostly.
