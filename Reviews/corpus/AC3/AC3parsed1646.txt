Good graphics. Good story.The fighting is a bit annoying since it takes so long to attack and kill. You have to swing like 10 times and they just stand there.Also the controls are very confusing at first. Hard to learn.Other than those cons, this game is pretty good. Missions are long, but thats what makes it interesting
