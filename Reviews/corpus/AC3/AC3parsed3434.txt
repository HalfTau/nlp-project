In my honest opinion this game is worse from all the AC games prior to this one. Mostly what i have liked about the previoust games was the freeroaming and recruiting members to the brotherhood and using them for various tasks and quests. Now this game pretty much makes you roam the streets all the time in cities atleast and it doesnt seem to be as smooth as previoustly. And what comes to the assasin recruits, there are only few and those you have are not really a nessesity.
