THIS GAME REQUIRES UPLAY, THERE IS NO BENEFIT TO BUYING IT ON STEAM!The physics going nuts was fun at first, but then the notsofun glitches started. I encountered 4 crashes to desktops  3 game breaking glitches that required a restart in the first 8 hours alone. Due to mandatory use of Uplay, the game eventually refused to launch until I completely reinstalled uplay. There is no benefit buying this game on Steam and Uplay breaking might prevent you from launching the game altogether.Buy this game on console.Technical issues aside the game is pretty decent. Not as good as its predecessors such as AC2 and Brotherhood, but still a 7/10. Gameplay is good, albeit the controls were tweaked from previous games. Graphics are great, especially for its time, but some of the faces have gone into the uncanny valley. Music is great too, no complaints here. Voice acting is good. Connor is going to be hit or miss for you. Hes different than Ezio, more akin to Altar.Might edit this if my opinion changes after I have finished the game. If I can get the game to launch again...
