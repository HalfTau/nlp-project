I was really looking forward to Assassins Creed III in mid 2012. The game looked like a more refined version of the second game which I loved. Unfortunately, what was delivered was a glitchy, unfocused, and horribly paced game. I still reccomend it, but if you are in it for the epic battles and story, you may be dissapointed. Also the Music is phenomenal, the theme rivals Ezios Family Main Theme from Assassins Creed II.Overall 6/10DLC 6.5/10Naval MissionsGood PC PortDLC Grants Fun Abilities and Interesting ConceptWeak Story and PacingLack of SteathTexture and Objects Glitch ConstantlyTailing MissionsI reccomend just spending your money on Assassinss Creed IV Black Flag
