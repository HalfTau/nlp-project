This game, by far, is my least favorite Assassins Creed game. First, the main protagonist. Ive seen literal pieces of wood, that had more expression then Connor Kenway. He shows the most expression when people die, and other than those moments, he is extremely lifeless. The most fun thing you do is Hence the title of the Fcking game assassinate people, and you only do that half the time. The other half is spent trailing people who stole some damn tools Or other things from your BFFs, and eavesdropping on redcoats and your BFFs neighbors. The mechanics they create are dysfunctional most of the time, and are only remotely useful in the tutorial they give you on that gameplay mechanic. And if you try to get 100 sync like I did, then you too are going to hate this game as much as I do.Then Ubisoft throws the abomination, that is Uplay, into the mix... Uplay is a really crappy service that Ubisoft forces you to download on your computer, to play this game. In fact, I lost my main save file that I spent hours on because Uplay couldnt do the simple damn task of syncing the game with my already existing save file. I couldnt, in good conscience, recommend this game to anyone. If you want a good Assassins Creed game, check out Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag. It has an interesting, witty protagonist, fun story that isnt completely obsessed with the whole templar and assassins business, fun gameplay mechanics Especially with the ships, actually has you assassinate people But you still have to do trailing missions once in a while, and is just a nicer step back from saving the world from the templars. And did I mention the subplot with Desmond Miles?  Why the hell was that guy going into the animus?
