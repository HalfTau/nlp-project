After finishing the trilogy of Ezio, Connor Ratonhnhakton Kenway takes place of the current assassin. Starting out with Haytham, and discovering his story, as well as Connors. This game came through a lot of changes. And some of them are not the best. Although it is a good game, with nice graphic effects and such, its optimalization is not the best. Actually not good at all. Same as controls  they have come through a lot of changes, which are not the best. From my experience, I did not feel the nice feeling after completion, as I did with Assassins Creed II or Assassins Creed Revelations. Also being most buggy of all Assassins Creed games. Connor is an interesting person with not a lot of emotions, but he is still missing something. Not quite the best AssassIns Creed game out there, but it is not that bad after all.But Haytham just wont hide in the goddamn bush!
