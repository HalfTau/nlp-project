This game is a mess. Its full of bugs and graphical errors. It feels more like its designed to waste your time than to entertain you. The voiceacting varies wildly in quality, and very little of it is good. The plot is fine, if a bit sparse condering its stretched over so much time wasted on fetch quests. Despite constantly teaching you basic mechanics of the game for the first 10 hours, huge parts of the game are never explained, like how several of your weapons work or where you got them poison darts, trip mines, etc. seem to appear from nowhere and are never explained or mentioned.Cut scenes and stuff sometimes seem to just end out of nowhere sometimes and I cant tell if its a bug or not because the quality of this game is so poor that I honestly cant tell if bad stuff is intentional. Theres a breef sequence where one of the NPCs is running away from her own wedding and you get to chase her. Shes screaming the whole time about not wanting to be a housewife, and you expect some heartwarming dialog about choosing your own path in life or something. Nope! You chase her around the forest while shes in a wedding dress because leaping through trees in a fulllength dress is super easy, apparently, catch her midsentence, and IMMEDIATELY shes at the altar smiling and happy with no explanation in front of her fiance who couldnt be bothered to change out of his filthy work clothes for his own wedding.The endgame credits take roughly 20 minutes and unskippable. Im still sitting here waiting for them to finish just to see if you can do the DLC after you beat the main game. Oh, did I mention that have the deluxe edition and all the DLC doesnt automatically unlock all the content? You need to type in the CD keys. And no, copypaste doesnt work either so you actually have to type them.I beat this game, and I wasnt happy to see the ending. I was happy that now I can put this in my beaten folder and not think about it anymore.
