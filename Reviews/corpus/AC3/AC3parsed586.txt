Recently just beat the main story. I enjoyed it quite alot. I did getoff over a couple dozen times because when your running Connor will do some stupidlike run up a wall or grab and hold onto something when thats not even what I meant to do.. FFS. Its really annoying when that happens and it happened about everytime there was a running scene or somthing like that. Which is alot because its Assassins Creed. Over all I still enjoyed it, nothing got in the way of me truly enjoying the game for what it was and the work that went into it. I give this game a 9/10 because I am a fan of Assassins Creed and I love the setting and atmosphere in game. plus combat is always a pus, Countering attacks is by far my favorite pas time haha. I recommend this game to anyone who thinks its worth playing. I personally think this is a fantastic game. Maybe get it if its on sale. But the story is noice.  Uplay tho. 9/10 becuse of Uplay and that stupid wall run/grab crap he does in game...
