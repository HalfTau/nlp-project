First, disable all the features of Uplay, because it will make your game crash.Second, in the DLC The Tyranny of King Washington, on episode 1, there is a bug that doesnt let the game continue, I had to go to the next episode without really ending it. Had to watch it on youtube.Decent game, not the best of the saga, but pretty good.The OST is one of the best and most memorable.Recommended on sale.
