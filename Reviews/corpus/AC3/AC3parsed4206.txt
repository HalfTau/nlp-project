Worst game, repetitive missions, absolutely no stealth gameplay, unappealing characters, bad voice acting, impossible secondary objectives, huge empty open world, I regret every cent I spent on Deluxe Edition. Most of my gameplay hours are from multiplayer because wolfpack is the ONLY THING that remembers Assassins Creed, and half of that was spent in the buggy lobby trying to play competitive multiplayer. The game isnt about Assassins, mistery conspiracy anymore, this one is about america and a native american that doesnt deserve the title of Assassin as Ezio does, Just look at him, and look at Ezio. Seriously? Altairs bone in that chair would be rolling in rage seeing Connor being such a puy. Even multiplayer characters have a better background story than connor. If you gonna buy it, buy Standard Edition, the DLCs arent worth it. and look for Wolfpack, only that, the rest of game is a shame to Assassins Creed name. If you want a good story, buy II and brotherhood, if you feel like youre into the series, stop on Revelations.I can sum up the gameplay experience for you Walk there, try to infiltrate that place but that is impossible without initiating a war, carry those crates there, carry those crates here, use your magic eye on this wall, see a cutscene that shows connor crying, see a cutscene that shows connor with a blank face, see a cutscene showing political bad guys with their white funny hair, try to help everyonde near your house because youre sort of jesus helping everybody while you want revenge but hey, before that lets fix a ship, destroy a city, conspirate against the british and turn yourself in a war general sucking George Washingtom feet.
