Another good entry in the AC series. Story was, like other AC games, a conspiracy theorists dream. There wasnt a buildup of the fighting capabilities which is good for those of us that played the previous games and get it already. The ship missions were a good break from the standard 3rd person parkour. The hunting and tree hopping were also a fun additions. Graphics werent improved much between the Ezio games and this one handling might have been a little bit less onthemoney here.
