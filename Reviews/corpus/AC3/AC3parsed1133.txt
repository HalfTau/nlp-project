It is one of the best video games of the year, one of the most daring developed by a major studio this generation, and one of the most beautiful to ever run on any machine. It stumbles from some awkward glitches and some game design overreach, but it is superb in a surprising number of small ways. Refreshingly, it is a game about America that doesnt settle for simple fictions when the uncomfortable truths about the United States history would be more interesting.ACIII packs surprises big and small, veers away from habits of the older games, and looks a hell of a lot better than them, too, thanks to a new graphics engine. All things considered, it winds up perhaps not as refined as Assassins Creed Brotherhood, but far more satisfying and wellcrafted than the rough draft of Assassins Creed 1. Connor may not have Ezios flair, but he has a game that rivals the quality of the Italians trilogy. Cautious consumers might want to wait for the inevitable subsequent patches, but those who dont mind a few cosmetic bugs should have no fear. This is a great game.
