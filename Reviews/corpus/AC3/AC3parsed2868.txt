Just finished this game and I was sadly dissapointed. It is by far the worst AC game in the franchise. Here Im just reviewing the single player.ProsAwesome setting, I love the Revolutionary war period.Ship battles were freakin amazing.ConsThe repetitiveness of AC continues in this game. Not too much seemed fresh.The story wasnt that goodDesmonds ending freakin suckedPlaying the game felt like a chore.Overall 6/10
