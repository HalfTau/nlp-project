I would recomend this game...but i would recommend you play tihs before anyother because it really has lost so manny good features from prevous game. The game is longer than the other so it is worth the 20. It is fun the combat is sorta easy but fun. Their are 4  maps so you will not run out of places to explore. The side quest are fun and you can get some stuff. All in all the game is worth it if played before the prevous games.
