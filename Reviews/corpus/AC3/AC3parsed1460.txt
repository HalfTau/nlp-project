Worst Assassins Creed of all. Same gameplay apart from the additions of naval warfare which is about 5 of the main gameplay. Nice Assassin, but same story once again  A boy wants revenge over something and becomes an bloodshedding murderer.Took me about 14 hours to complete the game and Im glad it didnt take longer.
