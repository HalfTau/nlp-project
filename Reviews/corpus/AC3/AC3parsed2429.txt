A CAVEAT Make sure you have the PC for this. Its an old game and its definitely not as pretty as games are in 2016, but it will, for some reason, tax your hardware. Maybe its OpenWorld Syndrome. Maybe its Ubisoft Syndrome. I used to run an HD 7770 1GB and a FX 8320 a bit better than an Xbox 360, and it was unplayable on that system. Boston ran at a constant 1520 FPS. Now, I run a GTX 970 3.5 GB and an i7 4790k, and Im getting near 60 at all times. So, buyer beware.To me, this is the last time Assassins Creeds story was any good. Its the last entry in the Desmond saga, meaning you get to find out what all of that MinervaJunoendoftheworld stuff was all about. Its also the last time Assassins Creed reveled in its own nerdiness over history.Also noteworthy of this entry is that its the first time the series began to suffer from the other kind of OpenWorld Syndrome. Theres a lot to do, and most of its meaningless. Beeline the main story and climb the towers, and youll get whats worthwhile from the game and spend quite a long time doing it. Get distracted by all of the sidemissions, and youll get bored and start perceiving the game to be empty.Of course, if youre a completionist, then that last paragraph is probably chockfull of pros for you.Heres hoping this time off Ubis taking to take stock in the franchise will lead them back to the lightly controversial, historynerd narrative dreamers they once were back in the days of Connor, Ezio and Altair.
