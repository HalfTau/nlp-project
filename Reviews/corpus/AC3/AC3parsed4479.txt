Though the first part of the game may seem to lack pace, the second half definitely brings it on. The new features such as hunting or tree climbing bring a new air to the game. Add the naval combat which is the best Ive seen in any video game to date and you have a great gameplay mechanic. The story evolves around the North American Civil War, and youll have a chance to interact with characters like George Washington or Benjamin Franklin. You should not miss this game.
