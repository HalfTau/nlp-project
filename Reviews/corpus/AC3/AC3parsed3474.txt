The problem with this game is it has TONS of side missions a quests and they affect the game play of the main story however the problem is that by the time they actually make a large enough impact youre less then 5 missions from the end of the game. I spent so many hours and days doing all the side content and got NOTHING for it. Also the main character was bad, the villains were the only good part of the story and even then only 2 or 3 were good. Then theres the Desmond story honestly it was a worse ending then mass effect 3.  The only part I recommend is the sailing side missions which is basically what assassins creed 4 is skip this one and go on to 4 dont waste your time.
