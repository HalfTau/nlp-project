I feel like AC is dumbing down the controls and Conor is such anof a character its hard to like him. Whenever you are out of the Animus its so confusing on what to do next or go if you leave the game for a while and come back, not to mention being useless against Abstergo agents its so frustrating. I like the story but so far its the second worst one Ive played AC 13, Brotherhood, Revelations, Liberation, and Black Flag. Side note, from the looks of it Unity will be worse than this...6/10 hot garbage
