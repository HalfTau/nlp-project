Excellent story, nice setting and plenty of things to do. From killing redcoats, turning the tide of war, to naval combat and upgrades of your weapons and ship. Trading also plays a nice part of money making and there is a nice treasure search which ads to this game and makes it the best AC up to Black Flag. Recommended.
