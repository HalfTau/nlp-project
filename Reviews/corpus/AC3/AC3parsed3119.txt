I came to this game right after beating Assassins Creed II, and I can say without a dout after now playing all of the games in the series this is by far my favorite. The new combat mechinics felt much more fluid and clean, the parkour was amazing rarley having those moments where you accidently climb the wrong wall and fall back to the ground, or the occasional accidental jump to your death. Connor is also my favorite assassin by far after seeing Ezio for three games and having Edward feel to much like Ezio to me. I can highly reccomend this game wheather it be for the beutiful scenery and hunting of the frontier or the busy cities of Boston and New York.
