Ok, if you love the story and you want to play it yourself, go ahead and buy it. If you want to some american history and great detail terrains and enviroments then sure buy it, but if you are here for the gameplay you might as well watch a walkthrough on youtube or a LETS PLAY ! by a youtuber, the control system and gameplay in general is BROKEN, Objectives stop you from being original and doing things the way you wish to. OH ! you see thar cart to hide in over there, really smart to use it so you can hear the plots od the enemy, GUESS WHAT  SECONDARY OBJECTIVE  Dont hide in the DAM cart!! It simply stops you from playing the way Ezio or Altair would play it, smart, smooth and simple. Running away or towards someone requires a lot of patience for you ll see yourself jumping for no appear reason to invisible walls or landing in the least spected places, even when you were totally aiming for the branch not even 4 feet away.You are running to tacle someone and there way too many people in front of you ?? no problem, you just hold down the right click and youll shove them around to open a path, BUT WAIT THERES MORE D  SECONDATY OBECTIVE  DO NOT SHOVE ANYONE!!!! and you are just like............ OO its a motherf riot either i shove them or kill them.Also secondary objective tendo to appear on the least expected moments. You are about to use your dart on that dude right there?? PUM COOL KILL !!! Secondary objective shows up in right that second  Do not use dart or kill the dude you just kill, his name is Pepe and we love him.Seriously now, HOW MANY ING DLCs are on this thing, what happen with AC 1 and the whole AC 2 saga, One game one playthrough one campaing one awesome adventure. OO UBISOFT GET YOURTOGETHER AND STOP CRYING FOR MONEY.
