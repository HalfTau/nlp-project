They finally changed the engine, for one that is absolutely amazing, capable of creating beautiful maps, on the forest or in the cities. The gameplay totally changed, and we forgot about swords and were magnified by Connors tomahawk. But they forgot one thing, the game carries Assassins Creed title, and yet, has nothing to do with the Order of Assassins. Its just a native who wants revenge on his mother and on his tribe. The story is not all bad, has good characters like Haytham, who tries to make an alliance between templars and assassins. And as i said in my AC Revelations review, from AC III to AC Syndicate, all games shouldnt be bearing the Assassins Creed title. The game is about american revolution and thats all. And Connor, untill this day, holds the prize of less carismatic character. Its like they were trying to make you not liking him. The game its not bad, its just not an Assassins Creed game.Just gave an 8 because the new engine who made the game fun to play with the new gameplay and free running trough trees.
