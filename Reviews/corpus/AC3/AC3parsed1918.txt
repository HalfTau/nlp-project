i got it for 5 dollars  and i can say it was probably the last decent assassins creed game i could buyDont get me wrong but the early versions of assassins creed were glitchy and you had to parkour yourself on a preset path.In this it feels more natural as a game with in depth story line and concepts to it dedicated to entertaining you with tasksand endless missions  it atleast has a point of view of what to do and something to do. the only downside to this game isthat the part where litterally when the idea and concept of sea fighting came along. It bothers me in two ways. It lead toa even worse assasins creed game dedicated to litterally sailing around the pacific with very little important story lineand intresting charcters. assassins creed black flag two there just plain annoying to drive and manuver as well as just use for travel.But if your intrested in story line games i would suggest this to assassins creed2  assassins creed brotherhood, assassins creed revalations, and finish the series with this game.for atleast a intresting story development of how templars vs assassins plays out.game mechanics are overal a bit strange without a remote so i suggest one for that.i will say that i did play most of the series on a different gaming platform.im not sure if my review is confusing or not but i did enjoy it atleast to a certain point. well the entire series for that matter but ill give it as a series as a 9/10  but for this game a 8/10  due to how long it takes to get out of the tutorial of every single assassins creed game. it doesnt take to long to really learn how to play but they way they make it seem like you dont know how to is annoying and repetitve anyways i wrote this at like 1 in the morning so probably why its so long and well poor in grammar.
