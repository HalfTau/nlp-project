Assassins Creed III is a game in the Assassins Creed series of course P and follows a Native American named Ratonhnhakton and for part of the story follows Haytham Kenway, who is visiting the Colonies from Britain note the game is based during the American Revolutionary War so late 1700s. The game has a story that I liked and hated at the same time, but I would suggest it to everyone  I enjoy the combat thought it can get repetitive very quickly, though its fun to jump around on buildings using a bow to stealthily take out enemies. I may only have 35 hours on PC but I played a ton on the PS3 and Im guessing 150 hours of just playing around looking for chestsPros A diverse amount of weapons to use on enemiesHuntingLarge amount of land to explore 3 different sections of land, Boston, New York, and the Frontier with winter/summer visualsSmall amount of ship missions destroying shipsLarge amount of side missionsA HUGE amount of homestead missionsFellow assassins that can be called upon or sent away to different states to do tasks which provide money, selling materials, etcCrafting is possible with things such as larger quivers, etcCons Repetitive very quicklyDifferent appearances? Nope, just recolorsHunting can get boring quickly though is a great source of incomeExperiences with the ship are limitedAll in all, Assassins Creed 3 is a great game that I would suggest when its on sale, and though I havent tried any games further up the series, Id try those first.
