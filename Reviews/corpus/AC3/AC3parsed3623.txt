Best Assassins Creed to date, imo. I love the changing seasons and the hunting, its like Red Dead but with much more focus on the hunting because you can track animals and stuff. Love the way you can sell and buy supplies, be like a merchant, even though I never really understood how you do it.You can get and level up recruits in this game, send them on missions to make them level up plus you get some cash and stuff to sell.I love the character Connor aswell. Hes very cool and unique from the others and his robes are awesome. The start of the game is reeeally slow, you dont actually get your robes until like sequence 4 or something and you dont even become Connor until sequence 3, I believe. But once you become him, the game becomes really fun.Basically AC3 takes all the cool and good aspects from the other games and mixes it with hunting and a focus on managing and fixing your homestead.The naval combat is really cool too, which is where they got the idea for AC4 because the community loved it. Theyre a cool side feature and you can upgrade your ship to be able to ram enemies or to deal more damage with guns, etc.If youre an AC fan who likes immersion then this game is for you.
