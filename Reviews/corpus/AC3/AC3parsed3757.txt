I will not recommend this game if youre not particularly into the American Revolution history You can have a long chat with Benjamin Franklin about milfs.The game is too slow and monotone. You feel like just cant move forward in the story although you spend many hours, its frustrating.The amonut of cutscenes are too damn high. Well since the scenario isnt so interesting, cutscenes arent either.Poor stealth mechanics. I couldnt get it to work. Everytime it was waay more easier to just kill everyone in the map, which doesnt make you feel like an assassin.Rooftops dont really help you hide! Im especially offended by this.Secondary goals in missions are just pointless and tiring rather than challenging.The game gives wierd instructions to you sometimes. Let me write an example involving most of the bad sides.There is mission that requires you to chase someone. The mission says exactly just Chase him. And youre both wanted by the soldiers. On my first try, i thought i should chase and kill him, so shot him with an arrow mission failed. On my second try, i noticed he has a tail/dont kill mark over him so i chased him without attacking thinking that in some point a cutscene would kick in. NO, the chase just went on and on. By the way the soldiers were just letting him pass through them but not me. At a point a row of soldiers shot me through a HOUSEglitch. Whatever, on my third attempt, i got close to him and left clicked, Conner knocked him down and cutscene kicked in. BUT NORMALLY this left clicking would have ASSASSINATED the target! Great job on changing the controls without letting me know anything Ubisoft!Anyway, overall id say this is not the AC you desire.
