In many ways Assassins Creed 3 is a confused game torn between what works and what doesnt. On one hand you have Assassins Creeds now already signature phenomenal world realization in every respect, which happens to sadly be offset by being in a game which simply cant get me to give a damn in the grand scheme things. This offputting switch in question occurs after a sizable prologue section when game replaces a much more charismatic standin main character with a proper one who has all the likeability of a lonesome rock. And thats probably the main fault of AC3  Connor simply cannot carry the weight to be an interesting character and, by proxy, make for an interesting game. This results in clearly emotional moments and twists falling flat on their faces because theres ZERO emotional investment going on. Your mileage will also obviously vary depending on how much youre into the time period in question, but this has always been one of the stipulations for the series.Thats not to say Connors personality backed by badtoforgettable VA is the only thing at fault here, though. Replacing sprawling cities of previous games with trailblazing colonial towns and explorable frontier was honestly because it directly cuts into the effective use of series hallmark parkouring abilities. But once again, this is seemingly balanced out with the inclusion of brand new sailing segments which manage to, for the most part, be optional and not overstay their welcome... unlike the allpresent repetition seen in other activities throughout the game. Last thing that boggles the mind why change the control scheme, but still retain the need to keep the run button pressed at all times leading to chronic case of Death Grip?
