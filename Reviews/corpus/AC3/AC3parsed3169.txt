Ah, Assassins Creed. So many hours of my life have been sucked away by your mildly repetitious gameplay. Up to a point, every installation in Ubisofts AC series is different  enough to make me curious  and yet the games themselves are really just the same thing dressed in a slightly different costume each time. At least, thats the general impression I get.For the most part this remains the case with AC3, but the gameplay was slightly different. Ive always been annoyed by some of the mechanics namely the occasional attempted leap of faith to any number of strategically placed piles of hay which turns into a rather pathetic suicidal fail but that could easily be attributed to my own lack of skill in the game. Most of the time I didnt have to worry about this in previous installments, so it wasnt bad enough for me to stop investing in the franchise.Unfortunately I spent a good deal of time in AC3 in part due to a new control format for keyboards  staring in dumb disbelief as the main character alternately jumped in the wrong direction and tripped over his own face.Once again, maybe I just suck on an epic level at this game, but the smooth feeling of climbing and freerunning from the past games felt a lot more faltering in this one.I will say that Im very happy with the ending, and the ability to run through the trees and sail a ship was enjoyable. I really liked the guerilla tactics in the wilds, and the combat was fluid and enjoyable as always. The running through the trees was smooth enough to compensate for the awkwardness of the cities.The story was a bit forced and there were several laughable plot points how easily Connor obeys his main enemy, for one.Dont get me wrong  I do like the series of games as a whole, and I highly recommend them. But this game was not a highlight, nor in my top three favorite AC games.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone interested in the Assassins Creed storyline and games, because it ties together some very important things, but my opinion of it isnt high enough for me to suggest it to anyone who didnt really, really like the previous games, or who isnt very interested by the story of Desmond Miles.I would recommend it to those who havent played its predecessors, and those who have played them and liked them.
