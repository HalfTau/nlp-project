ProsYou can pet dogs.Some juicy plot in the outofanimus scenesConsNone of the environments are nearly as vibrant and interesting as in previous games.Having to play as a protagonist who really becomes just plain unlikeable as the story progresses.Medicine is a thing of the past. Now weve got regenerating health, and very inconsistent regenerating health at that. So if you do manage to hide from your attackers, as long as theyre still looking for you, you wont get more than a third of your health back. Not exactly helpful.Money is pretty much worthless, as theres no armor seriously, wtf and you can get the best weapons youre gonna get pretty early on. As long as you have some pocket change to buy ammo and maybe bribe a herald, youre good. And since most of the side stuff ex the homestead only rewards you with money, theres no incentive to do it.Dont even talk to me about how broken the lockpicking is. Whatever happened to just using the hidden blade?Theres still some Assassins Creed fun in there, but its thin and outweighed by just how much of a slog the rest of the game is. Cant really recommend.
