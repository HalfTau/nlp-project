This game is a mess.Played four hours and right after Sequence 5 the game froze in the loading screen. From this point on I couldnt load my savegame anymore. I tried it believe me.After minor raging I decided to start a new game and rush through the game to the point it crashed, hoping it would work this time.And as you probably already guessed, it didnt.Therefore I cant recommend it, although gameplay until this point seemed not bad so far.Ubisoft, get yourtogether for gods sake.PRO Uninstallbutton works just fine
