This is the first of a new type of Assassins Creed game and it has lot of promise and stumbling points much like the very first AC game had. Freerunning has been simplified and combat has been expanded as well as the mission variety. You dont have to play many of the naval missions at all but I found them fun and an added bonus to a game already jam packed with content. The story and characters are satisfactory and Connor isnt a suave cool dude like Ezio but his backstory justifies a more solemn and serious assassin. Overall I dont think this game is better or worse than the Ezio trilogy, I just think its a very different experience. I do have to say there are a few bugs youll probably come across that may annoy you but ultimately shouldnt wreck your experience.The multiplayer is ok based on the two games I had the patience to try. Its not dead, but the new wolfpack coop mode I was really excited about did seem to be dead. The gameplay is very much like the previous games multiplayer oddly enough.And now the part I really loved about AC3 the tyranny of king washington dlc. If you get the base game, you need to get the season pass and experience this ridiculous journey. It takes the familiar feel of assassins creed and throws it out to make a completely differentfeeling actionbased game. And the story aint bad either. The worst part about this dlc is that theres a bug with the first chapter that could totally prevent you from completing it and force you to restart. I advise you to research and avoid this bug if you want to play the dlc.
