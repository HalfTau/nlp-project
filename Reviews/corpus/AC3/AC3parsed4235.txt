There are several things who totally annoying me Some bugs like stuck in loading screen disturb the game flow very hardly One of the main characters takes too late in appearance for me The control with mouse and Keyboard is sometimes very imprecise etc.But if you can ignore the things its a fantastic game!P.S. the Connor end is disappointing and the Desmond end just weird
