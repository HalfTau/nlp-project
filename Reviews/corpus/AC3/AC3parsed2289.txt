The third installment of the Assassins Creed series was the first Assassins Creed game that I played on PC. Immediately I fell in love with the idea of the Assassins and the Templars being behind the American Revolution  and other events throughout history. I loved being able to meet the founding fathers and help them on their quest to gain independence.Even from a superficial standpoint, the game is beautiful and well done. The whole world is immersive and the soundtrack is simply a compliment to it.Even though you have to, for the most part, follow the main storyline, there so much to explore and do it is impossible to be bored. Then, when you do finish everything, it is always fun to play it over again to try to achieve all of each quests goals and achieve full synchronization.All in all, Assassins Creed III is a beautiful and fun game that will always be one of my favorites to play.
