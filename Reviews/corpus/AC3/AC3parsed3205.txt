Whats more American than learning about the American Revolution? Killing Redcoats while youre doing it. Thats why Assassins Creed III is one of the most American games of all time. You get educated about American heritage, both European and Native American, and you get a big dose of good ol American sensationalism at the same time. The battle of Bunker Hill is interesting to read about, but its even more entertaining to swing through the trees and singlehandedly WIN the battle by assassinating a British officer. Who cares if the colonists didnt actually win the battle? Connor, the halfNative American free runner, wields a tomahawk like no one else can, and he uses it to rip through those villainous Redcoats.The United States is great. Learn how it came to be by playing through the Revolutionary War from the perspective of an assassin. For a game made by a bunch of FRENCH and Canadian dudes, Assassins Creed III bleeds USA.
