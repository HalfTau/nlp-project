The game is so and so, i m a big fan of the AC series and was expecting sth more from this title.. The combat system is by far the best until now havent try the Black Flag yet really enjoyable.. But the side quests are boring and dont motivate you to play throught them.the crafting system is so hard to undesrtand , i dont know what to do...also the mansion is fairly made, with mo much options for upgrates like the past titles...also the huge frame drops in big cities makes the pc runs out of power...anyway i played it only for the story so i di the main quest and i rrushed through it up to 1518 hours..also the dlc with upgrates doesnt even arent visible at all, the make no real contribution to the game,,, also after it i go so bored and i dont want to play the George wasinghton DLC , which maybe be good ,, but i dont know.. still the main story is fine, i liked it a lot but dont buy the DLC stay with the main game in summer sales or sth.. this is the opinion of a man who played aall the ac from 1 up  to revelations...
