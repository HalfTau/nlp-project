The current storyline about Desmond takes off stright from the ending of AC Revelations. I really enjoyed the new theme of the game. This time in the Animus, you play a native american character who was driven by freedom. His character is innocent and constant and he does not grow much as a person.The fighting mechanics are the same from the previous games. The addition of the bow and tomahawk were nice. The tomahawk by far was my favorite weapon to use. There is a new health system that works kind of like shields. During combat it heals slowly, but out of combat, quickly. There was definately more to do in this game. There were many mini events that were integrated so that it was seamless. The only replay value for this game was the mini events.Another fun aspect was the hunting system. That was a nice addition that made AC III feel special. The environment was awesome as well. Most places that I visited felt like a new area.The only problem with this game was the lack of cohesion. This game was not as steamlined as AC Revelations. There were naval battleships that you could participate in, but the mechanics were rough. The mini event had little incentive to work on because of the lack of rewards.To sum it up, this game was a nice experience overall. The story for Desmond did finally come to an end.
