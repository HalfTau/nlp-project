How is this a bad game? Allow me to tell you This is a game where the controls actively and aggressively fight the player. This is a stealth game with clunky controls. Stealth games need razorsharp controls to be good, because otherwise the player is constantly at a disadvantage, and this game takes it one step further by having the controls fight the players. Half the time the player tries to turn a tight corner, the avatar runs up a wall instead. This is a game where collision detection is terrible, to a point where the players avatar gets stuck on things that shouldnt be causing the avatar to get stuck. Combine this with bad level design, and players will spend half their time getting caught out, and the other half getting screwed over by the game. This is a game with location detection so finicky that you can stand in front of an objective and be completely unable to interact with it.
