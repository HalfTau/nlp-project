Although it is arguably the worst game in the Assassins Creed series lets forget Unity for a second, no doubt it is still a great game. It is seen as bad probably because players are exposed to already great games such as AC 2 or Brotherhood and it left their expectations so high that AC 3 is seen as inferior.The world is as expected of an AC game Widely explorable, great detail and atmosphere. It matches perfectly with the games timeline, which is the American Revolution. The only issue I have is the A.I, which sometimes glitches out to the point of hilarity.Another flaw of the game, as most players have discussed and agreed upon, is the main character, Connor. His character is very stale and dull, with no drama or excitement to follow as we progress to the game. His motives are clouded with mystery and questions that were left unanswered. Haytham would be a better character to play as.Overall, it is a great game as a standalone. But if you are new to the series, it is recommended that you play the more interesting, better rated games first such as AC 2 and/or AC IV.
