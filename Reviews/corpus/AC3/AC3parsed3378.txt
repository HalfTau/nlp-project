so many things about this game feel broken compared to their other gameswhen playing i will try to open a door but instead either of the characters im playing as will try to climb it insteadwhile doing a chase scene i will chase someone into a room or building thats on fire, a part of the building collapses and the character will do a little movement showing him getting the wind knocked out of him or lose hise balance, when he is doing that animation he walks right into fire and dies, note the player does not have any control of the character during that animation so the entire chase scene has to be restarted, and the chase scene in particular is quite long.the horses get quite derpy too, several times my horses get stuck inside rocks when the horse walks next to it and they will decide to walk even when on flat ground and no obstacles or people around the horse, making chase scenes even more frustrating.enemy ai is even more derpy, combat itself is good but the stealth in this game is atrocious, if an enemyspots you they will mindlessly attack you in the most predictable of ways, most ai will attack you 3 times then pause and stand there for about 3 seconds before repeating, etc etcthe map is a little confusing but thats probably just megraphics are great as is most sound effects and the story is pretty good with slow character development which isnt really a bad thingthere are more pros than cons but the cons happen to often are far worse to deal with
