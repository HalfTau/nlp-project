this game is the reason why i bought almost ac series , except for unity and rogue. still to pricey. most of the story , you played as an indian named o connor, son of templar and mother from native indian. the focus point of this ac series, you learn how to hunt animal, and set a trap to them. or chase them and kill them with your barehand or with your weapon. of course not much different than AC IV. but the story has its own unique than any other series, and somehow still related to AC IV blackflag.
