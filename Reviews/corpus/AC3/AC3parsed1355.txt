I love these games. But something happened and it changed everything.So I had played this game for like 4 hours because it was so awesome. I log out, log in the next day and WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT...Uplay deleted all my progress. Or didnt save it. It was gone and thats all that mattered.So then I got AC4  Black flag for christmas and it was hands down the best game I have EVER played. I liked it more than Portal, which is really saying something.There was autosaves appearing every few minutes and so I felt reassured. And today I login and whatdoyouknow, MY FILE IS GONE! AGAIN!I absolutely love these games but I will never buy one again. You shouldnt fall in love with something so beautiful and then be forced to give it up. DO NOT PAY FOR PAIN!Best wishes.Nic Alex
