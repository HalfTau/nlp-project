Overall7.9/10Great game if you enjoy the series. I honestly could barely tell you what this was about let alone the whole entire story. Im sure I could try to sum it up but I thought it had something to do with 2012 Apocalypse.You play more as Desmond and even use some modern weapons. You go to Brazil which may or may not be a plus depending on how you feel about Brazil. Those segments were enjoyable.Tomahawk is a great addition to Connors arsenal. As far as the story goes, it wasnt too bad. I enjoyed the Revolutionary War angle.I did get the DLC but I have yet to go back to the game as I purchased the season pass after completion.Naval combat was fun, too. I am looking forward to playing Black Flag.I do enjoy some hidden blade combat. The side missions are okay but as far as liberating anyone or gambling, I didnt bother with that much. Even the supply stuff and trading I never even touched.If you take over the forts, play the main missions or DLC missions and especially the ship stuff, as long as you get some chests, you get enough money to not even need to loot.I recommend the musket. Fun stuff.P.S.I know the series is a little overdone, but as far as running in trees which can be frustrating and tomahawking people, this is fun stuff.Worth sale price of under 10 definitely.
