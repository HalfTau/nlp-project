Heres my Assasins Creed 3 experience1. Install game2. Game requires Uplay.. not a good sign3. Options menu has no resolution setting4. Game begins with 15 minutes of unskippable cutscenes involving Desmond Miles aka the worst part about every Assasins Creed game5. Mandatory tutorial6. Finally get to start playing the game, more tutorial introductory type gameplay nonsense7. A this stage the game decides to go full ubisoft, and the environment is flickering out of control, objects on the ship are flying all over the place, performance starts to slow down8. Game does this even after restartBasically, cant even play the bloody game. U B I S O F T
