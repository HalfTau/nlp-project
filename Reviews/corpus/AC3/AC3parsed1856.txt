As with other Assassin Creed games, the gameplay was pretty fun but is honestly nothing new compared to older games. Combat still mainly consists of the standard hit and dodge. Perhaps the weakest point of the game is the story, events were just too predictable and boring. There really was a lot of potential here that Ubisoft missed out on unfortunately. However, I really enjoyed playing as Haytham Kenways character, though I cannot say the same about Connors two dimensional character. If youre looking to play one of the newer Assassins Creed games, you should put your money into Black Flag or Syndicate instead.
