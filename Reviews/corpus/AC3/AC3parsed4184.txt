Assassins Creed III is poorly optimized for PC and only runs smoothish on certain hardware configurations. That being said, multiplayer runs in DX9 and should therefore run fine. It did for meBuy, when it is on sale, or when it is part of the Heritage Collection.EDIT 18/05/2016 After getting a new PC, I can say you could theoretically bruteforce the performance issues with powerfull enough hardware. That said AC3 is simply not fun. One simply cant shake the notion that parts of it was designedbycommitee. The optional objectives more often than not force you to play completely against type, needlessly complicating missions and in a few cases simply turn into a luck based mission if they are not outright impossible to achieve. Controls sometimes force you to jump between barrels and crates, especially funny when you are chasing someone, and the character seems to have a fear of moderate hights and tend to get stuck on tables and the like.Definitely a low point of the series and I just realised that I have still 45 games to go.May god have mercy on my soul.
