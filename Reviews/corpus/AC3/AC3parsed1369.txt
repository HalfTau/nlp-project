This review is about my thoughts on the game, not details ingame! First of all, I have no idea why so many people dislike this game. I think its one of the best games in the Assassins Creed franchise. Ive played many other of the games, and so far, I like 2 and 3 the best. The games graphics improved quite a lot, and the gameplay is amazing. Very little lag came with this game considering my 1.6GHz processor. I play it fine on high settings, with little to no lag at all. Overall, I think this game is amazing and I recommend it to any of my fellow Assassins Creed fans.
