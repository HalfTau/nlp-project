I love this game very much, but the lack of the devs giving attention to the bugs when convoys are attacked as well as naval convoys ALWAYS got lost at sea makes me feel that the game itself is much an incomplete product with imperfections.Please Ubisoft Devs fix the convoy bug. Itll still be played by people like forever, and still the bug is forever unsolved for everyone who bought and play this game for sure.
