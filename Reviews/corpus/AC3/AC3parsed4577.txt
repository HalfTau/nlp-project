Probably second worst in the franchise. It was super short, not enough awesome assignations, lots of clipping problems, the cut scenes are about 4 hours of the 810 hours of the story. Story wise, you dont even have time to understand the characters, in previous games you had time to understand both Altair and Ezio, but here it is all rushed. Overall, I wouldnt recommend buying this game because theres nothing really special about it. I sincerely regret purchasing this game.
