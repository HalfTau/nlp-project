Not a bad game, especially if you like colonialera settings. Some of the mechanics can be annoying, but, overall, its pretty good.The combat is pretty boring, however, as its very flashy and all of the enemies take turns attacking you. Because of this, youll only take damage in combat if you miss a quicktime event to dodge or protect yourself. This is my first Assassins Creed game, so maybe combat has always been like this, but that doesnt change the fact its lowintensity.Exploring the areas and making use of the Open World makes things interesting. For being Open World, though, it does have quite a bit of loading screens. Its not so bad that it ruins the game, but fast traveling is more or less pointless only saving you a minute or two, at best, since you move from loading screen to loading screen. In larger areas, i.e. cities, its a bit more time saved.
