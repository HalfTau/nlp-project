This was the first Assassins Creed game that I felt was worth the effort to play all the way through. I normally love games with plenty of sidemissions, but not this style, for some reason, so I did not 100 complete the game. However, completing sidemissions along the way of completing the main story made for an excellent adventure and had me feeling very good about myself by the end of it.The gameplay, at some points, is frustrating. I still havent played an Assassins Creed game where this isnt the case. In all games that Ive played from this series, every failure feels like the games fault rather than the players, as opposed to how it feels when you miss a jump in a wellconstructed platforming game.The combat here is pretty nice improved over Assassins Creed 2 and its sequels, but improved more in the games coming after this one.As I said, this game really made me happy that Id beaten it when I reached the end, whereas the others before this one had me feeling more like Id completed a chore, even while watching the nice ending cutscenes. I did grow attached to some of the characters, and so I felt invested in the story enough to still care, come the end of the game.Im still unfinished with Black Flag, and I havent played others after that, as of writing this, but 3 was definitely my favorite of the series, so far.
