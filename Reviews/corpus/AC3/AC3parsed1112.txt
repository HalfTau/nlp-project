Nice scenario, American Civil War. First of the assassins creed games to introduce the naval piracy asspect which was nice. Rubbish protagonist, he has no depth and doesnt develop. They could have done so much with the native american angel i feel but its only really for the start of the game then its back to being a mass murdering assassin.
