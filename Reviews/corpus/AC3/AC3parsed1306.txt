If you can suffer yourself through the Astronomically boring mess that is the 3 sequence long prologue where you play as  the cape clad numbskull Haytham, you will find the awesome game that was promised on the store page and in all the trailers and you get to play freely as Connor at last, great game once you get to sequence 4.Stay strong and you can get through it.
