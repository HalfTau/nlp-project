Gameplay is good, as usually.  Everything else sucks, especially the disjointed and nonsensical storyline.  The only likeable and interesting character is one of the villians.  Crafting thats so tedious that youd just rather use the crappy weapons.  Lots and lots of search/fetch quests.  Dont waste your money, even on a 5 sale.  Hopefully the new French one will be better, but im not holding my breath.
