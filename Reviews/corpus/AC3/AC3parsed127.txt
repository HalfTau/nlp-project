Its a fun game because of the simple fighting gameplay, the story is rather confusing especially if this is the first time youve tried the series, but thats not my point. The Endings are rather anticlimactic. and the game is not that welloptimized. and there are still a lot of bugs up untill this day.In conclusion if youre just planning to buy a game that has simple mechanics that is excellent in combat, this is the game for you. but if not. then no.
