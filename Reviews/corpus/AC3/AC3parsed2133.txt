I have been playing for 10hours now... nothing much happened, the story seems weak. I dont feel any connection to the characters, nothing interesting to do, feels like i am doing random missions without any importance. Running around, feeling lost in a beautiful rendered open world.Annoyances like Why the x am I collecting feathers for? Oh yeah, accomplishments, so you can finish the game 100... why the x am I tapping e e e e e to remove a log of burning wood... how challenging... and glitches, characters limbs stretching out like crazy when dying, flying around after dying, invisible horse carts, stuck after riding with horse cart, etc...I loved the first AC, but this one really dissapoints me. Well, I am really trying to force myself to continue this game, as I have read in some review that this is only the tutorial part... and it will be better...hopefully, fingers crossed.Totally not recommending this game at this point... really really hope it will be better afterwards...
