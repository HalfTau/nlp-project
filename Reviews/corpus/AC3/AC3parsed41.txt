After seeing all the hate reviews on YouTube, I really dont see much wrong with this game. Apart from a boringly empty forest, this game is pretty great! If you know the historical events that happen during the time this game takes place in, it makes history more fun. I kind of find it messed up because the redcoats are gone and now you only kill colonist army solidiers and criminals. Its still a fun game though.
