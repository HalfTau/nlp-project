Assassins Creed is one of the best series and the third title doesnt disappoint. ACIII was a huge leap forward for the series and one of the most solid games I have ever played. The story is the best part of the series and it is completely engrossing many new twists and turns occur and I found myself playing hour after hour just to keep progressing through the story.The gameplay is the tightest of the series in my opinion. Free running is greatly improved especially climbing and I no longer end up with sore and tired hands like I would playing the previous titles on a gamepad. Combat has been tuned to be quite fun and I believe a bit more difficult. I found myself using stealth a lot more than in previous games where I might run around like a psycho because there wasnt much penalty for doing so.Overall this is the best game in the series to date and carries on a lot of what made the series great while tightening up everything and then throwing some great new features and the best story to date.
