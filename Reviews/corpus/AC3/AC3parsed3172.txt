It is obvious that ACIII had the highest budget of all the ACgames and you can really tell that the teams who made this game put their soul into it and believed in in. But for reasons unknown people wanted to see yet another Ezio Auditore and therefore didnt like this game. However.. this is by far one of the best games Ive ever played and it will give you atleast 30 hours of pure enjoyable gameplay with great graphics and a good story as long as you dont expect Ezio. I for myself loved Ezio and his story but found myself to be openminded enough too see that Ubisoft had to renew their thinking in gameplay and create a new interresting character. The way this story merges with Black Flag is purely astonashing. And btw speaking of Black Flag, do not miss out on THE greatest ACgame ever!However, buy this game and dont look back. And also check out the DLC Tyranny of King Washington. It might not get great reviews but if you want to keep playing as Rathonahketon you are going to love the DLCs as well. It will extend your gameexperience in an alternative universe for another 56hours and if you are a real fan, it will be worth the money.
