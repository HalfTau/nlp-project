Warning This game plays through Uplay and  you will have to make an account if you havent got one.I played Assassins Creed I and it was a pretty good game.  Assassins Creed II, I kind of forgot I was playing it and moved on to something else..  This one I feel is the first installment that really captured my attention. I love the time period and the characters involved, though the story is fictional.  I love this game because it feels larger and more open than the previous chapters. AC III  started adding facets of gameplay that really lead to a deeper experience and though those facets arent completely polished as they will be by AC IV, there is still a HUGE amount of game here for your money.  The only downside, as with any Assassins Creed game, is when you get sucked back to the lame old real world for missions/story.AlsoI bought the Gold  edition or whatever.  The one with the Season Pass  I knoticed some angry customers who had trouble and at first I thought Id be one.  I tried redeeming the Season Pass at Ubisot Uplay and was denied.  You actually have to use the Redeem Code option at the main menu of the game.
