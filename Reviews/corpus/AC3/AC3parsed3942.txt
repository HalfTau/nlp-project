As much as I love the story and gameplay of the AC series, this one is riddled with glitches and errors. It detracted from the playing experience so much that I had to get up and walk away from the game midway through its most climactic events. I purchased the Season Pass and the game will not even let me use it, so theres another 15 down the drain for a game I do not want to play beyond the basic content anyway. It is just too frustrating!Ubisoft needs to take more pride in their work and decide if they are trying to tell a compelling story and make a good game or just make a deadline.
