The best educational games are the ones that dont feel educational. In Assassins Creed III you can fight the American War for Independence the sneaky way, meeting real historical leaders, discovering landmarks, and participating in significant events along the way. Every one of these you discover will earn you a humorous and informative entry in the games encyclopedia, presumably written by one of the main characters. You can also read Ben Franklins wise and witty proverbs in the various issues of Poor Richards Almanac, if youre fast enough to catch the pages. For those of us who grew up in the 90s with Carmen Sandiego and the Clue Finders, the Assassins Creed franchise definitely fills a void. Unlike most modern games, these are guaranteed to yield a return on invested time. Play slowly.
