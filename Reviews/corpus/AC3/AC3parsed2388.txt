Let me start off by saying.I liked this game. But the ending sucked weiner. The combat feels strong and made me feel like a god. All the characters are pretty interesting. But the backtracking, the chase sequences, and the last act of the game dropped my rating from an 8/10 to a 6/10. It feels like Ubisoft was going for something cool, but ran out of time and just shoved it out the door and rushed it. Only buy this game for the cool Tomahawk killing,naval fighting, and interesting characters. If none of those options interest you, just back the heck out. Also, the tutorial isnt half bad, Haythan is quite cool, and the beginning of the game is the strongest point in terms of story.
