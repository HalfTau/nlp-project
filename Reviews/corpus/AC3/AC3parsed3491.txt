As a historian of colonial America and a fan of the Assassins Creed series who thought the formula was getting a little stale, I was quite happy with this game.Graphics are great, colonial America has never looked so beautiful in a video game and the background historical events are accurate to an astonishing degree just listen to the newspaper men yelling out the recent events from Britain. Gameplay has received minor updates that keep it amusing, the forests provide an interesting dynamic in the primarily urban Assassins Creed universe. I found the main story OTT, and the gameplay eventually became repetitive and the rewards not so great. Ubisoft need to step it up in future games to keep my business coming. 8/10.
