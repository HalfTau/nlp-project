Im a assassins creed fan and i loved this game.It was enjoyable,you had lots of fun exploring the new world,storyline,gameplay,weapons and many more things.I got around 23 hours gameplay and enjoyed every second but had no idea on what other missions do or how to buy weapons, all i did was play storyline.They changed the game so much that i didnt even know how to play the game,i had to relearn the game to play it but once you got the hang of it its ing awesome.I loved the storyline,it was very interesting and lots of surprises happen.The game runs smooth on a win 8 and has no game breaking glitches. 9/10 Must buy on sale or not
