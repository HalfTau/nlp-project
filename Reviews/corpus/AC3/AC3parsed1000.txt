I love Assassins Creed, but this ed up piece of crap is not worth anyones timeThis is the worst game I have ever had to deal with, from the very start there where issues with it. First, the game wouldnt let me use my DLC, it kept coming up with Cannot connect to Ubisoft servers. Then the game decided to reset my save, nearly to the start. After I fixed this, I came back the next day and the game refused to load. Finally, it did, after 2 hours of messing around. Then when I logged back in, it FINALY let me activate my DLC, and after activating it, it decided to corrupt my game save, and any other save that I try to replace it with. So I exit the game, only to find that when I try to go back in, Uplay is uninstalled itself, and it wont reinstall itself again, because it thinks its still installed. Worst piece ofI have ever had to deal with.
