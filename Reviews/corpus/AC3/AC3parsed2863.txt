The most you can say for it is that itll fill up your time. But thats not really worth it when combat is a chore, travel is incredibly boring, the protagonist feels like a block of wood, and half of the gameplay time consists of walking from point A to point B to get a cutscene, then following an NPC to point C for another cutscene. By far the worst of the Assassins Creed games.
