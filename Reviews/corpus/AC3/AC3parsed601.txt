Assassins Side Quest III has a lot to offer, and some of it is actually fun. Unfortunately, for the most part Assassins Hunting Safari III is frustratingly glitchy and unfocused, and the entire thing is plagued by a UI that is even worse than it was in the previous games.  Still, its hard not to recommend a game as gorgeous and ambitious as Assassins Bureau of Land Management III grab it on sale.
