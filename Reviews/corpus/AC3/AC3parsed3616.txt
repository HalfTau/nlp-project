After playing all of the earlier Assassins Creed games 1, 2, Brotherhood, Revelations I decided to try this one out. I was so disappointed. They completely changed how stealth works basically, it doesnt. Hiding in a corner is spotty at best. Targetting is worse than ever no auto lockon for pistols? seriously? just a slow moving cursor? Fighting is horrible you have to counter then attack instead of being able to hold down RT then attack for a counter move like before its completely counterintuitive. Moving around on rooftops is at its worst as well. FreeRunning still doesnt work properly. Detection from random NPCs causes you to be seen no matter what you try to do. I played a few hours, but after that I stopped and uninstalled it due to frustration. I bought AC4 while it was on sale in the hopes that theyve done better with it, so heres to hoping.
