Compared to other games of the series Black Flag included the worst Assassins Creed experience Ive ever had. Stealth mechanics are bad, controls are far from intuitive, protagonist is not likable. Storyline build within the Independence war timeframe is weak and makes templars cause to be more valid, while not giving you an option to switch sides hahah
