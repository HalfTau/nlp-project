It was enough of a change from the Ezio arc for me to be interested in getting. Was it worth it tho? I think so, but make sure to get it on sale or in a bundle. There is definitely plenty to do, but you start to get that weariness that you may be familiar with in all Assassin Creed games. You just start to get bogged down in busy work that you dont want to do, but feel obligated to do so that you can get that upgrade or get those new clothes. I suppose that I just like the historical aspect of the game and thats what kinda keeps me going, but Ubi has stretched this series on for far too long without making gains to consistently reinvent itself or keep itself relevant. It was nice to come back to, but it will be the last Assassins Creed I will ever play.
