AC III was a good experience. I am a fan of the series, Ive played I and II, as well as the card game on the mobile that didnt pan out too well.This is one of the few games that Ubisoft has done well. The look and feel of the game has been pretty universal throughout, so there really isnt any huge learning curves from players who have come from previous editions to see the stroy through. And the controls are quick to pick up for those who are new to the series.The story line takes a few twists and turns that are unique to the series, one in paticular that was completely suprising, not going to spoil it .The only flaw of this member of the AC series is that the controls are so fluid that you can sometimes miss what you are trying to climb up a few times because your char will want to run around a tree or slightly miss a ladder sometimes. But that really isnt so bad.
