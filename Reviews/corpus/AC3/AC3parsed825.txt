Pros The time period is very interesting. The story is really good after Sequence 3 finishes, however it does seem a little repetitive, in the sense they basically copied AC1. Decent parkour, decent combat and improved stealth. Satisfying for completionists.Cons The game is badly optimized. I run it flawlessly in terms of FPS because I have an MSI GTX 1080 Ti 11GB, but when I had an R9 380 4GB which is a 2012 card released in the same year as this game, I used to get around 5060 fps on low settings. Ubisoft cant code for 99 of people can run it really well due to its age, but its worth mentioning. There is a glitch where carts someitmes cant be seen when fps is high, often occuring on 120, 144, 165 and 240Hz monitors. The fix for it, is to cap the framerate at 60fps. This can be done either by using an external program such as Bandicam or Riva Tuner Statistics Server, or by setting the RR to 60Hz and turning VSync on. The parkour is a little clunky, clumsy and blocky at times, and sometimes Connor doesnt do what I want him to do. Several random crashes here and there. The stealth AI is horrible, illogical and . Its hard to believe this game was made by the same company who made Splinter Cell Chaos Theory.Rating 7/10.
