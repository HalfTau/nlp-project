Conner is no Ezio, the first 79 hours of the game is tutorials, the story is weak and most of the time you are simply walking from cutscene to cutscene. I expected a giant open wilderness like Red Dead Redemption but instead u have small chunks of wilderness that never feel real. Its still Assassins Creed so it gets a good 77.5 out of 10 when you actually get to play the game but they really whiffed on this one.
