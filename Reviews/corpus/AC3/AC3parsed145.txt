So far, I have only played the original AC release on up to AC 4, Black Flag. Out of those titles, AC III is my favorite by far, with AC 4 fairly close behind.I really enjoyed the historic aspect of the game. I am sure that liberties have been taken, but seeing the possible interior of an TransAtlantic vessel of the period was very interesting. Was it an accurate representation? Who knows, but it was cool to see and walk around. I liked the fighting mechanics tremendously better than the previous releases. If you get a War Tomahawk or Good Sword and combo it with the Rope Dart, you END fights very quickly. If you grew up outside of the bigcity and enjoy hunting, you can go hunting as much as you like, but watch out for the bears, cougars, bobcats, wolves, and occasional enemy patrols! The ship battles at sea were a gas as well. The battles in AC 4 were much better though, but these are still enjoyable. An occasional bug still will get you from time to time, thankfully, they are very rare.The biggest thing that drives me crazy with this and all the other AC games that I have played are the restrictions for a mission. It seems like they put them in to extend the game as you usually keep replaying the part until you get the 100, that can be a bit of a drag at times, especially with old systems. At least they mostly ditched the timed obstacle courses from the previous releases which was very welcome imho.I know this game took alot of guff from the botched release and being familiar with UBI and their ridiculous philosophy and attitude towards their customers, sadly, it does nto surprise me at all, but they do seem to have cleaned most of the problems up now.I would definitely recommend this game, especially for the history buffs. With all of its warts, it still has a very definite charm to it.Catch it on sale and enjoy.
