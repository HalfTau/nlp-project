Assassins Creed 3 is for sure a fresh product of ubisoft. after 3 years with Ezio, the franchise moves on the the American revolution. amazing open world gameplay, new weapons, new characters, new kinds of objectives and locations. The story is a bit cold but still touching and amazing. my advice if you get AC3 you should also get the tyrrany of king washington that expansion pack will blow your mind.
