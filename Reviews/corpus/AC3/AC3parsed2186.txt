What a nightmare of a game. I love the idea behind the AC story and I tried so hard to play this game, but theres just too much broken. This game does a severe amount of handholding their players through the easiest of tasks, often neglects to show you your optional objectives until you finish certain missions, and straight glitches out at points. I love the story and I will watch a playthrough of this online for the story, but personally, trying to play this game was maddening. What a serious waste of my money.
