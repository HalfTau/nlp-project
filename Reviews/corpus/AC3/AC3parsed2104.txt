Not a bad port, and it has its flaws. Interesting story and cast of characters. Although I do wish they would have had a bigger involvement in the main plot.The controls are pretty solid and the graphics are decent although I wish this would have been ported better.Gameplay overall is solid and the dynamic weather effects are a nice touch in how you move overall.Overall its not a bad game, the character to me is interesting and the overall game is a nice change of pace when it comes to setting.
