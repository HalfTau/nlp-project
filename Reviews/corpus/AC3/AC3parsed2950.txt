Despite a very immersive environment, a lot of bugs remains even after years of updates, resulting in very very frustrating parts... The world is vast and sometimes getting to an end takes like forever, even with a horse because fast travel is not available.Definitely good for AC series fans, just for the plot, but nothing really fancy otherwise.
