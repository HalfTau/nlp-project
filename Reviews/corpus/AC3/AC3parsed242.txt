My least favourite Assassins Creed. Buggy as hell. Uniteresting missions. Sloppy mission design. Not good but if you like the series you should play a little of it so as to get the flavour and if you have never played an Assassins Creed game before, try  Assassins Creed Black Flag if you didnt have a good time with III but  dont give up on the series. We all have stinkers.
