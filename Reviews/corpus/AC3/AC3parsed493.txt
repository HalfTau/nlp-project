I absolutely love this game, I love the fighting mechanics and just the game in general is a well thoughtout game.... One thing... The freerunning was a bit too glitchy for my liking, you would be chasing someone and Then the mechanics want to to run up a wall and lose your target. Besides that, it is my second favorite game in the series. My favorite is the first Assassins Creed Although it is glitchy at points, i love it.
