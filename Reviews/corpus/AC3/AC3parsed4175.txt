I must say i was a bit dissapointed about this one in comparison to its predecessors. Graphics are fine....but gameplay, especially fighting mechanics seems tougher. In assassins creed revelations making combo kills was much easier. Furthermore the story is not as compelling as previous ones. Basically you used have to kill all templars. I missed the atmosphere of the cities in previous installments revelationsistanbul, brotherhoodrome. Here you have Bosten and New york but both cities felt like nothing special.Actually the best parts where the seafights. Wreak havoc on other ships with youre own fully upgraded killing machine felt good.Overall it is still a decent game and worth while buying, but it would be best to do so at steam sale.
