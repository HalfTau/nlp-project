I found this game to be very enjoyable. There are multiple extra secondary story lines off the story which reward you in many ways as you work through them giving you something extra after you finish the story. There are many different type of weapons you can equip if you want to be a heavy, swordsmith or the default knife/tomhawk weilder. The character is a little awkward but kind and easy to get use to after you game the game enough.
