OK, now were talking! In this game, the setting for me was sort of weird. Sure, I should know the American culture living in America...because MERICA!!! !Right?Well I sort of didnt care about the American culture since Im half Japanese... Although I do not care that much about the Japanese culture as well xD.So what am I interested in?Im interested in kicking Washingtonswith the powers of Bear, Wolf and Eagle! NOW THATS WHATS UP! of course thats in DLC.Now to the main storyline, gameplay and etc.There was a lot of content within the game considering a bunch of stuff I dont even want to mention about the beginning of the game because of spoilers... and then the land you get to renovate with the people you help out throughout the storyline. Lots of hard work.Especially hunting, THATS RIGHT, they adapted Cabelas Big Game Hunter, in 3D with an assassiny feel. DAlso the feathers are back D
