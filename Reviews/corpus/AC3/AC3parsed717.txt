Sure, its a good game. Sure, this game introduced the Kenways, and Naval Missions, and all that jazz. Sure, this game runs well. But its just not a great Assassins Creed Game.Pros Introduced Naval Missions First game in the Kenway Saga Naval missions, ship commanding and upgrading, naval combat, all introduced Rope darts and some other weapons introducedCons Overall unlikeable Assassin. Hes so serious and angercentered. I wouldve rather continued playing as Haythem than Connor... Poor backdrop. The British Colonies, Frontiers, Indian Villages? Its like US History Class all over again... BORING! I understand some people like this setting, but this is my opinion Poor story and ending. The ending doesnt give me any satisfaction for Connor, or anyone else. Plus, well, I wont go into spoilers here. Weather is too repetetive. It seems the season changes every mission or two, so its either a. Its the spring and youre trying to get past a steep hill but then a bear mauls you to death, or b. Its the winter and the bear is hibernating but youre moving extremely slow since youre putzing around in the snow trying to get somewhere.Man did I have fun with this game. But I just dont care for it.
