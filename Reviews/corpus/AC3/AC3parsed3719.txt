The Ezio Triology was better, but I still love this game. Ive 140 hours of game spend already within multiplayer. The multiplayer is very fun to do either. In in singleplayer You can climb in trees now, Use your guns to blas enemys. A different way of playing, no more potions because you cant cure in 2 seconds for real.. But a different way of combat. I like it!
