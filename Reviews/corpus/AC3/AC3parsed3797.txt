Fun game. Continues the story from the first 2 games. Added ship combat was a plus. Graphics upgrade from 1 and 2 was great.Only problem is that they changed the control layout so took some time to get used too playing also some control issues with the new layout that makes it tought to play at times but still a fun game to play
