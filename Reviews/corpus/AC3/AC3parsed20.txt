Despite new engine for game lags for my not too strong laptop and many negative things in the game, I really enjoyed this game. It is like a breath of the fresh air after the Revelations which came quite boring.The strongest part of the game are, of course, side missions, especially Homestead missions where Connor has emotions and at least some personality. It was really interesting to complete the game on 100, even collecting collectives was interesting, while in the Revelations I just havent had any wish to play the game after the last sequence.Overall, all Assassins Creed games are good and Assassins Creed 3 is not an exception, especially if played in order with other games from the series, so I strongly recommend this game for any AC fan!
