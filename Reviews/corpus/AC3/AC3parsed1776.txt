Loved it.The controls are better than in previous games which makes me recommend you play the games in order because theres no way Id stand the first or second AC games controls after this. However, the controls are still not perfect and can get really annoying.The game itself is good and the story is interesting, but the DLC story is also great and possibly even more interesting than the main game.Personally I loved the sidequests more than the main quest and loved the fact I could go do the side quests afterwards and that there were more of them after completing the game.The main character may seem boring if you skip the cutscenes and youll miss a lot if you wont do the side quests especially the homestead missions.Having to use Uplay was probably the only actual thing I disliked about buying this game. Otherwise, I would recommend getting it.
