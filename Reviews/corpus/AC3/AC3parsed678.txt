I enjoyed this installment of AC. Going from a totally urban setting of AC2 to the mostly rural/wild setting of this game might be something to get used to but I enjoyed it. Some of the wilderness areas are really quite beautiful. The whole hunting/trade routes management was also a nice distraction from the usual stabby stabby. Story wise, its pretty solid as far as AC goes. Desmond got interesting. And Connor is bae.
