The Gameplay feels very unfinished. The Combat was very weird and unresponsive at times.On top of that I did not enjoy the Story very much. I dont know what it was, but it felt off for me.And the ending was VEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYY unsatisfying/bad IMO.If you consider buying it for the Story only on sales with 75
