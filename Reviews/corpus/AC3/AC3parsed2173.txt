A lot of people dislike this game for various reasons. Its true that the intro/tutorial to the game as Haytham Kenway and young Connor is long, and at times tedious, but for the most part it is well done, and was fairly enjoyable, if a little linear. Once that is done, the game becomes much more open and fun. The other criticism that most people give this game is Connor. I think hes really good. Sure, at first he is really awkward sometimes, and seems a little bit dead pan and lifeless, but he is an assassin after all, and on top of that has had some serious emotional trauma from his childhood. Later, once you begin to understand his character a little bit more, you start to despise those that he despises, and love the ones he loves, and you understand why he is doing what he is doing. All in all, I would say that this game really surprised me. I too, dear reader, read the negative reviews, and was skeptical to purchase this game. It was a choice I do not regret, and I really enjoyed the game.
