good game with a heavy emphasis on hunting and an interesting story line since you play as two different characters. There are many ways to hunt with the bow with a trap and some bait....  Also the bow is interesting there is a mission where you creep up to someones mansion and I only had two arrows and I wrecked like 15 guys  You loot them and get the arrow back
