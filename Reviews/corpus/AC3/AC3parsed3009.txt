I love the game, its really great to see a different elementary school versioin of US history. I love how the game puts you into different perspectives of US history. The story line is really great and the game is quite fun. I cant wait until Unity comes out and we play in the French Revolution.The Horse controls are very frustrating and the damn horse doesnt moveit keeps getting stuck in areas so its faster just to not use the damn thing!!! There should be a way to TURN OFF the parkour. I feel like im playing spiderman with this guy...
