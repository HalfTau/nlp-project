This is a great game. Having played and completed this a few years ago on Xbox 360 its quite nice playing it on pc with hd graphics.Proscombat system is great and not to difficultmassive map with much to exploreNaval battles are goodGood story lineIf you have played black flag then comming back to this, then you will notice curtain comments and stuff of the npcs which is quite intresting.Consim noticing alot of bugs which isnt nice with the npcs and in general gameplay.overal id recommend the game if you can deal with the bugs
