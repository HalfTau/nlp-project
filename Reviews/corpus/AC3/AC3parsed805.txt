The game itself is very good, but it comes at a price of some severe problems. First of all, the fact that you have to use Uplay almost makes me want to not recommend the game on Steam. More often than not youll find that the cloud servers are down and maybe even your 98 save that you were itching to complete has been deleted happened to me. Extremely annoying.Second, the game is poorly optimized for PC. FPS drops are frequent, especially in populated city areas, even with a fairly highend PC and lowering your graphics settings barely has any effect. The controls are okayish, but especially freeaiming is clunky at best. The game also has a tendency to crash randomly but its fortunately not common.Third, the game is still quite buggy. Enemies stuck inside walls or other unreachable areas, animals freezing in quicktimeevents, you name it. While some of them are pretty hilarious and dont break the game, some may require you to restart your game.But thats enough about the bad, lets talk about the good stuff. The game is visually impressive, has an interesting storyline, has good open worldelements and fun combat. Especially the homestead and naval missions were an excellent touch, though I still feel that you arent rewarded enough for exploring who wants to run around collecting pages?. The story is quite strong and much more morally dubious than AC I and II. The game really makes you wonder at times whether you are fighting for the right side, and although Connor couldve been better developed as a character, he is still badass To sum it all up, I definitely recommend this game, but only if you are willing to put up with some Ubisoft BS.
