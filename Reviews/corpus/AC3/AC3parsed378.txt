This game is absolute garbage.The main character, Connor, is emotionless and stiff. A protagonist should at least put the gamer in a state of empathy, but this protagonist kept me rolling my eyes with every line of dialogue.The graphics are on par with the first Assassins Creed game. Its nothing to write home about. The environments are interesting. Running through the forest and climbing trees really felt like a well thought through concept. The world felt nice and open. What was lacking was actual content. Theres not much to do, but admire the vast landscape.The story was interesting at first and I absolutely love the historical research that goes into this game, but it went off the rails with Desmonds story. And the conclusion to both Conors and Desmonds stories were very anticlimactic. The story was a bit contrived and they forced Connor into the American Revolution in a very unbelievable way. And another thing  Im disappointed that they piggy backed on the whole 2012 world is ending hype train. That was a bad year for cinema.The gameplay was good, but stale. I played all the Assassins Creed games before this one, and nothing has changed. Okay, maybe a few things have changed, but Ive had my fill of the series and really wanted something new. Basically, this game kept the core gameplay, cut the fun extra gameplay that was in the previous games, and added new boring gameplay. THE BEST PART OF THIS GAME WAS THE NAVAL MISSIONS. I loved that and if they just made a whole game out if it, Id buy it.In conclusion, the graphics were mediocre, the story was atrocious, the characters were flat, the environments were somewhat interesting but barren, the history was amazing but the characters involvement was contrived, and the ending was very disappointing.4/10
