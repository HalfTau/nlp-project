If you are new to the series this is a great place to start. Due to the progression that the Assassins Creed series has had over the years, this game operates very smoothly, with a huge variety of ways to traverse the environment as well as eviscerate your enemies for the mortal mistake of simply looking at you. On that note, if you arent new to the series this game spends no time breaking ground. As per usual all the voice acting feels is a bit forced despite the phenomenal cast. The game feels like every other Assassins creed with a few small tweaks that seemed much more epic before this game actually came out. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who hasnt played every other Assassins Creed, because I honestly found the series a bit stale at this point. Although Black Flag changed that opinion for me. absolutely loved that game. Totally revitalized the series for me.
