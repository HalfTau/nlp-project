Bought the game onsale for 10.00 expecting it to be on par with its predecessor assasins creed 2. Where the 2nd installment of the franchise was fun, challenging and fluid this game is frustrating, boring and very glitchy. I feel as though the bugs may be a PC only problem but boy there are tons of them. This game is basically Red Dead Redemption if RDR had a sub par story, a combat mode consisting of 2 buttons and twice the bugs.
