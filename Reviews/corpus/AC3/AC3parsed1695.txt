Why do people hate this game?I dont see why people give so much hate towards this game.I feel that this installment in the Assassins Creed series is one of the best. Connor is a strong charecter with an interesting backstory that noone really expected around this games announcement. Whilst the controls take a while to get used to if you previously played the Ezio/Altair games, the engine that brought in these new controls is a godsent. The side missions are fun and the game makes you work to earn your recruits!Overall I enjoy this game more than I did with Revalations but there were some things that couldve been improved i.e more AntiAliasing options and less lag but theyre technical problems that Ubisoft probably dont care about anymore
