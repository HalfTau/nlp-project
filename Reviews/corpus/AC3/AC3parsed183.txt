I enjoyed the Ezio assassins creed 2 games nothing comes close to them so far. This third installment, even tho it is weaker and has a forgetable character compared to the previous games, is a fantastic game. I clocked many hours, simply because I enjoyed playing the missions and story. All due to the time period and how well they put you in it. I am not a fan of the main character, but huge fun can be had in this game, simply because its a blast exploring and interacting in this world.
