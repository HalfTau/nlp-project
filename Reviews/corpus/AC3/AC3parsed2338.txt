Assassins Creed 3 is the 6th entry in the Assassins Creed franchise released in 2012 as a sequel to Assassins Creed Revelations where you play as Connor Kenway, an a Native American in America that fights for the freedoms and is most likely kicked off his land anywaysthanks JacksonThe story is bland, youll get most of the enjoyment from the franchise by playing Assassins Creed IV Black Flag and Brotherhood, if you hate DRM then youll have a good guess on what I feel about UPlay and the graphics are about as good as a game from 2012 can get.Ubisoft, the same people who misuse Iconic thought it would be a great idea to launch Assassins Creed Unity, a freeware unity project developed by Ubisoft to build on the originality of the nowdefunct Digital Homicides project The Slaughtering Grounds and WatchDogs, an Assassins Creed game set in the future that took a sequel for the franchise to be considered more than mediocre.And then Ubisoft thought it was a great idea to cast Yung Magneto as the newest assassin in Assassins Creed The Movie.
