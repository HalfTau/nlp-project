Im now about 90 of the way through, I think. I havent leveled up my character, done any of the side missions, explored most of the world, or done any of the complex economic system. I just discovered one of the symbols in my HUD means that I can recruit and deploy assassins of my own, although I have no idea when I could have used them, as the missions so far wouldnt have allowed for it. Its like they created a photorealistic background of a painting with stickfigure people as the subjects.  It all has absolutely no bearing on the main games story or play, except that some characters Ive never met before seem to be oddly close friends.  Also, you can barely take 2 steps before it starts another 30 minutes worth of cutscenes.
