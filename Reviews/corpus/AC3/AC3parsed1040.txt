Playing Assassins Creed III is like reading War and Peace as a first grader.Profoundly impressive, but pretty much indecipherable.It is my sincere opinion that this is the weakest of all the Assassins Creed entries. Its hard to deal with, the missions are repetitive, there are fetch quests, and you dont play as the main Assassin until five hours in. The gameplay is somewhat familiar to me, as a veteran player, but it has some very confusing changes to the control scheme.However, it advances the story. If anything, that is probably the best virtue of the game  it advances the ingame storyline and shows off the AnvilNext engine. Dont think of this as a game, think of it as a very extended tech demo in preparation for Black Flag.
