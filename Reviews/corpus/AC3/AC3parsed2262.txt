I just want to clarify from the outset that i am basing my review on the part of the game i actually got to play as the game became so bad a little way in that it was rendered completely unplayable. Played the part on the ship, which was decent and made me want to play further but when the ship docked and got to boston i was getting 58 fps. I dont have a crappy rig, its actually pretty decent but for what ever reason the game was just unplayable after that. I have found assassins creed games to run pretty poorly in general but this really was pathetic, the strange thing is that in multiplayer i was getting 80fps but the single player section was just broken for me and as a result i wasted my money bought it for 5 bucks on sale so not a major deal but still. Very dissapointing as it seemed like a goood game, pity i couldnt play it.
