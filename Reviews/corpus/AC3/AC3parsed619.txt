I like the idea of what Ubisoft tried to do with this game.  The end product...not as much.  I love the Assassins Creed game because I am a huge history nerd.  Who doesnt want to run around colonial Boston helping America gain its freedom?That being said, I found the wilderness portions of the game to be incredibly annoying.  They are big, which means it takes a LONG time to get from point A to point B.  Climbing trees can also be annoying when the character doesnt swing to the other side of the tree, even though it is obvious that is what they are supposed to do.Conner, who could have been a really cool character just kind of comes off as a whiney little baby.  Also, the framerates would sometimes creepin into the teens for me, suggesting the game is not particularly well optimized for PC.Still, I love the series so I recommend the game, but only if you love the series.
