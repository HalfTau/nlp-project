Its been quite awhile and AC3 is still my favorite game in the series tied with AC4. The story is fantastic. The gameplay is fantastic. AC3 is the first AC game that really dives into a more open world approach, giving you a LOT of various things to do outside of the main quest.Theres very little I DONT like about AC3.All that being said, AC3 is definitely worth a play or two or three even with its painful and unsatisfying conclusion to the Desmond trilogy. You can get it on sale if you want but IMHO its well worth the full price too.
