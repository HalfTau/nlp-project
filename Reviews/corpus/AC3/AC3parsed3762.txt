It certainly was not a bad game but lets put it this way, i either wanted to keep playing and was totally sucked in or i would rather eat a box of nails then drink whatever came out of my mouth. I failed the same mission over 40 times  because i could not for the life of me figure out how to get past parts of it. it was like oh i see you just started the sequence well heres and explosion that will knock you down so you instantly fail. Oh i see you got passed the explosion, well heres some guards who will slam you into the ground while you lose your target. not only do some of the missions feel as if they cannot be beaten but the stealth is just awful. I have actually hidden inside a empty house without a door while in cover and had the person who i was eavesdropping on walk away from his conversation and spot me without any indication that i was there. If you want to spend hours gettingwhile thinking about killing sombody than by all means torture yourself by buying this but if you want to keep your sanity then go buy something better.
