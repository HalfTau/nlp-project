AC3 looks pretty enough, and the setting types have some genuine moments of endearment, yet the camera angle is close and buggy. The mechanics for movement are janky. Combat has animations, that whilst impressive, are far too long and remove the sense of agency. Never fear about characters or plot lines that would carry interest, they only make brief cameos in what is a long and grindy game. Ive played all AC before this and none after, the pick of the bunch being the original and AssBro. AssRev has some cool grenade crafting. The DLC introduces some features that should have been in the standard game, but break the engine in implementation. So long Connor, your father was more engaging. AC fans only.
