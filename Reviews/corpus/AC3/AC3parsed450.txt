It took me a long time to decide if I actually liked AC III. The game doesnt really get out of tutorial mode until about half way through, which really interupts the pacing and I had a few false starts before I started playing the game to completion.I just didnt connect with the plot or the characters in the way I had in previous titles, I found Connor to be supremely unlikable and the plot bumbles around, attempting to jam in historical events and characters. I admit I had ruined the early plot twist for myself a number of years ago by halfwatching a housemate play it whilst drunkenly shoving a takeaway into my mouth, but it was obvious it was coming.We also see the wrapup to Desmonds story, I wont give any spoilers but his playable missions were fun, if a little short and linear.Gameplay wise its pretty good, free running and fighting remain as enjoyable and fluid as ever, with new gadgets and weapons to play with. Exploration is thoroughly enjoyable, with the Frontier actually feeling vast with several distinct areas and lots of collectibles.The Naval missions were the high point for me, with a good variety of mission types, interesting upgrades for the ship and associated main plot missions really set the base for the following game  which I look forward to playing.Its quite a buggy port which Ubisoft have never bothered to patch, as it can break gameplay  especially for some of the Homestead missions. It often crashed for no reason, but the autosave is pretty good so its not a huge issue, just frustrating.Overall, I guess I enjoyed the good bits more than I didnt like the bad bits. Its often been described that the AC Franchise is a downward sloping line after AC 2, and I tend to agree.
