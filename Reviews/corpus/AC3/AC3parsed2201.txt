I firmly believe this among the worst games of 7th gen. The biggest issue is actually not how bad it is but how good it could be. Its got great potential with a Metis HalfEnglish HalfNative Assassin, yet instead of doing anything with that his character traits boil down to CHARLES LEEEE. The gameplay is nothing new in fact the old engine honestly felt much better. Dont waste your money.
