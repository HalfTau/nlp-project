Not the best Assassins Creed because of a few things. First and foremost, they tried doing what they did for ezio three games of charecter development in one game for Connor. It didnt work outwe did not attach to his charecter. To tell a good story, you need decent voice actors. Connors voice actors is... well... horrible. But there is a very good reason for that.You appreciate the game much more if you look into all the development that went into it. Connors voice actors sucks because he is one of very few people left in the world that speak Connors native tongue. The developers did a fantastic job at making sure as much of the game is as historically accurate as possible Washington is where Washington was, this battle happened at this time with these people present...while still tying in the fictional aspect.Dont get me wrong, the game is still fun, I liked the story. Its just not the best AC game. If you havent played any AC games in the series, I strongly recommend playing Assassins Creed 2 first read about AC 1, as most people get bored by the repetitive gameplay
