Save your money and dont buy this game. The controls are unbelievably cumbersome and the storyline is a flop. Missions are terse and lacking action. This feels more like wasted time walking from cutscene to cutscene in a terrible Blist movie. Regardless, youll spend more time watching your character climb every possible piece of the environment... except what youre actually trying to climb. This is the worst 20 Ive spent in years. Dont make the same mistake.
