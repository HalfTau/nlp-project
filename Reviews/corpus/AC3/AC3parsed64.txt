Set during the American revolution this is the best of the Assassins Creed games imho. The atmosphere and feel of the game is fantastic and you really feel attached to the character and part of the world.This is one of the first times in the series I actually completed a few side quests and enjoyed getting involved with the side plot.Without spoiling they managed to flip the plot around quite well so you find yourself really hating and wanting to kill the games targets, unlike some of the later games in the series there feels like a real purpose to your mission.This game gives a lot of the usual assassins creed weapons but as per usual for my personal play style renders quite a few obsolete. There just seems to be something about beating English Red Coats with a tomahawk which never ever gets old. I feel that the developers watched the 90s version of Last of the Mohicans as there are some real similarites to the whole tomahawk / knife fighting style.Another thing i loved about this was that if you start random fights in towns you quite quickly get heat from other enemies and hunted down. As anoying as this can be when an enemy gets in your way and your forced to kill them mid mission , it feels far more realistic, unlike the syndicate style city wide killing sprees which in reality would have made the famous JTR look like an amatuer.My issues with this game and the whole series really is the meta plot and modern day parts of the game. I really couldnt have given a damn and watched / interacted with them out of game progress rather than awe and wonder.I really hope  that they could have taken the reboot in a totally new direction and binned all this garbage.Still AC3 is the pick of the series yup better than 2 and all the other Enzio guff.
