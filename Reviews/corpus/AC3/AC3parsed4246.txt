Assassins Creed 3 is a good game, or may I say it SHOULD have been a good or even great game... Assassins Creed 3 looks good and has a good story, but the gameplay feels much more sluggish and unresponsive when compared to the other Assassins Creed games... On top of that, Assassins Creed 3 is also one of THE MOST unpolished and most buggiest and glitchy games I have ever played! It is as if Unbisoft had this great vision for Assassins Creed 3, but they lost total interest in the game and instead rushed it out to make a quick buck and hoped we would no notice.The game is full of models and textures popping in and out., it is annoying as hell!You also see NPCs spawn in and out in front of your very eyes!The only reason to buy this game is if you want to continue the story...
