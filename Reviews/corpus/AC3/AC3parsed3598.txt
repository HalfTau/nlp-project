Worst in the entire franchise. Buggy beyond excuse, slow plot, clumsy controls, and ultimately disappointing. Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag is superior to this in pretty much every single way. Only buy this game if you have a raging lust for the American Revolution or wished bad things on Desmond.4/10Final Thoughts Seriously. Black Flag was the game that actually motivated me to pick this back up and finish it. Benefit of the doubt. Never again.
