WARNINGSpoilersThis game is a great piece of work.The whole story was so touching that I almost burst out in tears.Haytham and Connor are ironically doomed to be enemies despite being father and son.Sharing the same blood, they both are stubborn. I wish they had a happier ending and got to know each other a better way.
