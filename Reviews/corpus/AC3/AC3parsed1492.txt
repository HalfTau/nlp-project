Assassins Creed III  Loved it.I have read a lot of peoples negative comments towards this game. I will respect their opinions of course. They felt Connor was a boring character and the game as a whole was not as good as previous AC games. Ok.I must start with saying this AC III is my first AC game I have ever played. I have not played to this day any AC games prior to this one so I can not comment on any comparisons.The Story however and the background setting for AC III is my favourite and will always be my favourite, and yes I can say this without playing any previous AC games and any future AC games I may play sololy because the setting and story fall in the time frame of America being born. The history of America has always been an interest of mine since I took American History in High School. This alone may make my opinion of this game bias and if so, well I can not help it.I love the historical pieces of information you can get in this game. Would I have loved this game if it was set in another country? Or another time itself in history? I dont know.This game is not without flaws though, the parkour is not perfect. A lot of times I found myself climbing up things when I was trying to just run by or get stuck on random objects or even fall off the side of buildings. lol I couldnt get mad I just pretended that this was part of a realistic touch the developers put in the game, after all, how long could a person parkour in real life before they fell to their death? Also the couple times you had to do ship fights  that was horrible. Just horrible, however that will not keep me from recommending this game. 2 ship fights in the entire game wont kill it.
