At one point i overwrote my previous Uplay password. Why it didnt tell me that it was already used and said that i couldnt use it i have no  clue. I could not log into my Uplay account and thus could not play Assasins Creed III. I ended up having to cancel the purchase on the credit card i used resulting in a 2 month steam community ban. Another thing was that the credit card i used for buying it became an unaccepted method of purchase after the incident. Ubisoft needs to improve Uplay software or better yet, just get rid of it. Lord knows they wont do either.
