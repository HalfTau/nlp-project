Rather interesting, gorgeous landscape, many things to do, mostly good freedom openworld feeling.BUT, serious flaws that definitely prevent me from recommending this. UPlay, and overall Ubisoft crap. Yeah, not that big of a deal, but constantly annoying. Keyboardmouse work... mostly. Untill you get stuck into a menu. Or it stops responding during a fight. or... well its obviously not really been worked on. I guess I should use a controller... luckily enough I own one. But I hate using it, Im not confortable at all with it, and playing on a PC, I should be able to use PCspecific controllers, for christ sake. Large chunks of the game are barely interactive cutscenes. For the introduction, allright, I can bear with it. But it goes on, and on, and on... entire missions are cutscenes disguised with quicktimeevents and contextual gimmicks. Even out of the main plot, the freeform gameplay often feels like gimmicky minigames and is riddled with QTEs. Same spirit for the simplified freeform highprofile running, which is ACs signature your character keeps trying to adapt to things you didnt ask for, bumping into corners, jumping for an assassination when you just intended to drop from a roof peacefully, climbing into an inclimbable ? wall when you were trying to run away...Overall, a promising, but ultimately extremely frustrating and infuriating game. Ill probably give up on it.
