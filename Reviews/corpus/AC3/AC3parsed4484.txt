Save your money. This game is absolutely crap on so many different levels. The biggest being the stupidest interface I have ever seen in MANY years of gaming. The instructions on how to use certain abilities are succinct, but rarely work correctly.I have over 3 hours in 5 done and have yet to meet the guy Im supposed to be playing Connor. At least half of that time is in cut scenes...unacceptable.
