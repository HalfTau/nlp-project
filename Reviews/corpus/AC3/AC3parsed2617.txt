Along with every Assassins Creed game forgetting about Liberation and Unity, Assassins Creed III has noticable flaws some more than others but is still charming.I was heavily dissapointed that you can literally MOW DOWN waves of guys, along with how long it takes your noteriety to go up. You can kill patriots, then start a mission to lead the same guys into battle. There are only 4ish types of enemies. Some optional objectives are almost IMPOSSIBLE until your fifth try. The tutorial is too slow, some missions have t enemy placement Clearing the Redcoat fort as Haytham rings a bell,Some parts are stupideasy, some parts are stupidhard, and almost 70 of the time it feels like Connors thrown into the middle of the revolutionary subplot To be fair I can blame the fact thatIIIs setting is welldocumented, recentish history compared to Ezio or Altair.However, I still truly love this game despite its misgivings. If you live in the States or Canada the timeline is relevant, even if youre British with the DLC. Depending on how you play, you can make up for a flawed sneak system. Both the neutral NPCs and enemy NPCs change behavior depending on the change of plot eg the start riot ability after the Boston Tea Party.Assassins creed III is not the best  since II, but it is still an enjoyable experience, even on my  setup. My only seriously negative gripe is the texture for the bushs. I CAN CLEARLY SEE YOU CONNOR. ALL THE GUARDS MUST BE BLIND.
