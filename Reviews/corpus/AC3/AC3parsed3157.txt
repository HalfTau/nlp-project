While I like the Assassins Creed franchise, the games have been steadily declining in quality since the inclusion of multiplayer in Assassins Creed Brotherhood. This one is no exception. While I didnt think this game could be worse than Revelations, it somehow managed it. The game is clunky to control, with Connor not doing what you want him to around a third of the time, the story is both unbelievable in the bad way and uninteresting, and bugs somehow still run rampant a year after its release. Its only redeeming features were the homestead missions and the naval combat system. Not sure if I will play Black Flag after this one. 3/10
