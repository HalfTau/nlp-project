Assassins Creed III is a good game but the bugs in the game ruined the game for me.PROSThe story was great in my opinion because it takes place in the revolutionary war.The battles that took place on the ship were great.The combat for the most part was great.ConsBecause of the bugs, it made me rage multiple times.Sometimes the controls would glitch and certain buttons wouldnt work.I had to restart missions because the enemies would not appear to progress the mission or a cutscene would not be triggered.Some of the enemies would hurt you even if you counter, and the game said nothing about how to defeat them, so you just keep hitting them for a minute or so and out of luck you will kill them.For the first 24 hours you dont play as the assassin, which would be fine if it wasnt extremely boring.It would play the same music sometimes as when your walking when you are fighting enemies.Not really related to the game its self but in it you can skip cutscenes which I like, but you cant skip the credits which takes over 20 minutes to end.I have not played other Assassins Creed games so I hope that the other games arent as buggy as this one.3/10buy it in a sale
