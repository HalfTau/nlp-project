Assassins Creed III was a shift in the dynamic of Assassins Creed gameplay adding a much larger open world mechanic  different from previous titles in this series. I found the main story to be engaging and well thought out. Connor makes a great protaganist for this game! The sailing part of this game is good but not nearly a good as Assassins Creed IV which centralizes around naval combat and travel. Definitely a great pickup for RPG fans!
