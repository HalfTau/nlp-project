So far the worst PC port Ive ever seen. No matter how good is your graphic card, if its not in the list of the blessed nvidia ones you will have your 15FPS regardless the video setting. Game is kinda okay. You cant tell if the game mechanics are crap or you just suxx as a result of 15FPS. Game interface is just ugh.I like AC and I need to know how the story goes. Thats the only reason I play the game. However I swear a lot.I paid for it, return it, got a refund and then the Ubisoft gave it for free. What a story. Better than Twilight.
