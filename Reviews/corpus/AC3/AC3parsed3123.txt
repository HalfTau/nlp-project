Assassins Creed III  CompletedAnother Assassins Creed game completed. Though the game was still enjoyable, there was something that didnt quite feel right about this.Maybe it was the fact that a quarter of the way through you swap playing who you think is the main character and move onto someone new, Im not sure. There didnt seem to have that sneaky assassins feel that the other games gave you either. Very little need to go running across roof tops or hiding in back alleys.The actual game play is all the same as the previous, probably a little bit easier to be honest. I actually managed to get right up until Chapter 10 with the original weapons you get from the start without having to upgrade. There is no real need to craft anything if you just want to complete the story, you can complete all the chapters with the bare minimum effort being put in.The length of the game is very good, I only finished the main story and this took me twenty four hours. My actual completion rate is about 30 according to the statistics page, so you can probably ramp up about fifty hours of game play in total if you wanted to do all the side missions and challenges.Graphics wise, looks really nice. Playing it on my big screen TV with the Xbox controller really shows off the power that PC gaming has over consoles.This is in no way a bad game, its just not as good as the previous titles in the series in my opinion. I would still recommend this game for anyone who classes them selves as a gamer at heart especially for the price that its at now, even when not on sale, you are getting a bargain at 14,99.More reviews at
