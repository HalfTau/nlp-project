 Generally good game, despite many reviewers and critics stating that it is one of the worst in the AC series. The storyline could be better, but the combat, graphics, soundtracks and mechanics are generally good. If youre a fan of the AC you will appreciate, however dont expect much change or anything thrilling to happen in this game.
