Now this game tore me in many different ways. I enjoyed the combat, the different weapons, the new enviormental system and the finally the new seafaring missions. They were all great additions and it felt very fun to me. Many side missions and other things around the map kept me tuned in for hours at a time. My biggest fault is how boring the main character is. That drags down the rest of the game because he simply is not exciting. The story was fantastic I very much enjoyed it along with the new enemies ect ect ect. I would reccommend it if you were a fan of the previous games and even if you werent I had a lot of fun with the game.
