This is such an incredible game with amazing graphics considering the time it came out. I loved how they added the feel of what it was like to play as a templar. Connor is probably the best assassin I have ever come across. I love the juicy storyline and how they ever have extremely sad parts. Which is rare in an action game like this. Definitel one of the best games I have ever played. 10/10.
