This was a very satisfying gaming experience, from start to finish. Responsive controls, good graphics, good story that gives real depth to the bad guys by making you see their point of view and question whether youre doing the right thing. The Tyranny of King Washington expansion was totally worth it, giving several hours of storydriven gameplay in an alternate timeline.
