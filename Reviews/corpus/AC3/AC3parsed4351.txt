Desmond Miles, the virgin bartender detailed in a previous review, awakens aliens from a distant pastearth that used to be angels in a vain attempt to save the world from a solar flare, thus derailing the entire franchise completely from its original alienfree conspiracy theorydriven DNA memory theme.Every choice youve ever made in the previous games is irrelevant, and Desmond dies to save the world which is never actually explained nor justified, because he apparently died to release a demon witch ally from beyond the stars. It was previously revealed that these ancients where beyond space and time, but that was scrapped at the last minute to present probably the best example of shoddy plot planning Ive ever seen in a title.Nothing makes sense, which is intentional, as the last few AC titles have been cliffhangers to sell future products. See also Subject 16, The aztec prophecies, The Truth glyphs, The entire purpose of downloading KungFu into Desmonds brain, Desmonds offspring, Lucy was a secret agent and they LET us escape, etc etcAssassins Creed was originally supposed to come full circle, with Desmond waking up exactly where he was because the entire franchise is supposed to be a memory of a memory, of a memory. Desmond is your past relative and youre reliving Desmonds memories. All thats gone now because Ubisoft has quite literally casualized and dumbed down the franchise further with each game, making the story just as  as the control scheme.If you place each plot point established since AC2 Brotherhood, youll quickly see the great majority of them make ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WHAT SO EVER.
