I cant help thinking that a shark has been jumped somewhere... This isnt a bad game, and it isnt even the worst of the series. But it sure isnt the best. It turns out that the American Frontier just isnt as engaging a world as the previous games. It turns out that our new protagonist is a boring sap. Worse, it turns out that the big overarching story has a pretty weak ending. Do I recommend it? Yeah, sure. I guess. Theres stuff to do in it. Ive thrown 60 hours at it. But Ive got to be honest, some of those hours were a slog...  Once it drops below the 40 mark, I might pick it up, but the full price feels like a ripoff. Oh, lastly, the moronic UPlay system is still there, but it has been somewhat defanged. It is now just annoying and stupid instead of actively evil. So its got that going for it, at least.
