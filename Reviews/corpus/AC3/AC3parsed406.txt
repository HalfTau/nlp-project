As one of the best Assassins Creed games out there, AC3 introduces a whole new host of characters save for our long time friend Desmond and his crew. By bringing a brand new Assassin, Ratohnhaketon also known as Connor, and placing him right in the middle of the American Revolution, you get to meet George Washington, John Adams, Paul Revere, Israel Putnam, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and many others, making it one of the best games in the franchise to date.
