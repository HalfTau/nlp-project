This Assassins Creed game is awesome! The story line is great! The multiplayer isnt really my thing but the gameplay really stays close to the classic AC style. My favorite AC game has two be either this or AC2, and the only reason AC2 would beat this game out would be the fact that the sub story takes up way too much of the plot at the beginning of the game. Overall really good game!
