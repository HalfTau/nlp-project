Though this game may be a little laggy, it is fun, realistic and a good history lesson on the Revolutionary War. People may complain that they play as Haytham for a third of the game, but it gives you an interesting story and point of view when you start playing as Connor. New animals are included in this game such as dogs, cats, chickens and cows to pet, rabbits, deer, and foxes to hunt, and wolves, bears and cougars to fight. Much more is included in this game, such as your not on the British side nor the Yankee side, but thats just a simple summary.This fast paced game may give you a struggle or two, but have fun!
