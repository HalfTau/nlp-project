While not the worst of the AC games Ive played, its not exactly the best.Gameplay 7.5/10. AC3 has simplified gameplay compared to the previous titles. Its actually not bad, since combat and freerunning have both been made a lot more fun by it. In regards of actual stealth, however, I found it lacking.Graphics and Art Style 8/10. The previous AC games looked OK, but they were nothing special. This game has a major upgrade compared to them, and it ends up looking pretty nice.Music and Sound Design 7/10. Nothing stands out, although some scenes and gameplay sections were made a lot more exciting by the background music.Writing 7/10. AC is no stranger to the cliffhanger, but this game has one of the cruelest and cheapest Ive seen in a while. I wont take any more points away, though, because the first few hours carried one of the most unexpected and mindexplodingly logical twists Ive ever experienced.Stability and Glitch Control 7/10. The game is still playable, and its nowhere near as fukt as Unity wahay, topical. But some were very immersionbreaking, and I remember very well one stealth level being royally messed up when rubberbanding caused an enemy corpse I had hidden to rocket right into view of the guards, leading to me being discovered. Similarly, I had to initiate a few restarts when I got stuck in world geometry.Final score 7.3/10. Its a good game, and Im glad I played it, but I still recommend getting it on a sale.
