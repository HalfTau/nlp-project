Assassin Creed III is a very fun and adventurous game. If you like to drive boats, played the past Assassin creed and enjoyed it, like to do some hardcore jumps and assassinations, have a long time gameplay without getting bored, I would totally recommend you buy this game. So far I have no complains with the game other than the multiplayer. The multiplayer in my opinion really isnt fun because Its practically the same thing every time. But dont get me wrong when playing with friends, its a lot of fun.
