Wow. This game was a great piece of interactive cinematic experiences of the American Revolution, and the major events in it. Coupled with a great soundtrack that didnt overpower, but enhance the playing experience, this clearly became a top cantputitdownuntilIfinish game. Good backfill on story line for those who havent play the series yet. Sea battles were amazing, and were my favorite part of the game. Theres nothing like going through and wrecking a whole bunch of lobsterbacks to the plot music in the game. I really enjoyed this one.There were too many unimportant sidequests lots of grinding for 100, runs from uplay, and much better to play with a control than keyboard.All in all, a must play for any American. Youll get a history lesson too if you read your database 5/5
