This addition to the AC series brings a new level of gameplay and frustration to the franchise. The continuation of an awesome story line and awesome game mechanics with some improvements make this worth playing for any fan of the series.The goodExcellent, emotional storylineTons of great historic recreation and informationMore badass weapons and moves a lot moreFree running through trees addedCrafting and trading system added not perfect, but definitely engaging and fun to profitNaval battles added this is definitely one of the highlights of the game. I always looked forward to more naval battlesPhenomenal graphics as are standard for the seriesOptional mission objectives add new challenges to the gameplayThe badThe functionality of a lot of moves is a little off. This made me yell in frustration. running up the wall when I wanted to just run alongside it, not grabbing ledges, etcMany of the optional objectives only have one solution and you have no way of knowing what it is. They have made only one solution possible by making guards omniscient or mission fails when you step into a certain area. Several optional objectives required failing over and over until I found the solution. Or I found it on youtube. Or I gave up on it because its ridiculous and the reward isnt worth it.With the added trading and crafting, I would have liked to see more options on how to spend my hard earned cash.Many of the gathering systems, while really cool, are ultimately useless.
