The pace of gameplay sucks.Yet the whole story is so great by defining FREEDOM in a breakthrough convincing way i could forgive any flaws.Not mentioning how vivid and unique the main characters are, especially after reading the book of Haythems storyline.But for gods sake why Ubi had me play both father and son andin the end?I was so confused and unwilling iand searched for a nonexistent solution for over 1 hour.Still best story ive ever played.
