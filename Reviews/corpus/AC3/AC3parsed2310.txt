Ok first of all this is by far the best AC from I to III. Combat is enhanced is more fluid and less static. Firearms no longer need long stupid aiming. And you get to drive a ship. Well on the other hand as I said this is the best AC so far it is also the worst AC when it comes to frustration. I became frustred so many times with this game... I mean glitches, bugs and other minor or major anoyances. Not to mention ridiculous popin and actually popout. Obviously there is no draw distance slider or setting and thus youre stuck with only one option even if you have beastly HW you cant do nothing about it. I was running away from guards in NY because I didnt want to fight them so I turned to side streets and pop there was a whole dead squad shooting me.You need to learn to live with it. Gameplay is solid, movement is quite better than in AC2, combat is much better than in AC2. And I almost forgot hunting, yes you can hunt animals and run through american wilderness.7/10
