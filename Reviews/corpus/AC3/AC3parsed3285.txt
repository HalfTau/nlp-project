The next part in the story of Desmond Miles. Interesting setting in the nature with the native americans. Awesome missions and historical settings is great. Though, from the Assassins Creed franchise, I think this is the least epic one. However, it is still a very good game like you are used to with the previous titles. Definitely worth buying especially during sales
