This game is the cats meow of Assassins Creed! You can do EVERYTHING in the game. Ubisoft took this game to a whole new level. They took all the elements of the previous games and wrap it all up in one. The graphics are superb.This is a must have. I recommend all of them.If youve never played any of them, you should start from the very first and play them all. Trust me, you wont be disappointed. The story is progressive through each game. Its like watching a movie series. AWESOME!
