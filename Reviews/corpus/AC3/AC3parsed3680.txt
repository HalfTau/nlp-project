I have been trying to play this game for a year and Ive just finished the game. This is by far the worst Assassins Creed game of the series only because of this main reasons The story is awful because of its incoherent and inconsistent nature with the rest of the series. The ending is quite similar to the Bioshock infinite ending except much more vague and as a result it is a bit of a mind which makes the already crazy plot from the previous games even more difficult to understand. I would not recommend purchasing this game at anything more than 10, you may as well skip this instalment of the AC series and watch a synopsis at the beginning of AC4 or a video online.
