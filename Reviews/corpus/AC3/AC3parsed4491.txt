Assassins Creed 3 is a paradox. The game itself is beautiful and completes the entire Creedcollection and is propably one of the most beautiful games I have seen since ever, but as a real fan of the Animus there are a few differences from the former games in the series.Nonetheless, this game is worth every penny I ever paid for it, and I even got the Extended Edition! Marvellous!
