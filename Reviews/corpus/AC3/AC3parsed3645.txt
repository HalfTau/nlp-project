No voice overs for this game. When the cut scenes happen there is no sound of the people talking. This also happens in any area where people congregate and talk, but there is no sound of that happening.I bought this in the Winter Sale and emailed to ubisoft about this. To date I have not had a reply. After searching the internet there are many other people suffering the same problem.For me, I will no longer support this title range or any other promoted by ubisoft since they no longer stand by their product it seems.Buyer beware.
