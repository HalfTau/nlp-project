The game is awesome,I really like the story,the graphics,new environment. Americas nature is awesome and the developers managed to show the players its beautiful sights. The fighting style has changed from the last games, players can perform a variety of combos,depending on which weapon you have. Hunting was also added to the game along with the domestic animals! The developers showed how European people managed to settle in America. As always,there are many historical places,events,people and this is why I like Assassins Creed games. I encountered some bugs, but they did not manage to break the game or interfere with the main story progress. All in all,the game is worth buying, really nice game, especially for people who like history.
