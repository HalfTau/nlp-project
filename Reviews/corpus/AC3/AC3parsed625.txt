Wow, this game is a colossal waste of time. Let me begin by saying that I got into the AC series in early 2016 starting with Assassins Creed II, and I fell utterly in love with the series...the gameplay mechanics, theme, and story that were so welldone for the Ezio trilogy. If you played the Ezio Trilogy, you know how endearing the characters and overall story became to you. You loved it. Now, imagine playing something that looks a little bit like one of those games, but where you play as a bratty, unsympathetic main character who constantly makes poor decisions and lets the bad guys get away. EVERY TIME. He is literally always complaning and angsty. Now sure, when hes a young man, that may be acceptable and one could brush it off as him just needing some time to be impetuous and foolish and learn from his mistakes. This is what I did. I hoped he would grow up. I hoped the story of this game would get better. I was sure eventually it wouldnt end up being a colossal waste of my time. NOPE. I was wrong. So very, very wrong. Not only is Connor a highly unlikeable character and the story a hideous thrown together recipe comparable to that of fruitcake, but the gameplay controls SUCK in this game. Theyre not intuitive at all, and 1/3 of the time they dont work when you need them to the most. This wouldnt be SO bad if it were not for this game having several severely buggy missions that are nigh impossible to complete, let alone with 100 sync IM LOOKING AT YOU, CHASING LEE. It makes me wonder what bitterness the developers and playtesters had stored in their cold, dark hearts when designing and testing them. Did the playtesters even playtest, or were they just playin?In summation Do not play this game. There is no part of it  not even the finale  that has a redeeming factor for all the hours of frustration and poor storyline you will have to endure. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER GOOD GAMES YOU COULD BE PLAYING. DO NOT PLAY THIS ONE.
