For all of the bad rap this game gets, I really enjoy it. One of the many complaints about this game is the man of the hour himself, Connor. Very wooden and not much to him but hey the guy is a Native American who has to deal with old world people from accross the Atlantic, who wouldnt feel awkward? The combat system is decent, for reference look up the Patriot with Mel Gibson when he pulls out his tomahawk, its the same. However the story is great that is if you are not from the U.K. Conner teams up with George Washington, Ben Franklin and many other familar Founding Fathers to help drive the British off of our sorry American talking new nation. This game holds a special place in my heart because it feels like you are fighting in your own back yard and when you win its satisfying. Now as for the character story, its basically Star Wars, Im not kidding look it up on youtube, its Star Wars. Beat for beat it follows the Wars mythos to a fault. In all its not terrible but it if you are an American who loves his/her own history. Pick up a copy, its really worth, espically for the DLC Campaign which is beyond cool. Conner has powers and is a superhero vs the evil King Washington and his new Empire...muhahahha.
