If you like money then dont pay for this garbage produced by Ubishit, are you offended that i called them Ubishit and not ubisoft ... then you deserve the right to be their customer after themove they did, instead AC4 or any AC except BUGnity or AC3 is worth buying up until now.The story is kinda....... meh , i expected way more than it actually did, it was just a sour taste in my mouth. Still if you are an Ubishit fanboy you can buy this, i sincerely regret the 4 euros i spent on this garbage on the russian steam store  bought by a friend from russia .With this and Unity , Ubishit have sunk their flagship series.
