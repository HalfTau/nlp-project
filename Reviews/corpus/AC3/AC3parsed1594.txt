Dont take this as a hard no recommendation. Assassins Creed III is in many aspects a good game and for some time I even enjoyed it. Its gorgeous, the traversal system has been improved over its predecessors, it has a great multiplayer mode and the beginning of what become a hit on the series naval combat. But its also one of my go to exemples of why I rarely buy AAA games anymore. Its bloated with a lot of poorly planned, poorly implemented and overall pointlesss sidecontent designed to make the games feel bigger and longer than it actually is. The story rhythym is so poor that even though I bought the game just to finish the 2012 arc I gave up halfway through and read the ending online. Bland characters everwhere, derivative and repetitive mission design, very little charm that makes the game while beatiful and responsive feel souless. I used to be a huge fan of AC but thats my final entry.
