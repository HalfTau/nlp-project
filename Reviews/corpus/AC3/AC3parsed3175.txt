Unless you feel completed to play ALL the Assassins Creed games, this game is not worth playing. Any chance of a good story was snuffed out left they portray the Founding Fathers in anything less than a heroic light. There are random time jumps during which everyones properly characterized so theres no need to show the player anything.If Ubisoft wanted to make a game about the American Revolution then they should have just done that, not shoehorn it into an Assassins Creed game.
