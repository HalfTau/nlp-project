Finally got around to finishing this, along with a few other games recently. Ive always loved the Assassins Creed series, and this one was just as great as the others. They incorporated unique missions, as well as tons of random side missions that makes the game even more fun. The main story was awesome, and although a bit confusing at times, still very fun and intriguing. Definitely worth what I paid. I did prepurchase the season pass, so Ill be checking that out soon. If youre a fan of the previous AC games, youll love this one too.
