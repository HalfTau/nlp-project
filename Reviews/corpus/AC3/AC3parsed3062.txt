Easily the worst Assassinss Creed till now Im still several games late AC3 is the perfect epitome of a souless, corporate, grey product made by faceless people. Its a complete mess of ideas thrown together with a complete lack of harmony. It inherited the typical AC issues but added a lot more. I love History and I did enjoy the historical details and research Ubisoft puts on this series, but apart from that it was a really unpleasent experience.2/5
