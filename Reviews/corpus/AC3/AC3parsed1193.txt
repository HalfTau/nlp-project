Ive tried to like this game. I really have. Not only have I tried to play this game on console, but then made the move of purchasing it on PC. I used to say Its just a bad port through the first six or so hours of the game. Then, I got to a point where I was stuck in a trading UI tutorial, with no way out. At this time, I realized that this game is broken. It is a discrace to the franchise. This game in the way of story, has NOTHING to offer. You will scream at the stupid AI, at the climbing, hell, you will rage at walking around. It is not a bad port. It is a bad game. Do not waste your money. Black Flag is around the same price, has nearly the same combat system, and has more interesting features. Please. For the love of GOD do not make the same mistake I did.
