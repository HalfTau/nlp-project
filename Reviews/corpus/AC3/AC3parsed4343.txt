While I did not as thoroughly enjoy this game as I did Assassins Creed II Revelations, this game was entertaining, and had a pleasing main quest that offered several emotional points and some flashy combat.Experience the story of Desmond Miles as it draws him to the depths of the Old Civilizations archives, experience Desmonds burden as life or death rests entirely upon his shoulders.
