Fun game but be patient. There is a lot of running around trying to find what to do next, but it is fun. The cinema scenes slow you down, but dont skip them. They add to the story line. I finished the game and viewed the credits for 10 minutes knowing games have bonuses at the end and also knowing there was a lot of little things left I had not finished. I was right. Still playing. Huge game. 33
