So I decided to play this again.But wait, I actually only played 3 hrs? what the hell. Oh wait, now I remember.I am annoyed at this game.Everything about it frustrates me and makes me scream at the screen. which is why I probably gave up and skipped this the first time aroundThe game is nice looking and there may be a good story, But I just cannot get around the clunky, idiotic ideas that pass for controls.I bought this game when it came out and played 3hrs.Guns, have NO business in AC unless I have the same ability to fire as the AI.So I killed a guy with a gun and tried to use it.. But how? Focus? High profile stance? nothing.Sure, you can use a short gange pistol in a fight, but I wasnt allowed to pick off a sniper or even fire the gun.So unless I missed something  in the crappy manual its a no no.This game is designed to be played with a controler. Just try to lockpick with a mouse. No onscreen hints just force feedback, wait what mouse has force feedback?And the first problem I ran into was the screen resolution options.There werent anyManually editing the ini file.Why? because its designed for a console and consoles have tv.So unless you want to play this with a feedback controller on a tv and are happy with the crappy controls, feel free to buy this.Thank god that black flag was NOT like this and was quite enjoyable.ACIII  What not to do in a PC gameWorst Assassins Creed ever IMHO.
