Warning This Is My First ReviewPossible Spoilers BelowThe story of AC3 is one of my favorites mainly because Connor is half Native American and half British. He is born and raised with his Native American tribe though but this holds equally interesting. This makes the game take the interesting point of view from the Native American tribes that were simply booted off their land after and during the Revolutionary War. His story is full of betrayal and misplaced trust but thats not all that makes this game so enjoyable. The Desmond missions which seem to be either loved or hated throughout the series are absolutely amazing in AC3 and you actually get to be...well an Assassin in the present day as Desmond. The ending for AC3 is also a crucial part for anyone who follows the series making this game one of my all time favorites in the series.
