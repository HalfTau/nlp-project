I love this game, the first two games of this series wernt my favorite but when this game came out it drew me in so quckly. An amazing story and a incredible adventure. It makes me really have that stealth assassin feel, but at the same time I feel like I can free roam and have fun with other things as well. I would defiantly recommend this, the crafting system can be confusing as well as some other things you might need to better understand on your own, other then that I enjoy this game and it doesnt get boring quickly .
