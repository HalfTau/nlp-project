Id give this game a 5 stars if I was able to and the only reason would be the dumbass chase scene with Lee. Its so scripted and broken its not even funny. If the dumbass that designed it wanted you to take one specific route they should give you indicators as the whole game is about being semi open world and letting you go and get to the objective however you would like. Instead what happens that any time you go where they dont want you to they immediately tell you that you lost the target even if he is a few feet away from you. Its just plain dumb and I honestly wouldnt recommend this game just due to that. Let along the always on drm t.
