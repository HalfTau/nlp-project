Have been a fan of AC after playing through AC2, botherhood and revelationweakest in the series but still playable.Let me summarize the AC3.ProGood combat system.Better visual graphics.New system of homestead which is similar to AC2 but alot better.Fast travel system to save time.New Hunting system.New cartwheel trade system.Good MP where you can coop with your buddies to gain levels.Improved PvP mode.Awesome ship battle.ConLack of tutorial for the new control interface which made some people confused.Weak side quests because they are not interesting to play.Glitches not fixed even until now trade cart under attacked bug, graphical bug.Main highlight of the game which is the battlefield is a disappointment.Some bad level design which making traveling through map is a hassle.Lack of weapon varieties.Very bad design for climbing viewpointespecially tree.Complete viewpoints doesnt reveal the whole map unlike previous series.I find the main character rather dull.End of Desmond saga makes opens up even more questions.I wanted to rate it above average. You should get this if youre AC fan but you may get disappointed in certain aspect. Therefore, I rated yes for recommendation but this is not the best AC game as people claimed. I guess they loved it because it reminds them of patriot.My RatingExcellentGreatAverageBadGraphics GreatSound  music GreatGameplay GreatStory Average
