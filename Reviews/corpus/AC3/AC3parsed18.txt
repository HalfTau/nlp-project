The first AC game that I have played. So enjoyable, has great scenario, even better gameplay, and enough graphics. Our character is Connor Kenway, a charismatic Indian halfblooded assassin. Place is New York and Boston. Time is Indepence War of America. This game is one of the best AC games I think. Buy it I advice.Graphics 90/100Gameplay 95/100Scenario 85/100Details 87/100General 89/100
