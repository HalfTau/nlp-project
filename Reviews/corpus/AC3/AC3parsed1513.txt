Overall good game. The homestead and ship additions are nice. The main character however did not feel in sync with me however. While he suits the setting, I found him to be rather boring. Doing all the side activities is still a chore. The environment could have been more alluring too, it just didnt suit my style.Personal experience score 7/10Story 7/10  DecentSound 9/10  Nothing negative to say hereGraphics 8.5/10  Looks goodControls 7/10  As with most AC games, character trying to climb everything or jump onto wrong ledge can be painfulGame Length 10/10  About 50 hours including exploration, chores and any other side activity. About half or less if only doing the main story.
