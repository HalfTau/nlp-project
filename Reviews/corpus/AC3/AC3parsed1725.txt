Man, the single players is awesome, the side missions are really cool and you have the recruting system from revelations.The story is really cool and has nice plot twists, the graphics allow for total imersion which is always awesome.On the down side the multiplayer is just worst thanwith unbalanced weapons, really bad mechanics offering you the impossibility to stun most of the times and it always favors the attacker. The level up system is JUST A HUGE MESS, such characterization can be applied to the inventory system where you need to be a rocket scientist to understand anything of whats going on and everything is unlocked since level 1, at least i could choose everything, making level ups just unnecessary.But you play Assassins Creed for the story not the multyplayer, so if you dont press the button that says Multiplayer you will have a great experience. JUST DONT PRESS MULTIPLAYER.
