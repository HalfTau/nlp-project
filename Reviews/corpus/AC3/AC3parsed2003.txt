Assassins Creed III gets a lot of flak, and I dont think necessarily all of it is deserved. AC3 is a fun entry in the series for a few reasons the setting is detailed, you get a lot of American history references, most of which flow ...interestingly enough i suppose. Some might see it forced, but I think they integrated it alright. You have an awesome naval portion of the game, easily the best part, and, in some ways I think, its more fun than AC4s naval mechanics. You see a lot of historical figures, theres lots to collect, do, and see, a lot of decent characters...but a lot of dull characters too.Most characters have good voices, decent stories, but a lot of them lack much depth, and only a few of them stick around long enough to justify any depth anyways. Instead of having a tight core group of characters you have a larger pool of more shallow ones. Luckily, to me, the villains were brilliant and entertaining, and Connor really wasnt as bad as people made him out to be he was stoic, just not rambunctious and funny like Ezio.Overall it was a worthwhile entry. Certainly not the best, but definitely worth finishing. The ending for Connors story was fantastic and emotional...while the 2012 storyline really sucked. Its a game of equalizing pros and cons. For as pretty as it is, detailed and deep, theres also storyline and character shortcomings. If you dont like the colonial period, dont bother though. Its not a MUSTPLAY. But it was still certainly fun enough to recommendIf you plan to skip it...SPOILERS
