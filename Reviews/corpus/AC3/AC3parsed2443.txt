This game had many bad new changes. The first problem I had was the glitches where I would randomly fally below the ground or stuck in a corner. Aside from the glitches the game mechanics were really bad from the last one. I totally hated how Connor would go his way to jump on the edges of each semiroof window instead of just running across. The viewpoints are lacking where all the docks wont be shown and any flat territory out of range. Theres also a gamebreaking bug using the trading book which makes quite a bit of revenue if you invest in it.There are redeemable qualities added on such as the sewers which was a fun hour or two investigating and solving. I also enjoyed the ship battles, but felt like it lacked which becomes better in 4. Negative minigames for me wouldve been that lockpicking its so much easier using a controller.In result, I think this game is good, but I think the ps3 version is the better as performance and lack of bugs was way better. I hope uplay will one day update their old games beyond satisfactory.
