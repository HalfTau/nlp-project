Right out of the gate, this game disappointed me. Even though the game is set in one of my favourite time periods, the story is too slow and the gameplay is too clunky to recommend. If youre a really big fan of the Assassins Creed series like I am, check this one out if its on sale to decide for yourself, but otherwise skip this one.
