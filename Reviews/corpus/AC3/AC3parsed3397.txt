Poorlywritten code everywhere the missions are buggy, the AI that is used to, for example, hide in hay piles does not work most of the time, your character jumps right back out Boston is a horribly unoptimized piece of garbage.Avoid this game. It is awful.Update after a significant video card update, this game performs much better. Its still poorly optimized for PC, but, if your rig is powerful enough in all respects, this old game works well enough. The Tyranny of King Washington DLC is where this game shines best, honestly, as far as gameplay goes, if at least just for the fact that fasttravel to mission points was implemented in this in the base game, you have to spend the time needed to run to each mission point, outside of interlocation travel.
