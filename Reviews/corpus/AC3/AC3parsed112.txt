I really admire what Ubisoft tries to do with these Assassins Creed games.  I love the alternate history approach.  I love how vibrant and alive the cities and countrysides feel.  And I admit that for the majority of Assassinss Creed III, I was entertained hence the thumbs up.But there were some really frustrating elements.  Completely unlikeable main characters the bad guys are far far more interesting than the good guys, zero emotional connection to Conner, long periods of traversing through the frontier to get from one place to another, the absence of parkour missions, a system of economics that is irrelvant to the game and can be safely ignored.The best missions were the peg leg trinket missions not finding the trinkets, but the missions you would get after finding a certian number of them.  These missions were interesting and mysterious.  But they were few and far between.The combat has always perturbed me about the AC games.  Ezio could take on a limitless number of enemies.  Why would anybody attack him?  Wouldnt he get a reputation of being an invicinble bada and frighten away all the guards?  Instead, they attack him like pigs to the slaughter.  ACIII makes combat harder, which is good.  It was still my preferred approach to most missions where stealth wasnt mandated, but it was definitely more challenging.  Also, the kill animations are especially entertaining.Buy it on sale... its worth it.  Just bring a book for the long traverses so you dont get bored.
