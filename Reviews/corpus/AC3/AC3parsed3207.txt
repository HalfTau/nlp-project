went from black flag to this, had to adjust the controll scheme to be mor familliar to me, but havent put it down since, absolutly great game, was a little scheptical about the theme, but its a beautifull game with a fantastic story, not a big fan of playing as deasmond, but I would recomend this to anyone who hasnt played it before!
