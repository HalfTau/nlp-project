This is my favourite game from the Assassins Creed series, coz it has a very interesting story and the soundtracks accompany every situation.Climbing works better than in Assassins Creed 2Good graphicsThe combination between story and actual events from the past is interesting and fun to playShip missions are new and funThe settlement missions are cool to play and its interesting to see your settlement growing by thatGood voice actor german editionBeautiful LandscapesBad lipsyncMissions are repetitiveUpgrades for ship are expensive as Combats are still way too easyThis game has some bugs but you can tolerate it, since it is very big and also they didnt effect my chances to complete a missionnotea bug disabled 1 assassin recruit which didnt bother me and I had 5 others leftAt all i recommend this game to everyone who knows a bit about the revolution in USA and who is in agreement to play a game more for the plot than for the gameplay but I personally had no problem with that and also its worth the price andI guarantee a long playtime.last edited on 15th of october 2015Id be very grateful if you could evaluate this review.For more reviews you can join our groupIll see you in the next review.Sincerely your old mate Mr.Clinkz
