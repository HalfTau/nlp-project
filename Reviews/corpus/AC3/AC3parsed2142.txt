It is a really great game. The campaign and the side missions are fun. The only major problem I have with it, and after looking online a lot of people have had the same problem, is the magic lantern puzzles in the underground. I was able to do at least two. The problem is that most of the magic lantern symbols do not appear on the doors, which makes it extremely difficult to unlock the doors. If this was fixed it would be great. But other than that the game is great so far.
