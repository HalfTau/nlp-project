Physically unplayable. Everytime I load the game up which hasnt been much my screen glitches and looks like something that would induce a seizure. If I recieved a physical copy that was acting like this, i would refund it immediately. But, since this is steam, i cant do that. I want to like the game, but it is glitching constantly. Above the graphics jerking off a monkey mom, the controls constantly seizure also. Consistantly unplayable. I only recommend this game because most people dont have this problem.
