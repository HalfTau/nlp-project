So I havent played an AC game in awhile. Since revelations. Ubisoft is rushing these games out too fast. The QC was terrible and I can see why Unity is getting such bad reviews. I honestly dont remember this bad of gameplay in the others.The story was good but gameplay and a lot of graphical glitches, a lot. Poppins everywhere. All settings maxed. Youd call an assassin strike, once the person dies they immediately disappear and just leave their gun. Some bodies stick around but for the computer there should be much more. Weather changes is a nice effect, with snowy days being the best but rare.Connors character seems to be just thrown into the story and he doesnt really feel like part of the series as a whole. I enjoyed his abilities and different things you could do but it just seemed out of place. I didnt really get how he got into the position he did. I mean, you get it, it just seems out of place.No point in doing any side missions hunting, homestead. frontier, etc as the game is so easy you can use all your default weapons and be fine. I remember in the others you had to as you couldnt beat certain enemies. Here, no one is a match for you! No point in wasting time trying to get money to upgrade stuff because you dont need to. Only thing i upgraded was for the Ship. Cannon, armor, and steering and thats all you need!The best part of this game is the Naval battles. Thats where the game really shines, graphically and smooth gameplay. Great added fun!
