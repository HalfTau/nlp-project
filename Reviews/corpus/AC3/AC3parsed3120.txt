Not the best Assassins Creed game.SingleplayerPros Good choice of theme American Revolution New mechanics in the game are very interesting Storyline with Desmond finally comes to an end Graphics are improved from the previous AC game The Ship battles are epic New weaponsCons Uninteresting main character Connor Useless merchant The gold in this game is only good for bribing The wanted posters are hidden and not shown on your UI Map The ending of the game was poorly created Tons of loose ends Synchronize viewpoints are useless and unchallenging Your followers are weak and you barely use them Regenerating health No armor upgrades or health increasersOverall 6/10The game offers a new change and expands from the previous AC games.Although they have many pros, they also have flaws. The creator shouldhave remove the regenerating health completely, it provides no challenge andno point in buy armor. The merchant overall is useless. You barely see him atall as he moves around the map if spotted ever. You might as well completethe game without ever buying new weapons. The stealth system is the sameas always.The multiplayer is the strongest thing about this game.Steam should have added coop in the tags.There is a coop mode called wolfpack. This gamemodeis the best for practicing for Unity when it comes out.Multiplayer 8/10
