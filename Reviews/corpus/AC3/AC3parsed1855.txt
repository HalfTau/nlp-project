Out of all the Assassins Creed games this one was my favorite. This was the first of the series that truly felt like an open world to me. I spent more time working on side missions and exploration than I did the campaign by far. The characters are strong, the plot is thick, and the feel is legit. You can really lose yourself in this title.There is one particular twist in the beginning of the game that really started the story off on a great foot. I wont spoil anything, but impressing a player right off the bat truly sets an awesome tone.Since this game finally brings the series home to America, I finally took an interest in the historical side of Assassins Creed. For the first time, I actually enjoyed looking in to the finite details and reveling in our nations past. Being able to relate to some of the locations throughout the game and most of the events made every action feel more significant for me.If you like Assassins Creed this game will not dissapoint. If your new, this one is going to break you in nicely but you really should spend some time with the prior titles to appreciate the story. I would be concerned for new players because the underlying plot involving Desmond Miles is going to feel extremely cheesy without the proper background.
