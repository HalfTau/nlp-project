Bah. Mediorce game. You might as well play it if youve played the previous ones, for the sake of knowing the story. After plaing the Ezio games, this was a let down.Lets start of with the goodgreat graphics,great choice of time period/integration of characters I liked the main story, very tragic, but could have been longer and could have been better with better voice acting and animating, see below really liked the hunting thing, being in the forest and whatnot, but that got tiring pretty fastThe badglitches, this game was clearly not tested as enough as the Ezio games.the side quests were pretty unecessary, you could get through the game without doing them and if you did them omg were some of them were so boring.... the dialouge between some of the secondary characters felt so forced, the voice acting couldve been betterthe body animation could have been MUCH better this was mostly noticiable in the side quests. For example a character would be angry or happy or would be displaying some sort of emotion throught their voice, but their bodies and facial expression remained stagnant, it just seemeed so awkward and lazy...more development time would have helpedgetting 100 in some of the missions is impossibly hard, so many glitches....the fighting system...OMG they dumbed it down so much...its just not engaging anymore..it gets so repetitive VERY fastOverall...they tried something new but they needed to put in more time... This game had potential to be much better. The Ezio series games were a masterpiece... This game though... meh.
