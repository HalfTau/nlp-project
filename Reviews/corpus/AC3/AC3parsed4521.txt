Singleplayer is so good that my only true complaint is that there isnt enough content.Multiplayer feels like a refinement on the previous iterations, which in itself isnt bad, Im hoping for a completely different multiplayer experience in the future.The CoOp is just MP where the enemies are bots and youre against the clock, using the MP engine, so I cant say alot about it.Also, in MP things cost a bit too much to unlock, at least from the start.Edit Years later, still the best AC game in my opinion.It nails most of the things that matter most in an AC game, at least in my opinion.
