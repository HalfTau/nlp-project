i never understood why this game got so much hate! most people dont like the main protagonist, Connor. sure he wasnt as handsome as Ezio but that doesnt mean this game is bad! most people dont like him because he is dull, but that is exactly why i like him he focuses on his mission and does not seem to have emotions, and if you pay attention to the games story, you can clearly see why he is like this.enough about the main protagonist, lets focus on gameplay. the gameplay is very nice, and i havent ecountered a bug yet, and ive played the game for 26 hours. the game is really dynamic on the fighting styles you can choose wether to take your enemies head on with a tomahawk or a sword, be stealthy and use your hidden blades and bow, or a mixture of both!oh and did i mention that you can hang your enemies?another thing that i really liked is the ability to hunt animals in a lot of dynamic ways, either you can climb in a tree and wait for an animal to pass, or you can set up a trap. you can make money by selling meat to shops this way.now lets talk about the story the story is hard to get in the beginning but when you pay attention to it its great! the reason this game gets so much hate is because of the long tutorial part 5 sequences, but honestly, i liked that! i mean, you wouldnt go from a 16 year native american boy to a master assassin in just 2 minutes, would you? i find it adds some sort of realism. and it isnt really that long, i completed those 5 sequences in just 3 hours.9/10. i highly recommend it
