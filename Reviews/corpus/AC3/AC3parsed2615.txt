Youll probably be a little confused with Desmonds story if its your first Assassins Creed, but the Connor experience is standalone.I loved the frontier setting. Sure the cities might not be as vertical and diverse as previous ones, but the frontier and the homestead are the unique features of ACIII and I thought they were phenomenal  though some of that is bias because its physically close to home. There are some polarizing elements, and my opinion is different than most, but its definitely one of my favourite Assassins Creed games.The DLC didnt stick out to me. You might as well get the deluxe edition if its inexpensive, I guess. The Washington DLC was pretty good but didnt really stick out to me, and youd get more use out of Hidden Secrets if you remember to punch in the code before you start the game unlike me.Full review here
