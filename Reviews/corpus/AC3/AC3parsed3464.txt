I definitely recommend playing AC3, just for experience of such a well designed depiction of Revolutionary America. And the stabbing of people in the face with bayonets.ProsBrilliantly crafted world as usual, smooth action with decent characters and all the usual stuff youd expect from a Creed game.The ship battles were the best part of the game aside the level design, and so its no wonder that became the core part for AC4.Cons Let down in the simplification of things and how easy the game is. Personally felt all the side missions and extra stuff didnt have enough incentive
