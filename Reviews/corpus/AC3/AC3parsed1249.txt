I shouted at the screen more than usual with this game. Really boring in comparison to previous ACs. I hate the combat so much oh god please stop not to forget the random minigames and all the scenes youll be thrown into with absolutely no idea how to do anything. You can find a forum full of just how do Is on this game because NO ONE KNOWS THEY NEVER TOLD US
