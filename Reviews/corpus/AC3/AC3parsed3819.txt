22 Hours of this game and I have yet play as the primary character, Connor. Ive spent more time crashing than I have playing. Now the game has erased my save. Now Im not saying this is a bad game. Its just a terrible port. Looks like Ill be looking for a used copy on the PS3 or 360. Im not giving Ubi any more money for a game I already own.
