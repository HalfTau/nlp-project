This game is amazing, its graphics were ahead of their time, the gameplay is near flawless, i would reccomend this game over the fourth in an instant, you relate to the characters and the direction of the story goes deeper than i could imagine, i finished the game after 55 hours of amazing gameplay Note i did not collect all feathers/almanacs., only wanting to spend more time slaughtering those silly regulars. its a amazing game over all, its worth the money and you wont regret it
