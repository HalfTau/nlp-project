after 116 hours playing this game i must say This is a Epic game ive completed it 5 times it never gets old its one of the best assassins creed games out i have all of the other games execpt black flag and i really have to say its one of the best i have its combat system is so fluid and easy to use they got ride of the arms/head and the rest keys so its easier to play also the storyline is easy to follow so you wont feel lost. now some enemies are well just plain overkill like the Jagers they are so hard to kill that you would basiclly need a cannon inorder to kill them or alot of ammo for you pistols e.g. dual barroli give this game a 10 out of 10p.s. connor is the best assassin in the series so far
