I will try to make it short. I have enjoyed the AC games since the first one on the PS3. However, as much as I like how they improve on every iteration of the game, this one is lacking in something. I am not bashing on this game. Yeah they introduced you to battling ships very fun but other than this something just lacks. In my opinion it is the main protagonist. Conner is not fully developed in my opinion and quite frankly is very hard to like. His character has no depth, as in, all I see is the stereotypical angry Native American who doesnt really ponder or have much depth with the ideals of the Assasin Brotherhood. All I hear is, Why?! But why?! He must die. Where is Charles Lee?! Even Altair had more depth.  From the very start, you are almost given the clue that Conner is just there for you to find a key. Simple as that. Dont expect him to make a comeback. Another thing that makes this game not so much fun is that there is a couple of almost game breaking bugs. I had the misfortune of running into the ledger bug VERY FRUSTRATING! and ragdolls randomly clipping creating alot of lag to the point i felt the game was going to crash. If you want to get this I highly recommend it at sale price. I cant see myself buying this or recommending it at full price.
