God, Connor or Ratonhnhakton is such an underrated and misjudged character, its like I see the determination  bloodlust of Guts from Berserk in him and his stuggle with his sense of justice just like Batman. Combine those 2 godlycharacters and theres Connor Kenway. His true true mother given name says everything about him Ratonhnhakton  life that is scratched. Underrated storyline. Truly an one man army.
