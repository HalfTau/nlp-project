Ubisoft did a swell job putting AC3 together, with new added mechanics and features the freeroam/side mission aspect of the game becomes more interesting creating a new world for the player to enjoy while hunting, sailing, etc.  Multiplayer modes are as to be expected great without a doubt the games multiplayer takes time, skill, and precision in order to succeed and rank up.  All in all the game brings a new level to the franchise and should be expected to continue without fail.  9/10
