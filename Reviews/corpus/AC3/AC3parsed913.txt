AC3 short said has a wide variety of things to explore, just as the other games in the franchise. I can not compare it much with the other games in the franchise causs ive only played Assassins creed 4 Black flag except from AC3.I think many people will like AC3 because its such a fun openworld game with an interesting story, good voice acting, beatiful graphics with more. Its a very overall chill game where you can take on things in your own way. AC3 isnt a game for you that would like a challenge. The game is very easy to complete and i must also say that the story aint so long.The deeper you go into the game the more things you will unlock. It might sound like many other games, but it still makes you want to earn more money and complete missions a lot more. Theres not much of a balance between the easy and the hard missions, either you really have to use your items efficiently or you can just rush through it all with an axe in your hand.There aint many sidemissions as well unfortunately, thats something i would really like more of, maybe almost like a second story. I havent bought any of the DLCs yet but will probably do in a short time. It will enhance my gameplay a lot i think. So if you are missing out something and really enjoy the game you should consider buying some of the DLCs.One thing i havent seen in many games except the AC franchise is the big amount of finishing moves you can do. Depending on what situation youre in you will execute different types of finishing moves. Rather or not youre into open world games you definitely should try this out.
