My gametime is 39 hours, so obviously I like it.Pros Civilians have great AI. Fresh fighting mechanic. Overall character design. Deaths in game sync up with deaths in real life. Achilles was such a great character. The Haytham twist was unexpected. Assassins guild that you can expand. Female assassin. Taking over forts. Gameplay was actually challenging. The time period is perfect. Haythams smart alec quips are entertaining. Rope darts. Killing Charles Lee and Haytham. Shops and your homestead are great. Being the captain of a boat was amazing. The sea battles were so good. The Covert Escort ability was a little glitchy, but overall amazing.Cons Orphans are awfully annoying. Enemy vision is especially terrible in this game. The environment felt copied and pasted at some points. For example,New York is almost exactly the same as Boston. You cant run on roof tops without being yelled and shot at. You can hide from the enemies in grass! Im still laughing at that. Cheap enemy AI. You cant ride away on a horse without being shot at. Desmond. Connor. No freedom on the battlefield. Hardly any battlefield.This was a good game. While it had many glitches, it was still very entertaining.7/10
