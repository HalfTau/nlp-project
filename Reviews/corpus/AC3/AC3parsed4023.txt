Very poor mechanics, I constantly found myself climbing up a wall or a fence when just trying to run. Combat is a joke, if you smash the X button you will win every fight. The UI is terrible and the game is open world just for the sake of calling it open world and to waste your time traveling between storyline missions. Also, 50 of your game time will be spent watching cut scenes, run up to a guy for that epic assassination that you were waiting for and just before the kill...cutscene! This is the perfect example of the casualization of mainsteam games, apparently all it takes is a good setting and story, and nothing else matters. My first and last Assassins creed game, and it was too crappy to finish.
