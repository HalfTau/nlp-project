Oh dear God. The pacing. So. Bloody. Slow. Its like watching a snail creep through molasses. Ive so far played the game for close to seven hours and this is how Ive spent my time 50 watching cutscenes, 30 running or walking from point A to point B seriously, why do I have to walk such long distances? Its neither exciting nor fun, 10 fighting which is fun, granted, and 10 waiting for the Native American dialogue to be over since Ive already read the subtitles five friggin times.The story is, well, kinda standard, I guess, nothing special.... whatever, I dont care anymore. It just takes too damn long to go anywhere. I will probably spend some more hours playing this for reasons passing understanding. Perhaps I have masochistic tendencies. Who knows, really.
