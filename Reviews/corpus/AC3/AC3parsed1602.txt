I loved Assassins Creed II, but this one is just Horrible controls, horrible interface, just horrible. I have tried and tried to play it again and again since buying, and every time I just get frustrated at the complete lack of an intuitive interface. Ugh. Have I mentioned it is horrible? Because it is.
