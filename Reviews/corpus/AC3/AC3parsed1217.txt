Even after replaying this game several times, it is still one of my favorite games, and definatley my favorite Assassins Creed game. The story behind Connor, how he becomes an Assassin, and just what he does throughout the game is such an amazing story and incredibly exciting to see what happens and how everything unfolds. The gameplay is brilliant, the new features of parkour, hunting, and naval gameplay are amazing, the historical aspects are great, and the story is truly interesting and leads you to want to play all the way to the end. I absolutley recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Assassins Creed games, or hell, even if you want to play a game that takes place, and uses, the events/people of the Revolutionary War.
