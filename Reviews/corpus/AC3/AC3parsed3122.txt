This is BY FAR the iest Assasins Creed game ever. Everything they made right in the past games they ed up in this one.  Its so full of gamebraking bugs even after a  of major updates including a giant day 1 patch and annoying sequences and minigames that you ask yourself Has anyone ever tested this game before it went into retail?! All the games core mechanics no matter if its stealth, combat or parcour and climbing are just clunky and broken. Due to the badly programmed AI and the bad mapdesign it is literally imposssible to play this game stealthy. Instead of looking forward to the few stealth sections the game offers you usually just end up thinking i hope thisis over soon. They dumbed the gameplay down even further, by adding quick time events and assisted running always on and by removing ANY decissions in doing assasinations. ALthough its supposed to be an open world game 95 of the missions feel like beeing chased through a labyrintth and whenever you go the wrong way you get desynched and lose. The most frustrating thing about this is, that the game often doesnt tell you what it wants you to do. For example in one mission you have to infiltrate some fort and when you get detected you lose. After you have succesfully infiltrated that thing you can fight again, so i attack some soldiers and after killing the third one i get desynched because you just killed George Whasington WTF?! How am i supposed to know that some random grunt hanging arround in some fort is ing George Whasington in his 20s?! Up ypurs too AS3!
