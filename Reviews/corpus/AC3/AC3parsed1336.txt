AC3 Spoilers ahead.The last best Assassins creed game before ubisoft shot themselves in the foot repeatedly with the later games, maybe aside from black flag. Now I for one thoroughly enjoyed this final installment to the trilogy I guess you could call it Desmonds trilogy.So the story.. wellThe story is great, the story was always great in AC games up to this one. I guess this would be a fitting end to the series..if it actually ended with 3, but no Ubisoft keep pumping them out.The gameplay is your typical AC deal, climby free runny stabby go back to the pasty fun. The quirk this time though is nature, climbable trees..branchs.. hunting etc, doesnt add much to the gameplay but its addition is not unwanted.Good game all round really, ending could have used some work but still,  good game.
