One of my favorite AC games, This one had a few glitches and problems but i think it was due to my internet connection while downloading it satellite and i corrupted the file. Great game though, so much to do and explore and lots of achievements and things to find and a lot of side quests. I really enjoyed the sailing aspect and the battles at sea. Great story line too, would recommend it to anyone who likes open world games.
