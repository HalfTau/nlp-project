First impressions based from two hours from playing...Beautful graphicsNew worldGameplay... Heres where it gets tricky imho.using xobx controllerThe parkour and combat configuration from the previous games are not here. Forget about holding down the trigger and/or using X to counter. What I loved about the previous games is that it kept you very alert and you had to time your button presses while holding down the triggers.This game simply is too automatic for me. It holds your hand and simplifies it too much to get a sense of the parkour and combat.  Quite simply... its either you like thier new formula or not.For the past month, Ive been binge playing since the first game becuase Ive become addicted to the story and gameplay. Becoming a fan of the franchise. Now as Im playing AC3, I feel like Im forcing myself to finish the game. A lot was expected from the studio that gave us AC 1 and 2. Each game being different from a histroical context with AC 2 being such a huge leap of story, world, and gameplay. I can understand keeping that fresh excitement of introducing players to experience a new AC game, but so far its just not grabbing me.Basically.... I dont like the controller HUD layout, controller configuration, and gameplay. But hell, I need to know what happens in the story!Thanks for reading my first impressions of the game.
