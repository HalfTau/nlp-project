There are parts of this game that were phenomenal, and parts that were so stupid that its hard to believe they are both part of the same game.I loved how this game recreated battles and historical events with one of their own characters thrown in there. The storyline is impressive. I especially enjoyed the openworld layout where the beautiful city of Boston and its countryside can be explored. Adding crafting and hunting which can be done in between quests for fun was also cool.Heres the problem, there are too many cut scenes that the game does not allow us to skip. All of the scenes and missions with Desmond Miles are annoying and should simply have not been included with the game. Basically, all of the modern day stuff was garbage and not even fun to play. The whole game should have just been the 18th century world, not the modern day world. The game developers ruined what would have been a perfect game with all of that. So I rate a game that would have been 5 out of 5 easily, 3 out of 5. Its still definitely worth playing, but not as good as it could have been.Also... I have DLC content that to this day I havent been able to open on my PC because of glitches with the ubisoft server, though that I blame more on ubisoft than the game developers.
