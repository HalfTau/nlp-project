The game generally has a different feel from the previous games I have the Ezio trilogy on XBox, however, it has not deviated much from the former quotrapequot combat of the games after Brotherhood. Its almost sad how much fun the combat is in this game. While the difficulty is absolutely pathetic, any scrub can finish it, its still a ton of fun spamming the counter button and seeing you decimate everything in a 5 lightyear radius.The story overall is nice though it could patch up some plot holes like Why not shoot the guy from the start of the the game before MC gets all attached and stuff?, it could do that for once. However, thatd take away from the suspense that your father is a , so?
