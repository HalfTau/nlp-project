I cant believe this game has positive reviews. Its the worst AC game and Connor is the worst assassin ever created. It has killed my belief in assassins, cause colonial assassins are scumbags.It has killed the modern day story. All previous games buildup was for nothing.The few good things in this game are Haytham Kenway, Templars and this one sidemission in an abandoned mansion that starts only if youve collected all the trinkets,  which is just boring.
