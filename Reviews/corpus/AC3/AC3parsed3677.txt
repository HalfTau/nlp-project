THIS IS SUCH AN AWESOME GAME!!!  I played Assassins Creed II extensively, and loved the heck out of it, but it often felt a little repetitive.  This game is just improved in every way!  The story is great, and I dont want it to end!  I am approx. 16 of the way through, and I feel that it is just starting to get good.  I got this game for 75 off, and for the mony, it is probably the best 6 I have every spent!!  Get it ASAP if you havent already!!!!  Sure to be a hit!
