This game has a very slow start. The main story is god awful. The map, and as a result the experience, is fractured. Good elements of the design are communicated poorly. The art direction is a bit off, especially in regards to the interface. There is a lot that this game gets wrong. Despite all of this, there is a good game in ACIII, that I really enjoy. The combat is very fluid and quick. Some of the side quests are interesting and character building. The Naval missions are phenominal.If youre willing to put up with less than perfect pacing, design, and organization, this game is worth a purchase. Dont spend more than 10.00 on it though, or youll probably regret it.
