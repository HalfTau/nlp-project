Really fun game that goes well with the overall story of the Assassins Creed franchise. This game gets way morethan it deserves, and my opinion is that those that dont like the story didnt take the time to complete all of the sidestory this really contributed a lot to the development of the story. Anyways, try to pick this up when it is on sale... really enjoyed the game.
