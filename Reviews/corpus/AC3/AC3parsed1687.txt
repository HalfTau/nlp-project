Farming simulator I have no interest in hunting nor skinning beasts, gathering materials for quests that have shown no progression on the main storyline. Storyline is boring and gameplay has been dulled down and noninteractive.Uplay isand it will always be.This game is trash compared to its predecessor. Such a shame.
