Once the novelty of the new engine, new setting and graphical upgrade from the previous games wore off, I found this game disappointing. The world is so much emptier than Rome and Constantinople. The pacing is atrocious with new mechanics still being introduced halfway through the game, around the time Conner gets his robes and his objective. The story was really tedious and kind of pretentious as well. Conner especially emulates those traits, and I didnt feel as cool playing as him like I did with Ezio.
