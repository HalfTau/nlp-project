The introduction of a new game engine brings with it new mechanics and concepts that heavily alter Assassins Creed gameplay. Its clear that its a work in progress, but the flaws are covered quite well by the strength of the storyline including the conclusion of Desmonds arc and the introduction of moral ambiguity into the Templar vs Assassin conflict. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, its inspection of American history, and the characters it established.
