Ubisoft and Steam have know about this bug since 2013, and it is STILL not fixed!If you encounter this, you must turn off automatic updates in Steam for the game, rename the Episode 2 files, delete your Episode 1 save game, replay Episode 1 from the beginning. After you have completed Episode one, you can return the Episode 2 files to their correct names, and supposedly finish the rest of teh content.
