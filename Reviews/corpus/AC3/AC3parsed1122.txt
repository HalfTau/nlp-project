I am positive about all those new features, like sailing, climbing trees and hunting in the game. The main story is good, about the revenge of an Indian assassin, it is also unpredicted that the character you used in the first chapters turns out to be a templar. The only problem of the plot is that the Charles Lees death is too easy and you cant even kill him yourself by pressing any button.
