Best installment since the first Assassins Creed. Revamped combat and free runnnig, wonderfully crafted environments, and an engaging storyline. Theyve done away with most if not all of the tedious and clunky mechanics in previous installments and have added a number of fresh new ones, including a revamped stealth system. Very enjoyable. My favorite of the series thus far. have not played Black Flag yet
