I played this game when it came out in 2012 on the 360, and recently decided to get it again on PC. I had some issues with the camera glitching when I first played it, but after restarting the game it worked completely fine. Ive had no issues or glitches with the game and I think it still manages to look beautiful on PC five years later. I might just be a bit sentimental due to this being my first Assassins Creed game, but I highly recommend this game.
