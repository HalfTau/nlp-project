Great game,not the best Assassins Creed game but still fun the less. The ending is a bit of a let down but who cares? The gameplay and graphics are great! But I did run into sevral glitches. When I tried to run the game on AA  set to very high I got glitched textures. But other than that I do recommend this game to anyone who is a hardcore Assassins Creed fan!8.5/10
