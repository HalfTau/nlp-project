As a big fan of AC2 and its awesome setting not to mention Ezio being a top boi, I was expecting AC3 to be an absolute turd.However, I was somewhat taken by surprise. The locations in AC3 are big and varied enough though they lack the beauty of AC2s Italy, and I even began to warm up to the wooden Connor after a few hours.In true AC style, a lot of the missions are repetitive and dull but there are enough exciting ones to make things interesting. The ship missions definitely a precursor to AC4 in many ways are one of the highlights, and I think half my playtime has been spent on those sections.All in all, its pretty good. If youre new to the series, definitely go with either 2 or 4, but if youre a vetran looking for some variety it is worth picking up in a sale.6.5 stay within eavesdrop distances/10
