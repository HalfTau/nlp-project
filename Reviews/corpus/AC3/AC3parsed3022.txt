Being an Assassins Creed fan to be honest revelations was a dissapointment, the only reason the game was released was for the sake of the storyline for me, and i sure was more than Excited when i first saw the trailers of Assassins Creed 3 not to forget the best part being a new ancestor. the story is good at start bound to give you a few surprises at the very first, though somewhere in the middle it becomes a little boring because things seem to be repetitive but by the end it gets better. I was expecting too much, but was not bad either, game play has too much to offer including a bunch of bugs that might end up irritating you, overall its recommended, but would be better if you play with less expectations.
