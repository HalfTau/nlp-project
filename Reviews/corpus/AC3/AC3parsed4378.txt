Absolutely amazing. This is my new favourite game in the Assassins Creed series. The story, the characters, the evolution of the game from start to finish is just so well done.18th century colonial America is a fascinating period in history and Assassins Creed 3 does well to showcase major events whilst maintaining its own original storyline. The fusion of what supposedly happened and what actually happened are blended so well together. The open ended level design is also very appealing to me. Theres so much to do, so much to explore, and so many people to meet, its great! I genuinely feel like Im visiting 18th century America.What really stood out for me was the new and improved free running. In previous games, the player could move through predominantly urban environments. In this sequel, the wilderness becomes your playground and you can move through trees and scale up cliffsides! I love this new system of movement as it opens up a whole new environment for the series to explore and experience an environment where you can hunt, ambush, trap, and stalk your enemies.The core gameplay/combat are great fun too, with plenty more finishing moves and plenty new weapons to use. There are neat gameplay features that have been added for the more modernized combat, such as using a human shield to block gunfire. I like how Assassins Creed 3 has adapted its gameplay rather than just rinse and repeat from the previous title. Ranged weapons play a much stronger role and can really make a difference in battle.Alright Ive said more than enough. Im glad I got this game, Ill be playing it for a while
