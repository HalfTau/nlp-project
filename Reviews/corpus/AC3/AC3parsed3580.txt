4/10I tried to like this game, I really did. Assassins Creed really hit its peak with the second installment and has been steadily declining ever since. Ive never been able to actually care about any of the stories in the games they are just stupid and convoluted to a fault. The inclusion of historical figures is fun but just a distraction from the glaring faults elsewhere. The gameplay is just very repetitive and I find myself really struggling to go back in and finish it. You will perform the same tasks over and over again and have to constantly restart missions because of bad game mechanics as opposed to player faults. If you really like Assassins Creed games then this is for you, if you are new to the franchise just look elsewhere.
