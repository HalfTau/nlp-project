Dont even bother, i purchased this game after the BIG language update that crashed everyones save files, i figured well since i never bought this game and dont have files for it then it should be fine NOPE!! thanks to Ubisuck, this game is now no longer playable. ok no i take that back, if you like a game that has a screen that freaks out and glitches with controls that when you wanna walk straight you end up walking in a circle then doing some crazy 8 movements. Seriously Helen Keller could be a better walker than this. HEED MY WARNING BRETHEREN, STRAY FROM UBISOFT. GET ANY OTHER GAME BUT ONE FROM THIS COMPANY. youd be better off playing ride to hell.
