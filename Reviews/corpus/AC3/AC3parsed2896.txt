AC3, is a great game.It has a nice story, good characters, nice open world and all of that stuff.But there is one thing that rips this all appart.Its horribly optimized and almost unplayable at some points, I am using a 780 Lightning and there were places where I dropped to 30 FPS for no ing reason.And its Vsync locked for no reason too, and when you get to unlock the framerate, which for some reason only worked once for me, after that it just locked itself back to 60. It just fluctuates from 50 all the way up to 130 for no goddamn reason.All i have to say is dont buy this game if you are a 60hz panel owner, because you wont like it.
