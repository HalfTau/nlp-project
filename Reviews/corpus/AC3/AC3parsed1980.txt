The saddest AC game in my opinion. Based on a father, and a son and how they grew up on either side of the spectrum. Join Hayman as he joins some enemies from the American Revolution, and join Conner as he joins with the heroes to bring his people back. This game is pretty good but the ending will just blow you away... Pretty awesome and very sad10/10
