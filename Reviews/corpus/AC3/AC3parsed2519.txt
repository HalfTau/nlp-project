Something must be wrong with me, but I honestly did not like this game.  My major problem was with the game being a bit boring in places travel / cutscene / walk 2 mteres / cutscene.....  I also found combat to be awkward with regards to controls  keyboard control was quite unresponsive in places eg. fighting wolves etc. Trading? Useless except for that one mission when the ship is rebuilt. All through the game I had the feeling one I dont like that this game was designed for consoles and that the PC version was an unwanted but necessary exercise. Maybe I should have started with part I, maybe new AC games will be are? better  this one failed to impress me.
