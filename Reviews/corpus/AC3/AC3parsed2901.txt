Everything about this game except for the graphics is garbage. Character response to player input is horrendously sluggish. Insane amount of glitches. Died 4 times in 4 minutes due to character glitches. One of which resulted in my character standing still while being repeatedly stabbed. Camera work is terrible. Hiding mechanic seems to stop working at random. The story is stupid to the point of being vomit inducing. Terrible acting. Extremely disppointing considering I was a fan of AC1 and 2. Yet another step in the constant decline of Ubisoft games.Edit I had to go into my registry and make some changes in order for the game to even update beyond v1.01. That is absolutely unacceptable.Edit I cannot possibly say enough bad things about this game to properly convey how horrible it is.
