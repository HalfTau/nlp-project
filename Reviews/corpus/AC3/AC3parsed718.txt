AC II introduced a new, fresh setting with a good roster of characters. To me, this was like the Batman Arkham Asylum of the series.AC Brotherhood gave improved gameplay from the orignal and provided more oppertunities and things to do. This was the best, like Batman Arkham City.AC Revelations rehashed a lot of the material and added some bits and bobs to it. This was not the best but still mostly solid, kinda like Arkham Origins.AC III was like the Batman Arkham Knight of the Assassins Creed series good in gameplay and somewhat good in setting, but lacking in polishness plenty of glitches in both of these 2 games. Still mostly solid since they patched some of it up.
