Okay so I just adore the Assassins Creed series, and Assassins Creed 3 was no exception to my Assassins Creed experience.The characters are wonderful and full of characterstics, and the beauitful scenery makes me want to get to every single synchronization point there is in the game just to see the whole area. The one thing I hated was the long....very long rides through the forest, getting from point A to point B. But fast travel made it a bit better but still its a climb sometimes.Missions on the other hands do provide a challange, but sometimes getting a full synchronization for every mission, can be tough  and well, you probably wont get it on the first try. Plus some of the missions seem...bad in a sense where it can be tedious sometimes, and annoying.Controls are just the same as any Assassins Creed game, yes it does sometimes get annoying. You want to go to one place and the character moves to another place.Story on the other hand its beauitful in context from Connors childhood, to Haythams playthrough. Though the story plot can seem a little....weak, and the ending just killed me. Though other then that, pretty good have to admit.If you really enjoyed the game dont forget to read Haytham side of the story in Assassin Creed 3 Forsaken the novel for Assassins Creed 3, it tells more of the story for the game and might answer a few.
