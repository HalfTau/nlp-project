Recommended game for Assassins Creed fans. The scenery is stunning.Combat is topnotch. Naval battles are fun. Quick travel is so much better now.Scaling mountains / hills can be frustrating some times especially when its hard to distinct which are scalable and which arent.Also the full sync with the forced stealth approach are rather difficult in this one compared to previous games in the series.
