I had a great time playing this game. As a Cree First Nations, there are not many games where I can play as a Native American hero such as Connor. He is one of the most badass characters Ive played in any game. The setting is great and reminds me of one of my favorite movies Last of The Mohicans. You can even use the gun stock club from that movie as well. Theres nothing more satisfying than taking guys out with a gunstock club.The game is huge and thats an understatment it really is massive. The story was interesting and I enjoyed it for the most part. I would definately recommend this game.
