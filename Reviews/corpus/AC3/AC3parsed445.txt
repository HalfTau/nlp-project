I wanted to like this game, I really did. The frontier locations are beautiful the combat especially on the ocean is fun, but its all brought down by incoherent and buggy gameplay. After playing this game nearly to completion I am certain that significant portions of it were simply never playtested.Mission design is schizophrenic even when not bugged, with a difficulty curve like a roller coaster. One missions is literally impossible to get full sync unless you keep reloading from a checkpoint until a targets pathing bugs out.Many locations have broken freerunning pathing, and obvious intended paths or stealth approaches that are broken due to design errors and were clearly never tested ingame. Multiple naval missions have full sync requirement that punish you for upgrading your ships weapons, as they require you to intentionally miss almost all your shots to avoid killing the targets outright before their weak points are exposed.One sequence has three consecutive noninteractive cutscenes, one after another, each of which can be skipped jumping to a loading screen that takes longer than the cutscene, followed immediately by a much longer, unskippable scene. Its so bad it must be intentional.Another source of frustration is that the game is constantly taking temporary control of your camera, be it for looting a body, performing and execution, or showing you an incoming enemy ship. Every time it does this, the forced camera change lingers far longer than necessary, both annoying you and leaving you open to attacks in combat, or making it hard to navigate alleys or narrow ocean passages.Assassins Creed 3 everywhere you look, somethings broken.
