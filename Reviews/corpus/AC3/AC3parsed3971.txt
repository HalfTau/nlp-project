Having already being the owner of Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, I must say that Assassins Creed III still poses to be a great and unique experience of the American Revolution. What I love most is the interactive and wellblended storyline of the powerful, but naive, Connor Kenway and his journey, tampering with powerful foes, no doubt that this Assassins Creed deserves an A.
