i know ive only spent about 20 hours on this game but it is truely amazing, it has an aspect of freedom and history and it has events like the boston tea party and the battle of lexington and concord and other historical figures such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere and other patriots not the football team. i hope you buy this game because it is truly a good game
