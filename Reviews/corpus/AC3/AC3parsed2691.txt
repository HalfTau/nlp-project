This game seemed promising at the beginning, but the ya know 57 hour long tutorial and cutscences every two seconds and the dull story line makes this game the worst in the series, if I were you, Id save up for Assassins Creed Unity, thats a great game. The best thing in this game is the graphics. The last mission is impossible, its just bad.
