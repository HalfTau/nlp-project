TLDR Only buy the game if its on sale and you want to play the story. Be prepared to google search for graphical fixes.Full of bugsHad to Google search for about 30 minutes to find a fix to the screen clipping/jittering issue.Game gets stuck in foreground when trying to alttab out and controls/movement are inconsistent at best.Contraints optional objectives for 100 sync for main missions and some side missions are infuriating due to the above reasons.Can get stuck in a cutscene with the save wheel spinning. Can also have other actions take place within your cutscenes causing unpredictable outcomes. wolf attacking you during cutscene, then once cutscene finishes you get stuck in the close up camera animation as if youre being attacked.Game can, and will randomly crash for no apparent reason or cause. Can happen between cutscenes, running around, opening menus and probably more.Assassin recruits will on occasion remain in an area, start walking around or otherwise think theres an enemy when there isnt. Recruits can also get stuck while running to saftey, never resetting on their own and effectively forcing themselves into an injured state.Overall complaintsShort storyline.Be prepared to either run around A LOT or spend about 3060 minutes per city unlocking fast travel points.Almanac Pages collectable throughout the two cities can be frustrating with the movement bugs as you have to chase them down.Snow, while a nice weather change, is a garbage mechanic on the Frontier zone.You assassin recruits are pretty useless early on, if not a burden entirely when you first unlock them.Making money is pretty limited, and almost entirely from you hunting for pelts. The process is tedious and you have to spend countless hours running through the forests just to be able to unlock a few upgrades early on.Lack of weapon upgrades, more or less there are static weapons that are overall better than their counterparts, which are unlocked incredibly early on.Unrefined AI and some questionable moments in the engagement process. A group of 2 guards can be facing away from you on one side of a ship, and air assassinating a target not only behind an object but out of view will trigger them, but a gunshot at the same location wont.
