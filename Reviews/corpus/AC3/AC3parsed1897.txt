Pros Smooth combat and graphicsCons repetitive and a little too long for what it isIf youre a fan of AC games before or after this one you probably will like this one too. AC3 is a solid game but it has its issues. Without getting nitpicky with the various bugs and glitches that may or may not still be in the game, my biggest gripe was that it lacked innovation. Thats mostly okay because the AC series has a winning formula to keep us playing. The contribution that it makes to the series story is like the other games at the beginning and the end. The middle part is mostly all about the smooth gameplay with some forgetable plot that relates to the period in which its set. The develops did try to add in a new feature of managing a homestead. Pretty much just a lame crafting and farming system. Theres plenty of side objectives in this game but for me I didnt really bother unless they were in my way because it wasnt all that rewarding. Overall a great game with just some minor flaws.8.5/10
