This is simply a bad game.It is heavily scripted and a flow of the game does not really exist which is why I felt patronised most of the time.The story and the motivation of the characters is incoherent, hard to follow and most of the time did not really make sense to me. The characters are dull and difficult to sympathise with. Everything that made Assassins Creed II and its Addons great is missing in this game.I mainly bought it during a sale since I wanted to know how the story outside the animus proceeded but now I would recommend to someone with similar motives to just look it up somewhere and save the money.If you have not played this game, you have not missed anything.
