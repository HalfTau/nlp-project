Im playing through full AC series recently. This is my fifth and I can feel there are some remarkable improvements in it.This game gives me a refreshing feel after I stuck with Eizos trio literally forever. The rebuild of 18 bc America is beautiful. To watch it, feel it is the reason why I keep playing this series. The system has many impressive imporvements as well. Gameplay feels more realistic, less dumb AI and missions are more challanging than before.Unlike the old Trio,that totally stucked with the same system, reptitive storyline. Took me more than 200 hours to beat them. I nearly lose the faith to keep on.Im in 10 progress now.Oh, Builtin board games are perrty fun to play. Im getting a crush on it which took half of my game time on it.
