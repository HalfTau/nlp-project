This review is subjective and entirely my own opinion, feel free to agree or disagree with it.Assassins Creed III is the best AC game I have played so far. It adds new elements to the franchise, new locations, new characters and improved gameplay that makes it feel unique to its franchise, but it is let down by Ubisofts blatant disregard for PC gamers and their systems.This game would be fantastic if is was not for the constant drops in framerate and the game ruining bugs and glitches. I would only buy if it is on sale. It is worth the full price but it may leave some players feeling ripped off because of the ongoing issues and poor optimisation.
