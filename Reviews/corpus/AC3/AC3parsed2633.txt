If you like the Assassins Creed games, the American Revolution, or just science fiction, then Assassins Creed III is the game for you. Its packed with famous events such as the Battles of Lexington and Concord, famous people such as George Washington, and continues the story of Desmond Miles, the presentday Assassin. Although some missions may be difficult at times, the overall game is very fun and I had lots of fun playing it. The most entertaining thing about this game, in my opinion, is the fact that it is possible to fight tons of British soldiers in the streets of Boston. If you have twenty dollars and like the American Revolution and Assassins Creed, then buy this game.
