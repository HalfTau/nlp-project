Assassins Creed can be vaguely compared to the concept of The Matrix in which you play a protagonist in the real world who becomes someone else inside a virtual world. It tells a fictional story of a war between Assassins and Templars  and spans across several real life historic periods. The franchise is one of few  which tells a massive story backtoback instead of switching main characters half way through or making massive time jumps. Especially Assassins Creed III  seems to be the best game in this long standing franchise.
