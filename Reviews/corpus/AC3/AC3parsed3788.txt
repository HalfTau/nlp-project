This game is an endurance test every time I play. Between  writing and acting, a downright ridiculous story that really started ever since the end of ACII, Desmon being in the game at all, controls that were designed by Satan himself, and an interrupting cutscene every 5 minutes that constantly leaves me asking the question So when do I get to start playing? this game is the worst entry in the series.If this was the first entry, you could rest assured that thered never be a sequel and Im actually a fan of AC1 and all the AC2s. Its more a movie than a game given the amount of times it literally just takes control away from you, and a sucky movie at that too honestly, these writers couldnt write their way out of a paper bag without using a series of jump cuts to the future, and I shouldnt really be able to tell when a voice actor is just reading in another language, especially one Ive never heard before, but here in AC3, you can totally hear the reading. To be fair though, it could be dead on that the natives always sounded like they were reading if so, well done. The ONLY real freedom you have in this game is running around looking at the top of all the towers and collecting all the collectables. Now, maybe thats true about all the ACs, but this one is by far the worst about it.Do not buy unless youre looking for an endurance test in the Revolutionary War setting.
