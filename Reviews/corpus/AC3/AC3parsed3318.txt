Its a fun game with good graphics, almost no glitches, and good gameplay mechanics.It story department lacks a lot because the main character is just not that interesting. The game makers do a good job of showing the templars not in a totally bad way but its just glanced over for feather collecting seriously. There are a lot of things which are basically useless ? like trapping, hunting, and upgrades for your farm because all they give you is money and you honestly dont need that many upgrades to beat the game so its a lot of wasted time which you can do but is not necessary. The Desmond sections are pretty fun but the story is basically running at full speed by the end and a lot of the backstory with Juno is.... weird.Overall, not the best Assassins Creed game but fun for what it is.
