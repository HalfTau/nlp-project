There is only one good thing i can say about this game and that is the graphics are a bit better than the previous games. As for the rest it is terrible, so goddam awful there are no words to emphasize just how bad it is. With overly long boring cutscenes i fell asleep many times which got me into some trouble at work. I only played this game as it is in my library and for no other reason.
