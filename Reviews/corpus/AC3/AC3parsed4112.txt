There are some good things about AC3, but for some reason it didnt draw me in decently. I believe it was primarily because the main character wasnt very compelling. Id much rather have played a full game with the initial protagonist, but then that character is replaced with a second protagonist that I found to be much less charismatic or intriguing.
