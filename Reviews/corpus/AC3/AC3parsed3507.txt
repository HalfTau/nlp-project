Bought the deluxe edition. UPlay is a terrible application, and the season pass does not seem to have gained me anything. And the included  Benedict Arnold DLC is nowhere to be seen. Uplay will not accept the provide season pass key or DLC key nor provide any indication that those key are already entred. There is no indiication fo this in the game as well, as the only DLC listed is some george washington thing. Which Im sure is magical, and should be part of the season pass.Its disturbing that the pirates get a better product than those who pay for it. Uplay is like those You wouldnt downlod a car ads youre forced to watch on movies you paid for  while the pirates just take that part out and enjoy a seamless experience.If you buy this game, it will download and after setting up yet another account on another only storefront youll get to play the game but youll probably have to fight with their horrendous support team until you give up and vow to not buy any more of their products.
