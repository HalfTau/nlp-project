If your the type of person who loves cinematic scenes and puzzle peice story lines, then this game is perfect for you. I personally liked the combat mechanic and the cinematic scenes. The voice acting is great as well. Traveling is kind of like Skyrim Elder Scrolls V and I really cant complain being a huge Skyrim fan myself. Parkour mechanic is a bit weird at times but it works just fineIn conclusion8/10
