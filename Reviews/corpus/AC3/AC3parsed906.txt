On my opinion, the best ASC title, side by side with black flag.A open world, never seen, with forests, valeys, cities, seas, unbalivable atmosphere, a massive combat, alive cities, massive gameplay, a massive amount of content, many forts to capture, be a kid, grow up, hunt animals, parkour on trees, on the mountains... this game is the game, that everyone must try, playing freely on USA, live the revolution, this game, is the biggest game ive ever played, played on a cracked version, now decided to buy, worth every euro. PERFECT. PERFECT. PERFECT.bad aspects uplay. ubisoft servers and the big amount of bugs and glitches.Im not gonna lie, this is the biggest assassins creed ever made, tons of quests, mini quests, tons of forests to explore, ocean quests, your own colony to build, probably the biggest map ever seen in a game, you can also hunt, lock pick treasures, play games with npcs, and much more.And ofc, the multiplayer mod.My favourite game on the genre.BIG TIP Buy all the dlcs, it adds tons of hours, unfortenatly, i only have 1 of them
