in my eyes one of the best games from this franchise and one of the last games ubisoft made well.back when it was new, the kind of movement was new, the enviroment unusual, the story fascinating and the personalities believably.i liked this game so much, i completed it multiple times except collectibles, bwa!.if you can get it for less than 1015, you wont make a mistake.but in my eyes  if you keep in mind, that assassins creed III is several years old by now  closely not worth the current price of 25 CH source
