If you like AC then youll probably still enjoy this. While the mythos is set in colonial time USA which sounds so awesome there really arent any assassins running around in bigbattles with the british like it shows in the opener. While that isnt horrible it is misleading and im just clarifing for you. Its AC so its fun the wilderness is pretty cool albeit easy to get turned around at times. Having your own ship and sea to sea combat is badass RECOMMENDED
