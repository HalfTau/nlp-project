If youre going to skip one of the AC series, let it be this one. Everything you might have possibly liked about AC games isnt here. The setting is inherently dull and all chances to add colour were missed. The fighting system doesnt make much sense with firearms around. The storytelling is jumpy and inconsistent. The main plot is you either walking or being teleported to markers, so that you see some cutscenes. Sometimes you have to reach the point in stealth, which is a broken mechanic btw. And the sidequests are fun for the first two minutes and ultimately pointless.The only positive is the characters, which are given more depth than any previous AC game. But how much is that worth in a game with boring gameplay and a skippy story?Everything is tedious, broken or both. I make a point to play all of the AC games because they do have their moments, but the amount of upery in this game is testing my willpower. It gives you just enough to make you think you could have some fun with it, and immediately reminds you that you wont.
