3.5 Stars  A B movie with a hollywood budgetYou play Connor, a native american lad whose village gets burned down by the ruthless scheming templars. Angry and confused you reach out for a way of getting vengeance and land amidst an order of assassins, dedicated to wiping out the templars. However your skills and your hatred get used by the political power struggle of the time and you end up helping to start and win the american revolution, birthing the country which eventually will commit the genocide of the native american people.Basically youre ain this game, robbed of your adolescence by the loss of your family, you cling to the naieve ideals of freedom and latch onto the American patriots, fighting for a free country, not its natives. The problem is that, thanks to hindsight, you can see history unfolding before you and you know whats going to happen to Connor, blindly lashing out at the world and inadvertantly causing the death of the not just the family hes trying to save but vast numbers of his people all across America, you really dont wonder why you start to hate the protragonist just a little bit.The naval battles are genuinely awesome and the running, jumping, climbing trees elements make you feel like a ninja, but the incredibly drawn out plot 40 hours and I skipped the epilogue and the massively anticlimactic ending really detract from what could have been a fascinating romp through American history.
