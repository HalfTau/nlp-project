Although the game at launch had a rough start back in 2012, this game is pretty good now that it has been patched. With adding a lot of new things and a pretty big map with 5 different areas to play in. Home front, Frontier, Boston, New York, and the Navel missions in different areas the combat is an improvement from AC1Revilation but the instant counter kill is still in the game. The story its self is pretty good and a decent length with plenty of side quest to do to help prolong your play through. Connor may not be an Ezio but he is his own type of person either you love him or you dont, but the game its self is in my opinion worth the buy.
