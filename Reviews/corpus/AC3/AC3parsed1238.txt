I am playing this only for the story.I am not enjoying the games mechanics at all.They are very dull and uninteresting.Hack and Counter... yay...Sure there are some items for use but im basically done with the game atm and i have used ZERO of these items unless asked to when completing full Sync. They are utterly useless. You just Hack your way through a really good story.Once again AC is showing its not a stealth game at all. Its a joke calling this series of games Stealthy. Its Action/Adventure and Story Driven. It took them all the way to Syndicate to add actual STEALTH mechanics... and that game released in 2015.Mechanics in this installment are clunky and tedious.Swimming mechanics are garbage like the rest, same engine was used for Black Flag and its just as bad. Black Flag was a phenominal game overall because it was a straight up pirate game and was very good fun.Horse riding will make you want to vomit.The Bow was also unimpressive. It was an item i was very excited about and was sadly let down by its preformance in game. But maybe that was to emphisize the evolution of technology... there are flintlocks and Rifles.Overall the game is like my review.Half baked.You are better off watching someone play the cinematics via the internet. Youtube thisand save your monies.
