I wanted to like this game as much as I liked AC2, but I just couldnt do it...Everything on paper checks out. There is clearly vision for a great game, but the execution just isnt up to scratch.There are loads of cool features, such as hunting, crafting, building your homestead, eagle vision, hidden tresure and naval battles  but in the end it is all pointless in the grand scheme of things.There are only three plot driven naval battles, and the homestead/crafting portion of the game doesnt affect anything throughout the game except completion percentage, which makes that whole part of the game feel tacked on to add content, rather than a meaningful gameplay experience.I upgraded one weapon which promptly disappeared from my inventory after the next mission, so I went the entire game without upgrading anything else, which shows collecting money is entirely unimportant also, as you can complete the game with the beginning equipment easily.Storywise, I didnt care for it at all. I guess you have to know or care about basic American history to understand why Connor is involved in what I am assuming are all key events in Americas formation. The present part of the game makes even less sense. Ive played and completed AC2 and 3 now, and still have no idea what is going on, or how its relevant to the bulk of the game due to a lack of backstory.The controls are decent for the most part, except when Connor decides to run up walls and climb things when youre just trying to follow someone. It can get frustrating at times, and did lead to a few mission failures when having to keep up with a target through winding back alleys.So much potential for a great game in here, but it just didnt hook me at all. Youd think with the 20 minute long credits, there would have been enough people on board to build it into a cohesive RPG, but it plays like a short history based and Forrest Gump inspired adventure with a few added bonuses to fill in time.I was 30 completed in the game when I just wanted it to end so I never had to play it again. Thankfully that is now so, and I can kiss it and Uplay goodbye forever.I wont be buying anything Assassins Creed or Ubisoft again.
