I feel very let down by it. Its just more of the same youve known, only in a cooler period of time IMO. The boat missions were the best parts from what Ive played. The intro really does take forever. I think Ive officially lost faith in this series. I had a feeling that would happen once Ubisoft decided they needed to make as many of them as they could, as fast as they could.
