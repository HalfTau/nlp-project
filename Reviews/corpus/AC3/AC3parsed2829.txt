So many plotholes its like a big cartoon chunk of cheese. I dont know if its because its a port or what but this game is full of so many glitches its laughable. Dont get me wrong its fun for the ride but its the same old game with a higher number slapped on the case. This series really has gone down the pan since i cant really remember because its a blurred mess of a franchise. But like a drug addict or an idiot ill keep playing because i want to know what happens and because i want a mind numbing game to play sometimes. The story is ridiculously lazy and makes no sense anymore, there was so much potential storywise and its clearly been rushed out to satisfy the templars that run ubisoft. Shame on you ubisoft for pulling a typically EA style move and ruining something that could have been a great series.
