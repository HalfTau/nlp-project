 Assassins creed again. It is often said about the latest AC games that it is just like the old ones, with new weapons, a few new mechanics and new storyline.I see this as a good thing, nay, a great thing. Assassins Creed has stepped from its astounding beginnings each time building on what was liked in the last game and added new features.As the closing act for the main storyline no spoilers, it was a little disappointing. Also the architecture of this era makes for very little house running that we had in the previous games.The introduction of sea battles was a little clunky but a good starting point for Black Flag. With plenty of side missions and things to collect it is a beautiful and enjoyable world.
