I can see how ACIII could be exciting for Americans. Running around an 18th Century market town like Boston must be evocative glimpse into the early United States.For Brits, however, that novelty is absent. Most of our towns still look like this. Playing ACIII is very much like spending a dull Tuesday afternoon in Shrewsbury, or Bicester. Or Sudbury. Or Market Harborough.
