The story, combat, animations, world, and voice acting are all great. This is honestly by far my favorite to date minus one thing. The controls are not crisp in this one and its very frustrating. It has a lot of really derpy moments that I just dont understand. Climbing sync points in trees Ive had issues with branch targeting. Being on ships can be really annoying with the tight spaces and climbing cargo. Ive had air assassinates totally screw up because they were on a horse. There are points in the game it just disables certain abilities for no clear reason. I played this right after Revelations and the controls are just not the same.
