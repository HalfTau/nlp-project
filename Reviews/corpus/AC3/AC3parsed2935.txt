Pretty good game. After sequence 3 3 hours into the game you are able to play as the protagonist, Connor. Before that you play as some english dude and its not that interesting. Im not even sure why its in the game, This is the reason but anyways, the game runs pretty good. My only hesitation on buying this game was because I heard it was poorly optimized. I have a NVIDIA GeForce 745 4GB and an i54440 with 8GB of ram. I run this game on high settings at 1600x900.
