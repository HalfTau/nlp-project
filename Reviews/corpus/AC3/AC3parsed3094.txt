It was like playing through a game that was envisioned, written and directed by George Lucas. The plot is poorly tied together and the narrative drags on in ways that are often unecessary and confusing. Want to kill an assassination target in the streets and just shoot him in the back as any reasonable assassin would? Nope, lets force you through a long winded escape from jail sequence and then you can do it.Even gameplay wise the game falls short as you are forced into the correct position should you fail a mission your first try. Oh sorry AC3, did you want to play yourself? Go ahead then. Few chances to run on roof tops as well as AI will get angry at you and buildings can be so far apart and roads so wide that you are better off running in the streets or riding on horseback because its not as if you were playing an Assassin Creeds game. Does not have the writing, play and feel of a AAA title and one that was falsly advertised as well. You never do take part in any real battles, sure its not realistic but all you do is man a cannon and press B.Play the AC2 series if you want an assassination game, this is a poor addition to the series and brings a horrible ending to a fairly long saga with Desmond. Didnt know all those years ago that it would end like this one, and wow...awful.
