I really like AC Series. Their fictional history stories are awesome. Though, I am not too fond of Connors character, AC III gives you an atmospheric american revolution environment which is captivating.I think an asian version, wheteher chinese, arabic or japanese Assassins Creed would be awesome. Imagine ninjas or shaolins leaping on the top of buildings.
