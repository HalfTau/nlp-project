Bought Assasins Creed Black Flag a while ago on a whym because of the naval gameplay and really liked it, AC3 had naval gameplay too so I thought Id try it and figuredthey could of done nothing but improve it. The story and some of the nonchangable controls annoyed me and by the time I had finally gotten to the naval gameplay6 hours of speeding through quests I was very dissapointed with how they changed it from Black Flag. The game is just no fun to play, and the parts I was hoping Id get to enjoy were a chore to get to and very dissapointing once I got there. Applied for a refund.
