You will probably like this if you liked the previous AC titles. The gameplay is pretty much the same, but the setting is colonial America. The ship combat is interesting as well. The multiplayer, however, is dead.There are a few issues that I had with the story, but I ultimately enjoyed my time with this title.The main issue that I had with the story is that Conner gets knocked out from getting pistol whipped by a fat colonial dude possibly more than one time. Conner is an expert tracker with super ninja assassin vision which I believe is described in the game as something along the lines of being able to detect things which normal people cannot. Hes a damn stealth ninja mass murderer that can take on hordes of trained soldiers by himself. Hell, he can even stay concious after being in close range of connonball strikes. Im supposed to believe that a fat colonial dude can take him by surprise and pistol whip him? No. Heres what would happen in that scenario counter  hidden knife to the brain pan  return to starting position. Find a different way to progress the story. How about shooting him with poison darts? That would have been more believable, since none of the soldiers ever use those.The other big issue I had with the story is Conners personality. From what I remember of the previous games, Altair and Ezio both reminded me of someone like Jason Bourne. Conner, on the other hand, reminded me of Anakin Skywalker from episode 2.
