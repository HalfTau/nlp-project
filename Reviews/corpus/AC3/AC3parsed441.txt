Overall, this is a good game. Yes, you have to deal with Uplay, which I understand can be frustrating. The only real problem I have with this game is the pacing of the story. It drags on way too long at the start, and then really picks up speed around the end of the game and leaves you wanting more of the story, while unfortunately also making you feel a bit empty inside. The story itself is fine, the problem is the speed at which they told the story, in game. However, this is still a solid entry in the Assassins Creed franchise.
