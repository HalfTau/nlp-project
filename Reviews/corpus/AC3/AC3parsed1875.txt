I played and liked pretty much every AssCreed Game before 3, and I was kinda sceptical about this one because of bad reviews and the general opinion about this installment.bbbbut, turns out this game is wonderful, i enjoyed playing it and i highly recommend it for pretty much anyone.It has smooth and good looking visuals, naval mission i enjoyed massively and i wished there would be more of them, fighting and climbing works smooth and is learned pretty quick. There is a fricking Homestead, you are building your small communitiy and it is very satisfieng to see it grow and progress.But like every game this also has some negativesThe Stockpile, Crafting and Trading Menus are the worst i navigated through in the last years, and the need of these is pretty much nonexistent, you dont need the money it drops off which is kinda sad, I wish the Menu would be alot better to control and it would have a real impact on the game with missions and notority effects or in general that it changes something in the game.Alot of running from A to B and then over D to C and back to A again. 20 hours or so of my playtime was me riding, running, climbing through the land just to come to the mission starts just to be send 2 miles in the other direction again.The ending was the most dissapointing I ever played till now, it is just so unsatisfying, it just ends, you yourslef as the player aint even given the press X to kill for the  Lee, which wouldve made the game at least a bit better. but yeah the ending is crap.And thats pretty much all, buy it, play it, enjoy it for it is a good game.
