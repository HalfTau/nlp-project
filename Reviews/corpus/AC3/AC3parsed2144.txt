This is a fantastic game.Its beautiful to watch, has a great story and you feel engaged in the game.You have three locations/maps to explore and they are pretty big, you never feel constrained.Combat isnt a huge challenge, but it is fun. Looking around the street after a big fight to see all the bodies spread all over... its definitely cool!There are some bug issues with a couple of quests, also the game keeps a lot of options locked until very late in the storyline.To minimize this, I found that playing the storyline at least up to sequence 8, preferably 10, leaving all the side quests until you get this far in the story. By then you have everything unlocked and plenty to do.I did a second play through when I was half way through my first one and did just this, I found little to no bugs to report, doing it this way.Also, hunting is fun! Again, might not be a huge challenge, you can definitely dismiss all the hunting tactics and just run around like a manic through the woods until you corner your prey or it does a bad move and comes in range for you to strike and kill it, which is also fun.. but, you can do it with stealth, climb a tree and sit there, track your prey with clues, lure it to you and then d a swift kill.At this time I have 57 hours logged into the game, even if a couple of those are from the first play through that I gave up on, I have finished the storyline and there is still plenty more to do, and if I dont buy AC4 right away, Ill have a couple more hours worth out of this one.EditA couple of things that I found about making the game run as smoothly as possible.You need Uplay. Get it from the Ubisoft website! The version of Uplay that Steam installs with the game is bugged and will make your gameplay hell.Get Uplay, create an account, unlock your game in Uplay, with the key you get from Steam.Before I did this, I was about to shelve this game because it would frequently hang on load screens or just lock up entirely, its all because of Uplay. After uninstalling the version that came with Steam and getting the latest one, game ran smoothly, no hangs or lock ups.
