Good game, I like the Assassins Creed series, I really liked this ones setting. I dont think I will ever get back into it, just becasue it feels rather old and cliche at this point. It was definitely worth buying, and I am glad I finished, but I dont know how each would like it their own. Regardless, Ive spent my time here and have moved on.
