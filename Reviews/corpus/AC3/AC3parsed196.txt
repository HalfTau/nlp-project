This game was very fun. I have 200 hours of game time. I loved playing this game trying to find all the hidden secrets and stuff. HOWEVER, i came back to the game to mess around and play on the game with over 200 hours, and it states I need to buy additinal DLC to even do freeplay on that savegame. Why do I need to buy DLC that I dont even want to play? I just want to play my game. If this DLC is necessary to play, it should be included in the purchase. I bought this game at full retail price. Do not buy this game. Punish Ubisoft for trying to push this BS DLC.
