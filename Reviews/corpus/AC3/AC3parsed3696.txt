Bought this while on special after playing Black Flag. As much as I have Ubisoft Black Flag was fantastic.This game crushed that. So many bugs. Menus just didnt work. PC port was done so bad its easy to see why everyone hates Ubisoft.If you arent going to bother to do it right dont do it.Apparently is a good game. I could not finish it when it wasnt crashing there was game breaking bugs everywhere.
