This game was pretty good with introducing new mechanics, even if it took time to adjust to them. Theres a lot of side content to do, but remember its all optional if you feel suffocated by it. I stopped doing minor side quests because of that, and getting on with the main story felt good. The funny thing is that you could die more easily to being ambushed by a wolf than getting shot 10 times while running from hordes of guards. If you can look past the terrible optimization of the towns and not the best AIs, this game is solid.
