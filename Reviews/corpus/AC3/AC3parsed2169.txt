I personally think AC III is the worst game of the series I have played so far. It is not a bad game but compared to AC I and II it just lacks everything. The Story is actually quite interesting but also very confusing because the amount of different people that do not really play an important role is huge and every mission someone else gets introduced so the only deep character in the game is the assassin you play, everyone else is just some person that does something for or with you.The town where a huge part of the game plays  Boston  doesnt have the character like the towns in AC II where you could spend hours and hours just exploring and doing anything. The architecture is rather boring of course its related to the time AC III takes place but anyway.But as you see there are a lot of positive reviews so just try it out yourself maybe you like all that stuff that I didnt. But for me this was one of those games which I rather want to end quickly so I can play another game.
