Not recommended for PC at this time. Although excited to be back in the AC world, each successive episode gets a little harder to get running on the PC in widescreen using keyboard/mouse. As usual the FOV scaling is not correct for widescreen and there is no slider control like there is for Borderlands 2. This is the difference between a big game company that listens to PC customer feedback and one that does not. Some of the earlier AC episodes had third party widescreen support through widescreen gaming forum and others making gameplay bearable. The second biggest issue with AC3 is that it is nearly impossible to use keyboard and mouse, having to default to controller. Even with controller, the menu requires multiple movement and button presses just to navigate. The quick select is not so quick anymore. In widescreen the cursor does not line up with the characters and the mouse cursor must be positioned to the left or right of the target before it will be highlighted, making it difficult to shoot targets. The UPLAY launcher is similar to Games for Windows Live which just adds another layer duplicating all the functions that Steam already gives you and achievements only appear on UPLAY not Steam.
