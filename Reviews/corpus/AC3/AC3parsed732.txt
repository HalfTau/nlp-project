I have been a fan of this franchise since I played the first installment to the series on the Xbox 360.   I bought this game even though it recieved mixed reviews from a variety critics and gamers.   I can honestly say Im happy with my purchase, this game reworked a lot of mechanics which in turn gave it a fresh step in the right direction.  The story is rich and deep, Im not really that interested in the ship combat, but its a nice way to keep the game interesting.  Overall this game is excellent and I recomend it to anybody who like adventure and story driven games.
