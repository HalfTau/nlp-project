Assassins Creed 3 is one of the most unique games of the series. It adds this spectacular aspect of outdoor and wilderness gameplay that is sure to remind you of Red Dead Redemption. Hunting in this game is very fun.The story is a unique aspect, but compared to ac2 it could have been better. You begin the game playing as Nathan. Nathan meets a native american woman and she gives birth to Connor. Nathan was a templar and Connor became an assassin. The story leads up to an epic father vs son battle scene and honestly that was one of my favorite moments of this game.Gameplay In regards to gameplay, its better than ever. In no other game maybe batman can you take up to 20 or more soldiers and defeat them all. Crushing enemies gives you a satisfying feeling.In regards to playability. Ive put over 44 hours into this game and still have not been able to beat it 100 percent. Youre going to want to collect every almanac page, every feather, every chest, liberate all the colonies through your assassin trainees and more.The most fun aspect of this game has to be the sea missions. Naval combat is superb. That content alone adds numerous hours of gameplay to the game.Overall this is one of the best Assassins Creed games yet. And I cant wait to get my hands on Black Flag.9/10
