Assassins Creed 3... I have very mixed feelings about. I really like the story, environments, and gameplay. The one sticking point for me is the crafting/trading system.It was a real treat to me to get to see the events of the Revolutionary War play out from an outside perceptive without the almost saintly quality we, being an American, give these events and people in them. The environments accompany the story beautifully and are what I always come to expect of an AC installment.With the advent and wideuse of gunpowder in this era, the combat is still as inventive and fun as always. Being able to use muskets along with the traditional assortment of tools in the assassins toolkit makes for a good, whole combat experience.The shear complexity of it turned me off completed from it and I never bothered to touch it or the quests in the game. It was the natural progression I think the creative team needed to go but I think they will need to redraw this idea.I feel that overall, this is the lackluster title of the series. With that being said, its still a good game to have and a musthave for those following the Desmond Miles storyline.
