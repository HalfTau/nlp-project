Storyline 7/10 Edward AC4, Ezio AC2 and Altair AC1 had better stories, period. Still, not bad, and the Desmond storyline actually gets something done. But they couldve done better some people go down too easily and others too difficultly. Im looking at you, H.K, and you, T.H. SpoilersGameplay 5/10 Seriously I have to get off a horse to climb a 10cm ledge, call my horse again and continue until the next time that happens. Couldve been more smoothly.Graphics 6/10 Could be better for a 2012 game. Still, not bad.Credits 1/10 Unskippable. I couldve written a whole thesis in the time the credits were going. Not a Skip credits or Go faster through the credits button. Ubi, why?
