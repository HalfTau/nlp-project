This game is fine, but I highly recommend getting it on sale. It starts a little slow, but is quite good. There is a TON of side quests, and objectives. Fighting at sea was very cool, and will be huge in the next AC.I may come back to it later to do side events/DLC, but the main story was engaging enough for me. A good buy if you can get it for 15 or under..
