Pros Decent graphics.Good storyline.Good voice acting.The naval combat.Cons Still try to figure out why the ending was so lame.Artificial difficulty because of the optional objectives. Otherwise the game is just too easy.Assassins Creed syndrome  Connor get stuck/climb on everything you do not want him to.Repetitive.I wanted to try this game cause a lot of people seems fond of the franchise. I can see why they love it but this is clearly not my type of game. The gameplay was too assisted and the game itself lacks some purpose. Ive just watch a movie about the American Revolution instead of playing a videogame.
