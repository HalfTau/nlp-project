Liked this one. Played all ACs, AC2 being my favourite and Revelations being the one I could never complete because too boring. Completed AC3 100, 70 hours. Visually very beautiful and historically appetizing. Combat is the old and simple AC combat style...nothing too challenging. Naval battles in seastorms were for me a wonderful change from the usual game settings. DLC worth it? Played Hidden Secrets DLC...it is worth it but only if you buy it with the game. I got it after I completed the game 100, bad choice since you dont get to use the sword and the outfits in quests. Mayan ruins could be a taste of what AC4black flag is going to be. AC3 is a beautiful game, VERY rich in details. 88/100
