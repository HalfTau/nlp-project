Even tho alot of people hate Assassins Creed 3 for its boring story, easiest combat in series and Main character, I personally liked all of them.Combat is fun and easy but it can also sometimes feel booring because, as i said its so easy.Connor is usually too serious and uncharismatic as a main character, but i got along with him.Story was great about freedom and justice, but too slow at getting to play as Connor.Over all i would give the game score of 7.5/10Because it doesnt have the thing that is in other AC Games
