Let me first point out that Im not exactly recommending this for the single player story. The improvements done in AC3 compared to its predecessors is very satisfying thus making it a fresh experience. If youre patient enough to explore everything and pursue all the little tasks, AC3 could simply last you 60 hours. Otherwise its rather a short lived dull experience. However if youre a fan of the series and need to stay in the loop of the overall story do give it a shot. Its got a tiny bit of a twist.
