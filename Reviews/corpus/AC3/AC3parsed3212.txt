Reading through most of the reviews there was a lot of hate for this game. The first time I played through was a couple months after release, and I completely fell in love. Story, gameplay, and the genre my first AC. After that I played through ACB and returned back to ACIII about 2 years after its release. Playing through a second time and comparing it to ACB was completely different. The setting is still amazing but now having a comparisson showed me a lot of the game flaws. Graphical glitches, MAJOR objective difficulty requirments, and a TERRIBLE combat system WAY too easy made be fall out of love. Conner is such a controversial character and listen to his reasoning about the assassins and templars is frustrating to say the least. Also, some of the previous AC elements mainly the fellow assassins is extremely poorly done and completely hidden and unexplained. Still, the setting, new combat items, and an amazing naval combat system lifted this game. Ubisoft took a HUGE undertaking and if they had an extra 6 months this game would have been the best in the series. I think the rush was to fit with the Desmond story line compltely awful by the way and they added a huge plot twist to make the game more important to the series. However the twist was stupid and didnt make me feel anything for Desmond.6/10
