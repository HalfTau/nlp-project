This game is pretty good if youre okay with stupid collectables stupid tons of bugs stupidly annoying AI stupid glitchy movement stupid glitchy gameplay falling from the face of earthOther than those stupid things, It has quite interesting sidequests such as homestead missions, heartwarming missions which let you gather those who are not needed and build your own community. and Cpt.Kidds treasure, a treasure of the legendary pirate from Black Flag.
