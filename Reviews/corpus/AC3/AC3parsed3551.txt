I was very disapointed in many things about this. 1. The controls are very confusing at first.2. You cant kill random civilians or animals unless its animals in the wilderness. 3. Its a real hand holding type game, very scripted. Things I thought were inproved was the graphics, storyline and voice acting in general. If you wait until this is like at a bargin price then I guess it would be a new game to try but my score on this is a 6/10
