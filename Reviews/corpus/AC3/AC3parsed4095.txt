Much like past Assassins Creed games this one relies on many of the same types of activities and quest types to complete required tasks. However, it seems as though theyve taken all the fun bits out and replaced them with confounding and completely unnecessary mundanity. The result is a game cleary rushed and subsequently joyless, incomprehensible and infuriating. If you havent bought this yet and the overarching story is important to you, I recommend skipping this one altogether and just look for spoilers on the Internet etc.
