Assassins Creed III ReviewI have never been a particular fan of the Assassins Creed series, so when I bought this game I was pretty excited. HOWEVER, due to technical faults which I could not solve I couldnt play the game without Uplay crashing and burning it. Ubisoft customer support were very quick about replying however, but we still didnt solve the issue.  Eventually, I had to do a COMPUTER RESET BACK TO FACTORY SETTINGS just to get it to work. Once this was dealt with, the game worked perfectly.So the game. You start the game off as Haytham Kenway. A suity kinda guy who you would definitely NOT expect to be climbing CInema walls.  And yet this is what he does. He climbs cinema walls just to kill a dude with a necklace. There is then set a wild goose chase, as we try and see if we can find some kinda temple or other.You then play as Connor  or Rahetuhaskjdbnjksbd apologies for bad spelling D who is a kid. You then play hide and seek with other kids and then get caught. Connor grows up really quickly to the point of being a tree hugger and climbing through trees. You meet an old guy on a hill. He turns out to be aan assassin and all that crap.Overall, I think this game is amazing. The graphics ingame are a stunning HD, and with my Nvidia GeForce Graphics chip, the game runs pretty smoothly. The fighting system works well, as you can easily block enemy attacks. Combo moves  are a bit tricky, but once you get the hang of it becomes great. The map is extremely big, covering New York, Boston, Davenport Homestead, and the jungle wilds. There are a few side quests, but if you get bored it may be worth getting the DLC addon. I would give this game a 9.5/10. Great job Ubisoft!
