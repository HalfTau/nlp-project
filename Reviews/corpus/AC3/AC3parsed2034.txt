Here is my opinion of this dreaded game.I love AC franchise and I love playing however horrendous the games are. I even loved them once back in the time of brotherhood perhaps. For some reason Ubisoft packs their games with compatibility, control and graphics issues all the time only for such expensive prices!If you like the story and see what is the plot in the game like I do play it at your own expense. Otherwise, there are plenty of other fishes in the sea.
