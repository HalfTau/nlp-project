Good game, interesting story line, and continued upgrading of the AC gameplay. Connor is an engaging character and becomes a huge badass. The forest environment is very unique and fun to explore, espeically with the hunting part. Definitely a fun game to try, espeically for the price.What spoiled the game for me, was that it was the first of the unfinished products that has come on the market lately. There are so many issues with it that I would sometimes turn it off out of frustration. And unfortunately those much needed patches never came. So be warned about that. But overall, its worth playing.
