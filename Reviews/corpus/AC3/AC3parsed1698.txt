People had a problem with this game most likely for the story? I dont even know myself.I personally thought this game was alright.I LOVED the combat and gameplay. It was a lot of fun and interesting to find different ways to kill someone.And the hunting? Amazing! Hunting the animals was probably the most I did in this game!The storyline to it was actually okay. The ending got me fcked up becuase well, storyrich game fan and getting into the game like it was an action movie really got me. Its a slow build, yeah it takes time. But it was worth it.I recommend this game without a doubt. I sometimes think AC should have ended its series here but thats on me.Youll see why if you play it.
