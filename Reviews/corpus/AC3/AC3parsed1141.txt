First things first I love all the other assassins creeds but this game is a total grind.The bonus objectives are utterly pointless and totally frustrating to complete. I would much sooner complete the mission how I like rather than some dumb pointless objective which most of the time has no benefit. I spent about an hour on one mission trying to do these stupid objectives then geting caught at the very end with NO CHECKPOINT, SO MUCH REPETITIVE BULLST! one example getting to the end then my character rather than hide in a bush decided it would be a better idea to climb up a ladder UPSIDE DOWN?! WHAT?! why would I even want to climb a ladder upside down? never mind when a guard is about to patrol around the corner? After finally completing the mission I get AC3 has stopped responding, I dont know if the progress is saved yet I need to rechage my bullst batteries before I can bring myself to play this boring frustrating game again.
