Iv played all of the Assassins creed game and this one is by far my favorite one. Amazing graphics and i find the story really interesting.But as everyone else there are things that i disliked about the game such as starting off as hathem and waiting a few hours to be able to play as connor when he is an assassin. Some other things were the missions out side of the animus, i understand its part of the story but i would have rather stayed in the animus.Other than those two things this game is deffinitly worth the buy, i bought the deluxe edition when the Assassins Creed Franchise was on sale.
