I dont know what it is about this game but I really dont know how to sum it up. In terms of an AC game its not bad, but it isnt great. The characters in 3 are not as dynamic as Ezio or even Altair so the feeling of the Order is lost almost completely.Ive played this game on both Console 360 and PC and I expected graphical improvements on PC but its not there. This is one of the few games I would say play console not PC. I experienced a lot of bugs, glitches, and small stuff like how your cloak flows and glitches through things which all together just bug me out of wanting to play this game.I do recomend this game but only if youre an AC fan and dont wanna skip over this part of the series, but if youre just looking for a good game Id opt for 2, brotherhood, or 4 instead and skip 3.
