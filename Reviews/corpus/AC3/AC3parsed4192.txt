As with previous installments, there are improvements and regressions in AC3. I loved the frontier, its one of the most beautiful, realistic, outdoor environments Ive ever seen in a game. Hunting is very enjoyable for a while, as is the ship combat. I also really enjoyed the story and the interesting take on the American Revolution. Unfortunately, partway through the game the protagonist is changed  I like the second protagonist OK, but the person you start is a much deeper more, more interesting character. There are numerous small bugs, although nothing too game breaking. Some of the missions are annoying, but I felt the game balance was a bit better than the previous games  if you go for the optional objectives almost everything is challenging but not overly so. My biggest issue with missions is sometimes the objectives given are not very clear.Contrary to a lot of other fans, I find this game to be more polished and fun than the any of the previous ones, and have put the most hours into it. It has its warts, but they made a good effort to clean up some of the problems that have kept this series from being outstanding.
