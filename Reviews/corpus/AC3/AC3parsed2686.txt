As a long time fan of the Assassins Creed series, I am markedly disappointed. AC3 drops some of the best and most fun things from all the time spent as Ezio good hit detection, functional contextual controls, QUIET single hit kill weapons, guards that dont spawn in trees, rocks you can climb most of the time, an economy that isnt terribly designed, freerunning that more or less works, a Brotherhood of Assassins that can actually KILL PEOPLE... and replaces them with the ability to jump in trees and kill beavers.This is by no means an even trade. Calling the game buggy is a drastic understatement. Calling the game dull... the same. Calling the story poorly written, many of the characters flavorless, the actual development involved in the title questionable... very reasonable.Give it a pass. Buy Black Flag instead, and play the game inspired by the one enduringly fun part of Assassins Creed 3 the ship missions. Trust me, you wont miss anything you care about.
