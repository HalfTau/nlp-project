Would NOT recommend. In my opinion, It doesnt stay true to the series. The story feels forced and the gameplay mechanics have changed for the worse. They mashed in as much cutscenes as they could and also decided to patch in a permenant B Skip prompt to ruin any immersion you wished to have. The UI is far from optimized and will even confuse native console players with positioning of quick weapon selection. No hope for mouse / keyboard usersI played on controller as there is horrible mouse smoothing and all the ranged attacks are forced autoaim. It even feels like they lazily took the disguise elements from the Hitman series and fighting elements from the Batman seriesnot in a good way. Overall it just seems like a mashed together, cutscene filled, sibling game elements money grab hiding behind the Assassins Creed trademark.Also. Five games in and they still dont know that Parkour plus Free Climbing does NOT equal Freerunning and they still havent learned how to PK roll correctly you dont roll down the spine, that would hurt / paralize you as a breakfall.
