Seriously, I had such hope for the fifth AC games, but instead Im filled with disappointment. I am a great fan of Assassins Creed, Assassins Creed II, Assassins Creed Brotherhood, Assassins Creed Revelations, but the fifth game of the series breaks my heart. The game constantly shows me red screens during the game play, and after the story line of Haytham, the game crashes every 510 minutes. I tried every compatibility setting in property, and it still crashes. I love the franchise, but honest to god, I hate this one single game that crashed literally a hundred times during my 2 days of game play.
