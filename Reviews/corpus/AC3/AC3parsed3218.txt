Wanted to like this game, so so much. The American Revolution is one of my favorite periods in all of history.Then, you get into the game and realize this PC port was probably not even play tested. Its a joke the sheer number of bugs an glitches youll encounter.I got to the Ledger Tutorial and just quit. Not touching it again, its completely broke. That part isnt compatable with a keyboard and mouse, and UbiSofts own website directs you to a WORK AROUND.The game is what? 2? 3? Years old now? And they NEVER PATCHED A GAME BREAKING BUG?Joke of a company, joke of a port, joke of a game.
