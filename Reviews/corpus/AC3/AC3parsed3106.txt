Coming as a long time fan, and having done multiple playthroughs of the previous AC games, I sadly was not a fan of this iteration of Assassins Creed. Im not entirely certain how best to describe what went wrong with game, but the best terms I can put it reached for lofty goals and just fell flat. The cities where just plain boring with very little places that were exciting to climb, and moving from one point to another felt like a chore instead of a navigational puzzle. The nature climbing and frontier aspects while good ideas where simply too twitchy to work effectively. The combat fell underneath the trap of the first AC where it was too repetitive and slow paced, and the gadgets I just couldnt really find a use for. Sure I figured them out easily enough, but I found the game to be much more efficient simply not using them. The highlight was the naval battles, since they were such an original concept, and they did manage to maintain their fun throughout the game as well.For the more abstract aspects, I felt the story was confusing and not at all properly injected into the history of the Revolutionary war. The main character, who seemed like he would be a breath of fresh air, was actually really boring and Im actually glad their not pursuing his story any longer.TLDR Even if youre a big AC fan, you can skip this entry. I got it for Desmonds conclusion, but even that wasnt all that exciting.
