I love this game so much. Dont listen to all the haters who complain about it being bad, just because Connor is a bad character and lets face it, he is. The new parkour system is incredible, everything feels connected, and while you still occasionally accidentally jump off buildings, this happens a lot less with the new engine. The combat is easy to get the hang of, and allows you to take out entire armies of enimies with ease, and taking a break from the war to hunt for some meat is always a fun distraction. I would say this was my second favourite Assassins Creed, besides Assassins Creed 4. You should buy it now, it really is a good game.
