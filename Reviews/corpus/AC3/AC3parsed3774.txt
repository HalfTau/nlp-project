Not the best in the series.I can only recommend this if you are really invested in the Desmond storyline from the previous games, and even then this game has to be 75 off.Its bland.The main character is boring and void of personality, and none of the other characters are very interesting.The story is very slow and just not interesting or even entertaining, the future bits of the story were more engaging than the animus segments.The open world maps are big in size but small in content, and tedious to traverse, there is a fast travel system but it only works on certain points on the map.The best method of travel is by horse, and the controls are clunky and awkward, the horse will get stuck at times because it cant step over a ing tiny rock, but it can jump over big fences.The sidequests are usually kinda boring as well.There is a hunting and crafting system in the game, but its boring halfand feels pointless.This game is also buggy, not in the crashy or laggy sense, as far as i have seen, but gameplay wise its awkward, npcs will get stuck in objects and the enviroment, freerunning that makes you go all over the place and just doesnt feel right.The game also feels halfand i had a couple of cutscenes with no lipsyncing.Now this makes the game sound horrible, so lets talk about the positives.The homestead mechanic was enjoyable, i know that Assassins Creed 2 had a similar system with Monteriggionisp? but it feels better in this one with characters and sidequests, granted the characters werent amazing or anything, but they were entertaining.The combat feels fluid and kinda fun, a little easy and it makes you feel like an unstoppable killing machine capable of slaughtering entire armies of puny little soldiers while their women lament, is that a positive or a negative? Depends on the person.The ship combat is amazing though, it will make you jump in your seat, and make you feel engaged.I cant say much about the Washington DLC because i had a gamebreaking glitch after 3040 minutes and i had to start all over, so i decided to give in to apathy and just say  it.All in all?4.5/10 if you can get it cheap and you like the Assassins Creed franchise its worth a buy.
