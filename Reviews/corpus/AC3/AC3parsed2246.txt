AC1 was incredible and innovative, AC2 was a rehash but with many improvements and more indepth story.This one though is widely considered the worst one and I can see why. I didnt think too much of it and ended up not playing it all the way through, its too much of the same and the main story takes way too long to get into. The controls can be frustrating and the requirement to sneak for so much of it makes it slow and boring.If you really like the games and arent tired of the same old gameplay over and over you might like it, but I would say get it on sale because youll probably be disappointed like many others.
