This game has boring characters and setting, it moves slower than any game Ive ever played, the sandbox is small and dismal and Ive played puzzle games that were more immersive.  The only reason I played it through was to see what happened to Desmond and the end of the world senario set up by the previous games.  I dont plan on going back for the 100 completion.
