A bit better than its predecessor, Revelations. Its main fatal flaw being that it takes 4 hours to start the actual game isnt necessarily gamebreaking, but it could easily deter the less intrigued and dedicated gamer as Im sure it has many times. If you persevere through Connors childhood, you eventually get to realize the main hook of the game being a native American badass in the revolutionary timeframe, fighting against the worlds most formidable enemies, both to the American colonies and the Assassins.Considering the response to the mechanics they prototyped in this game, it really helped Ubisoft get some good ideas for how to make its next title, AC4, a vastly enjoyable seafaring title.
