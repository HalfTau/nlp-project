Worst of all the assassins creed games... You are litteraly useless in fights everyone els is much stronger than you, the game is poorly organized, to much spectacle from the story so it feels lite you are not playing the game you could rather just go to the movies. and there are alot of buggs.Played 37 of the game.I wish i never bought it and i rather crash the AC story beacuse i am never playing the game ever again.Waste of cash
