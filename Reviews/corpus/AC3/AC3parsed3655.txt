Whilst you may not become as attached to the young, arrogant but ultimately loveable Connor Kenway compared to the one and only Ezio Auditore, Assassins creed is in no way a step backwards for the series. A story that takes you across America, hacking and slashing anyone who stands in the way of your prize makes an incredibly rewarding 10 hours aprox. and is definitely a must play for anyone who has enjoyed the prior game. Youll quickly adapt to the new challenges, climbing trees, handling muskets and so on, but you will miss some of the older mechanics from Ezios and Altiars stories. I think the game developers wasted too much time on the prologue and if youre like me youll agree, if at some point through it you just want to play as Connor, I encourage you to continue playing, because after the first 2 chapters is where it gets awesome. 9/10, a thoroughly enjoyable play.
