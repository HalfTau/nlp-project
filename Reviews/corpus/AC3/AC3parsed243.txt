This game is not so good.The story is very good but the game play hmmmm when i started the game it had a bug where my camera was moving whenever i was running and by moving i mean a very sakefull moving.Some other times when i press alttab it was freezing.After a few days it magically fixed itshelf and i was able toplay this game.To sum up it is an excelent game but if there were no bugs it would be a lot better.PS the graphics in this game are amazing!
