Although Im not yet finished with this game, I can already tell that Im disappointed. Im not a huge Assassins Creed fanboy, but this game really dropped the ball after Revelations gets you so pumped for the next installment.The controls are much too spastic for a big budget title. Heres a fun game try to pick a musket up off of the ground. Even though theres a prompt in the HUD to pick up the musket, you still find yourself having to hold down the F key as if youre trying to smother it before the game will actually pick up the musket.Remember how fun it was to hop from building to building, assassinating guards on the rooftops in the previous games? Well, sucks to be you, because the guards for some reason have impossibly perfect eyesight in this game! You might as well have a giant red arrow pointing down at your easytospot head as you stumble from rooftop to rooftop because youll never get the drop on these guards! They see me before I see them regardless of the situation how is that possible? Im supposed to be the lifelong trained assassin here!Im barely into this game and its already stupidly difficult for no reason whatsoever. Id definitely pass on this one.
