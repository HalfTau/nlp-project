Garbage, horrible story,  controls, voice acting equal to that of a high school kids first attempt at making movie. Combat is , lead char is so out of place and does not even come close to fitting the role the game portrays him as.Then there is the usual garbageport that Ubisoft is so famous for.This game is more suited for downs syndrome patents as Im sure most Ubicraps employes suffer from.Save your money and support devs that give a crap about there product.
