Assassins Creed games are something I love personally but this game is my all time favorite. I love the American Revolution and having this game re live it for me was a blast. Some of the knowledge I have on the American Revolution is from this game is closely realisitc. I would recomend this game if you love the Assassins Creed franchise and its handling on history.
