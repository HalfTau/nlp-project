THE BUGS! This is the most glitchiest game Ive ever had pleasure or displeasure of playing. The storyline is fantastic and the open world is breathtaking, but the bugs really yank you out of the fantasy. Instead of taking down a British fort with stealth and precision, you have to deal with guards stuck in walls, soldiers with a sixth sense, and accidentally freerunning/climbing/jumping/falling all over the place. The character development is okay, but could still be better. The only reason anyone could LOVE this game would be because theyre diehard fans of the Assassins Creed series. Personally, Ive only played the first game and I thought it was extremely repetitive and boring. I said,Well, lets give one of the other games a try. And this is where Im at, not really wanting to play the game due to different reasons. So, lets review almost too buggy to play, beautiful scenery and dynamics, dissatached characters, interesting storyline and great periodical transitions, buggy freerunning, buggy NPCs, buggy world, BUGGY GAME. Thank you.
