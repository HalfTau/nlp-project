What can I say? Im not a big fan of AC games. I played 13 and stopped there.Nevertheless, I found Assassins Creed III to be a pleasant enjoyable experience.The game is set up in a cool historic setting, that isnt used often in games.America of 1754  1783, during the French and Indian and American Revolutionary Wars.The locations are detailed and has a nice atmosphere to them, especially the iconic towns like Boston, Philadelphia and New York. Theres also forests and natural terrain that offer unique gameplay and feel, in various weather conditions.Navigation and movement is enhanced by fluid and beautiful animations and freedom of movement  which isnt restricted to your classic cityparkour ACs iconic FreeRunning system works on trees here as well.The story is decent, especially the main relationship between the two main characters you and the villain.The gameplay is quite fun. If a bit too easy, unfortunately. You got a lot of weapons, tricks, slick moves and some equipment to mix it up nicely. You can  disarm and steal weapons and even fight handtohand in a satisfying way.Connor trades the elegant dancelike combat of AC2 with a much more brutal, wild and aggressive fightingstyle. That works really well. Animations are spectacular to watch and takedowns are entertaining to pull off.
