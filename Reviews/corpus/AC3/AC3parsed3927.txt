If its on sale, especially if it is bundled with the previous Assassins Creed games, its well worth it. Tons to do and a big world, but much of it feels empty and pointless. Very unpolished and full of bugs. Characters are forgetable and storyline is mediocre. PresentTime cutscenes with Desmond are annoying and boring. A dull end to a dull character in Desmond Miles. Regardless of my negative comments it is still fun enough for me to have put over 100 hours into it.
