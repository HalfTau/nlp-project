My first AC game, amazing and I love it! Even though I thought the AI are pretty dumb... When they see you, you walk in bush and they automatically act as if they didnt see anything . I am not a hardcore gamer by any means for single player game thus I am okay with stupid AImakes everything easier This game would score a 8/10 in my book, the world looks amazing though you are kinda just wasting time exploring themthere is no reason to do so If you still not have a go to game yet and just love exploring endlessly in games like this, get it!
