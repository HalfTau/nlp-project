Prettypoor.Compared to the excellent Assassins Creed 2 and AC Brotherhood this is a dull, buggy mess. The stealth system simply doesnt work and i clipped through the ground multiple times and fell to my death. The weirdest bug i found was when i was running to a mission waypoint and all of the city guards were either shooting at random civilians, standing still in a T position or walking in to walls.The plot is boring and the main character is as about as charismatic as a wet wooden stick.It does have nice graphics though and the naval missions are really fun but everything else feels like a waste of time.You could probably buy 20 sandwiches for the same amount of money it would cost you to buy this.Get Assassins Creed 2, Brotherhood or Black Flag instead of this.5/10.Why the hell did i play this junk for 22 hours?
