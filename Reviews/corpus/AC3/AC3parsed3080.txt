In my opinion a giant step back for the franchise. Dont get me wrong, the naval battles, the setting and the main twist in first chapters, that all is quite good. But the gameplay is unbalanced, buggy and the game looks kinda unfinished and hurried. Not mentioning the horrible ending.The game in overall is still kinda fun and a must for the franchise fans, but I was rather disappointed.
