In the beginning, it was okay. All I could say is that it could have been STRONGER, and FASTER. The game is really repetitive. If you know how repetitive Legend of ZeldaSkyward Sword is, then its pretty darn repetitive. The storyline lacks full detail, and I would agree that Ezios story in Assassins Creed II made more sense. Connors father, Haytham, was an Assassin one time, but somehow was cursed by a Templar Ring??!?!!? Its confusing. So now, Connor is an Assassin by blood, not by reason. He has no elaborate feelings, either. There are some missions in the main storyline I cannot finish, so I just have my free time. In my free time, I finished nearly ALL of the missions in Homestead, nearly ALL of the missions for Assassins Guild I think that is what its called, capturing forts, etc, etc. Its getting boring. Sheesh.
