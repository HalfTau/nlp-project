The game itself is pretty good.Gameplay is nice and exciting.But the games optimization is horrible.The game crashes and for example you cantt turn off AA or put down the settings lower than medium this affects lowend PC gamers very much.The game is also made by Ubisoft so it requires Uplay of course.And it might delete your saved game.
