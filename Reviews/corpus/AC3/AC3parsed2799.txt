New elements introduced e.g hunting, naval missions are cool, but failed to overwhelm the dull gameplay. Its just boring, unlike the previous AC games....how the silent bow was advertised as silent and that when you shoot someone with it silently they will die silently, but in reality it alerts every enemy in a ten mile radius and initiates world war three.
