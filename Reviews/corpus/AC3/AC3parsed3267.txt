Please. Get. Rid. Of. Uplay.Ive played for dozens of hours already, but for some inexplicable reason I cant log into Uplay anymore and the account seems to have lost synchronisation of my Steam purchase. Buyer beware! As a result, I do not recommend buying this game.As for the game, its good. Its bigger and its better. Even when the combat is still a bit weak and too easy for more experienced gamers. It has also become rather weak when it comes to stealth play. Do not expect a Thief or Sniper Elite III  level of stealth gameplay here, its not really there.
