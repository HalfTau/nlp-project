I hate this game, and i went through the whole 16 hours just to beat this game, to tell you how bad it is. The story boring, the combat is fun yet repetetive, and also all the upgrades, almanac pages, treasure chest, and other content are so useless that i never even took the time to actually do anything other than just play through the story. I mean Conners dad looks and sounds more indian than Conner himself! If youre a fan of Assassins Creed, then you should buy this game when its on sale, but i totally recommened that you ignore this game.Also it has Uplay, so pirate it if you dont want to install it.
