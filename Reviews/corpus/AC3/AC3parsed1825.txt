Let me first preface this game with  This is the first Assassins Creed game I have ever played, ever. Except messing about in Brotherhood... or 2... I dont remember, at some friends house years ago.Ive played this game for about 9 hours... So I think I have had enough time to say something about it...Please, let your wallets avoid this game with all cost.The plot of this is absolutely atrocious. The gameplay is the most boring thing about it. All you do is press the middle mouse button once or twice in a couple of places, and watch redcoats die.Also, theres freerunning, I guess. Sometimes you hold a button and the guy on the screen jumps to places. it isnt even fun or engaging like in Mirrors Edge, you just watch them. Thats it, then you stop to kill some redcoats. There was a point in this game that I stopped giving a damn about the story entirely and just killed redcoats. Even that, the most fun part of the game, killing people, is resctrictive. In the hour I played of Brotherhood or 2, I remember just going around and killing civilians, that was fun! But in Assassins Creed 3, you cant kill anyone on the ground except for the people in the stupid Red Coat.This game is a failure. It has no redeeming factors in it, and should not be bought under any circumstance. Go buy Black Flag. I heard that one is great!
