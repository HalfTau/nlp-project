Good graphics, gameplay, and story line. Side quests with the plantation are kinda unnecessary and crafting is weird. Voice acting for Connor is very weak and uninspired but it doesnt retract from the game that much. REMEMBER CONNOR ISNT EZIO AUDITORE! So dont hold him to that impossibletotop standard
