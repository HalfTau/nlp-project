Contrary to the gaming lemmings opinion  This is the best Assassins Creed.Ubi pulled out all of the stops for this one, in contrast to the newer ones. Newer entries are just cookie cutter, assembly line, diluted versions, that have been getting more ridiculous with each incarnation.It has far more nuanced story and characters.It has decent combat that controls well, a multitude of settings, a multitude of game mechanics that arent immersion breaking or ludicrous  great graphics.Overall its just the most fleshed out AC and doesnt feel as linear, or consolised as the newer ones.
