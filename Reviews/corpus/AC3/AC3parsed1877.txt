Funny enough, the reason I got into the Assassins Creed franchise was because I wanted a new Wii U game and that sounds absurd. This was the first AC game I played and I get quite emotional about the ending. Because I enjoy hurting my wallet, I bought it on steam here on sale, months after completing my Wii U copy.are a lot better on PC and everything looks so nice and immersive. Unfortunately, unless you have a middleground or better computer, it wont run very smoothly and chunk a bit and all the lipsyncs for cutscenes will mess up. But hey itll still run. That being said, my 1000 laptop runs it perfectly unlike my 250 desktop.this is a fantastic game. I wont spoil anything though. Ive always been exceptionally interested in Revolutionary America and this satisfies my thirst for colonial action.In the end this is one offew games Id give.
