Like pretty much all Ubisoft Montral games, it has more bugs than the Vietnamese jungle.I cant remember how many times I had to restart a mission because of bugs, sometimes you get ennemies stuck in various environment items sometimes its you that is stuck somewhere. There are all sorts of other bugs, like in one place if you jump you go ballistic and crash back down to earth and die. Very frustrating !!! Also at some point in the game the red coats, or lobster backs British soldier in the game started to sound like womens when I was killing them disturbing And yea ! You need UPlay to play... UPlay software, UPlay account, Uplay this, UPlay that. And Im sure they are keeping track of all these bugs And the way you play And how many times you take pauses What you eat and drink Im joking Mostly.But the game is not all that bad I thought It was very entertaining, lots of side quests, nice graphics when its all maxed out. The cities are cool and open there is just not enough buildings you can enter and hide in. Naval missions could have been a wee bit better. And the A.I. is far from being the sharpest tool in the shed at times. all in all its a 6 out of 10 add UPlay and it falls to 5. So for me its a 50/50 choice
