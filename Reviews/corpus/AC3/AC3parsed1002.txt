Assassins Creed III is a brilliant game. Despite a few minor bugs placed throughout, I experienced a wellmade game that works beautifully on the PlayStation 3 system. While I cannot say the same for it running on PC I was forced to make a refund due to a terrible framerate on a lowerspec computer I can easily say that this is a game worth playing.  The main protagonists are well developed with deep character exploation, and the accompanying tiein novel Forsaken by Oliver Bowden is worth picking up for more background. I dearly love the characters and the environment, and the combat system is gritty and brutal. If you have the PC that matches its requirements or higher, it will be worth buying during a sale. Otherwise, get a copy for your Xbox or PS3 and enjoy this meticulouslydetailed story of trajedy, heartbreak, and sheer human will.
