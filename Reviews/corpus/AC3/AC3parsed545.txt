It started off well enough, then the controls gradually got more broken, the story became tedious and by Sequence 10 of 12, I gave up. I pushed through because I liked Desmonds story only in this particular installment of AC. I like the setting, but the controls at times, getting stuck on ledges mid chase, or horses spinning in circles when you are racing against the clock... so much frustration.Graphics 8/10Gameplay 5/10Story 6/10Overall, play it if you want to finish Desmonds story... or, just watch it on Youtube and skip to Blackflag, or backtrack to Ezios games.
