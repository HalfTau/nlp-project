Pros Good Story, Much better writing than Brotherhood and Revolations.  Much better combat then a lot of the games in the series. Great Ship to Ship sea battles and nearly perfect modern mission sections. You are finally given some good answers.Cons Terrible map design, over crowding A.I.s making escaping near impossible. Mission and design logic is deeply flawed leading to some very irratating and facepalm worthy moments.  A.I. behavior switches from irratatingly stupid to that of beyond human reason. examples Friendly A.I. killing a target that must be kept alive for mission to succeed. To soldiers instantly identifing you from 100 feet away. Lots of polish work left undone, bugs and glitches, nothing game breaking just irratating.Side Note I didnt try Multiplayer because I dont like AC Multiplayer in general.Rank 3 out of 5 Stars.Person opinion This is a game for fans of the series and if you can overlook its obvious issues there is a good story to be had, I would recomend the pc version as a cheaper alternative for those interested. Its in between the first game and brotherhood as far as im concerned. If you think their is any chance youll like it its not bad for the pc price.
