yea sure you may think what are you doing i love the ac series well i love them as well but this game was horable they dumbdown the combat so much compared to all the other ac games before the story has nothing to do with the first ac games and the charactor you play as is so whiny i cant belive it. the side missions for this games are repulsive Go get soap for me Go deliver the mail to so and so those kind of side missions. i rate this game 3/10
