Terrible game. No stealth system in place. The only thing close is you might grab a wall or something. Half way through the story Im thinking that the Assassins are evil, because the story is written so poorly. The enemys hold guns like idiots, and the train in the brazil level looks worse that the one in HalfLife... yes the first one. Thank god it was in the steam sale for like dirt cheap, I cant imagine preordering this 3/10
