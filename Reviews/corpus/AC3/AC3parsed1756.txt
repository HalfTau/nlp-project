A good game overall but the first part of the game is very boring and tedious. The game only gets fun when assume the role of the main protagnist. I would definately advise you to get it, if you can push through 12 hours of tedious gameplay at the start. The graphics are great, it runs well and the gameplay is fun, especially with the new environments.
