ACIII is a natural progression of the story from the previous games its fun to play, its well crafted, with amazing investment in sound and image, great playability. It doesnt have the simplicity of Brotherhood, but it definitely goes a long way in that direction.I liked the Homestead building missions, as well as the main storyline. The game was fun to play, although the great surprise from chapter III is... well... surprising. I loved it, and actually finished it twice.I didnt really like the DLC with king Washington  there was something that felt awkward, and I tried to play it but abandoned it fast. Also, sadly, the game is buggy at times. But no bug of great importance will affect the pleasure of playing it.
