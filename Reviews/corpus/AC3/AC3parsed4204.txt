This game was a slog to complete.  The protagonist was unlikeable, the setting was uninteresting to explore, and the gameplay was a step back from Ezios trilogy.  In my opinion, this is the worst of the Assassins Creed series, simply because it wasnt very fun to play.  On the other hand, it had a lot and I mean a LOT of hilarious glitches, from the main character shooting 200 feet into the air for no reason, to incredibly violent washer women, you can never quite know what is going to go catastrophically wrong next.
