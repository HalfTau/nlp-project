Fantastic game, very underrated. There are some systems and mechanics that are better fleshed out in AC4 Black Flag, but I really like the character of Conner. If you are a fan of the series youll probably like this game, and make sure to grab the DLC, it is also quite good and explores an alternate reality where George Washington has gone mad with power!
