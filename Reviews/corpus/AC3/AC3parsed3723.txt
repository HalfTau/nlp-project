F Just for having to use a seperate account to login, first time around creating the UPlay account, I use my CD key then my account disappeared and now I cant even play the game, waste of money in my opinion, just buy it on console so you dont have to have a stupid UPlay account. Makes like a thousand times easier. Definitely would not recommend to a friend, family member, not even someone I hate and would love to see waste money.
