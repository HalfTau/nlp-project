Gamebreaking glitches that cause you to constantly reload a checkpoint, terrible voice acting except for Haytham, and controls that have somehow taken several massive steps back since ACII. I remember when Ezio could, for the most part, do the things you actually wanted him to. In ACIII, youll be lucky if you dont accidentally climb up the same tree half a dozen times while in the middle of another scripted foot chase.Do yourself a favour and avoid it, the storys not even worth the trouble.
