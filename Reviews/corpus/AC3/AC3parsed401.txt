The story in AC III had me hooked all up until about Sequence 11. The end just felt a bit rushed, scriptwise. Any optional missions are pretty boring  mundane. Ive noticed that Ubisoft has aimed for an average of 24 hoursworth of content for each Assassins Creed installment. If they had cut out some of the pointless hunting, courier, and tailing missions, they could have focused on making the end a lot better in my opinion. Once I completed the story I had no desire to complete any other parts of the game.Although the climbing/freerunning was made a lot simpler, it still felt harder to get around sometimes especially compared to AC Revelations. Its also hard to change your outfit, which is disappointing to me.The best part of this game was the combat overhaul. The faster pace and brutal takedowns were VERY entertaining for the first few hours of gameplay, but it got repetitive as there were only 3 or 4 types of enemies and they had very predictable movesets.The other best part was the ship battles. Those were always fun.
