I wish I knew this game was fun but nope. The Stupid Uplay service Ubisoft forces on you has made it impossible to play for the last week or so Ive owned the game. It makes you connect and install Uplay during irst time set up then says you MUST connect online. Uplay has been saying it cat connect to the internet dispite resetting steam, my connection and computer. Literally the only thing on my computer that cant connect to the internet. Good thing I got this on sale.....
