Good map, wildlife, forests, cities. Nature scenes.Good characters lee, haytham, allDifferent and attractive story.As almost every ubisoft game, very short story compared to huge map. Ends faster than expected. You can play only story and not even do any side missions or exploration, or recruit assasins. Game never stimulates player to do these.Few musics, Same musics almost every mission, Bad for atmosphere.
