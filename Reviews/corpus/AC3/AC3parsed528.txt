While the title tries to connect real figures in the history like the previous title,the attachment to the characters are no more.The alt. history does not feel vivid.I was very impressed how they altered history of Medici into the Assassins Creed universe.It was a moviequality scenario.Though, third title has failed to extend its great value of storytelling.Aside from the narration,the flow of movement is not as smooth as previous titles.The tree branches cannot let players to walk across a whole forest.It will be stopped no matter which branch choose to run.Battle mechanic is not bad, but was heavily misadvertised.From various trailers, protagonist was running across the battlefield and fight against brits,but nope.There is a mission where you are at the battlefield, but if you tried to go to the actual ongoing battle area, you will instantly die.The war with brit mission seemed rushed.There are some good moments, but the overall poor design does not live upto the previous truemaster piece.The franchise died after the second title.
