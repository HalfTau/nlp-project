Very fun game. I really enjoyed Ezios story from the previous games and was nervous how this would turn out. I have to say I really enjoyed it. I felt the story was good in both the past and present day storylines probably the last Assassins Creed game with a good story I fear after playing IV. There was more exploration and the expansion packs bring really cool new abilities.
