This installment of Assassins Creed brings you in the colonial times of America, 18th century. Your protagonist ist Conner, an American native who got his assasins calling and started training with Achilles Davenport, a retired Assassin.The game leads you past historical events of the time and feels about the same as the other installments. Not so many roofs as in Venice but new to the game is tree climbing and running along the branches from tree to tree.As for base building you have to finish cetain quests for people who later join you at your home base who then can provide services for you. It is not a game breaker if you dont, for me the game was finished before getting all the henchmen.The missions were a bit repetive and not really difficult. Some main area forts have to be taken in but I used brute force instead of stealth which works very well, although it is not very assassin like.What I particularly enjoyed were the ship missions. Ubisoft really put some effort here. The ships were easy to stear and the sea combat did not feal clumsy. I can see this was probably part because the same technology would later be used in Assassinss Creed Black Flag.Was the game epic? No. I preferred Brotherhood because of the better personality development and recognizable scenery. I would give it a 7/10.
