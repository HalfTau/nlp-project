So Im playing this game, its everything to be expected from playing previous assassins creed games.  I can take on like 15 muskeeters and get shot by all of them and then sword them all to pieces only taking damage when they shoot occasionally cuz its hella easy to block in this game.Its moderately fun.   Im still probably going to finish the game through, but I have to say its already crashed once.Often times on stealth missions enemies just magically appear.  Like just recently I snuck up on two guards, I thought EZ double stealth kill right? wrong. there was a 3rd person magically inside one of the other characters.   Another time I snuck up on a target, ez kill right? wrong.  There were 2 invisible guys that appeared only after I knifed him.tldr glitches  crashes and hella easy gameplayAlso UPLAY SUCKS this game makes u use uplay and no steam achievements.EDIT after playing the game a lot more HOLY CRAP this game is HUGE and has an incredible amount of stuff you can do.  It almost feels not like assassins creed anymore, but its still pretty fun.Im stillabout uplay and the few glitches here and there but so far there was only 1 crash with the game and with all the autosaves no data was lost.  Im switching this from no recommend to yes recommend  its pretty sweet.Double editThis game randomly crashed when I was about 50 complete and most of the way through the storythe save file is having issues.  I cant use my pc backup or the cloud sync idk wtf is wrong with it but this is a game breaking bug, dont recommend you cant finish the story.
