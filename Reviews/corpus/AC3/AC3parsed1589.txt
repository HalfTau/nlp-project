The story in this game is actually pretty good, only thing that ruins it is the rythm of it and how its told. Some of the charachters are really obvious or just badly designed. Otherwise the game is really fun. Parkour feels really fluid and it is not often that it takes me somewhere else than I meant to. And the tree climbing is excellent.Youre not really getting anything new but it is a really fun game. 7/10
