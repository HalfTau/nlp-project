This is the only Assassins Creed game I really dislike and in which, had different devs from its predecessor, that did not understand the story and just ended up on rushing it.Bear in mind, Im an enthusiast of the series and I kept being told of how bad it was over time. I actually decided to see it for myself.I played this game up to its finish and I have to say that, it was mildly gripping, but after a short while, its a succession of boring content.Missions tended to be always the same, leading up to little to no variation and some just long and not interesting.Big overldoad in sidequests. WAY too much. Recruitment of assassins is confusing.As for the main character itself, the prologue was interesting, but as for beyond that, he just pretty much follows orders. Where are the feelings?Combat is weirdly designed and is a bit clunky, ending up in some cases as trying to do one thing and ending up in another, as in trying to counter kill when he actually ended up counter throwing someone.Only thing that can be pointed out as at least average in this game is ship sailing and multiplayer.My thoughts on the game is, if you really really really reallywant to see by your hand how it unfolds, buy it under a discount.
