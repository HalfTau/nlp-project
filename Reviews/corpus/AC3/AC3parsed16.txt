Although AC III is not the best AC game made, it is still a decent game with some good improvements in the gameplay such as the fast travel option, the hunting, and the naval missions to name a few. There are definitely some flaws, and the main character might seem a bit dull and stiff after three games with Ezio. However, all things considered, AC III is still a decent game that I spend many hours on, enjoying the story or just exploring the frontier. If you played and liked the other AC games, Id recommend giving it a try, but if youre new to the franchise, maybe start with a classic like AC II.
