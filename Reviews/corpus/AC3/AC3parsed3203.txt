game the only reason why i got this game was because it was 10 on sale and i have to say it is one of the most boring games i have ever played, the textures, resolution and graphics are  and looks likeon your screen not only that it is poorly optimized for PC cause it has constant lag. Also i dont give a  about the backstory of the game i just want to get into the assinating parts first the fun bits but nooo of course not have to go through the ing introduction first. I should not be getting terrible fps with a gtx 770 2gb, i5 4670 and 16gb of fast ddr3 ram, i also do not understand why i need to go through steam and then ubisoft to play this game.
