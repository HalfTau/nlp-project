Hmmm....mixed emotions on this one. Definitely worth playing for AC fans, but the game has a real slow start and an almost rushed ending. Optional objectives optional though they are actually take away from missions rather than enhancing them and the plethora of side quests really feel like open world busy work that arent rewarding and arent worth your trouble. All that said, the new assassin is more savage than ever and grusome kills are still very satisfying. Overall I enjoyed the game but couldnt help but think what if? as I played. Its a good game, but it could have been so much more. Merica!
