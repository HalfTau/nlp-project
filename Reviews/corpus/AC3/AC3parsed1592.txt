Pros  Great rich story Graphics Controls over your assassin feel more fluent and easy Combat seems more smooth and less awkward compared to some animations in previous ACs Hunting mechanic SettingCons  Controls over your assassin although feel better are kind of broken Tail/Follow Missions are ing annoying  my opinion  Ragdolls are broken af Lockpicking is pretty damn unnecessaryThe game is great definetly worth the 20 dollars that it costsit has its flaws but its still a very smooth easy to run game.
