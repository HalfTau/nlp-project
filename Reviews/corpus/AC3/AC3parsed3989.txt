Freerunning through the trees is something you could do for hours without any objectives.  Its just fun.  Adding rope darts that let you hang redcoats and bandits from branches, thats just an added bonus.  The introduction of sailing and naval combat, also a big winner in my book.  For everything Im about to say about the plot, the takeaway is that the game is fun and absolutely worth picking up.The overall story isnt as strong as it could have been ignoring the weak conclusion of the weak Desmond solar flare overplot.  I would have liked to have seen more Ben Franklin quotes for one.  They also never got me on board with why the main character would trust any of these people.I would have also liked to have seen more exposure of the hypocracy of some of the other founding fathers, that while all men are created equal, only land owning white men could vote and women were considered mentally inferior.  I was especially disapointed in their coverage of Washington.  Yes, they address how he was not nearly as competent a general as he is remembered, stoping short of portraying him as a coward.  They also hint at his involvement in slaughtering natives when he was a British officer prior to the Revolution.  But they gloss over how petty he was, and while the Fugitive Slave Act came after the Revolution, it would have been nice of them to made reference to his involvement in it during the overplot.  Thomas Jefferson is just barely brought in as a young man during the Tyranny DLC.  Even if theyd wanted, there wasnt enough time to get into all his personal issues.
