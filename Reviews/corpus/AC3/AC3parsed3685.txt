The conclusive saga in the dramatic life of Desmond Miles. This title for me at least signifies the end of the ac franchise. A beautiful entry in the entire series it reinvents the whole genre with its quality enviroments, epic storyline and fantastic gameplay. After having spend roughly 30 hours in this game, i can say by far that it has everything u will ever ask. Side missions are there by the hundernds, the fighting system has become harder and more fluent than it ever was, the economic system is much more difficult to handle if u want to get a lot of money and buy everything in this game, but the most awesome experience by far is the addition of hunting and vaval battles. To sum up ac3 has everything  u will ever want in an open sandox game. Its a rich tale that u will never want to end and u will see and experience first hand what it means to be a man of the new world. Only downsize is there are still too many bugs in the pc version. Other than that if u are a fan of the series this is one game u dont want to miss. Rest of u try it and u will remember my words. This game is worth your money.
