Hated this game in 768p, LOVED it in 1080p Ultrawide. Beautiful settings and character textures, smooth fighting but less equipped than AC II  Revelations, quite easy combo and fast executions. Kind of Arcade AC, where you literally can fight the whole town. Intriguing characters and first look at Templars upclose, the one idea that spawned Rogue, and started to split fans into Templars or Assassin.Anyway, back in the days they say this game sucks balls, but i suggest everyone to play it again in higher resolutions and settings, in full 1080 to 4k, looks more realistic than AC IV and sharper than Unity imho/cmiiw.
