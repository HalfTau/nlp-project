By far my favorite AC over its predecessors. The naval combat convinced me to buy black flag. I can see why they made a game around that aspect of AC3. Nothing like lining up a shot with a massive ship and have a dozen cannons sound through your speakers when you release the trigger.Although, nothing overly annoying, there are quite a few bugs in the game.10/10 would hand achilles his painting again after he dies the mission before.
