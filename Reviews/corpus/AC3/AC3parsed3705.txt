Gave it thumbs down before because Uplay crash issues trying to start the game, it requires Uplay which crashes, but there was an easy fix for that   Uplay should be installed in the same drive as AC3 itself at least this solution worked for me. Love the AC series and this game is no exception. Just a bit mad because of the pointless hustle with Uplay.
