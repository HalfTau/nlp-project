AC3 is a pretty solid game. I had enjoyed watching the Assassins creed storyline before and decided to buy into the AC franchise at AC3 which, many of my friends said was a bad idea and AC3 got badmouthed by most of them and internet reviews as one of the lesser of all the AC games. I bought the game on sale anyway and throughly enjoyed every second of the game.Granted, theres a few glitches that I experienced and the character of Connor couldve been better fleshed out and made in a way that the player could connect to but otherwise the story and gameplay is worth it. I would definitely recommend buying it, particularly if its on sale as when I got it.9/10 Would singlehandedly win the American Revolution again.
