AC3 in my opinion is where Assassin Creed started to go down hill and every game since AC3 for diehard AC fans like myself has just been a prayer that the next game will go back to its former glory. It might be the fact that I loved Ezio and Altair so much or maybe the game just lost its simple touch that so many of us loved. I do not recommend this game for people who enjoyed the first few games and are expecting this to be similar. However, I do try to make my reviews unbiased so I will base the rest of the review on the game on its own, out of context of the previous games. So this game does have a nice open world environment with seasons changing along the story line to create a real sense of the world revolving. For the students of history, AC3 has definitely put a twist on the players of the colonial period of America. I do admit that I love scaling the rooftops of colonial New York and the vast forests you can explore. Upgrading your Homestead is also a nice feature. Watching your small plot of land grow into a thriving village. Gameplay there are many differences in terms of weapons and the lack of armour sets, which was quite disappointing, although you can change outfits, they are nothing special. The selection of weapons were not really my cup of tea so to speak and I ended up mainly using the hidden blade.Overall, the game was a major disappointment and in all honesty the franchise hasnt improved much over the years.4/10
