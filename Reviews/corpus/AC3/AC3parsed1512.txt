This series was cool back when the story actually made a little bit of sense. The series original idea of incorporating real people from history was uniquely enjoyable but now theyve started making games about main characters being about Chief Crazy Horse A3 Main Character, and Jack Sparrow Whatever Assassins Creed was released with the pirate dude and with all these other obscures and Naw. Im talking about that entire mind  situation that made Desmond kill Lucy and Thathad me lost. Im not about where this series is going.
