It was fun to play in the Civil War era, but thats pretty much all this game had going for it. It got old pretty fast, mostly due to the main assassin Connor. He was such a dull character. I honestly only finished it because I was interested in Desmonds story. I bought this on sale for cheap and it was about worth that.
