Okay Ubisoft, you bunch of geniuses. So the story here is I boot up the game, a Uplay launcher pops up and ask for a signup/login thing. I was like, One of these. eh. Fine then and create an account. Guess what happens. The launcher crashes. And every time that Ive started it since. WHY is there a launcher that requires a password, and does this game even have online stuff to justify having one?Also , HOW do you even fck that up?I bought FF7 on Steam a while ago, cuz why not. That thing is even more haphazardly thrown together and requires a password and serves no purpose, but guess what, it doesnt friggin crash when I try to use it.I spammed that thing until I got enough gametime to write this to just let the salt out.
