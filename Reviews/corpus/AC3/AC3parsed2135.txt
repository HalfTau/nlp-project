StoryThere is one interesting plot twist, but most of the time its actually quite boring compared to the previous titles...The desmond  part of the story is a disappointment.GameplayShips! The seafights are a really entertaining addition to the franchise. The normal AC missions are unfortunately rather boring.Nevertheless it consumed many hours of my free time although not always because I enjoyed it but more because of my urge to complete as much as possible.Story DLCsWell they add a cool alternative universe with special abilities which add some diversity to the AC mechanics but it was really disappointing to see that in the first part of the Story DLC the game was so bugged that in one mission the last one? an event to progress during the mission would never trigger, so my savegame was stuck forever, no matter how often i replayed the mission. I finally had to watch the rest on Youtube... Because of that I dropped the game after some timeIf its on sale for a fair price you might get it but dont pay the full price for it.
