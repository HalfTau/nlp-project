As a big fan of AC franchise i can say that this game is one of the better ones in the series. The story was amazing, soundtrack is great and so are the game locations. American frontier, New York and Boston are all very well made and look beautiful. The game will keep you busy for 4050 hours if you collect all the feathers, almanac pages and do the side missions. It is a massive improvment over ac revelations which was not that good. For the first time in an AC game you can hunt wild animals and command a ship. The combat system feels really nice and satisfying. If you are looking for a great AC game you just have to check this one and Black Flag first. You will need uplay for this but i never had any problems with uplay so i cant really complain. This game is a must for any AC fan.The flaws i want to mention are pretty dead multiplayer and really bad dlc tyranny of George Washington.
