AC 3 is one of the better games in the series, maybe because it walks away from the Italian setting for a breeze of fresh air. The setting and story is compelling, and coupled with the Tyranny of George Washington DLC brings it all to a very nice rounded end. Musical score in this one also adds much to the atmosphere.Have to note that in grand digusting Ubisoft style, Episode 1 of the DLC has a game halting bug that hasnt been fixed since its release several years ago. There are long winded fixes to the bug that requires a restart of the DLC. However if you do encounter the bug I would suggest just watching a Youtube playthrough of the last small piece of episode 1 where the bug is, then just start episode 2 and continue.Dont let it stop you though, as its a fine story!
