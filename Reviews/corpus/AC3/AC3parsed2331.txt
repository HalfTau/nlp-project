Assassins Creed has always filled me with joy as a gamer as it ticks every check box i have, ive played assassins creed from the very begining and it has got better and better throughout. Assassins Creed III Has lived up to my expectations and gone a little bit ahead, some of the new ideas and items in the game can be confusing at first and you have to bare wit it to get the hang of it but once you have it is an amazing game and with the graphics aswell the game is perfect and it stands out from its prior assassins creed games and has a very big twist near the start and shows the game in another light
