Overall a decent game. It has all the Assassins Creed elements which makes the game good, but the game feels very limited. The great economical and assassin systems from the last three games are pretty much removed. The village is quiet uselessand so are the assassins. The maps are really big, which forces you to travel by horse, not nearly as fun as running over rooftops.But then again, the storyline and combat are great as can be expected from an assassins creed game. Its the worst game of a great series, which makes the game decent.
