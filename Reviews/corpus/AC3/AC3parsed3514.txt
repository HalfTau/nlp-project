Stay away, do not buy.this is by far the worst of games in the Assassins Creed seriesbeautiful graphics, and new futile mechanics, just doest add up enough against the indredible lackluster storyline, unrewarding most tedious grind of any AC gamebad port, with iffy controls even if pluggin in a controller, 2 years after release still encountering huge bugs that just frustrates and makes you pull out your hair when going for full completionthis is not worth more than 5 bucks tops, and then be prepared to get frustrated countless of times, and leaving you unfulfilled in the end
