Assassins Creed III rekindled my love for the series. The new setting and characters were a great welcome for me, and the story was well told through some great writing and voice acting. There are some complications here and there that can bog the player down, but for the most part, the amount of content you get in this game is a steal for the price. I played it on Xbox and PS but the PC version is by far the best way to go if you have the rig for it, and the options for the PC players are satisfying.
