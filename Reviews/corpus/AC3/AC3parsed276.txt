Uning believable. Of all the broken games that Ubisoft Never fixes they decide to patch this game almost 6 years post launch and totally destroy all our save files....you cant make thisup. What a ing joke....I mean how do you  up that badly on a stupid ing 3gig language patch. I mean this game already has  optimization and tech issues but god damn....god damn. Ubisoft you are just as bad as EA in my eyes at this point.  you.
