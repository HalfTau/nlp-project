I would say this was an absolutely great story, it just felt a little too shortonly main missions. Truly loved the game though. If you go through all the side mission, you will enjoy it way more. Wish the game was a little longer, I loved the character, maybe cuz it was my first Complete AC game. Defenitely suggest you to buy, gonna be worth it.
