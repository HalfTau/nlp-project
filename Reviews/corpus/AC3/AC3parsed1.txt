Extremely underrated Assassins Creed game, the story is very well written with very fun missions, and it is also fun to play as Connor Kenway, because he is more immature than the previous two assassins, Ezio Auditore and Altar IbnLaAhad, creating a more unique playthrough. After finishing the long story which is great there are many missions to do to expand your village just like low budget story missions that are pretty fun, along with the collection of items, and hunting too, this game is great. 10/10
