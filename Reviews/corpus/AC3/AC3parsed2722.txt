In a series like Assassins Creed, where the publisher has spammed the market with endless sequels and spinoffs, you really want to stick with the good ones unless youre a hardcore fan. Assassins Creed 3 is NOT one of the good ones.The game suffers immediately from a truly endless tutorial/introduction phase. It takes literally 5 or more hours before the game opens up and becomes its normal self. Most of that 5 hours is long talking scenes and repetitive training if you have played any AC game that came before. Its truly grueling and makes you hate the game right away. Once this is over with youll find the standard Assassins Creed gameplay but not quite as refined as normal. It feels like a between step where theyre trying to advance the series but dont know how yet.The simple fact is Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag takes most ideas AC3 has and makes them more enjoyable, without the 5 hour tutorial and with much more freedom and fun. Unless youre a total Assassins Creed diehard youd be better off skipping from Brotherhood or even AC2 straight to Black Flag.
