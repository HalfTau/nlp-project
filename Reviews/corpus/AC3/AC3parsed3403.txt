this game is, in my opinion, really good because it teaches you about the history of america and the revolutionary and civil war things like that. it has a significant difference from the first 5, i think, games because theres alot more features like domestic animals and more weapons like guns but you can actually keep them. one complaint though, i think that there should have been the hookblade from revelations in it because i liked it alot.all in my opinion
