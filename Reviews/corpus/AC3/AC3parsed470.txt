In the beginning the game runs fine. But a little further in when getting to Boston the fps drops to 2025 and stays like that no matter what the graphic settings are and there seems to be no easy fix for it. It isnt like this on all PCs but just be careful. It is still a good game apart from this problem. Im still giving it a thumbs up because it isnt terrible.
