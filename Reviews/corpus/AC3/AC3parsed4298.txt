This is not a bad game and you may even enjoy it if youve never played AC before but to me this is the worst of the series. Biggest problem I have with this game is the story. While Desmond side of the story was quite interesting, everything else was boring. Repetitive missions, stupid stealth system, really weak villians and did I mention the boring story? My suggestion Avoid it until its heavily discounted.
