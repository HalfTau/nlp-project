This is the type of game where you either love it or you hate it. While it does have a very slow start, once the story picks up, you will be on the edge of your seat for the entire time. The controls are a bit different from the previous games, but they are a bit easier to use here. Overall, I rather enjoyd most of the time I spent getting 100 sync
