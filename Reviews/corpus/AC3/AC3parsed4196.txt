No no no no. Do not play. This is a terrible game. I love the other Assassins Creed games, but this is a bad one.Lots of people dont like the tutorial, but I didnt mind it. However, the game becomes significantly worse after that. There are almost no fun missions in this game. Theyre like the ones in the previous AC games, but they are all bad instead. Also, you play as a and everyone around you is kind of aas well, if they even have a personality. Oh yeah, and then the Desmond stuff is the biggest anticlimax of all time.Havent played 4 yet, but I hope its better.
