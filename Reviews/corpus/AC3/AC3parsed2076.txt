A solid game with an interesting time period and story. The story itself is great, developing more on the ideology of the Templar Order than previous games. The American Revolution was also the ideal event for the rebirth of the Assassin Order. The game delivers one of the most engaging stories of its genre.The gameplay was really good the combat became more realistic and entertaining with various weapons to play with, combining ranged with melee. It also added features like the ability to climb not only buildings but cliffs and trees, and also command a ship through fantastic naval battles.The graphics are amazing to look at, from the american landscapes to its cities. But are some of the most unstable Ive ever seen in a PC game. The game itself is unstable, crashing randomly and delivering an unstable framerate regardless of your hardware and with some tricky bugs like corrupt save files and bad synchronization. Should these problems like graphical optimization be addressed, this would probably be one of my favorite games and we as consumers shouldnt be the ones fixing the game after paying for it.However, if you somehow dont experience these issues or manage to correct them yourself like me, the game should deliver you with an amazing experience. The characters are very well written, it really is movie material as well as its music.I really do recommend this game, but should only be bought on sale due to its poor optimization.
