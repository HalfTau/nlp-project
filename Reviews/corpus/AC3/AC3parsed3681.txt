As a fan of the AC series, this game is a huge let down. I now have 7 hours game time and dont feel immersed yet. In other games, the introduction/learning the ropes section lasts only a very short time, but in this game it never ends! 6 hours in and im being taught how to use tunnels, despite using them for the last 6 hours anyway? 7 hours in and still not in assassins robes? still running around completing boring repetitive missions to open up more features of the game?! come on guys, sort it out!
