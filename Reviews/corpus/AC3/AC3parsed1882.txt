when i first got the game it worked perfectly, then when i turned off the game too quickly, it caused me to lagg incredible meaning tha running and combat was unbearable to play, i untinstaled and re installed the game and it did nothing to that save, i started a new save and it worked fine but after a while and not from the same error as lst time, it lagged. my advice, just get it on console
