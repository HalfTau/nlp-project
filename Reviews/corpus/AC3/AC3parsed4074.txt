I really wish I could recommend this. The game starts out so promising and looks really nice and plays as well as ever. However, my biggest complaint is not the gameplay or storyline, which I actually enjoyed. It is the optimisation. Oh and UPlay. I bought the game here on steam, but every time I want to jump in, it begins to load up UPlay and updating that for some reason. If I launch it from UPlay it starts to launch steam. So basically I am having to wait around a few minutes every time I want to play the game. The biggest complaint however is actually the optimization. The game lags on a lot of high end PCs. I dont know why but it does. Even on the lowest settings not that they give you much choice here. I struggle to even get 30FPS out of it, when even more graphically intense games on ultra settings would run at 50FPS at least!And lastly, I left the game for a few weeks and when I came back to it I realized I had no idea where I was or where to go and I had no clear indication on my start screen.
