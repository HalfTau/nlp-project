This is the point at which I decided to stop playing Assassins Creed. I played some of Black Flag after, because it was supposedly different. It was, but I didnt finish it, I dont know if Ill get back to it.I finished ACIII because I wanted to know the ending of the meta story around Desmond, I seem to be in the minority who cared. But these games feel like a chore now. I was really looking forward to the ending in the second half of my playtime. Also, I cant believe there are still instafailurewhenspotted type missions. These can be frustrating. Ubisoft really needs to stop making their games about extinguishing icons on your map. You try so hard to ignore that collectible feather... but... its right there... On your map... tickling the OCD part of your brain... So...  You go. ACIII also suffered from a mostly uninteresting cast of characters.If you want to know what happens in Desmonds story, watch the cutscenes online or something like that. I dont think Assassins Creed is worth my time anymore. You really have to be a very big fan of the series and game style to play through this in my opinion.
