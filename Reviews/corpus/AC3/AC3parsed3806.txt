Due to graphical errors and incessant crashes, I wasnt able to play more than an hour and a half of Assassins Creed III. That said, Id like to express my sincere thanks to Ubisoft for insuring I couldnt play more than an hour and a half of Assassins Creed III. Its an overly simplistic action adventure game with  ironically  excessive handholding tutorials and features. The game is clearly directly marketed towards kids and teenagers, particularly when you consider its completely nonsensical story which involves going back to the American Revolution within a computer simulation in order to stop a solar flare from destroying Earth in the 21st century. Sure, Assassins Creed developers, Ill take a hit of whatever youre smoking.The gameplay consists of holding down a button and running forward, watching your character run freely across the landscape, climbing over walls and running along railings with the balance and coordination of a parkour master. Occasionally, youll hit a button to start a cinematic, or repeatedly tap a button to kill someone. Then theres something about guns and... whatever. This game essentially plays itself more than you play it. Its utterly boring. Not to avoid mention of the dialogue were forced to listen to. Our main characters sole state of mind and mood is, Grr, me angry, me stab you in face. I assume that childish angst and egoism is intentional in order for their core audience to relate.I would recommend this game to anyone who is , and likes seeing pretty flashy colors on the screen. If you want to play a game that is good and fun, I do not recommend this.Actually, I just dont recommend this game at all. Kill it with fire.
