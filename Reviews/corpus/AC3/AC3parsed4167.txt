Other then that fact that it runs very poorly on AMD cards HD6990 its a really fun AC game. Though, it cant touch any of the Ezio AC games IMO. I have played all AC games besides this one on PS3. As an AMD user I dislike the game but as a gamer I like it. When and If you manage to find the sweet spot in the graphics menu, the CCC and can maintain around 30FPS its a really good game with some very bad design choices like the main character being the most boring AC character so far not played black flag.The gameplay itself isnt really that far from the other AC games style. It actually even manages to add some interesting variety to the actual combat gameplay compared to the older titles.The naval sections are just a phenomenal addition to the AC games.Also, I am personally not that excited about the location and time period its set in. Id rather see them go back to Europe or somewhere in Asia. But that is also my personal opinion on that matter and I think that most people like the time period and location of this game.Anyway, the only big drawback of this game is the poor AMD optimization other than that its a great AC title overall. I do think this games will run much better for Nvidia users.Sure, its not the best AC game Ive played but its better than the first one and manages to at least keep up but not surpass the Ezio AC games.
