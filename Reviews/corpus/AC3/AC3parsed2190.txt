Assassins Creed 3 is an interesting game and very fun to play.... If you can take the hit to your PC.... The games engine doesnt use all the cores in your CPU making it very difficult to hit a playable 60FPS on the lowest settings. AMD users will really feel this when hitting the city of Boston... The game is just not optimized for PC play.... So Unless you have a 3rd or 4th Generation i7 in your system, I wouldnt buy this game. Its just not playable. I have a AMD FX 8350 running at 4.5GHZ along with a AMD R9 280X GPU. I would expect at least 60 frames... But nope... Ubisoft has not made patches at all... Anyway, if you are dead sure your system can run this game... Go ahead and buy it... But if you have lower end specs, or an AMD CPU, I wouldnt risk it.
