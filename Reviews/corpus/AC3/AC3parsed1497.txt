My favourite Assassins Creed game! Right in front of Assassins Creed IV Black Flag. Ive already beat it on ps3 when it came out but i wanted to experience it again. I love the setting and i like how it was a big change from being in Europe. 10/10 would recommend!EDIT also my favourite assassins outfit!
