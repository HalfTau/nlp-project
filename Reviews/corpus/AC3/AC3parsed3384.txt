Its very meh in terms of overal play. Desmonds face looks god awful. Ubisoft is always changing the controls and it feel much worse. The story line is hard to keep up with since its always fast paced and the missions arent very hard at all. I feel like this game was rushed and the effort put into this game was terrible. The graphics do look nice, but the overall flow is not well put together.
