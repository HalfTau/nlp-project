Since there are so many Assassins Creed Parts out yet, Im not sure if this one is worth it, but its overall a good game.I played this game as my first Assassins Creed game and it surprised me since I just bought it just as a preparation for AC4. It fulfilled its job very good. Its a nice game which may be a bit difficult to controll but if you got it, it can make real fun. The story is a bit more originally then the ones from the new games and its also a big funfactor.In conclusion I think its a pretty nice game, which is worth buying when youre a AC fan, if not, Id prefer trying the newer AC parts.
