Very enjoyable, nice plot, good main character, great setting, I really do like it. The only problem is, well, the cut aways to the Desmond plot, as usual. Honestly who the fck actually cares about this stupid Apple of Eden and this other plot with the Templars taking over the world and sht? No, thats boring, I dont want to see this buzzcut dipshtdo anything, hes boring! Every time Im brought back to his place in the story I always count the seconds until I can be back with the ACTUAL main character. Its called Assassins Creed for a reason...
