This game seems to be the subject of a love it or hate it thing. I imagine that it came almost as a shock to fans of the series. You play as Connor, a halfNative American, and halfBritish Assassin. Compared to the extroverted and charismatic Ezio Auditore from AC 2, Connor is almost the complete opposite. It may be hard to like him at all by solely doing the main missions.The storytelling seems to fail from the start. In the beginning, you play as Haytham for a good while. His sequences act as an unnecessarily long and expositionfilled tutorial. Thankfully, as soon as Connor becomes a fullfledged Assassin, the game starts picking up the pace, but the storyline is okay at best. Since I was never fond of the modernday storyline anyway, getting pulled out of Connors story a couple of times was a drag. The ending for Desmond is very unsatisfying.Theres not much to be said for the main missions, but some of them are incredibly boring, like eavesdropping or following people. Be warned, though, that the battles are a COMPLETE disappointment  you arent even allowed near the redcoats.Sidemissions are a mixed bag. Fort/liberation ones are quite fun, as you can approach them in different ways, like sneaking around or running into the thick of things. Naval missions are undeniably awesome and intense, offering a feeling of badassery as you obliterate enemy ships. However, the other missions scattered throughout the world are not very rewarding. At the very least, I do recommend playing the homestead missions, as they show a more likable side to Connor.The weapons and equipment you are given covers a wide range of ways to kill, and there are different enemies to prevent button spamming. Regrettably, I found fighting still way too easy. Enemies will, for the most part, take turns and watch passively as you slaughter their comrade.Overall, Id give Assassins Creed 3 a 7/10. There were some things that kept me playing, but it could have been better.
