Nice graphics, but thats about it. Personally, this was the game that ruined AC for me, utterly boring when most of your time is spent traveling from location to location which should have be saved by map traveling. The story drags on and on and didnt interest me in the slightest. After playing half of it couldnt commit anymore than that I realised there were no big assassinations that there were in the previous 3 games, which for me was the most fun part of AC setting up a perfect assassination by being undetected. But the closest Assassins Creed III gets to this is trying to remain undetected whilst evesdropping 2 guards.
