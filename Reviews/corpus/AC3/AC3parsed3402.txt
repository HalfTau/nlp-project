A lot of people seem to hate this game, and I figured I would have too seeing how American history is boring, and having lived in boston, 1700s boston was pretty flat and open, so it wouldnt make for good parkour.I still think that, but the combat is trivialized which is what I wanted, and the main dude is cool. Some mechanics are weird, but I love reading the lore tidbits.Also the UI is  but whatever, asscreed.
