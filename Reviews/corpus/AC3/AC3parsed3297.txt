How this game has an 80 metascore is beyond me. Ive played all of the main AC games and this one is complete garbage compared to the others. The negative comment written by Liberty pretty much covers everything, but there is something Id like to point out. The trailer makes you believe this game will put you into the Revolutionary War  this is not the case. There are a couple of small battles you get to participate in you just shoot cannons or tell people to fire their weapons but there is nothing resembling the trailer in this game. And Connor is a bad protagonist. And all his friends are boring. And the game forces you to spend way to much time helping them with their petty problems. And... I could go on but why bother.
