I believe this is my favoutie of the series.I understand i am in the minority but it seems to me that people refuse to embrace Connor for the true badass he really is. Unlike Ezio Connor od AC3 is born into nightmare world for his people Native American and Assassin he stand as a focal point for both with all the weight on his sholders. Also, the rope dart.
