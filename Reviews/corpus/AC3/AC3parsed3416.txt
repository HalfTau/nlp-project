the combat in this game is very broken. enemies do not have a set amount of health, instead you can only kill an enemy if you complete a full combo against them. this becomes irritating very fast when you are faced against multiple enemies that will interrupt your combos, or the more difficult enemies that are immune to combos and therefore invincible unless you can sneak up on them. but these enemies also spawn endlessly if youve already been detected, making many events such as the fort takeovers very impossible. there are some missions where you get to sail around in an old timey sailing vessel and have shiptoship battles, but those are too few and far between to make up for the rest of the game. skip this and go straight to 4.
