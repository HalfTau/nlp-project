This game was amazing. Im a little late to playing it, its been sitting in my library for 2 years but I finally got around to it. The story is amazing and the whole concept around the game is by far my favorite of all the Assassins creed games. My only issue is how buggy it can be. The random glitches during missions here and there had me screaming and punching my desk. Redoing a mission over and over and over again because he either climbs in the wrong spot or just all together would stop moving or not do what Im trying to do. Random civilians fall through the map. Riding a horse was probably the most challenging thing to do in the game sometimes. I could go on and on about glitches this game has, and theres a lot, however that seems to be with every assassins creed on PC, so I blame ubisoft. The game also has a lot of running back and fourth between the frontier, boston, and new york, and it got annoying to finish a mission only to have to run all the way across the map to get to the next one, and then back across the map for the one after that, but at the same time it was nice finding different ways to get around the forests by tree tops. If you look past the bugs and glitches, this game is amazing. The story line is amazing and always made me want to keep playing. Even after the main story line there are epiloque quests and A LOT of sidequests. For a completionist, it would be almost annoying, but for someone like me who just wants to play the game and get sucked into it, assassins creed 3 did the job. Would absolutely recommend this game to everyone. Best assassins creed game.
