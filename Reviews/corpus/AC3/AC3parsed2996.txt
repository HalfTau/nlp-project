This game is adequate, but as a triple A submission that likely had many millions of dollars put into development, it falls quite short. I didnt connect with the stroy in any way, bugs had a way of finding me rather than the other way around, and most of the missions boil down to running from point a to point b and stabbing a guy with little to do in between. The one good thing Ill say about this game is that its a pretty great time to just walk around town with the law enforcementat you, so that you may take down all comers with your bare hands. Yet at that rate I may as well have just played either of the Arkham Batman games.
