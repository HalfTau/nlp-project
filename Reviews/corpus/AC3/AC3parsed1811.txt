Same old Assassins Creed formula. However, this time he characters are less interesting than a brick wall, you spend the majority of the game staring at Connor in a loading screen and it takes less time for Ezio to reload a hidden piston in 1200s than Connor takes to load a pistol in the 1700s.On the plus side, combat is satisfying, and the Washington DLC is a breath of fresh air and I found to be more enjoyable than the base game.
