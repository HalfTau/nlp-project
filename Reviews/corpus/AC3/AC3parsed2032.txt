The game is flawed. Stealth is bad, story is bad, the character is annoying. On top of that, he jumps on absolutely everything and its almost impossible to complete some objectives.Prosyou can captain a ship and learn about a lot of history....other than that, would not recommend.Ill play it through, but the mechanics are terrible.
