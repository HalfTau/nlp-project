Well, heres the truth.This game has a pretty good storyline, arguably the coolest protagonist, cool new features, and is set in a really ideal time period and location.BUT, you see that 43.6 hrs on record up there? Ill tell you that maybe 10 of that is actual gameplay. The game lagged horribly, the game crashed right when you became Connor after an extremely long cutscene. Imagine trying to play a game and you have to play the boring beginning 8 times and watch the same 8 minute cutscene EIGHT TIMES. Then have the game be so laggy that its basically unplayable, but fast enough that you think you can play it. Basically the gameplay was 10 times slower than it should have been resulting in 40 hrs of gameplay. This may work for you because Im running AMD processor and graphics card.Now lets talk about how extremely ambitious this game was. Ubisoft basically thought they could make a game that should have been on a next gen. platform, but they through it on the old dogs. Its like trying to play Battlefield 4 on a Nintendo DS. Good luck.This game is SOY GAY. I DONT EVEN WANNA TYPE ANYMORE BECAUSE IT MAKES ME SO ANGRY THAT THIS GAME WAS A TERRIBLE PORT FOR PC AND IT JUST SUCKED. I LOVE PEN15
