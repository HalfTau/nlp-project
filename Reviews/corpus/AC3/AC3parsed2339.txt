AC3 is just like all the other new video games. Its an interactive movie that replaces game content with improved graphics. Also they removed the grab throw command in combat or I didnt play long enough to unlock it, which almost singlehandedly ruined it for me. No more grabbing those annoying beggars/musicians off the street and headbutting them in the face...
