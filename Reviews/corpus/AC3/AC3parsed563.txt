A fantastic game, especially if you love the era of the world it takes place in. Some dialogue is out of place and feels forced, but may be the best of the franchise if you take into effect gameplay and all other factors. Only rival I could give it is Black Flag and.. thats because frickin pirates, man. The story even with its rare bumps in the road is enjoyable and gripping. The engine is good, better than Ezios trilogy, but not quite as good as Edwards IV. Nonetheless, one of my favorite games ever made, for a gameplay/story combo. May not be for you, but it definitely picks up after the first 1/4th of the progress into the story
