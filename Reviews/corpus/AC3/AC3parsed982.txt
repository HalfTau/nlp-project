This game is one of my AC favorites... 8.5/10.0 The frontier remains as the best open world area in the whole AC series The templar/assassin plot story will touch you, with some of the coolest characters  twists in the AC series Historically this is a masterpiece, heavily inmersed in the revolutionary war You want to complete side missions after the main story ends to further enjoy the gameCriticism You may not empathize with some characters End sequences loose some steam Feels like the story is kind of short at some locations like NY Side missions are a bit poor
