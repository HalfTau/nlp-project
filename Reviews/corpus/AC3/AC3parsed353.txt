Uplay0/10Uplay refused to launch the game, stating that I was not connected to the internet. So I tried logging in a couple more times. Eventually it asked me to reinstall the game altogether. My internet was completely connected and I was having issues with their launcher. After asking me to reinstall the game, instead I attempted to try and launch it again. There was only error after error after error. So I requested a refund via Steam. I never had issues with Uplay up until my first attempt on my new gaming pc. I will NEVER buy another Ubisoft game that requires Uplay ever again. Wouldnt even allow me to play the game without an internet connection on a SINGLEPLAYER game. I fullheartedly loathe Uplay.
