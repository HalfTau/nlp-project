How the  did this game make it out of beta testing? The potential is there for a great game, and maybe playing AC4 before AC3 spoiled me but for s sake launching the game is an ordeal as it frequently locks up at the main loading screen.If you manage to get past the main menu which is a herculean feat to be sure you are then treated topoor tutorials that do more to confuse than inform and terribly placed checkpoints that can have you running through the same 15 minute sequence just because you failed to abide by 1 easily failable objective.Spare yourself the rage give this game a pass, the sequel to this game has all the fun and none of the grief, if you want to explore the plot of this game read the wiki page but dont blow your money on this trash heap
