This game is amazing.Many say that other Assassins Creed games are better, while they might be correct this game is still one of my all time favourite single player games.Things that are really good1. the story is very engaging and if you dont enjoy tons of dialogue you can skip the unimportant cutscenes. Love the plot twists and the caracter devellopment.2. the gameplay is fun, the fights are fun, the objectives are well indicated and exploring the world is pretty fun as well.Also, I could go around stealing all day if I had the time to. 10/10 would steal again3. the animal and people animations are great and very realistic.4. stealth gameplay is sometimes hard but doable at the same time, deffinately fun though.Whats kinda meh1. the graphics arent great you see objects appear in front of you if youre travalling around the world, it is an old game though and the animations are still awesome.2. the guns in big fights against the soldiers in the town where you play as Hatham are annoying to say the least, and the way to counter them arent explained at all.The story telling is just awesome though, deffinately worth buying, maybe even when not on sale.
