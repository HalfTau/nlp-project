My favorite Assassins Creed game. The mix of open wilderness and tight city streets was very well done and a great setting. The story was strong in that it wasnt black and white like many other AC games. The main character wasnt perfect, the bad guys werent all that bad, and the Revolutionary War had plenty of gray moments to make us think. Connor himself is probably my favorite Assassin. He isnt very emotional, but thats representative of his upbringing, and really allows for great moments when he does let lose. AC has always had great animations, but I think this game had the best. Connor was big and powerful, and his weapons and moveset made it show. When it came out I never had problems playing it on PC and to this day I dont know why people thought it was so buggy. I recommend looking up Connors Epilogue Monologue on YouTube. For some strange reason it was cut, but its a great wrap to the game and character.
