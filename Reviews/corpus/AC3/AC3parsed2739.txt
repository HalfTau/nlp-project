After playing it through the second time on PS3, its not as bad as I first thought. Sure the start is slow, as it can take up to 7 hours before you can do anything in the game, and then the game is half way through.Its kind of MGS 2 You spend the first half of the game playing as some other dude, wishing he would be the protagonist, but then you switch to play as some whiny little brat. Main story is like a flower that got eaten by a cow yesterday, in other words Connor had to be shoehorned in every little event in American Revolution. And events themselves are... well... uneventful. Sideactivities are plentiful. The storyline of building your own community and finding people to live there is much more interesting than the main story. The gameplay is good. You can finally climb trees. And somehow bashing enemies with the tomahawk feels much more satisfying than in the other games. And finally the naval battles are the factor that redeems the game. There is a reason theyre the main focus of Black Flag and Rogue, other games in the franchise I enjoy greatly. Actually bought ACIII again for the PS3, because I wanted more of them.
