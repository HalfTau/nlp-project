i would recommend but i got to say assassins creed 3 is completly different from assassins creed 2, assassins creed 2 is just like almost like gta but assassins creed 3 is like just stick to the story line.If u like stuff such as half life or skyrim i would recommend assassins creed 3 cause these games are based on story line.But if you are more to the free running and killing what u c like gta and fool around i would recommend assassins creed 2 D
