I got this game on sale at the end of 2013 for 15. Im new to the AC series but this game is amazing. It allows you to just follow the storyline or do subquests which add alot of depth to the game. The environments are beautifuly designed and you get to meet iconic people such as George Washington and Israel Putnam. Overall I say this is a great game for anyone.
