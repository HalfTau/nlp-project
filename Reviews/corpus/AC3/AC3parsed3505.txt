SToooooooooooooop! Dont buy this game if you like games, without bugs, reachable servers and good gameplay. The game runs like a steamengine alright, but there are so many bugs still not fixed and every freaking time I do something that Corrupts the Course of History, I can replay the entire mission! ArgH!
