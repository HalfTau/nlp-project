Of course I recommend this game, its brilliant. I think Connor is perfectly fine being un emotional because he all the people who care about him die. SPOILER ALERTSo you know I would 10/10 Recommend for the bottom of my diseased heart i give you one of my favorite games of all time. The only problem is that the DLC is very buggy and made me want to kill myself. But yeah just play it is really best game 2012 or was it 2013 I dont know and I dont care because this game is too good.
