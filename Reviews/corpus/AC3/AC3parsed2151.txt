Played it for a bit, wasnt terrible but the optimization wasnt great.Tryed to play it again today, and the game dissapeared from my uPlay account, bloody brilliant.I tried to reactivate it on uPlay with the CDKey and it tells me it has already been activated.I cant rate the game from the little amount of time that I got to play with it.0/10 for uPlay.I got robbed by uPlay and Ubisoft, Im not kidding.I payed for something that I cant play anymore.
