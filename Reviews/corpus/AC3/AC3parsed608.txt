Ive been trying to drag myself through this but it is just not fun at all. Im sure Ubisoft has heard of playtesting. Maybe theyre trying to save money and coast on the company reputation? I belive a lot of game development corporations are doing that now, because running lucrative industries into the ground while scooping up as much cash as they can get their hands on is what they do. Thank you, Martin Shkreli!I keep wondering then Desmonds experiences in the Animus might tansform him into someone likeable and he keeps disapointing me. The drama with his father doesnt make him more interesting. And the new game mechanics, hunting and trading? Zzzzzzz....Im at the part where a young Connor how did he get an English name who does that make any sense at all to? must escape from an insane number of soldiers who can somehow outrun me and why are there so many of them? Its not fun its not interesting and I feel like the time I spent on it is wasted. As far as Im concerned the Assassins Creed story ends here. Im uninstalling it now so Im not tempted to frustrate myself further with it. Ubisoft isnt getting more of my time or my money.
