Assassins Creed has always been a favorite game series of mine and AC3 is probably somehwhere in the top 4 out of all of them. The graphics were really great on my pc and i never got that blurry look that some people have asked me about. The campaign was interesting as well and I liked the fact that you could recruit others to join the brotherhood even if they were already designated to do so in the story. Another feature I thought was really good was the naval missions and being able to actually act as a pirate and board other ships. There were a few interesting plot twist in the story, but I wont go into that. Another thing is the weapon customization what you either craft or buy at the store and being able to mix and match different combinations and being able to hold 2 guns. Allinall, this game was great for me. Makes me wish I would have played the games in the order they came out instead of bouncing around lol.
