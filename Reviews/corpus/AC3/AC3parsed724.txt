Decided to try out the game again after a long break and the purchase of a much better equipped system.Downloaded game.Hit play. Had to update Uplay oh, right. Got everything updated.Hit play again because the game wasnt running.Claimed it was already running.Tried running from Uplay. Nothing.Ended the Uplay task and tried again from Steam.Game starts.I didnt see an option to turn off Vsync, could just be my mistake.Start a new game and get started.Crashes part way through the tutorial.Close Uplay for good and uninstall game.Im good. I dont need that headache.
