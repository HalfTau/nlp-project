There is a lot of setiment saying that this is not a good game i like it it adds a lot over the previous iterations.  Ship combat hunting and AMERICA. Along with the other assasins creeds it also gives you a bit of a history lesson while playing the game.  No of course there wasnt assasins or templars running about but then again maybe ther was.  DUM DUM .. lol anyway i hade a lot of fun with it and its sure a lot better than UNITY lol
