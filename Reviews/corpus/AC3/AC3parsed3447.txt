After finishing the game recently, Ill have to say I didnt mind it. Not as fun as the previous games and Im still a bit unclear as to how the last game in the series directly translates in this one... Ill have to not recommend it for several reasons.1 The game is extremely temperamental and glitchy. I dont believe Ive ever been able to play more than an hour or so without some freeze, story glitch or outright crash to desktop.2 Ubisofts support is nonexistent and in the few, extremely rare circumstances you actually get a response, it is of zero help or reeks of incompetence and/or no concern to paying customers whatsoever.3 BE WARNED and DO NOT BUY the Tyranny of Washington DLC. There is a well know issue in the first episode that completely make progress impossible. There have been thousands of online posts and nothing in the way of support or a fix from Ubisoft. Their only recommendation was to delete your save game and start over, hoping, that it wont happen again. To most players, it happens again though after hours of playing everything over again. Dont take my word for it, google Stalk the guard dogJustice Served for yourself is read of all the misery.This is the last title from Ubisoft I ever purchase it joins a list of blacklisted companies that will never see my money again such as EA and Amazon. There are plenty of choices for entertainment out there and I can live without another AC title or EA recycled sports game. The only thing these companies understand and care for is  and that is the only we can control directly. If you will not properly support the titles you release then you will not have me as a customer.If half of you reading this followed through on the same, things would change very, very quickly.
