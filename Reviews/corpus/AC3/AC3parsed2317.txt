Honestly, this is one of the best installments in the series in my opinion. This game was very unique and paved the way for Black Flag, Freedom Cry, and Rogue which are essentially all the same game. Not only that, but this game has some of the best mechanics in the franchise, not to mention the combat. The combat in this was very simplified compared to the previous Assassins Creed games but brutal and not to mention quite badass. The parkour in this is awesome, but there isnt much to climb on besides trees and twostory buildings, which is okay with me. Finally, the story in this is pretty good, if you pay attention and watch the cutscenes.Overall, this game got a lot of hate and is still considered one of the worst games in the franchise, but that is completely opinionbased. I personally loved this game and consider it the secondbest game in the series right behind the first installment. If youre looking for a bit of history, war, parkour, and a badass assassinindian, look no further! I would buy this game and create your own opinion of it, though, because its different for everyone that plays it.Rating 9/10Also, I recommend getting the deluxe edition with the DLCs. They did not disappoint me.
