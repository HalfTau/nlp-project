A flawed gem. Theres essentially two games here, a by the numbers focus groupmade AAA game that spreads itself too thin and a game that actually tells an interesting story beyond the obvious. The combat is clunky, the pacing is awful it takes HOURS to actually start the game properly, and the ending hours sputter and collapse, literally. But I was captivated by the presentation of a person of color in a leading role, especially as its set in Colonial America. Ratonhnhakton aka Connor was criticized for being dull and unlikeable, but how else would you expect someone in that position to take the role and still seem genuine? Connor has been discriminated, persecuted, and alienated throughout his life, and so responds by being serious and dutiful. He has to prove himself adequate at every turn just for his existance to be acknowledged, while at the same time trying to hold unto his principles and idealism. In the end the story takes a turn that, while historically accurate, still feels surprising given games responsabilities as mainstream media.
