The final episode in the Desmond series, this game does have a few bugs and, in keeping with Ubisofts tradition, changes to the way you fight, like no healing potions, at all. Still for those who like a good story this series has had a pretty well written one. A few shockers for those following the story I wont spoil.As with the rest of this series I pretty much had to turn off any voice chat with my friends a number of times and I may have scared my niece a few too. The game does have quite a few moments where it will leave you wondering if something can ever be done, it can, but by the skin of your teeth usually though full synch is insaneStill, its always good to have a reason for why youre wearing that straight jacket and this game is as good as any, enjoy
