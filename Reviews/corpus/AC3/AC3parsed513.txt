Its a good game. Read some others bigger rewievs if you want to know more. Im just here to inform you that you need a controller to play this. The keyboard and mouse controls are really really bad. It has few keybindings, meaning many keys do several things and if you remap something for combat it screws with your menu controls. Also the remapping of keys dont save, so every time you start up the game you need to configure the keybindings again.Also the lockpick system does not work with a high sensitivity mouse,I recommend buying this game, especially on a sale, if you have a controller!If you dont have a controller, Dont buy it!
