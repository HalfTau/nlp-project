Pros Delivers the same triedandtrue game play with some new additions, Naval battles are well made and add new flavor to the series.Cons Puzzles have been for the most part removed, limited quickkey binds are beginning to show their limitations Many weapons and items poor system to quickly access themI think the entire storyline concerning Connor and his predicament made the entire ordeal depressing and futile. Id rather have played the game from Haythams perspective from his beginning and the path he chose.Most of the assassin lore has been removed, it was glossed over along with Connors training, while AC fans might not see this as an inconvenience, newcomers might miss out on the deeper meaning of the conflict.Storyline progressions is odd at places, such as being able to liberate forts and hoisting the 13star flag BEFORE it was introduced to the storyline, along with an important character recognizing Connor without any foreshadowing on how he knew of him.Overall it was a decent installment, but doesnt hold a candle to Brotherhood.PS. The canoe is a blatant lie.
