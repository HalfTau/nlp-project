This game brings the series up to the next level with a much improved seamless gameplay. The story is on par with Assassins Creed II and the world is huge with lots to do.For me I did not find Connor to be as likeable character as Ezio and had a hard time playing as him in the beginning but he does grow on you. It also felt like a huge tutorial almost half the game.The game have some really nasty bugs and glitches which is annoying but nothing that will stop you from finishing the game.The multiplayer is improved over the last games but its still not balanced enough and I find myself playing mutliplayer only to get the Uplay award which is a boring chore.
