This is by far the most visually pleasing game in the assassins creed series.With a wide map and different seasons, it pleases the eyes.The story follows the life of Ratonhaketon.This game is the first in the series that actually made it feel like it was open world.Of course, the others are also open world, but the things you can do arethis game however, there are lots of things to do that are interesting, like hunting animals for instance.The difficulty is not hard.It is normal most of the time.Combat mechanisms have been slightly improved.The new animations during fight sequences makes it much more interesting to fight.This is in my opinion very different from the other games in the series, but is is very good nonetheless.
