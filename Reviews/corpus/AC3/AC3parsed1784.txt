After loving the assasins creed games previous to this i couldnt wait for 3. So I started this game when it came out in 2012 and gave up fairly quickly. I dont particularly remember the start of the game apart from it being incredibly boring.I finally came back to it in 2015 and found i had played 10 hours of the game and I still didnt have any of the assasins gear or anything i also really couldnt remember the story too well So that will give you an idea of how slow it is to begin.Anway after coming back to the game I found it to be enjoyable. There are a few things in the game I dont care for, like killing and skinning animals, crafting but there are other elements i found suprisingly fun like the whole ship and naval missions and the dlc animal spirit powers are a blast they are definitely a highlight of the game.The history and timeline of the game were initially another thing that put me off, im not sure why other than it just didnt capture my imagination like the locations and times in the previous games.Then the character of Connor seemed just too flat, I dont mind the change and well what can i say its hard to surpass Ezio and Altiar but something about Connor just made him hard to care about or relate to as a character.Then there is the ending of the game, it just wasnt satisfying at all, and ive heard that desmond no long features in the games beyond this point which makes his journey all the more pointless.After all my moaning though there is some solid fun gameplay in there, it just takes some time to get at it and looking back at my steam hours suprisingly this game has the most hours for me even though i like it the least. So that really shows there is plenty to do in the game.So If you havent played much assasins creed and have the patience id say you will enjoy the game. If you have just finished playing the last few assasins creed games and are jumping into this for the first time. Id say brace yourself for slogging through some crap until you get to the fun parts.
