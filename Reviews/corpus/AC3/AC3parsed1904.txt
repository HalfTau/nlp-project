We should have known, we should have seen it coming. After the wobble that was the previous game AC Revelations, AC III was an utter trainwreck. A bland and hastilly thrown together story, less interesting setting, a waste of what could have been a great main character in Connor Kenway, and an anticlimactic ending that TWO GAMES LATER still hasnt been expanded on or recovered from.The gameplay is standard fare but fairly dull.If you enjoyed the series until this point, you could easily skip this one, imagen your own perfect sequel and just move on to the others.BasicallyAssassins Creed IV is a better Assassins Creed III than Assassins Creed III, and Assassins Creed Unity is more in the vein of Assassins Creed II than anything since Assassins Creed II.
