First impressionI bought the game, download it, im trying to play it but i cant yet because Uplay is broken.I went to buy something to eat while this thing was trying to register the game, so after an hour of trying to get my informations it counted as i played the game but i didnt.Stay away from Ubisoft crap!After being able to play itTo get it working, i basically had to uninstall the uplay version that comes when you install the game  I used RevoUninstaller to get rid of everything After that i went to uplay website and downloaded their uplay thing. Then I was able to play the game.Impressions so farMaps seems huge, but im not far enough in the game to have real use for them atm, except doing missions i dont have any other side quests to do except killing the random courrier that crosses my path. But looking at ingame stats, later on it seems theres a lot of side quests to do. So ill play some more and update the review some more.
