This is a really good game with graphics that WONT make you want to kill yourself! I honestly have no idea why people are ing about this is a glitchy piece ofthat wasnt halfquot I only experinced minor glitches like teleporting through a log I was climbing. The only trouble I had was that my computer sucks, so it lagged a crap ton during cutscenes. Dammit Microsoft!
