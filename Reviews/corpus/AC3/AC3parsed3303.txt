While this game didnt really feel like an Assassins Creed title, the story and gameplay was there. However, a few minor things were annoying. Large groups of enemies were VERY dificult to get rid of, the blood on characters during cutscenes was absolutly attrocious, there was no need to spend any money, and no way to obtain any without looting dead bodies, killing and skinning animals had absolutly zero purpouse, etc. Over all, this game was very good but could be better. 8.
