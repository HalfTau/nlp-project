Look at my playtime before questioning my judgements.This game is fantastic, i can see how ubisoft tried to execute the Native American/1700s British occupied America game, and they did beautifully.The story is set in british occupied 18th century Boston, its about a man Desmond Miles who with the aid of the Animus, goes back in time and simulates what it is like to be one of the founders of an evil group called the Templars, who want power with control instead of peace. Later on you will then be controlling Ratonhnhakton Radoonhangedon. who is a Native American and the direct descendent of haytham kenway, who you will later on through the game find out who he really is, Ratonhnhakton is interested in becoming an assassin and so he sets out of his village to learn the true ways of the assassin.Even though this is the 3rd installment of the assassins creed franchise, i dont think i missed anything that i couldve understood the story better with from the 1st or 2nd game Keep in mind this is my first game coming into the assassins creed franchise. The combat is fluid and simple, yet complex at times. Its easy to learn but its extremely fun to master.There are alot of ways you can approach enemies, you can go in AntiqueGuns Blazing, you can take it slow and stealthy Or you can be a predator and kill your enemies in varied ways you can hang enemies from a ing tree branch.The visuals are pretty good for a game made in 2012, the ambient occlussion realistically maps out the shadows and lighting smoothly and beautifully, the texture quality is excellent and i fail to find a distorted texture anywhere, this game is made on an engine designed by ubisoft called Anvil, and it might just be the best looking game on the engine!The dlcs are a bit pricey and they dont deliver an excellent story, I havent bought them and i am satisfied with the games ending as it is.The game has a multiplayer, its fun tactical. And surprisingly, some people still play it to this day, i find it very hard to wait more than 5 minutes and not get in a game.The games story takes about 1517 hours, I rarely see games with that much playtime with such a small price, but this game is slow at times, the fastest speedrun of the game was 9 and a half hours. But if you are wondering how i mustered 350 hours, you need to know, the game has alot more than the story, it has several different guns, weapons and even clothing. It has alot of trophies and collectibles that are a chore to find, but wont hurt the game.And one of my favourite parts of the game is the Homestead!The Homestead is a place where later on in the game you will own,  as you progress further through the game you gain more people living in your homestead until it is eventually a village, you can even do missions with the villagers! Complete with their own cutscenes and stories to tell.The games price is just right for a game this good but you can definetely find cheaper prices on G, 2, A or Green Man Gaming.The game has done excellent on optimiziation, it has never crashed a single time and i fail to find any game breaking glitches or bugs.Overall, i would give this game an 8/10The game builds everything up perfectly, there are places where it excelled with flying colours, but there are places it couldve done better at and there are places where it fell flat on its face. But you wont be bothered by some of these mistakes.I reccommend you get it now! You would get it way cheaper on G, 2, A or Green Man Gaming, but in my opinion, 20 dollars is worth it.
