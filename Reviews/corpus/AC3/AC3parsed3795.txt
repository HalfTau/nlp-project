Easily the worst game in the main series. Where do I even start?Revolutionary Era New York and Boston arent as interesting to explore or run around in as any of the locals from the other games. It didnt help that the reputation system had guards hunting me down half the time. The wilderness areas are even worse, as there isnt much to do and getting around by tree isnt as done as it could have been. The missions are boring and uninspired and the story is interesting. Homestead management is also a chore, as is hunting. The whole game just feels stale, and all of the new elemenets have little to no draw save for ship battles.Skip it. Just go to the vastly improved Black Flag.
