While not the drastic revolution of the series that fans were clamoring for, AC3 still comes through as a solid title in the franchise and still mixes things up enough to stay interesting. The world is much larger this time around, making up two cities, a frontier and your property. Because of the size, traveling on horseback tend to be the prefered way to travel, while youll take to the trees in the thicker areas of the frontier and even in cities, the fewer buildings will have you take to the rooftops much more infrequently. Whether taking focus away from the rooftops of previous entries is a good idea is really up to preference.Missions in this entry, whether of the main or side sort, tend to be of varying quality with the highpoints of the game coming from sneaking through Templar strongholds, visiting interesting locations in search of Captain Kidds map and seeing Connors day to day life in the homestead. The absolute worst though, are the courier missions which comes with zero exposition and zero risk.
