While its a good game by itself, when you compare it to the other AC games it doesnt quite have the same appeal.The story in this game definitely feels off. They could have gone a better direction and possibly followed the other AC games a bit tighter, this one just feels like a massive let down.The graphics are great, as usual. Combat feels about the same. A great game if you dont care about the story that much.
