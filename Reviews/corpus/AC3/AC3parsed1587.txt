Ill start off by first saying that Ive played Assassins Creed right from the start, through 2 and both of the stand alone expasnions. I do recommend this game, however it doesnt have the same feel as the previous releases. I will fully admit that the game looks fantastic and the story is exceptionally well done, but my single biggest complaint is the frequent bouts of tedium that present itself. Some of the side quests, and in fact some of the main questline sequences, are little more than walking around. While at first it gives you an opportunity to enjoy the scenary, eventually I found myself getting annoyed with the seemingly pointless delays in quest progression. With that all said however this is a good game, the combat is fun, and as I said above it looks great and the storyline is a unique take on a turbulent time in the Americas. Is it my favorite Assassins Creed? Absolutely not. Should you buy it? Yes.
