One of best games I ever played!This game shows that Assassins make mistakes too. Connor wanted to protect his people and revenge his mother only bad thing was that hes naive and guarded. He thought that templars were the bad guys because of Charles Lee for destroying his village and killing his mother. But Connor was wrong. Templars were on good side. They wanted to make a world better place and warn Connors village before the attack. The people like Washington and free people were responsible for destroying native clans like Connors.Rest in peace Haytham Kenway. The most charasmatic character in assassins creed history!May the father of understanging guide us!
