I can not recommend this game for it is not a true assassins creed game. nor is connor a true assassin.too many bugs some of which even game breaking. okey its fun when rats are flying around the map and people dissapearing or teleporting in out of nowhere. but when horse carriages are missing and you cant hide inside them and thus cant play the mission.... its just  that you have to limit the fps to 60 ingame and change the refresh frequency of your monitor.only reason why i finished it was to know what happens to desmond.thats why i recommend watching a playthrough on youtubei forgot to mention that from my 15hours of playtime, i legit spend atleast 5 hours in loading screens..or Uninterruptible animations
