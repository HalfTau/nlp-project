Another entry in the AC series.  If youve played any other AC games, you have a good idea what to expect here. except its worse than the others.  Unfortunately this game features the worst leading man so far. Connor is not a loveable lead man.  The crafting system is also not very good.  Instead of wasting your time trying to craft junk to sell, its much easier to just go hunting and sell the spoils directly. The fast travel system was poorly done. To activate each fast travel point you have to spend lots of tedious time scouting the tunnels underground the city. Very dull. One big plus was the addition of naval combat. The naval fights were probably the most fun I had in the game and allowed for tactical combat. While this may not be the best AC game, I still had a lot of fun with it and can recommend it to AC fans. If youre new to these games and want to try one, then start with AC4 which is even more fun.
