i like where the game is set red coats vs blue coats love it but when i really got in to the game i didnt like it at all now i have just played brotherhood and 2 and what i hate the most is the controls in 2 and brotherhood is 4 bottons in this down to 2 the combat has change to something bad and if you loved the first couple of games then you will not like this one i bought this to finish the desmond theme so i have to go thought hell just to see what happens
