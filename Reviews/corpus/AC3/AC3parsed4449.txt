As a huge fan of Assassins Creed. I was disapointed in this game.  The main charater in this one is Connor and is horrible.  The game mechanics are basically same in all the AC games.  I am having a hard time not recommending this game because im such a huge fan of the series.  Dont get me wrong it is a fun game the rope dart is a great weapon in your assassin tool kit.  But the main story is the same old same old.  Maybe after playing as Ezio across three of the AC series it is hard to appericate Connor.  And I would of liked to see main story outside of Animus progress more.  But it does end on a cliff hanger and will be interesting how ubisoft corrects this IMO terrible ending.  If your a die hard fan play it if you are just thinking of picking it because it looks fun get AC2, Brotherhood, or Revelations instead.  I wish steam had a better recommendation system because a thumbs up is right and a thumbs down isnt right for how i feel on this game.
