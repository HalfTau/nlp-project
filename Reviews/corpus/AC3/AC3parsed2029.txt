Boring story, Dull combat. Repetetive side missions. And a lot of small bugs. The only good thing are naval battles, but for that theres Black Flag.AC3 is not a bad game, but its less interesting than its predessessors. So if you havent played AC before, better start with Ezio trilogy AC2, Brotherhood, Revelations. And then skip AC3 and go to Black Flag.
