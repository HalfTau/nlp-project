Yeah so this game, like AC1, just isnt worth playing. Not going to be as lengthy about this one b/c its just a really plain sort of bad game. Everyone gets it.Terrible modern story and dialogue  as usual.Terrible historical story and dialogue  worse than the others, which arent great either.Terrible mission design and secondary objectives.Uninteresting cities and wilderness.Obnoxious romanticizing of native American cultures. I turned into an eagle to discover the assassins. Please.Obnoxious romanticizing of the Revolutionary war. You see, the evil Templars obviously mustve been siding with the oppressive, mean British people. While the heroic, freedomloving Assassins were on AMERICAS side. Stop, just stop.Let me describe just how ridiculous this game gets with historical events and putting Connor in them.The game also places Connor at the center of every battle and event in the war. Lexington and Concord? You were there, in fact  YOU rode Paul Revere around to tell people the British were coming AND you won the battle for the Americans. Bunker Hill? You were there.Every other battle? You were there and commanded the troops to victory! The Boston Tea Party  YOU threw most of the tea in and defended the colonists helping? Declaration of Independence? You were there when they signed it! Please, its just so miserably cringy.A young, half white half native man that the troops would definitely respect. No they wouldnt be racist at all. I mean, no, not the freedomloving Americans  the only racists in the game are those mean British Templar people.I also love all these missions where they just have all the antagonists right nearby, ready for you to kill, but the game just wants you to believe that youre not ready or you couldnt take them. The dumb My dad is a templar grandmaster subplot is also really annoying and nonsensical.Connor is an annoying angsty teen for the entirety of the story.Dont play this game.
