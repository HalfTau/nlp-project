I havent tried the cingle player much but it seems fine. However, I get games to play multi with my friends, and the multiplayer software in this game is rediculously glitchy.I have multipe friends who have tried this and newer Assassins Creed games, and apparently the company is royally screwing up both the multiplayer programming original release, and not following up with fixes. This game has been out for years, and as of Dec. 2014 still is so glitchy, my friends and I cant play together because there is a glitch in which one player will get into a server and the other will get dropped from the server search.Also, apparently they dont give refunds except under very restricted circumstances. I lived AC 1, but I might never buy another one unless I hear from friends that they finally got their heads out of their butts and fixed/rewrote their multiplayer software.
