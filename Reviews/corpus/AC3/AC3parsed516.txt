Incredibly boring game and I like stealth games. This one is so often aimless that it becomes difficult to keep up with what Im supposed to do next to advance or just move the story along. The weapon selection/use is all terribly frustrating if I want to waste an arrow, let me do it whenever I want to. This game just became not fun too quickly and I wound up quitting and deleting itand I never have done that with any game Ive owned in over 25 years of PC gaming.
