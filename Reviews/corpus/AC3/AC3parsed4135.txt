Assassins Creed 3 is a great game, with a huge open world and an insterseting story it has amazing graphics and i really enjoy playing this game more over, the combat system is comfortable i played with a controller i think its easier and more fun.although the good things about this game i didnt like the idea that sometimes i needed to be super ultra sneaky in order to get 100 sync.. anyways, if youre looking for a huge open world with alot of things to do buy ac3
