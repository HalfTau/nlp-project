A great game that completely falls appart in the third act, both in terms of gameplay and story.This is why you dont rush games, because if they had just given the developers a little bit more time this couldve been a perfect game.The first two thirds are great and absolutely worth playing, but holydoes the last third suck.AC2  ACB  AC3  AC1  ACR
