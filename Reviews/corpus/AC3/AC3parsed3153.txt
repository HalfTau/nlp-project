This game is an interesting one. Certainly not one of the better Assassins Creed games. To begin, the games setting had a lot of potential to make it a great game. Unfortunately, Ubisoft neglected to realize that they set a game in one of Americas most exciting times and didnt act upon the fact that there were two wars happening throughout the whole game. Even the freaking trailer shows a massive fictional battle taking place, so I wanted action. I went into this game during my first playthrough expecting an epic wartime adventure through early American history. I was sorely disappointed. Instead, I got a depressing character who speaks in a boring monotone and grunts Wheres Charles Lee? every 5 minutes, and a mediocre story focusing mainly on the plight of Connors people. We get it. It was a bad time to be a Native American. No need to spend a whole game telling us about this. I tried playing through this game a second time, this time with correct expectations. I now realize that this game isnt that horrible if I think about it. The graphics and character design were unique, the cities and all of their details were fantastic, even the modern day sections of the game were somewhat entertaining. This game has both its good aspects and bad aspects. Dont just take my word for it. Play it yourself.
