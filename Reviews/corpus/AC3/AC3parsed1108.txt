AC3SP.exe has stopped working.This adequetly summarizes my experience with Assassins Creed III. After repeated efforts to determine the cause of the error, I am giving up trying to play this game, having invested a couple hours into trying to get it to launch with zero success. This on a system that will play all sorts of titles, old and new, with relatively few hiccups.0/10.
