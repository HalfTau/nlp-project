This game, while fun, lacks anything that really grabs your attention for longer than 5 minutes. The scenery is nice, but boring after some time. The combat is way too simple, practically all counters. Even with this into consideration, I would reccomend it, however their is one issue. That being, UPlay.Uplay is such a faulty system, and it made me lose 17 hours of gametime. Dont waste your time or money on this garbage.
