Although this is the worst Assassins Creed game yet to come it still is amazing.What I dont like about the game.Conners personality is bland and just ruins the story. They should have worked more on his character. Personally I think Haythom was thought out way better then Conner. There are so many glitches in this game.What I like about this game.While the games story could use a little tweeks it still offers all the fun we all know from the other Assassins Creed games.The differences are on this one you have to be the captain of a Ship towards the end. The multiplayer of this game is probably the best part of it. The Tyranny of King Washington is an amazing addition to the game and gives me a positive review of it.I give it a 7/10.Please give any counter arguments or addition in the comments, I would very much like to see them.
