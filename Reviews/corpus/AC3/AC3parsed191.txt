One of the best Assassin Creed games.The story is very thoughtful and nuanced, so much so that many people overlook it. If you realize that the story explores the ideological differences between the Templars and the Assassins then it is very easy to love. Should humanity be trusted to chart its own course as the Assasins believe or would it be better off guided by a benevolent firm hand like the Templars believe?Some people erroneously seem to think Connor is a one dimensional character but thats because those people likely missed out on the Homestead missions where his motivations are fleshed out. As the game progresses, more and more of the Homestead expands and as the seasons change, more optional conversations open up with characters in his village and elsewhere, all of which demonstrate character development.The gameplay offers a variety of ways for you to utilize your parkour and weapons. You can hunt in the Frontier, collect some feathers and trinkets, rob some convoys, chests, and complete Frontiersman missions. You can run through the cities collecting Almanac pages, trinkets and chests guarded by NPC, as you liberate districts from Templars by helping out the local resistance in their own unique missions. Or you can take to the beautifully rendered high seas and engage in naval combat. The set piece missions are back too as you are tasked to recover Captain Kidds treasure.The modern day has its moments too. It isnt up to the standards of the main game and was apparently done by the B team so the difference in quality is obviously apparent but the dialogue is still pretty good and the plot points covered provide closure to Desmonds story.
