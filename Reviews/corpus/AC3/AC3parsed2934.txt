This game is good, not gonna blow your mind the story is really dumb, and conner is no assassin but good.DETAILThis game has a massive mix of diffrent parts, strung together in a impressive way. From the story missions, which are interesting but confusing see further down, to the homested missions trading and recruting assassins PLEASE BRING THIS BACK UBISOFT. Note the game is not 100 cohesive game many of the side missions are detatched and weird, but it is still 75, better then most games.The stroy is the games weak spot, it can be summerized into 3 words  Wheres charls lee. At one point they are face to face and he does nothing, becuase game length. As such conner is really 1D not really, but for about 60 of the time, however haythem the main villain is very deep and has really good caracter.This game has alot of fun to offer, but it is not a real AC game, take that into account.
