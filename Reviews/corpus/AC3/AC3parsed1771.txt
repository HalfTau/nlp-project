Some people say corporations are bad. But theose people dont want to see how much corporations can do. The level of design, attension to details, programmers work, designers work, sound... everything is almost perfect in this game. As for weapons, and people complained about heavy weapons in particular, I like heavy weapons and I like to choose how I deal with enemies.And I enjoyed all weapons in the game. I think it was a mistake to drop heavy weapons in Black Flag, even though I enjoyed that game as well. I dont have any complaints for Ubisoft. Sometimes they rush their games for release, but in the end, its a game you can spend at least 50 hours easely.The only few features that I didnt like are guard dogs and hunting  does not affect later game and thus makes no sense.
