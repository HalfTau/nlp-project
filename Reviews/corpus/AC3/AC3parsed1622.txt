AC3 is a strong entry into the AC series. It is still Assassins Creed at its core, so dont expect many new mechanics aside from the naval battles and hunting although I didnt find myself doing a lot of hunting outside of the main missions. Desmonds story is good and so is Connor Kenways, but I found neither compelling or anything to write home about. Overall though, its a fun game with a nice aesthetic and, if youre looking for more Assassins Creed, this is the game for you PEnjoy! D
