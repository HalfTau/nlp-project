I choose Recommend, as I have to pick something, but my feelings for this game are very mixed.Pro interesting, detailed plot with some unexpected plot twists visually stunning, huge open world wellprepared historical background a few new features hunting, hiding, naval battlesAgainst Connor is dull and flat prologue part is way too long bad texture quality on smaller objects ex. doors and gravestones too little music trade and strategic aspects have very unclear interface and, basically, could be completely omitted
