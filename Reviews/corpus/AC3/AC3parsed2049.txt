7 out of 10Another installment of the Assasins Creed series.  This one plays out before and during the American Civil war, in Boston, New York and the frontier.  If you dont know, Assasins Creed 3 is a 3rd person action title with stealth elements.The good1. Good controls.  Controls were previous AC games weekest point, especially targeting enemies.  You character mostly does what you want.  Escept when running fast he often grabbed on to buildings and other stuff when you dont want it, this makes a quick getaway infrequent.2. Proper strafing in a 3rd person game.  Well done, other game developers must look how it should be done.3. The developers have done a great job cutting out unnecesary hasle found in previous AC games.  I just wonder about the underground  why?  It had no purpose.4. Learn about the American Civil war.  Something I knew almos nothing about.The bad5. You kill more people than the plague.  You also single handedly wipe out entire species of animals.  Its just too much killing.  I know its Assasins Creed.  But Really this is too much!6. Most part of the game is really repetitve.  Get objectives, kill lots of people, repeat.  The game should have had more emphasis on stealth, not getting caught and offing your enemies in style.  At the end the game is rather bland as a result.7. The environments compare poorly with previous Assasins Creed gamesThe ugly8. Takes way too much time.  Dont try to get all the achievements.  You have better things to do with your time.
