I could write about whats wrong with this game forever, but I wont, because nobody wants that not even me.Heres the deal, you play as Connor, an east coast Native American in colonial times whose home is destroyed by the Templar Order, which you guessed it sets you on a quest to joining the Assassin Brotherhood! Only after becoming the great Assassin you put literal hours of gameplay by this point into becoming, Connor turns into a whiney, brooding child who laments on how Assassins and Templars cant simply work together to protect read control the free world. After playing Assassins Creeds 1, 2, Brotherhood, and Revelations, After building up the Assassin Brotherhood from the brink of destruction, Aftering fighting a shadow war through multiple games to reach this point you have absolutely nothing to show for it, Back to square one , thanks for the cash! Ubisoft. Oh, and Desmond dies at the end after touching a golden testicle or something. Who knows, the final cutscene only lasted about twelve seconds.
