First time I ever tried the AC franchise and I can assure you, itll be the last.only A few things that come to mind the movement mechanism is awful, with every 5 minutes of gameplay comes at least 2 minutes of cinematic nonsense, Uplay this needs no further explanation amirite? and foremost, the game is full of bugs and glitches stockpile anyone?. I personally wouldnt recommend this to anyone, Hell, I wouldnt even let my worst enemy pick this up. Enough Said.
