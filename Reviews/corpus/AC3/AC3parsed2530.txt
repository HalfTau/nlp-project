Picked this baby up for 5 on the holiday sale.Ok a brief review from what I have played so far. On the whole I love the historical representation of the AC series and always been facinated with Americas revolution ERA, Yes it is a fictional reference but on the whole its rather well done.Yet this isnt about history and mostly about the setting and some unique story telling amidst Kenwood following clues from an amulet he took in the beggining of the game. Not goin to go into the story as others already mentioned in their review.Anyway my only gripe is about the combat that has been somewhat staple fo the AC series. I find it right now too much like the Batman Arkham games. Counter  attack, Counter  Attack. Its kind of dull a too easy in a way. The only alleviating thing about it is more of the trying to get full sychronization like not getting detected Silent kills  etc. Ive heard black Flag has better combat though.If youre a completionist like myself that this has plenty to do. Finding all the almanac pages, synchorinzing all the high locals, hunting every creature etc. It does a great job of that.Of course everyone has their personal opinion this game is well done, keeps my attention long enough. I have to say looking forward to delve into Black Flag which I picked up for 10 on the Holiday sale. Pirates!!!! !
