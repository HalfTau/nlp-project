Despite the change of the combat system in Assassins Creed 3, the game overall was a brilliant hit for me. Assassins was really the thing for me. When I played, I experienced. I felt like part of the Assassin Order and Im pretty sure every other player who played AC up to 3 have felt that way. The storyline and locations was amazing, breathtaking and mesmerizing. As you play as a Native American doing his best to protect his people, you will engulf in his revolution and culture. Truly another great title from Ubisoft. 9.8 / 10 D
