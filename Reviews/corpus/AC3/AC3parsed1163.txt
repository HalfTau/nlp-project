Assassins Creed 3 was fun when I first played it on Xbox 360. I enjoyed it and had such fond memories of playing it that I bought it on PC.This was a mistake, because the game is very buggy.If you happen to find it on sale for 5 or less, go for it. The gameplay is fun and the screnery is great in the wilderness, anyway.
