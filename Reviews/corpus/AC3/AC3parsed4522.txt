This definetly gets back to the root of the series, the story is amazing, compelling, and fits perfectly in the storyline. Theres a lot of focus on YOU, rather than the rest of the Brotherhood. And for the first time, you actually get to experience real world action. If you even remotely enjoyed any of the previous games, youll be loving this one for sure.
