A huge dissapointment. The worse entry in the series by far. Buggy, Unresponsive, hard controls and almost impossible to get used to, ed up aiming system, and terrible lip sync. The 2 Ubisoft kings Far cry 3  AC 3 proved the most dissapointing in my head. The dialogue would be much much better if they gave a damn fixed the lip sync because the acting was great and the animations are too damn bad.In general it is just a poor conclusion in the series with a very bad gameplay element and a mediocre storyline extremely boring until you play as the adult connor. Ubisoft you failed me
