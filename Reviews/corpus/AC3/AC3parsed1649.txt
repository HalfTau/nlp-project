The story is insteresting, the game has a lot of interesting stuff BUTbut its not finished, many things are useless in this game, there are many bugs  Sometimes I could not attack ennemies, after dying and respawning, it was working again Sometimes I have no interface regarding enemies attacking ...sometimes you feel like you cant control you character properlyThe worst part of this game is the pursuit of charles lee that makes no sense and you have to die multiple times before understanding where to goIts sad to see this game still unfinished, it could have been a great game otherwise !
