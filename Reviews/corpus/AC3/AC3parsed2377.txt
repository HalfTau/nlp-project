Without giving sploilers, its an AC game which lost its touch.The mechanics work, there is a story, its functional, but it takes way too long for it to evolve and the impact feels weak.Mayor events are rare, but have some interesting executions as in the way they unfold.If you played Revelations and felt a bit lacking, this will feel just like that, but in a different way. But no tower defense, which is good news.Honestly, if you want to experience the AS franchise for the story, you can skip this without feeling bad, but if you are really interested what happens in the game, I suggest a lets play.But the DLC is...okish, nothing spectacular, but it could have been amazing.
