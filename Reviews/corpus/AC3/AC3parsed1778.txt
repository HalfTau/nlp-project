 Hathway is intreasting Gameplay is ok the main story drags on way to long The majority of the game being tutorials Guns are nerfed to the point of insanity Real bad and game breaking design, to name one example early on, if you fail to grab a rifle before a cut scene you will become stuck for a while. Glitches, oh my, so many glitches.
