I just finished the game. I purely and simply love this series... I recommend this to everyone who likes cool badass stories with action, fiction and a little emotion. Stealth is not really necessary but the freeplay in/after the game is gonna add more cream to the game, and I like the cream on cakes, esspecially lemon P....Also native american killing british, flying into haystacks, arguing with everyone about freedom...     11/10  damn... IGNwould freedom again
