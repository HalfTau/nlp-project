The Revolutionary war is some of my favorite times to read about, so when I heard that Ubisoft was going to make an Assassins Creed game in that time frame, I wanted this game badly! But can this new installment to the Assassins Creed games really live up to my hipe?The first time I really played this game I was like, wow, look at these graphics! Assassins Creed 3 has some of the most impressive graphics I have seen! But that does mean this is the best game that Ive played. The game machanics are fine, but they do feel kind of lazy. The game is also far too easy, they give you the option of upgrading you equipment, and making it better, but you can beat the whole game by just using you starting equipment! aside from that, the combat is way to easy also, I could go into a town and just massacre every soldier in the city without dying. Uside from that, you can only kill soldiers, you cant kill towns people, and such. I know killings towns people is kinda morbid But it would of been awesome if they could give you the option to do that if you wanted to, like the other Assassins creed games, you cant even punch them. aside from all the negativity I just said, I did enjoy playing this game, the ocean combat is amazing! And the parcore feature is grately improved.All in all I would give this game a 65/100 because the game in so many areas fails, like story, combat, and not enaugh freedom to do what you want to do. But the game really shines with the naval combat, and parcore features.Well I just gave you my honest review about the game.I hope this review helped you dicide.This is DeathWishDestroyer sighning off.
