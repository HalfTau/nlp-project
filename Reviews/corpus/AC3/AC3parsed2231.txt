Good Pretty visuals and immersive atmosphere The story and characters are interesting Animations, especially in combat TreesBad Doing everything with the E key is worse than the controls for previous games Combat is more interesting to watch than to actually control Hunting feels stale and pointless after a little while Trading at the homestead is even more boring than Mediterranean Defense was in Revelations Freerunning is just as awkward as ever and getting rid of the space key function for making your character run up walls was a mistake There is usually no incentive to be stealthy, as the game discourages it while making running and gunning the dominant strategy The game is somewhat glitchy and I had to reinstall to get past a load screen that always froze upI refuse to ever pay Ubisoft again for another mediocre entry in this series after dealing with so many issues. If you play this one, try your best to stick to the main memories and avoid wasting time on side stuff.
