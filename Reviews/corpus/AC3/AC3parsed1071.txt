If youre like me and what draws you most to the AC series are the historybased narratives, then I see no reason not to get this game. Its a great story and a good chance to brush up on US history, plus it felt like a lot of gameplay elements had been improved. In general, the major fault with the game in my opinion is that if you stray too far from the main storyline, things quickly start to feel dull and pointless. I thoroughly enjoyed this game but almost exclusively for its main quest.Ironically, I feel its partlythe side activities were optional that they were tedious, in the sense that, had they been cleverly included in the story as an more intricate part of gameplay, this could have become something I wanted to do as opposed to something that I decided to dismiss. In Black Flag, for instance, upgrading the ship didnt feel like a choreI wanted to do so because I use the ship all the time for basic travel and exploring.Having to wade through the tunnels to unlock fasttravel in the cities is a pain. And there arent enough fasttravel locations in the massive Frontier region in my opinion where the fact they decided to implement a stamina system for the horses was an added negative, considering. I guess some would argue that travelling through the world is part of the game, but personally I might have been more inclined to take on side quests and explore with the knowledge that this would ultimately help make travelling faster e.g. by having all viewpoints become fasttravel once visited.Taking out autofollow is a baffling decision in my opinionI was really glad to see that appear in ACR as I could now focus on dialogue while walking, shame its gone.The ledger system seems intriguing but ultimately is dismissed as its not engaging enough in the sense its not really worth the trouble e.g. I knew it allowed you to create larger pouches, which I would always buy in previous games, but in this instance I just couldnt be bothered and decided to instead welcome to added challenge of having smaller ammo available.
