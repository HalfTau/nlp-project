The multiplayers better than Revelations but still not as good as Brotherhood. Way too much DLC, and Ive always thought DLC was t, you should have bulk expansions or none at all. The game itself has a decent story, fun missions. The scenery isnt as good as 15th Century Rome, but the treerunning and hunting is an interesting way to kill time when youre bored. Therestons of glitches and spazzing ragdolls that melt into chimneys or rocket into the air and its kinda cheesy that you can kill people by kicking or throwing them into walls, but ropedarts are so amazingly fun and the naval missions are brilliant. Oh, also, they changed the free running mechanic so that anytime you run, you automatically go into free running, and they changed the use button to the counter button, so when I started playing it, I felt more comfortable using my Logitech controller than the keyboard and mouse, which resulted in another interesting bug.  Whenever Id go back to a checkpoint during a mission it would change my left analog stick and the dpad for a few seconds, then automatically switch back after using one or the other for a few seconds.  Which would result in me trying to run, but instead bringing up the weapon wheel.  If Id automatically use the analog stick, Id start running then stop a few seconds later as the game recognized the correct button assignment.  The only way I could find to fix that was to use both the weapon wheel and the dpad at the same time if I ever restarted a mission.  So anyway, if you like the Assassins Creed games at all Id recommend this over Revelations. But Ill admit its not goton Brotherhood.
