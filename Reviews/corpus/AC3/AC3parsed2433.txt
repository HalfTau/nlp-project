The start of the game is incredibly dull. You play as Haytham Kenway whose plot line was so lame, I was tempted to skip every cut scene not that that urge to skip the cut scenes ended with him. Once you finally finish his 3 hours of agony, you begin to play as young Connor and spend the next couple hours in whats basically a drawn out tuitorial. While finishing this sequence, you start to learn how dumb the AI guards are, and how annoying they can become when trying to escape combat. Unlike previous Assassins Creeds, hay stacks and other forms of cover are few and spread apart so you best memorize every corner of the map if you dont want to battle an entire army whenever you try to complete a simple mission. If youre planning on getting this game, forget all the optional objectives, because they only open the door to Call of Duty like frustration as youll find yourself repeating missions over and over, trying to do nearly impossible tasks. Finally, the only way youll actually die in this game in by bugging out, and leaping off buildings to your death.Desynchronizing
