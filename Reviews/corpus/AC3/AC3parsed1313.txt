Go get a offline version instead of buying this, unless it is on sales.The game itself is actualy doing very good, the story is interesting and rich, fighting system is okay, the hunting is a good try but not enough. but UPLAY ruin it all!the archivement is a joke, no matter what you do you cannot earn any upoint from this game, and all the point you had spend for this game will produce nothing. so dont bother to get a real game, get it from , you dont need the omultiplayer anymore, it is dead.the only reason to buy this game is, since you had 1 and 2, dont you want to know what kind of fate is waiting Desmund ? how will the strugle between the Assassin and Tmeplar will end? if you dint play 1 and 2 before, then just fotget it.
