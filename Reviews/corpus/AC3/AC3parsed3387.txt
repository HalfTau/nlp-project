Pros graphics, lots of missions, cool cities and big mapcons bugs sometimes, once youve learned the fighting techniches of each enemy it becomes far too easy can kill 50 people without taking damage, missions arent realistic u have stealth missions where when u get discovered u have to restart but u can kill lots of enemys without getting hurt
