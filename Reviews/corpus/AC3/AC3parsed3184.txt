I say no to this game. I did not even get to play it. This could very well be a great game, but getting the game to actually function is agony. AC3 freezes just about every time you turn around, or so it feels. I have tried the quick fixes and nothing has worked. Dont waste your money on the game because you probably wont even get the chance to play it.
