ACIII, the continuation series of AC.The story of the ancestor is the greatest story of AC series that I have been played. But as the Desmonds story its like a downside, because for me the story about the 1st civilization is quite absurd. And this ACIII character isnt as strong as its predecessor, so it doesnt leave a strong impact for the player as Altair or Ezio.Aside from the story, the game itself presenting a new game mechanic. I think its somewhat good, the battle is become more fluctuative than the previous game, the way you kill the enemy is becoming more realistic as well.But the point that you must taken from the previous game is you dont have to press space to free running, so you should get yourself customized in the way the game played, bcs for the prev game you have to press space. And now pressing space is kinda useless.The game mechanic for obtaining money is different as well. In this game you play as Ratonhaketon Connor who got the vision from the 1st civ to join the brotherhood, as the brotherhood is starting to wither in America. So you settle in some land and can invite new homestead to join in your land. As time goes by, every homestead serve many item that you can trade or create from receipt.So the way to obtaining the money is to TRADE.You can also hunt, because Connor is a native Indian, so you can hunt wild animal to collect for its meat, fur, etc.There is also side quest for sailing and battle on water, its quite fun actually, as its a start for AC IV. Other side quest is rather boring, because you just have to kill thisthat, infiltrate, and deliver. The good side quest in this game is homestead mission, as it have a story on its own, ship quest as its fun, and the liberation.Well, as a fan of the AC franchise I would recommend this to anyone that like the AC series. As for other people who want to play AC, maybe you should play the previous version, bcs the story is really continuation from the previous.
