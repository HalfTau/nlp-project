The most annoying flaw is it needs to be on the C drive to work. Portable hard drives  the whole game up.I gotta admit I liked this game a fair amount... Theres nothing special or unique about it but it did feel comfortable and manageable. The most annoying feature being that elevated view points dont reveal all the objectives so you can lose an hour running around looking for extras which sucks. The main storyline was enjoyable though. If your expecting the free running seen in AC2 though you will hate this. Running on rooftops is a 100 complete waste of time and getting anywhere usually involves running on the ground.
