Dumb, Dumb, Dumb, Only get on severe discount. I find it lacking in many respects, such as the main character, the lack of climbing puzzle mechanics, the tackedon hunting and furniture making/trading mechanics, and everything just sort of loses focus on what made the series great.The sailing stuff was ok, but if you want more of that, AC4 is clearly a better game, and more into that.I will say, in the games defense, that it does the unthinkable and actually moves the glacial presentday desmond plotline that had been stagnating for the past two games. The present day missions are also a breath of fresh air.Recommended price 1520 or lower, dependant on personal finanial status and existing steam backlog.
