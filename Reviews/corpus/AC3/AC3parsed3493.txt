My first handson experience with the Assassins Creed franchise. I was pleasantly surprised. Its a very visually and graphically appealing game and it runs extremely smooth. The combat mechanics are very fluid and numerous, which creates a very fun experience and many different playstyles. Running/Wallclimbing can be clunky at times, but it mostly works out.The biggest drawback of this game is the story. Its very confusing and the ending is underwhelming and disappointing. However, the historical period is interesting and extremely well integrated. The cities, people, nature and overall feeling of the game are convincing and skillfully made. Most sidemissions are great, but many feel repetitive. The DLC expansions are all worth the time and price and deliver a new experience.The best part of this game has to be the naval combat. Its super fun and easy to understand  Its very understandable that the sequel to this game is focused around this. Assassins Creed III has made me a fan of the franchise and I will definetely be playing the rest of the franchise after this experience.
