Gotta say, this is the one bad game Ive ever played by Ubisoft. It seems like they decided to get rid of all the parts of Assassins Creed that I enjoy, what with a confusing fast travel system, a terrible port for pc and an obvious lack of effort into the weapons and mission hubs. There are no side quests, there are very limited weapons, the missions are repetitive and boring, and Connor himself isnt very likeable. No character development whatsoever, Connor is supposed to be a calm, patient person who doesnt like to kill. But his brutal combat skills contradict that fact. Also, Ubisoft advertised the game as centered around Connor as an assassin. Not until sequence 4 do you actually get to play as Connor, and you have to wait another sequence until he is an actual assassin. Altogether a disappointment to the AC series, although I believe they made up for it with Black Flag, which is the best AC game in my opinion.
