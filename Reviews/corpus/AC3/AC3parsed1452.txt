Plot 3/5 the nonAnimus plot is necessary for the continuation of Desmonds story. The Animus plot was not surprising we know how the American Revolution ended up but there were some interesting twists and good characters.Mechanics 2/5  a lot of annoying bugs, invisible walls and corners. When riding a horse, stay far away from objects and walls.Naval 5/5  The naval combat and missions are literally the best part of this game, and the sole reason that AC4 features naval combat. Absolutely amazingly fun.World 3/5  The world is serviceable but doesnt feel as special as previous AC games. The fast travel station unlocks are ... annoying.
