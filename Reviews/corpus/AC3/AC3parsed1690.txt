Before this, the only AC creed game I had ever played and finished was the first game of the franchise, Assassins Creed. It was the most BORING GAMING EXPERIENCE EVER. It was along with Far Cry 2 the most repetitive, gameplaywise, experiences I ve had in my life. It was a torture to find the strength to make it through the end! All that is changed radically in Assassins Creed III. I ve heard it was already much improved in AC 2. The missions have a much bigger variety now. The historical setting is interesting for me because I ve never played a game about the American Revolution before, although I have to admit the Holy Lands setting is much more mysterious. There is also a lot of American history you can learn through the Animus database, which is good for whoever is interested. The graphics are atmospheric and adequate for the games age, and the game is well optimized, I play on a Core2Duo E6850 nonOC with a GTX 560ti with everything on max except AA 1920x1200 and the game runs perfectly and fluidly, without having crashed once for more than 60 hours that I ve played it I ve only experienced a few ingame bugs  missions that wouldnt trigger/show on map, that I fixed by quitting the game and restarting. The behaviour of both steam AND Uplay, which gets so much hate, has been perfect so far. I dont understand why people have problems with it. I have basic, run of the mill adsl connection and everything is great, no problems whatsoever with the account I created , or with anything else. The only cons I can think about are that some of the climbing mechanics are still frustrating, and that maybe it will get a bit repetitive if you play it for TOOOO long, and you want to collect everything/complete all the optional stuff although they put so much content in the game, its hard to not appreciate the effort! Naval battles are my favorite!
