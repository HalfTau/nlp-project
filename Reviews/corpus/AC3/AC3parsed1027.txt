Assassins Creed III gets forgotten very easily being precursor to Black Flag which set the world on fire, but I personally prefer this one. In my previous reviews of Assassins Creed games I suggested that some of the series main now underused strengths were its eraspecific attention to detail and its slightly liberal historical accuracies. I feel like the makers of this game took a lot of care to acurately depict Colonial America, more so than any other game I can think of and as a lover of history, I was loving that. Playing a key role in the Boston TeaParty was thrilling, despite being British myself and committing absolute sacrilege by wasting tea.I liked Connor too, the main character, kid was brutal as . Plus we meet Haytham Kenway for the first time, one of the more interesting and divisive characters in Assassins Creed lore. Although the game is overlong and can be tedious, its a real contender for my favourite AC game. The seabattles were underdevoloped but ambitious nonetheless, the voice acting is second to none and it really is a blockbuster experience in gaming, despite being slightly underwhelming.If youre interested in accurate but loose depictions of history, this is a truly thrilling hit.
