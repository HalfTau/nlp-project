I loved Assassins Creed II, a title I was very skeptical about until I picked it up on sale. Ezio was a fun and interesting character to play, and so was his game.Conversely, Connor seems filled with hate. And I hate his game too. The controls have been simplified from previous titles, so youll be hitting the same button to pick up a gun, parry, or pat a random dog that wanders past just what you need in a fight scene.

In either case, YouTube has you covered better.
