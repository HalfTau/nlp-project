Sadly, i am not able to judge the Game in its full extend, because i didnt have a Chance to play all of it.Basically, it could possibly be an amazing game. But then there are bugs and glitches.Starting from missing/not loaded textures that can cause carriages to be invisible, over very, very werid behavior of humans and horses all the way to the reason why i am not able to play any more of it after a certain mission, the game always resets my progress to exactly that mission when i launch the game. But that is not all. I got stuck many times in places where it should be completely impossible to collide with anything at all. And there were loads of other bugs and glitches. Some of them were actually really funny, for example a bug, where horses go flying when they interact with fences in certain ways. That is very entertaining.Alas, i can not really judge the content of the game. It might very well be pretty good.But due to bugs and glitches i sadly cannot recommend it.The Soundtrack and presentation is pretty great though.
