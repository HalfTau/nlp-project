The main problem with this game is Uplay, it is a pain in theto play games with. Honestly I am never gonna buy a Ubisoft game for PC again if I have to deal with that.If you get past Uplay the game itself is okay but there are so many bugs with blood, guns, facial features etc. But if you have played an Assassins Creed game before than you should be used to this already.
