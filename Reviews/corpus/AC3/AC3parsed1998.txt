Many people complain about the bugs in this game and sadly most of what people complain about is true Invisible walls, character getting stuck in little edges, crashes..... But I must say I really liked what they did with this game, the character actually feels to have a motivation and an objective which helps the story although if I had to complain about something Id say that the pass of the years is barely noticeable and when you get to end of the game is like.. meh... Cool this is that you get to play as Desmond in the present and do a few missions with him.For the online part, I mostly play wolfpack and whenever I get tired of it I go into the normal wanted mode. I think wolfpack is the best addition that this game added to the online too bad they dont have it in AC4
