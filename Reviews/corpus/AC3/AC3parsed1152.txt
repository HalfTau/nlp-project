I am very unsure about this one. For the first time I did not like the the main protagonist as much as I liked the villian. He was smarter, honorable, gentle and apparently more skilled than I was.Playing only through this sotry I surely understand the background of revolutionary america. But that story is more of a sidequest which interferes with your actual goal, of course, to kill all templars.The missions are very repetitive and I didnt bother recruiting all assassins or liberate all city parts. That was not really my concern, although the recruitments were well made. Each character had its own problem you have to solve first. To bad it lacks the story here.The best parts for me were the ship battles and the reallife parts with Desmond. Those were the one thing that kept me playing. Even with the stiff controls and the frustrating climbing I experienced with my XBox One controller.Still I do recommend it, but for me it certainly was one of the weaker AC games.Completion time 22 hours.
