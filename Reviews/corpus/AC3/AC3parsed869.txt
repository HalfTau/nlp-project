I hate this game so much.. absolute ST.. I loved the previous games, they were amazing af..Although the game has good story, it doesnt have great characters. Connor is okay, not really memorable.The most frustrating things are the graphics and gameplay, thats pretty much the whole game. I have a good Gfx card, but this game fails to give me even 40fps on the lowest setting. Ive tried so many things to fix it, but in vain. Sometimes frames drop below 20 and its such a pain in the a.Gameplay is also disappointing. Combat is very slow and stealth is horrible. During missions when Iam moving through bushes, he just stands up for no fing reason.And it also keeps crashing. The last game crash is what made me write this reivew. If I dont like a game i just ignore it, dont write a review for it, but this one is special.I havent finished the game yet and I dont know if I even want to.
