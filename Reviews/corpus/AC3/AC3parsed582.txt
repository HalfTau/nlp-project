I have finished the game 3 times and i thought to make a review.The game has great graphics even though it was released in 2012The story is great and you will immerse into it fastYou have a great open world to explore and hunt into the woodsPET ANIMALS!!!the only con I can think is that it takes you a lot of time until you get to the main main story8/10
