Assassins Creed III is very, very bad successor to the second parts... Although, I did not recommend Assassins Creed Revelations you can see in my review why, I was pretty much impressed with its gameplay and Ezio as a fantastic character that he was in whole trilogy...On the other hand, Assassins Creed III is bland, it has confusing storyline, irritating main character I preferred Haytham 10 times more xD, idiotic conversations, even worse storyline in 2012 events although I never much cared about those in Assassins Creed series,  plot details... It is a complete miss writingwise... It feels like Ubisoft hired 10 year olds to write story and conversations and general feelings of characters... I was just completely pushed away by all of it during my gameplay...As for the gameplay itself it is pretty much what Assassins Creed is and was... Nice feel and easy combat, a lot of climbing and jumping and exploring a world... Nice addition that, as I heard is perfected in Black Flag is naval combat that feels nice and interesting... And new, in a game that definitely needed something new...Short versionPros Assassins Creed, as it is... If you like it that way  Naval CombatCons Confusing storyline Irritating main character Very bad conversations Even worse plot detail fails...If you generally like Assassins Creed like I do, you should play it... Just to wrap up everything... If you dont like Assassins Creed this is definitely not the one that will make you like it. So, its a Thumbs horizontal from me, but a little bit more to the down, because I just didnt enjoy it, although I like the series...
