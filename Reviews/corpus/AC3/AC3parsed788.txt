This game was ok.I definantly enjoyed it, it has some awesome combat, stealth, a mildly interesting story, hunting, parkour, and locations to explore. But it also has its downsides, it has poor optimization for pc, bugs, you have to play 5 sequences in to finally get to connor and even longer to get the suit, and Connor has all the personality of a wet cardboard box.Overall it was a decent game, but I would wait to buy it on sale.
