i probably would like this game, but with my current rig i cant run it at 60fps, when i get to boston it drops frames massively, i can run black flag and rogue at max 60 fps np, i run unity with everything ultra except AA and the nvidea HBAO, i run it on SSAO and i get like 70 fps, why this game runs so bad i dont know, i would like to play it, but for me its unplayable, i would like to get into the story though, since the game has connor witch is on of Haythan and grandson of Edward, 2 awesome characters!Edit ive changed my statement, im now an owner of a GTX 1080 and this was one of the first games ive tried to play, for what ive played, i like it so far.
