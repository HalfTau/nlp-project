I know Im way late to this one, but I still think Assassin Creed III is relevant enough for a review in 2017. The game is alright. Its the first Assassins Creed game Ive played, and its really subpar to par at best. The main character, Conner, is the typical boring, quiet, and borderline EDGY teenager with daddy issues. The only difference is that hes an assassin, duh. The game is pretty good for something that came out in 2012. The story is alright. To be honest Im more interested in Conners dad the main antagonist. Which actually got me questioning just how evil the Templars really are. I know that some their actions are pretty , but Im sure the assassins do just as  thing also. I think the fued in general is pretty confusing, but then again its only the 5th game in a series that doesnt really focus on the whole Templars v. Assassins and rather on the assassin you are playing, which is understandable. Im inbetween on this one. Ill just say this, if you want to play it, go ahead. If you dont, thats fine, youre really not missing out on much.
