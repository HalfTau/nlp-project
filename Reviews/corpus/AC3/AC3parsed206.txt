3 Words 1 AMERICA, 2 ,  3 YEAH But if Im gonna be real I do recommend this game Ive been a real big fan of AC for years and I know people like to hate on this game but I love it. I love the story and the setting, I love American history and I love studying it, having the game set in The Colonies and the story of helping the Colonists rebel against the British is amazing, meeting figures of the war is done well and the new mechanics of the games engine is a big improvement in my opinion but I definitely recommend thus game to you if you love this series.
