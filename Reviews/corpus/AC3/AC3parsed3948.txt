After getting bored with both part 1 and 2 I didnt have high hopes for this one.  Finally gave in and picked it up, and about 20 ish ours later I found myself completing my first assassins creed game.  Go figure, I loved it.  The setting probably had a lot to do with it, but I could just not get into the italian / middle eastern themes of the previous games.  Might have to actually look into getting assassince creed 4 now before it hits bargain bin prices.  If its as good as this one / better Ill be in for a treat.  Check this one out even if the first 2 didnt do it for you, maybe more so if that was the case.
