Nope. If you are specifically trying to play the AC games in order so as to follow Desmonds plot, then by all means play this game but when considered in terms of whether this game is actually worth your time as a game, independent of its significance to a plotline youre following? Dont bother.The game has pretty graphics, and animals and hunting, and all sorts of things that are all well and good, but ultimately feels like a rather lazy attempt at an AC game. For ease of reading, heres a list of my complaints thus farControl of your character has been paired down to 2 buttons, leaving most situations feeling either too simple or too constraining.Combat controls are less fluid than previous games in part as a consequence of only using 2 buttonsMuch of the wholly new content feels gimmicky or halfcomplete, with the exception of the naval stuff. The naval stuff still suffers from some of the other problems, but its definitely fun and new content.Totally phonedin voice actingTerribly written glaring plot holes, and confusing or poorly justified character motivesbizarrely obvious tropes like playing through a mixtape of overused scenes from supergeneric movies.1 dimensional protagonist looking at other reviews, this persists throughout the gameMain character assumes an Irish name rooted in a celtic word so that he may more easily pass as an Italian or Spaniard... seriously, this is the reason given. I currently have 16.8 hrs on record. Despite my no review, I do intend to finish this game. If at any point I feel this review needs revision, or my opinion of the game has changed I will do so immediately, but unfortunately I suspect this will wind up being my final verdict.
