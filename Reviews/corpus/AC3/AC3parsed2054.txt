I had to change my review after I downloaded some driver updates because my GPU had issues with this game alot. I couldnt even start the game for an odd reason!The framerate issues are mostly fixed but be sure your PC passes the recommended requirements to run this game. AC III requires alot but it sure is a beautiful game.I dont want to spoil the plot of the game but youll play as native american called Connor and his father Haytham. The game starts in London in the year 1754 and expands to 1781. The game lets you know about the American revolution and how the brits lost the war against revolutionaries.I actually did learn more history than sitting in a history class.Stunning visuals, cutscenes, good gameplay and the DLC is reasonable. Its a good buy for AC fans, but alot of people hate this game for no apparent reason. I simply loved it.Its not good as AC II but its great. It isnt repetitive as the first Assassins Creed
