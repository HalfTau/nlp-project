assassins creed 3 is a good game by a lot of meansyou are set in the american revolutioncombat is more fluid and faster paced than evermakes you question your moralsboatskilling britsmuch more weapon diversity no longer just swordsHowever in with the previously set standards of the previous 2 games its....well a dissapointmentyou start as Hathem Kenway who is actually a good character who is brutal and yet fair and politebut after a bit of time you are switched to his son who im not even going to try and spell which is a running joke in the game who is renamed connor. he is... well not a good characterlook at ezio he is funny, charismatic, just and somewhat smart who mentally changes over time. Not enough to drastically change his originall character but enough to notice that he has grown upnow compare that to conner who is ignorant, gullible and never really think things through and even at the end of the game he has not changed one bit.One thing that i have to give the game credit for is that it actually atleast in my opinion is the only major AC game to give character to the templars. They are no longer just evil people who want nothing but the world under their boots, in ac 3 not all of them a all that bad. some are purely evil s, some are s but are actually doing good and noble things and some are just plain good. Now thats great and all but its ruined because connor only looks at the phrase templar and gets triggered to the point where he will just outright kill them. Nearly every major character tells him that his ways are bad and that he is being foolish to which connor would just respond to that as if they said good job now go kill more templars also keep up that brooting attitudeanyways i would only suggest the game during a steam sale or if you really like asassins creed gameplay
