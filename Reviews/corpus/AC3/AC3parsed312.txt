Three out of five stars. The AC franchise takes an annoying amount of pride in their story telling. To be fair though, theyve gotten frighteningly good at it. There are moments in this game that I will never forget. On top of that the music goes above and beyond, the art is a gem, and the mechanics... Well thats were the problems begin. The engine is all but broken. To play this game for extended periods of time is to suffer. You will liekly go through all five stages of grief through the course of playing sections of this game. Still, when the mechanics work theyre really, really fun. The preachy tone of the franchise is back from the vacation it took in the last title and WOW. In their attempt to make the stroys backdrop deep and contrversial there are some outright lies told and, frankly, thats inexcusable. The high notes are so worth the bad moments. Just be ready for a lot of bad.
