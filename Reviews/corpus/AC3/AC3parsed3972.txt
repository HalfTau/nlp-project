I waited for a while to finally get this game and I have to say I am thoroughly dissapointed. The game is simply terribly optimized for PC. I may not have a really high end PC but I am able to play most modern games at medium to high setting very smoothly. This game however chugs like a , especially in towns. A look online showed nearly everyone has the same issue. Apparently the code does not properly utilize multicore processors.Gameplay is fine, as expcted, but having to play on minimum just to have mediocre performance is unacceptable.And Ubisoft has the balls to  about PC piracy.
