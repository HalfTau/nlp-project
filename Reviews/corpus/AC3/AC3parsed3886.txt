The worst AC game to have came out to date.Lets just have a recap. Assassins creed 1 for its time, amazing combat and movement system, beutiful landscape, interesting sorty to start off the franchise. Assassins creed 2 Took what was good about AC1 but refined it, even more beutiful landscape.Assassins creed 3 Dull and repetative landscape, a story which just didnt fit a freedom fighting assassin? WTF, and the whole inclution of guns just didnt work.There you go, the main reasons why assassins creed 3 will stay at the bottom of my list for assassins creed.
