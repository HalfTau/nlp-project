AC3 holds your hand for the first few hours, not letting you do anything besides the set mission, which gives the game a slow start. When it finally opens up and lets you do what you want, AC3 gets really fun. You have your own district that you can upgrade and develop by doing side missions so that you can generate mo money and get a few minor upgrades. You also have your own mothering ship that you can upgrade and go on naval or treasure hunting missions with. These missions were my favourite in the game, so Im sure Ill have a blast playing AC4  Black Flag.The setting in the American Revolution was pretty interesting and the story has its moments. AC4 makes learning history FUN! Also, Connor is a freaking beast when youre surrounded by 20 red coats and you go, no sweat. You parry a bayonet stab and push it into another dude, and then you axe that first guy in the face, followed immediately by rolling over to third guy and smashing him! Red coats be like good heavens! AC3 is a solid entry into the series.
