The AC franchise was always overvalued and AC3 is a good example why.Despite being quite gorgeous visually, the whole experience is laid out on a linear path before you and the free roam activities are repetetive and generally not fun enough. The main storyline is rather fun, though.As an example, I give the process finding underground entrances around Boston. You have to lurk beneath the city and find the stations so they can be added to your fast travel list. The only challenge in finding them is following clues on every crossroad of which there are exactly three types  light a torch, follow rats or switch on eagle eye mode and then solve a few easy puzzles again, about three types for some 10ish stations.Combat is relatively simple, similar to the one in Batman Arkham series somewhat. It is rhytmical, and sometimes quite a bit of fun. Other times, it is frustrating. Overall, the Batman franchise pulled it off way better.One of the large parts of the game is stealth sequences and these are the ones I hated most.Partly because of cranky controls which never seem to understand what you want to do and there is no real way of telling them since they are largely  contextsensitive, so if you stand near something at just the wrong angle, you will perform the wrong action.The second bad thing about these is that they give you very little information about your surroundings. In the best stealth actions take Mark of the Ninja for example, you are always informed when you are doing something wrong and given hints on how to do it right, but here, I usually find out I messed up by simply failing the mission at hand. There is no visible path to do things right and sometimes, you have to rely plainly on luck.Overall, if you add together the gorgeous visuals, quite interesting story, mildly amusing action sequences and plain bad stealth sequences mostly due to the infuriating contextsensitive controls and lack of information you get a game that is largely not worth your money.
