ACIII was a bit of a dissapointment to me, the game started real slow, boring and frustrating, felt like I was a farmer instead of an assassin. Half way through the game it became more interesting. Desmonds ending was pretty shocking, cant say the same about the historical part. The port itself is not well done, theres FPS drops everywhere, good graphics but bad port. Still consider Ezios games much better in every aspect.
