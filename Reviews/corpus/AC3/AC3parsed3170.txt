1 The game does not have bugs  it has cockroach infestation. Im not even sure if this game ever entered quality assurance2 Level design is horrible. I dont know what happened after Brotherhood. It looks like they havent used the same group of developers as in Brotherhood, but instead gave AC3 to junior developers and trainees3 Prepare to go from point A to point B A LOT during missions. Most of the spawn points are literaly kilometers away from your mission objective4 Crafting and trading systems are confusing and horribly implemented5 Forget about stealth6 Too many cutsceenes  both the ones you can skip and the ones you can notIts basically enough to say that they just HAD to implement a game of Checkers as a minigame to be able to avoid a complete flop that AC3 is. I wanted to buy the Black Flag after completing this one, but Im not sure that I will get a finished product or something like AC3.Seriously not recommended.Edit I bought AC Black Flag and will try to forget AC3 as soon as I can. Black Flag is just the AC we all love and more. Avoid AC3 unless you are really a hardcore AC fan.
