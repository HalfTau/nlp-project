If you manage to get through the infuriating, handholding, insulting, cutsceneridden, patronizing, dull, barely interactive 6 hour long prologue/tutorial, you will find an ok game with some new cool places to visit and full of collectables and sidequests. Its also nice to have a change of scenery from the medieval and renaissance settings of the previous games.AssCreed 2 and Brotherhood are probably better games but this one wins on scope and size. Also, it doesnt hurt that it looks good.Multiplayer is surprisingly fun.
