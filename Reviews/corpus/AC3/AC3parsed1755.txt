This time around the game is set during the American Revolution and you play as a native Connor who decides to go on a path of being and assassin.As always you are opposed to templars but this time with a bit of personal twists for the main character, while Desmond seeks out the clues to find what he needs in order to stop the upcoming apocalypse.Its quite simple and straight forward story, however it does offer some really good characters of interesting personalities. Key being Connor and his father Haytham and even Achillies, who is Connors mentor with a bit of a mysterious background. Along with some obvious appearances of historical figures of course.The writing works, though it couldve been much better in order to really make you connected and sympathetic with what happens during the storyline and to give these characters proper justice.Connors ending is alright while Desmonds is just a bad conclusion to his story and the build up of the past games.Where the game truely shines is the gameplay, it has been greatly improved compared to previous titles. The movement of character and parkour is better than ever! Now with an addition of tree climbing mechanic you can climb and traverse trees from one to another. Making exploration a bit different and more enjoyable!Other noteworthy mechanics are tracking and hunting of animals, which is interesting in the beginning but later on i just found myself ignoring it most of the time. Its just not worth your time and effort...The most significant is the addition of naval combat, and needless to say it is amazing! They are separated into their own missions from the classic gameplay and are quite short, but regardless its still the best you can experience in gaming atm!Graphics have been upped a notch too, the game looks beautiful. However it does have some optimization issues and really bad foliage/popin issues.But overall its a great experience with some minor flaws.
