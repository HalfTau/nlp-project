A good game and story ruined by poor controls and glitches glore. Its worth playing through for the story but not a lot else. Also dont waste your money on the DLC as Ubisoft do not appear to want to let you play it. For the several weeks it took me to complete the game, all i get when i attempt to download the DLC is Selected Ubisoft servers could not be found. This seems to be a common problem when cosulting internet forums.
