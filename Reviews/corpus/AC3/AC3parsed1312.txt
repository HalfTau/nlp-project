Connor the assassin annoys me. Hes impatient and angry. Instead of trying to assassinate people, he just charges at them like a psychopath.Its a beautiful game, but a number of glitches and poorer story compared to AC2 and Brotherhood make this game poor in my opinion.It was great fun at times too though.6/10
