A very very fun AC game, only shortly behind AC4 but that is not me knocking this game. This one was very enjoyable for me as a history buff and a AC fan. Some think this game was not as great as it should have been but I found myself enjoying almost all of it settlement missions were odd but god when you put 2 and 2 together at the end its a tear jerker.
