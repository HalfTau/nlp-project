I like Assassins Creed, its a bit of a guilty pleasure for me.Unfortunately, this game has many of the bad aspects of Assassins Creed and few of the good ones.Climbing around historic landmarks is basically not there, since sorry Americans 18th century Boston simply is not as impressive a setting as Rome or Jerusalem. The main character has a pretty bland and unengaging personality and while the story of the American Revolution is pretty interesting for someone who is not very familiar with it, the realworld story is absolutely groanworthy.The gameplay is as you would expect it, the combat has been expanded a bit with new enemy types which makes it slightly more challenging than in the previous games. There are a lot of new activities like hunting, crafting and trading, but they all get old really quickly and only serve to pad the game length. Also, the game takes forever to get going and has tons of terrible tutorial missions the ultimate low point is when you have to play hideandseek with some children. A good addition are the ship missions, which are really fun in the beginning, but drag out towards the end, since there is not enough depth to the ship combat.A note about the DLC/Season Pass Its quite fun, as it gives you crazy animal superpowers that you have to use to fight an insane George Washington, but its not worth the price increase from the standard version.Overall, I would not recommend this game. Its not worth spending a ton of time exploring the open world believe me, Ive done it, but the story is also not engaging enough on its own.
