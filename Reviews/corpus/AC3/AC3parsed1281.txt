I enjoyed the first and second AC installments including Brotherhood and Revelations. Unfortunately, when I got around to playing AC3, apparently my version of UPlay was outdated not that it told me so  I had to uninstall and find it online to reinstall, only to notice it looked completely different. Now that thats fixed, and Ive reinstalled the game just to clear that possible issue out, it still wont run.Well, to clarify, the Single Player wont run. I have no interest in MP for this game, and would be surprised if anyone still plays it this many years later, but it seems to at least open, which is more than I can say for SP. I never liked UPlay being required for a Steam purchase, but the first games were good enough that I overlooked it and bought the third main installment anyway. But UPlay causes nothing but problems. Steams DRM is deemed adequate by nearly every other developer who sells their games on Steam, Ubisoft. Get your heads out of your anuses and realize that this is why people arent willing to pay for your games. Its not because pirated games are free  its because they work, and typically have better product support...
