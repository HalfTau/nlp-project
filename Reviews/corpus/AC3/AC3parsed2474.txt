Yeah, I KNOW... he is not Ezzio. Still, despite Connors lack of charisma I like this game.It keeps many of the good things and brings several new ones on the table, not all of them likelly to stay, iePROS New freestyle moves. I love climbing trees. Use of guns is well balanced could do more damage though Recruits are no longer anonymus people, you can relate more to them. Desmond missions are fun and a breath of fresh air. Naval battles. Weather and pets are a nice addition altough mostly a visual one.CONS Hunting gets boring soon and unrewarding. Developing the Homestead is fun, but crafting and trading is not really usefull. The story is not by far as solid and interesting as Ezzios. Characters are a bit plain and dull. Most side quests Assassinations, letters, Frontiermen, Forts are just things to do for no reason at all. Animation is sometimes not very polished and buggy.CONCLUSIONI really LOVED AC2 and Brotherhood. I spent hours just watching the cities and landmarks, enjoying the cutscenes like a movie. AC3 had some big shoes to fill and I liked it anyway.
