this game would probably get a good review from me IF I COULD ACTUALLY START THE GAME. I have played almost all of the AC franchise and i enjoyed them very much and i was looking forward to play this game but i cant even start it like WTF I wasted 30.00 on it when i could have bought a much better game that would actually start. Point is if you are planning to buy this game dont be suprised if it does not work, and steam fix this crap plz.
