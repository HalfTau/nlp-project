I can say that this is one of my favourite game. The hunting stuffs, heartbreaking story, and the most awesome stuff, its combat styles. I love its character development. Sadly, the game seems to be incomplete. So many things were removed from the first look of the gameplay. Its hard to get some cheddars money, but I think Ubisoft tried to change the economic system, because in the previous AC series, its very easy to get some money, and become a millionaire just in seconds. Although, its still fun to play it, even if there are less soundtracks than the previous AC series.
