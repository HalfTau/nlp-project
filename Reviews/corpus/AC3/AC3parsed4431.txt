Superb. A complete change for the series. A good few twists in the plot too. Very similar to Red Dead Redemption in the fact you can hunt wild animals and skin them for items to sell. Combat is vastly improved also. Best played with a controller as Ubisoft didnt invest much time or effort in configuring mouse and keyboard support. Graphicly stunning and a campaign length of about 20hrs 40 if you actually spend time in the environment 8/10
