Assassins Creed III is definitly my all time favourite Assassins Creed. Some people may beg to differ but this is my opinion so shhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I love the story and the characters. From Haythems super rich english accent, to Connors famous what would you have me do? this game is just awesome. There were some minor problems Jumps in wrong direction but all Assassins Creed games have this problem Especially AC 2. Assassins Creed IV  has basically the same game mechanics as this one but is way more feshed out. The reason I like AC III more though is because AC IV has so much to do that I felt overwhelmed probably spelt wrong but I dont care even though I just wrote this to say that. Pick up AC III if you wish, or dont. Its your choice BRUH.
