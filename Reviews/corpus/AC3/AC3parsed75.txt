Assassins Creed III is a bit of a letdown after the Assassins Creed 2 Ezio trilogy of games, but its still an enjoyable trip through a different time period and location.  The story is less engaging, the secondary quests feel like an afterthought, and the freerunning is less intuitive/buggier, but the combat and tools are marginally improved.  You play through essentially an 8 hour tutorial before getting to the bulk of the game.  Overall, I spent around 30 hours on the preDLC content, completing most of the secondary quests but few of the collection quests.The assassin brotherhood sort of feature returns and naval combat is an option.  However, none of the secondary quests feel rewarding.  In most cases, a new outfit is unlocked after spending a few hours collecting items.  Theres also a few trading systems, but they werent very well introduced and I didnt see any need for collecting the currency anyways.  I encountered a number of awkward jumps/falls and one situation where I got stuck inside of a rock feature.  But I didnt experience any crashes.While the overall review tone isnt very promising, Id still recommend the game if you enjoyed the other AC games.  Definitely on sale though.  The DLC content is probably not worth it spend some time to review what it offers before commiting to the fairly expensive Deluxe Edition.
