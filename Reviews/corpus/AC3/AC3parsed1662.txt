This game gets way too much flack for no goddamn reason AND IM SICK OF IT. Oh the protagonist is so bland and silent... hes supposed to be you buffoon, yea because an orphaned Mohawk warrior whose land and people are getting ed up by the dreaded white man of ye days yonder is just going to be the cream of the crop football captain Rico Suave, of course. Oh I dont like the freerunning wells shucks,  off. There is only one single bad thing about this game and that is that it is too damn easy in combat, which is the fatal flaw of the Anvilnext Engine they used. The engine itself is brilliant but in combat it just makes slaughtering the white man by the thousands a relaxing pastime that takes minimal attention. The combat is simply too autonomous and easy and what Ubisoft should have done was compensated for this by stacking the player against insurmountable hordes of enemies that would befall even the most skilled of button pressers. Look, if you like Assassins Creed, get it. Its good.
