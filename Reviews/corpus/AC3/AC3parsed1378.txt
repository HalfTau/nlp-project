fun game grabed it on sale for 5, enjoyed hunting wish theyd have dont more with it tha just gathering quests, parkour in trees was cool, dunno if id buy it for 20 but if you see it on sale snatch it up,   thing to not AC 4 is better optimized than AC3 its not terribly optimized but not good at all.
