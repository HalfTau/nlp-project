AC3 is a long game, composed of a series of detached, meandering plot points and stocked with flat, unlikable characters. Classic AC gameplay freerunning / open world / combat is crowded out by minigames that range from the boring to the aggravating and many of the freerunning missions are essentially on rails, reducing the whole thing to a series of quicktime events. Collectables abound, but the payoff is slim and the majority of them only exist to feed an utterly pointless economybased grinding system.Even at under 10 I felt robbed. This one is for completists only  catch up on the story on wikipedia or something and save yourself the trouble.
