Fantastic, beautiful and amazing story.Everything about this game is just amazing. Jumping from building to building. Free Running all over the place. Hunting Animals. Killing Redcoats. Its just fantastic. The only downside of the game is having to install stupid Uplay. Another problem I ran into was that alot of the cutscene audio was out of sync. Other then those 2 negatives. The game is amazing.9/10D
