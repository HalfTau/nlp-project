You should be familiar with the series by now...Compared the others its size is amazing. The new weapons are both fun and cool looking. However, the massive size and lack? of fast travel leaves you spending half the game time just getting around. Story? It fills in some blanks, brings things up to date, but leaves a even bigger than usual cliffhanger. Its good, an amazing game and series in general, but i thought the others were better.darkThis is my review but in games the best way to find out if you like it is to try it.
