Im going to start off by saying Im an Assassins Creed fan. Ive beaten every single one at least twice up until 3. The reason behind this is the character in 3 is not even remotely interesting. Hes a mute with no attitude or genuine feeling behind what he does. He allows himself to be used like a puppet for everyone with an even remotely pixy fairy and rainbows situation. That is to say this is the first ACSeries game that storyline and character wise are just a complete and utter screw up. The combat is great, But when you take into account the 20ish hour storyline And thats if you skip ALOT of stuff is near unbearable.Thankfully Assassins Creed 4 looks like its going to correct the screw up of AC3 by out shining even AC1. Would highly recommend skipping AC3. Its just a waste of your time. Youd be better off catching the cut scenes online and hoping into AC4.
