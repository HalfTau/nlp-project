The worst game of the Assassins Creed Series. Its like the Arkham Orgins of the Batman Series. It starts out good but gets worse, the combat is very simple borderline button mashing, and the main protagnist Conner is not interesting at all he has a montone voice most of the time and the only other emotion he shows is anger. The story is very unintersting after Haythams part, arguably its boring from the start. Its open world game but the it might as well not be one, it is boring except the brawiling side quests, and that lasts for like 5 hours max. Overall this game is an injustice to the Assassins Creed series. Ubisoft is just milking this series at this point.
