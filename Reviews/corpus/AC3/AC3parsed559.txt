One of the oddest Assassin Creeds Ive ever played. Ubisoft did something strange with this title, and it always played different for me compared to Assassins Creed 2, 4 or any of the others. I suppose I should say it felt more personal and depressing in the end, but not in a bad way. It was fairly realistic in how certain characters acted and reacted.This game isnt considered Ubisofts strongest in the franchise, not by a long shot I find 4 to be the best thus far, personally, but it does try new things and delivers these new ideas in a unique way. Worth a play through, but obviously with all Ubisoft titles, buy it while its dirt cheap during a sale.
