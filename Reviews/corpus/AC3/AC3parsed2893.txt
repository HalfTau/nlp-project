I absolutely loved this game! It was really helpful when I was learning about the American Revolution in one of my classes, and since I actually experienced it well some of it was not perfectly accurate and some parts were changed firsthand, it got me a good grade on the test overall. In my honest opinion, the first games of every series are always the best, but this one has its own place in my heart because it goes through American History. It basically takes the same controls and weapons that you used in the previous Assassin Creeds games, and even adds the musket and boats, to make it feel more like you were living in that era. To arms my brethren! To arms!
