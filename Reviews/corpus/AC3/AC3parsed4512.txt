Assassins Creed 3 is a new entry in franchise concluding story of Desmond Miles who is an assassins in present time with help of others who are trying to stop the judgement day from happening by decoding various stuff left by the ones who came before. In short its final chapter in his story. The new protagonist is Connor half indian half british guy who is fighting templars in the era of American Revolution in 17531783.Like his predecessors he is able to hide in haystacks, use hidden blade adn other gadgets at his disposal, as well as new ones. Gameplay is much wider than AC 2 and its expansions but a bit weak and not nessesary. You are now able to hunt wild animals and skin them so later you can earn money from them or later when acquiring some individuals you can craft some specific stuff which can later help in the game. For the first time you are now able to climb up trees and jump on branches which is kinda cool and good way of moving around if you stalk your target. New addition to 3rd game is Naval missions which are done very well adn very enjoyable. There are also some bad things in game unfortunately. It feels more linear and less interesting than previous games were. There are still same stuff to do like attacking templar bases and getting new troops to your Assassin guild but its not that rewarding and time consuming. Although if you let yourself into this game you may quite enjoy it if you just take your time. All in all its a good game to enjoy but still not polished enough. But who cares AC 4 is on its way to 2013. 7/10.
