This game is okay, I played it but the gameplay mechanics and controls were pretty messed up. The stealth sucked for me but since theres no stealth mode I dont see how it would be good for anyone. Then theres the whole you have to download Uplay to play this game and it doesnt even tell you on the steam network about that There were also a lot of framerate issues for me as well, it might have been my computer but I dont think so because I bought this PC just three months ago so its pretty new. There was also problems with conversations where the audio would end but peoples mouths would keep moving which was extremely annoying for me and it probably will be for you too.
