The simple fact that you cannoy play right away with any usb controller its what makes this an horrible experience, I have been in the internet for about 3 hours trying to find a solution and still not finding one, this sucks...if it were for me I would like a refund on my money...games are supposed to be compatible with any usb controller, thats why Im paying for the game, when it says that it supports controllers...if its only for xbox controller, just let me know and I would have stay away from this game...bad service...very bad service,  you ubisoft and  you steam !! !
