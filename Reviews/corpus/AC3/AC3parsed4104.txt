Personally, This game was fantastic.This was the first Assassins Creed game that Ive played so I dont have a refrence point but it was a great and enjoyable game. Whilst I encountred a fair few bugs and the control were oftern clunky, the storytelling was compelling and there is so many things to do, challanges, bonus missions and just generally intresting ways to kill redcoats. I would absolutly recomend this game
