First off, let it be known Im a huge fan of the series.  The story in AC3 is probably the weakest point but the updated engine and naval portions are decent perks. The first hour of the game is practically a tutorial that includes a twist of M. Night Shyamalan proportions, and in the same fashion  pretty much goes downhill from there.  If youve not played any of the previous games, I would recommend skipping this one and going through the Assassins Creed II/Brotherhood storyline first.
