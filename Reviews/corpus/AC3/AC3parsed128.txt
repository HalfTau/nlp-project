One of my favourite this far. Im at 100 and stopped playing. Freerunning in the forest is cool and a great improvement according to the previous games of the series. However there are still many bugs that affects the gameplay. I have rushed through this game to start playing AC IV Black Flag since most of my friends told me that AC IV was better. DONT..The story stumbles in AC IV so enjoy this game since it has a great storyline with Kenways  Desmond. Read the book while playing if possible. The speeches are 100 the same. After you play a sequence, read the corresponding chapter in the book so you can draw the place in your mind where the events occur.
