A solid entry in the Assassins Creed franchise set during Americas war for independence which is brilliantly portrayed by its many iconic historical figures and authenticlooking 18thcentury New York and Boston and battles  Assassins Creed once again doesnt disappoint in that regard.I also enjoyed the concept of a Native American main character as there are very few main characters in games that arent caucasian, sadly, and this is intially a great thing until you realise how unlikable Ratonhnhkatton/Connor is   Ezio Auditore he is not. Hes always brooding, sporting a melancholic attitude and the passion for those around him that you felt when playing as Ezio is nonexistent. But if you can get around that youll delight in the new parkour system through the trees and mountainous areas of the game which is a refreshing change of pace and terrain from the longstanding series.Added to that are the glorious naval ship battles on the high seas which are incredibly fun and tactical as shots need to be timed in order to hit the vessel youre targeting and not get wasted in a rising wave for example. Navigating in concert with the direction of the wind is also important and makes for a joyous and riveting series of battles on the high seas DThe game also concludes Desmonds story and while its great that he finally begins to shine physically as an assassin, hes as whiney as always and his ending is seriously anticlimactic and a headscratcher.8/10
