7.9/10  Out of the first 5, enjoyed this leastI have to give it thumbs up because its a good game. If you never played AC you would love it, if you have played you may still. Things are just changing too much, fighting controls are much more dumbed down. Only attack and deflect really. All about timing. Previous AC you could get into some ragtag battles and win with a variety of moves.Each time I feel as though they focus on the story less and more on the city upkeep, weapon upgrades etc. Also, there used to be more variety on how you could complete a mission. This game makes you stand in the right spot otherwise you fail the mission.Worth 1015 if you like vamped up stealth version of AC.
