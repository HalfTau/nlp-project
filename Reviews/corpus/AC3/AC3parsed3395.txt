Once youve killed every cop in every city about 10 times, the game gets boring. Also, Uplay is absolute I cant play any of my Uplay games without an internet connection. Its sounds like a minor thing, but I have data caps and once they decide to limit my internet, I get speeds of 25 kb/s and  nothing works. Seriously, take a lesson from Rockstars Social Club. When you start up GTA IV, for example, you just enter your account info and youre good to go, even without internet. I payed about 100 into Assassins Creed 3 and Far Cry 3, and it looks like its 100 absolutley wasted because of  DRM. They also switched back to the old Captcha system on the website, you know the one. You get one set of numbers, but need to fill out two Captcha boxes. I think Ubisoft forgot Computer Science 3.
