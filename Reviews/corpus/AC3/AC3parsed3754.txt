Assassins Creed III is yet another Assassins Creed rehash, only this one was advertised as being Completely different, featuring All new mechanics, which included triangles over opponents heads that flashed when you were going to be attacked. Also completely missable naval battle minigames.The story is simple, rushed, and full of simple, unlikable one dimensional characters.This game is garbage. Assassins Creed means nothing but a series of shameless money grabs now.
