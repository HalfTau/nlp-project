I tried, I really tried, but no. By far worst of the franchise. Main character is bland as a water with ice and some air on top. Story, bad, just. No. I couldnt force myself to finish it.And combat? One would think that being able to be unkillable so much that you can easily kill hundreds yes I had a looong half an hour instance of constant killing of soldiers, piles upon piles of corpses, yet they. Keep. Comming. HOW is that a proper design?I was temped to check how many British troops died in the US civil war and was temped to just stand in an alley and kill them all as they approached me. Kill two hundred thousand, done, war won. Thank me later.I should have just skipped this one and went straight to 4 because the ONLY interresting thing about AC3 was the naval combat which gives you absolutely zero rewards and or bonuses.
