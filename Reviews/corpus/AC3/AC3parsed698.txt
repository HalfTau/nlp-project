Assassins Creed III is a great game and has some decent chacters but still for me is a negative review. Connors voice acting is terrible and a mucky storyline to follow, nothing is explained and so many plot holes that a elephant can fit through. Assassins Creed III is not a terrible game but the hype for it and the time peroid made people more forgiving for it. Still this game is in my top 5 favorite Assassins Creed games but people who buy this need to see what it is even if you may not agree.
