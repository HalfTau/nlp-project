THE BEST ASSASSINS CREED EVERThe story is amazing, and it just pulls you in to the point where you dont want to stop playing. It is so interesting how you are going through events that really happened and seeing a diffrent side to the story. Then you have got the homestead stuff which is optional where you upgrade your homestead to get more people and trade with diffrent merchants at boston and new york. Then, you have the diffrent side quest which are all pretty good, and you have tons of collectibles if you want to go for them. This game is just all around amazing. I give it a 9/10.
