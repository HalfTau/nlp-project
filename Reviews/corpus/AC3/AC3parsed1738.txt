This game does not get the good reviews it deserves. This game is HUGE and very fun. Let me tell you a story Lad. I once was walking around the forest road and this man needed help so i helped him and i ended up building up a village near my Mentors home then i found out something at the end and i literally cried. Despite that ending this game made me SO HAPPY TO LIVE!
