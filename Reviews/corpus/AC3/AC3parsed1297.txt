I have a weakness for AAA stealthemups, and ive enjoyed the Assassins Creed series since it started. Its not an amazing series, but it can be fun if you like openworld games and sneaking around.If you were to ask me if this is where you should start the series, I would give you a resounding no. The pace isnt very good, combat is way too easy, and the cities are kinda boring. That said, its my second favorite game in the series. I love the Colonial setting and hunting. I study Appalachian history and culture, so the setting really strikes a chord with me. Once you get into the right mindset its a really good game to mess around in, just not as good as AC4 or AC2. Overall, its just decent.Hardware wise, it runs fine. I have a Phenom II X4 820 / R9 380X / 16GB RAM and it runs at a pretty high FPS. Tends to stay at 60 when im messing around. I may not have much gametime on it ATM but ive played it a lot on console.
