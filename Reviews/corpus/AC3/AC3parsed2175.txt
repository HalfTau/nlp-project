Assassins Creed III is not a game i enjoy playing other then a little Multi Player now and then, The story it outright terrible, it starts with this guy in 2012 who found some ancient mystical power to that was going to end the world and throughout the game your are playing in and out of the 1700s and the 2000s. In comparisan with Assassins Creed Rogue this is bad.I would not recommend this game for anyone unless you enjoy extreme fantasy.
