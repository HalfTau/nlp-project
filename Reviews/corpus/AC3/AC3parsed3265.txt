AFter playing this game after AC4, I played AC3 a little on Xbox I realise this game has a great soundtrack, well presented, and  unlike 4 actually explains everything connor does through his childhood and training that made him an assassin.What youll loveSoundtrackPresentation and SettingThe actual story of the gameWhat youll hateThe Tool/Weapon wheelConnors boring personalityAnything and everything to do with the present day, and desmond.Not getting your sweet robes until sequence 6Its actually presented better than 4, but 4 is still a great game. 7.8/10
