I have heard some people say they had trouble with UPlay or just general crashes. Nope. I got uplay up and running fine within 5 minutes. The gameplay is stunning. I stood in awe at the framerate. I believed it would run improperly but it ran fine. Parkour mechanics that are beyond mindblowing. And lets not forget the jaw dropping combat. 10/10. And i dont throw around 10/10s lightly. If youre reading reviews before getting it i definitely recomend it.
