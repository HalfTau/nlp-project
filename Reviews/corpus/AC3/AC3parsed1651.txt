I had high hopes for this game. Its just to slow to be a assassin and its pretty boring. Also, Uplay can suck abecause it doesnt let me play the game anymore. I have to get like a code to play the game and they NEVER give me the code. This was a waste of money for a anticapeted game that I was looking for. It basically failed me.  Dont buy this game!!!
