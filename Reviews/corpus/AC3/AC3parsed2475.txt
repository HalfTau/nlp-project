Disclaimer I would only reccomend this game to people who enjoy the series or doing similar objectives or tasks. Otherwise this would not be the best game for you.Story was OK  not bad but not overly amazing.Combat was meh  It was fairly easy to predict everything happening and counter enemies.Stealth  Most of it was straightforward and easy to tell where to go.NPC/AI  Mostly predicting and repetitive, fairly easy to tell where and what they were going to do, though sometimes they would act stupid and stay near you for a long time.
