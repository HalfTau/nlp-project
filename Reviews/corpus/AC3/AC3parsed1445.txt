When I first purchased this game I wrote a negative review but, to be fair, this was my mistake and not the game nor Uplay. Luckily Steam stuck to their refund proceedure and didnt give in to my moans so I was forced to work out how to actually play it! The only points you need to remember are to get rid of the Uplay that comes with the game and download the newest version, stick it on desktop and always play the game via them. Do this and you can play to your hearts content The game itself is quite fun with just enough action not to get boring and a reasonable storyline .... If its on sale Id say get it but, tbh, I personally wont be getting anymore of the series as there are far better ones available.
