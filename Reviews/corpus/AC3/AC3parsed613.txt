this game ends at sequence 8 mission two at the prison fight there is no way to get past this. The stage ruins the game you have to bare fist fight 6 guys that never lose health and keep stopping you from killing the others off its was a waste of money glad i got this in a sale if i had know this before geting it i wouldnt have bothered
