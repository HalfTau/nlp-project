The main problem with this game is that, it sharply loses engineering quality over time. The more towards the end you get, the less things work perfectly, and the less everything feels cohesive and well designed.There is far too much brutality and fighting in this game to actually fit the fantasy, and the main protagonist lacks any surface to make him likable or for the player to have some surface to relate to the protagonists feelings. He is just basically portrayed as an angry teenage killing machine. Doesnt help that you play four chapters or so on a character that is far more likable and not even the main character of the game.Every side game is pointlessly made, and the naval mechanics are not used in the main plot to any degree.Difficulty in this game is made in a really frustrating way with time limits and spawning enemies, and there is a lack of good level design and enemy placement everywhere. The combat is repetitive and mostly frustrating.Example of a typical Assassins Creed design is to give me a 10 second timer to complete what is literally just a transition between two cutscenes, then if I fail due to the fact that the camera placement decides for the protagonist to jump to the sea for the Nteenth time, and then I just keep rapidly going to the restartscreen over just finishing this 10 second sequence. Was it relevant to make this time limit? Did it help the immersion? Was the fire around me everywhere not enough to impose a sense of urgency?A good world, with a terrible game with distinct lack of proper game design and lack of flow. Thats Assassins Creed 3.
