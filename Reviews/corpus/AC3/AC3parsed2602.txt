 not bad story and alternative clues climbing on rocks and trees also different character, different places Boston, New York hunting animals however it can be very tedious with the time introduced ship fights and upgrades they changed a bit the fight system but its still not a very good one crafting in bad way... a bit tedious and need to browse too much so many stucking points overall bugged optional quest progresses, what can be very annoying, especially when you can get only 9899 overall completions because of them if you havent red the content before what you should avoid etc... sometimes very silly optional requirements to synch 100 the Washington DLC bugged at the stalking dogs part which prevents any further progress did too much optionals, which triggered the bug. THIS IS UTTERLY RIDICULOUS, PLEASE FIX IT!! !
