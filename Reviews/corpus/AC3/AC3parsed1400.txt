There were a lot of things that I loved about the AC3, such as hunting animals, side quests and magnificent open world of United States of America during the time of revolution. On top of that story i think was very well plotted. However there were, of course, few things that hated about this game. For instance, the game lagged a lot around cities and some of the controls where laggy and very uncomfortable. However thumbs up for this game!
