I do recommend this game. But my expectations were higher, so im a bit disappointed.Liked It feels like the most interesting history lesson ever. like all previous ACs Graphics are decent. Soundeffects are decent. Your ship is rather easy to handle. The seasons are realistic.Disliked Poor combat system. In previous ACs you had more control over your weapons and strikes. AC3 is just mashing your Left Mouse Button. smh Controling your Homestead is . its feels like the first AC, when you want to exit gameUnfortunately those Dislikes weight heavier than those Likes because nowadays I just expect games to be less flawed like this.I hope Black Flag is an improvement to AC3.
