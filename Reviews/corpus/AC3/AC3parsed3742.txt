This game, along with brotherhood and AC 2 have been broken for 6 or so months now... Ubisoft NEVER addresses their problems and basically steals your money with a product that 80 cannot play. The AC3SP.exe issue is very widely known, and has never been fixed. Im surprised Ubisoft hasnt been sued yet over selling a broken pc version title of their games. Im beyondthat I bought these games and arent able to play them. I do however, very much so enjoy the Assassins Creed series. Just be aware that Ive had these titles in my steam account for years, and the past 6 to 8 months, I havent been able to play any of them with the exception of black flag.
