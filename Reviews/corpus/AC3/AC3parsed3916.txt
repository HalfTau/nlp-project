dont get me wrong, I enjoyed the game, but compared to the other assassins creeds this one was very disapointing, after playing the 4 hour intro I am a fast gamer myself and it took me litterary 4 hours I still didnt get much about all new features, though improvements where made like the freerunning and combat system I felt kinda lost in what to do next, a lot of cool features are gone as well hiring mercs gone, shops in every street gone, that awesome brotherhood of assassins feel gone. Also the characters are a lot disconnected in the assassins enviroment. I dont felt like connor or whatever his native name was is a real assassin but more like .... native american. though I still enjoyed playing this its a thumbs down because Its to low quality for a assassins creed game
