CONS.The game is VERY boring and long at first, as it takes almost 5 sequences until you actually get to play as an ASSASSIN. Once you get to play as the Assassin, you actually have to play as a little kid and do some weird hidandseek and hunting missions. Finally, you get to start your career as an Assassin. Although, you dont actually get to assassinate anyone until a few sequences after that.Another thing I need to stress about this game is that in cities, you cannot stealth kill guards without getting five more of them attacking you. Once you have five guards on your hands, then more notice, and you have 10 to 15 guards attacking you. Eventually, your health will be too low, and you will be forced to flee, without even killing all of them. Also, guards detect you instantly when on rooftops, so if you are looking at doing building parkour and aerial assassinations, I would recommend Assassins Creed 2, or any other game in the franchise, for that matter.Also the multiplayer does not work at all. My game crashes when I start it.PROS.The game wasnt completely bad, though. Some of the missions are outragously fun, like the naval combat and the mission where you assassinate the British officer. Although you pretty much have to do the aerial assassination on him, because if you dont, you will have to battle through 50 guards to get to him.FINAL VERDICT.Wasnt worth my time, and most of it was very boring or very hard. Not a very good game.If you are looking for a 20 Assassins Creed game, I definitely recommend AC2, or AC Revelations.
