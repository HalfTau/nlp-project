While both the graphics and the combat/movement are a major upgrade from AC2, the main character is shallow, whiney and generally annoying while the cities and places lack in character and very quickly look exactly the same.All in all, this game comes nowhere near AC2 and its expansions due to the above. AC games are about the story and character depth more than anything, and while the first character introduced in AC3 is great, the main one ruins the game for me.
