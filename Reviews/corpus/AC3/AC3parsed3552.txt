If you liked the past Assassins Creed games and how everything worked in those. AC3 is a huge departure from the normal games.I have multiple complaints about this games1. The tutorial is about 3 hours long. You dont play as an actual Assassin until halfway through the game. The first hour is fine, but the next 2 or 3 are dull and have you doing basically the same thing.2. Because the beginning is so long many of the ascpects of the game are not made relevant until later, and I missed most of them. I didnt know you could upgrade/get new weapons until after I completed the game and I had no idea about trade routes and the settlement. I only had one other assassin, and the storyline demands that you get one.3. The frontier was a good idea, but ultimitley was dull. The main thing I liked about other AC games was how full the world was. This one has a couple cities a fraction the size of Rome or Constantanople and then a huge stretch of nothing in between. Sure there are small towns and some stuff in the wilderness, but nothing exciting or makes me want to come back.Many people may like the game, but I personally did not.
