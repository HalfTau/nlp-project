Decent entry into the franchise, but not as good as AC 2 due to the mostly linear story missions. Great atmosphere though, the American Civil War is an interesting background for an AC game. Took me around 165 hours to 100 complete, so theres a lot of content and collectibles here to enjoy, including some mini games that get old after a while. You also get to ruthlessly murder around 3/4 of the redcoat population.Overall, a solid game.
