Assassins Creed 3 was a game happening at the time of the American revolution. The singleplayer was fine but it was too slow at the start, the story was sometimes hard to follow and sadly it only took 912 hours to complete. Im sure you can find an Assassins Creed game with a better singleplayer.Graphically they took a big step from theyre recent games and the voice acting was incredible very well polished and can still follow up to the graphic on the new releases to this date.One of my best experiences was combat i like how you arent making the same animation while fighting over and over again but always doing something new.The game didnt have that many bugs like there is in the newer releases of the Assassins Creed games, the riding mechanics is still absolutely trash though and was kinda game breaking in my opinion.I recommend buying this game if you cant get it for 8 euros on sale and you are all for the story and aint caring about stuff like open world, side missions and so on.7/10
