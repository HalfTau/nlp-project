I really enjoyed this game.I thought the story was great with its twists and turns and not afraid to kill off great characters.The way it portrayed all sides of the revolution as morally squiffy with no 100 good guys was well done.And yeah Connor is not the most charismatic, but give him a break, hes had a tough life!The only bad bits were the fighting side missions such as the fight club brawler missions which made me scream, but then they arent actually necessary so Id skip them if I were you.If you enjoy a good story, leaping around and shooting things, then Id definitely say give this a go.
