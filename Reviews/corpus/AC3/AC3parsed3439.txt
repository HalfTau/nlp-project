I was really disappointed when I played this game. I thought that the sequal of this popular game AC will be good as the second part. Im not complainning about the gameplay, and not even the graphics / textures. Im feeling wrong with the story line that AC3 has to offer. We can see that Ubisoft tried to make this game as the same other. Well, the story is boring as hell and at the end I would not spoil I had a face like this O.o. If you liked the old AC games I dont think you will like this one. Ubisoft promised to make it Ze best AC game in history but they failed. They made AC1, changed the textures and locations. Added a few weapons and climable trees. Added animels that you also can hunt. Thats all. I am not recommending this game to AC fans I also was an AC fan before this game and ony one who wants to try AC. Im putting a score of 5/10 because this game is a complete t compare to the other AC games.
