Interesting story line. Connor is a great character but a little bland. The gameplay is sorta here and there sometimes but for most of the time its badass and just fun. Its set in the American Revolution which most of us know about, sorta. So youre gonna be like, oH I know that!, a lot. Its great.SPOILERSSPOILERSDesmond dies so, 10/10
