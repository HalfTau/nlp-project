If youve played an assassins creed game, you pretty much know what youre in for.  The addition of shipship  combat is very fun, though.  Arguably more fun than the rest of game.  Alot of grief has been given for Connors boring character.  But I actually liked how he was written.  Hes more interesting than Altair, and leagues more interesting than Desmond.  The game controls very fluidly, howevery sometimes it is overly sensitive.  Ive accidently jumped off a building isntead of parkouring to the next many times.  I did not run into any bugs, and the game runs very well on my five year old laptop.  I would definitely recommend this game, but only if its on sale.
