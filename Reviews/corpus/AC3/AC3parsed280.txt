September 2017 language patch broke my savegames. It seems there is just one file missing. You can redownload it by accessing a beta branch of the game, search the forums for info. Ubi is probably going to patch it officially soon anyway, though.The game is good, AC3 redefines climbing, nature and introduces wildlife hunting and sea battles on ships. I did like the american natives setting, but the colonial wars stressed me a bit.Also the game is a bit confusing sometimes and I am not talking about the story, but about some gamemechanics. For example, I actually still havent figured the trading over a distance at the merchant, should read a guide I guess. No, I am not new to the series if that is what you think.If you enjoy Asassins Creed and like to play a powerful american native asassain at the colonial wars you should get this one. If you are new, I still think AC2 is the perfect start. AC1 is not bad, but it could be better.
