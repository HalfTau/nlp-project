Overstuffed, halfbaked and poorly executed. But surprisingly, this was a very important addition to the Assassins Creed franchise as the mechanics introduced in ACIII were carried over and drastically improved in the brilliant followup release, ACIV Black Flag. However, I would still not recommend this game itself. As enjoyable as the naval missions are, they make up a small percentage of what is mostly a drab and dull experience.
