Although people say this is one of the worst AC games, this is the game that introduced naval combat and hunting to the series. Both of these features were expanded in its sequel, Black Flag which is my favorite game in the series. This game has a pretty decent story and a cool setting American Revolution D. I personally thought it was awesome that you could play as a Templar or interact with important historical figures like Adams and Washington. Overall, its a pretty good game. I would definitely recommend this game for people who like the Assassins Creed series.
