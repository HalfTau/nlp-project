Assassins Creed 3 is a fairly fun and enjoyable game, bottom line.However, with that said, the game is not nearly as amazing as games such as The Witcher 3, Dishonored, GTA V, or even Far Cry 3 and 4.Its a game that, in my opinion, is worth 10 at the most. I believe that this game has 10 worth of entertainment in it.The combat is fun, but shies away from being too challenging, which can become quite lackluster after a while.The parkour is pretty fun, the running and jumping animations are satisfying to watch.But this game suffers from a world that has little to offer. Sure an aspiring boardgaming can play small mini games and such, but this game lacks the depth that is the norm here in 2015.That is why, compared to the games of recent times, this game is not that great.Visuals are nice, fighting is good, story is decent, and replay value is decent.Buy the game on sale.
