It is still a great game for when it came out, ive had it for so long and only played it offline the entire time and finished the game twice, and its so good as even the cheapest of computers can run it at regular fps, i congratulate this game as one of the best of its time, defnitely worth the time and the money  dont base this on how much time i have on this online.
