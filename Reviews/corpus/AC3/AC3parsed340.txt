A good game if youre into Assassins Creed. Its pretty much like the others witha few additions. The hunting and settlement mechanic are new and fun, though I wish they had done more with the naval missions. The rope darts were another nice addition but only because its fun the hang people with them.10/10 would help the British try autoerotic asphyxiation
