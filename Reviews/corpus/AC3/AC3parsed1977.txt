Although this game got slated by quite a few people I actually found it a refreshing change from the bustling cities of old. A nice twist at the beginning of the game had me hooked in and then it was all gravy from there. The slightly altered fighting style and environments suited this character and his roots, making for a fun and refreshing challenge.If you love these games like I do then you cant go wrong, get it played.
