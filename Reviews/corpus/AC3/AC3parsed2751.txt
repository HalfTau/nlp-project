I dont recommend this game. Is bornig, every missions feels a chore, and everything feels unfinished.  Fortunately everything is fixed in BlackFlag, and the story is way better in the sequel. I played this game only to get a sense of closure, since I have played the Desmonds Assassins Creed games, from the first to Revelations. I wanted to finish the story arc, and I founded Revelations more entertaining and fun than AC III. I liked the first hour of game, but then everything went downhill, with three hours of Tutorial missions and filler.
