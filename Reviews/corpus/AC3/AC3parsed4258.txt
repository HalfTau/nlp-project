I cant truly put to words how much I hate this game. Connor is unlikeable and plastic, and I never really bonded with him in the same way I bonded with Ezio and Altair. The setting is also very plastic, almost like walking through a miniature model of Boston as a tiny toy soldier. Graphics are watery and lowresolution at best, and Connors baseset of Assassins Garb is so uninspired it hurts. Glitches are everywhere, from flying horse carriages, to dead bodies stretching out across the entire eastern seaboard, it is nigh impossible to get immersed. The control set also changed from 2BrotherhoodRevelations, and if you played all of those games youll more likely than not spend half the game trying to use the old controls you got used to and failing and fumbling about. Honestly, the biggest drawback is that its set in Colonial America theres nothing new or exciting to be had in Colonial America, its all been there, seen that At least from the standpoint of being born and raised in America., with the feeling that they took a crash elementarylevel US History course before writing the plot. The only thing it has going for it is the crafting and caravan management, which even that is riddled with horrid bugs and hidden behind a godawful UI that makes doing anything a chore. Overall, I give this game a 3/10. Spend your money elsewhere.
