A very underated assassins creed game and in my opinion one of the best. The setting of the american revolution is one of the most interesting setting in the assassins creed franchise compared to the ones that came before this, this is the only one where I felt as though I could actually connect to what was going on and that made the game all the better. Connor the main character is someone a lot of people say was a boring protagonist but to me he felt like someone I could relate to and had true feelings rather than ones that were just engineered by the games creators.
