Worst game of the series.  Voice acting is horrible, storyline is dull.  Major lack of fighting, and even though they got rid of the oneclick constant kill massacre the combat is still far too easy.  The missions are very linear and the main character doesnt really stay in character very often.  The stealth system is pretty lame and unnecessary, however you must use it during some missions or youll fail.  The cutscenes are buggy, so much that halfway through I actually quit watching them intentionally, which made the game more tolerable if not for all the poor voice acting mensioned above.The sound does not mesh well with dolby 7.1 at all  at times people in scenes would seemingly quit talking, after turning off surround sound it fixed the problem.  As for a Native American theme, which I was looking forward to, epic fail.  Nothing Connor does has anything to do with Native traditions, just his own gain.The ship combat is fun though, also completely unrealistic to have a barely floating frigate with no upgrades destroy entire fleets of pirates and frigates.  On par with the series though, overly simple.
