Assassins Creed III expands on what the previous games made, but it isnt all good things.ProsMericaBig world thats fun to exploreLots of stuff to doConsStory bland at timesMissions get boringNot many significant landmarksThe technically not third game in the franchise takes us to an entirely different time period the American Revolution. To run around Boston is a joy, as well as all the forested areas, jumping around different trees and just having fun. Or you could be doing all the side things, which there are plenty of. Getting 100 will be tough, but it wont be boring. The story isnt exactly enjoyable the whole way through. About midway through the game, the missions get repetitive and everything gets predictable and just bland. They also lost the charm of landscape, with less than significant synchronization points and just not as great scenery. The world is definitely the biggest yet, making this Assassins Creed not the best, but enjoyable.Final Score 6/10  Okay
