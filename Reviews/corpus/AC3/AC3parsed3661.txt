In some games, there is a right way and a wrong way to enjoy them. I approached Assassins creed III in the wrong way, and in the end, I regretted it.It is a game of contrasts  it is beautiful, but poorly optimized, failing to run maintain 1080p60fps on overpowered rigs, in certain areas. It has a huge open world, but the missions proper are heavily scripted and will frustrate anyone wanting to do them in their own way. It looks to be about being an assassin but it really is about being a runner and a brawler.And yet... There is so much here. There is menudriven resource management. Tons of weapons and armors to collect. A huge world to explore, full of secrets and challenges. Whole swats of gameplay that you can ignore, and likely will if you focus on the story like I did.In the end, I felt regret for approaching the game in my own terms. Had I taken it easy, had I played it as a slow burn, exploring every nook and cranny of the marvelously realized world, I would have probably enjoyed it a lot more  and would likely have finished it around the time Assassins Creed 6 got here.
