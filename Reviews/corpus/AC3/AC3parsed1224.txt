The social justice narrative becomes tiresome really quickly.Had hoped the gameplay would make up for it but it becomes repetetive and tedious as the game progresses. I quite like long games but large parts of the game just feels like fillers to stall it from ending too fast.Might update this when I actually finish the game, which I may or may not do.
