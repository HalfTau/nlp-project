Ive played just the first few missions so far and they are insanly buggy. This game is not optimized nor has been fully tested on PC. I played AC3 on PS3 when it came out years ago and it played fine, with some bugs here and there popins being the worst bugs. But here it is difficult to even complete missions with crashing, audio issues, objects flashing on screen, the camera not moving evenly, etc. I havnt experienced these bugs outside of missions when Im just exploring yet. And man the popins are so bad in AC3. Guards will literally popin on the screen right in front of you. Man, its frustrating. AC Revelations was more optimized and tested than this crap.Im playing with a mobile GTX 1070 and an i77700HQ with 16GB RAM.If Ubisoft would simply reexamine and patch up this game it wont be bad because it has its moments. Until then I would not recommend AC3 on PC at all, unless you can get it for like 5. Play it on console as it runs much better.
