Game is good, when you can actually get it to run properly. Had to go mess around with Nvidia PhysX settings and running the game in compatability mode for windows 7 I have windows 10 before I could get it to stop crashing. My specs arent bad either GTX 970, i7 quad core 4.0Ghz, 16GB RAM, etc., and I guess it just cant handle newer built PCs? It still freezes randomly and crashes sometimes, and for that I cant recommend this game. Its poorly optimized for mid to highend PCs. Im well past the two hour mark as well so I wont be able to refund. If they release a patch that fixes the issues with crashing and freezing, Ill change this review.
