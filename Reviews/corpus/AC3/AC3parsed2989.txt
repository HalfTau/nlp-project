DISCLAIMERIve only played this game for about 6 hours at the time I wrote this, so it could have gotten much worse or much better by the time Ive finished the game.Ive had this game for awhile, but only recently got a computer with enough power to run it.After finishing the Ezio trilogy a while back, I expected something similar it when I started AC 3. I was kinda sorta wrong.First off, the freerunning takes a bit of getting used to, as the buttons to do so are different. There arent as many handholds as previous games, but AC 3 compensates by making it so that you can leap farther side to side or up to reach a new handhold.The largest problem I had when I started this game was the combat mechanics. At first I had no idea what to do, and got hit quite often. Although there is something similar to the combo instakill thing in the trilogy, its not quite the same here. Again, as well as the buttons being different, its not always a onehit kill. Sometimes you have to keep going at your opponent until he dies. Also, the use of guns in this game is much more advanced than in previous games obviously. The aiming/lockon system is slightly different, but youll get used to it quick enough. Choosing exactly who to shoot without relying on the games autoaim thing is a nice feature as well.The plot line so far is ok, not really interesting but Ive always been a movie person, so I do watch the cutscenes and so on. If you dont like the cinematic portion of games, then just skip it shoot people, I guess.I do enjoy the more open maps I have to explore, especially in the wilderness. The size is ok, but the details are definitely on par to what I expected. The city of Boston is also an interesting place to freerun around, and the changing seasons make the settings intriguing as well.Thats all I have to say about it for now. So far, I would recommend this game. Seeing as its only 20, I wouldnt consider it a waste of money, and apparently youll get at least 6 hours of fun out of it.
