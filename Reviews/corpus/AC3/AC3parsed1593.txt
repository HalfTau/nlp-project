Not a terrible game. Not that great either. There are more than a few issues with this one. Bugs and glitches abound, the A.I. can be idiotic at times, and the controls are far less as convenient as they were with the Ezio trilogy or the first Assassins Creed. Lastly, the frequent little hiccups this game caused on my machine during gameplay were troublesome. Every few minutes the game would get choppy and only pausing it and letting the choppiness pass fixed it. Each of these instances occurred at the same time as UPlay.exe using up more memory on my PC. UPlay is horrible anyway, but I felt like giving this game a fair try. It wasnt worth it in the end, mostly thanks to UPlay itself ruining my experience.The other main issue I had with this game is that the main character you play as is a thoroughly unlikeable fellow. I didnt like him anyway. Hed range from unemotional zombie to raging assclown to most if not all of his allies in the storyline. He was definitely not as interesting as Ezio, Altair, or even Aveline Liberation wasnt that great either, truth be told. Connor Kenway or Ratowhatevernobodycares was a horrible character and to be subjected to his comically overplayed seriousness for more than a couple of hours was pretty painful.Buy this if you cannot live without all the AC games. Skip it if youre not that hardcore a fan of the series or if you dislike UPlay.Oh, and I havent done the multiplayer yet, but I suspect its just like it was in Brotherhood and Revelations. UPlay kinda forgot twice that I owned all the multiplayer DLC related things and I had to go through Ubisoft support to get things restored. Meh. UPlay sucks.
