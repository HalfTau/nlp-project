On my Windows machine, this game will glitch out and crash after 30  40 minutes. My machine exceeds all of the minimum requirements. Because the issue takes some time to occur, I have exceeded the two hour play time refund period, so Steam will not honor a refund for this product. This game turned out to be a huge disappointment, as I was excited to continue on with the Assassins Creed story. When playing the Assassins Creed titles, youre better off sticking to a console since they actually work.
