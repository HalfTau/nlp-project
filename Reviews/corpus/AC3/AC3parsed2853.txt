Theres something off about this Assassins Creed...Connor doesnt feel like a strong character, the gameplay isnt quite as fun as its predecessor, and even though Im a fan of the time period, the American Revolution was asetting to put the game in.The game just drags on and on... and you never really seem to get anything done or do anything exciting for long periods of time.The best thing to come out of this game was the ship fighting mechanic, which was heavily focused on in AC4, which I think is a much much much superior game.Skip this game if you dont really care about the whole Desmond story anyway. Itll be worth your time and money to do so.
