As much as I adore the Assassins Creed franchise, this game was unfortunately by far the worst of the entire series in my opinion. Although the setting was very fun to explore, both Connor and the story were bland, there were so many bugs with stealth, combat and parkour, and the game overall was subpar to what I expect from an AC game. The ONLY reason I played this game was to see what happens to Desmond in the modern day plot. At this point, if you are new to the AC franchise, I would recommend totally skipping this game and play AC4 after the Ezio trilogy. You can always google what happened to Desmond.
