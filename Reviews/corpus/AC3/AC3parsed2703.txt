Many say that this is the weakest in the AC serires, but I think it is still a very strong addition. There are a few noticable glitches in the game but they do not detract much from the fun. Good combat, decent story, LOTS to do.Nothing beats double assassinating bunnies from a 25 ft tree, and thats why I like it.
