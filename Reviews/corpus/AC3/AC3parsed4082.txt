The first assassins creed gameplay was awesome however the storyline was completely awful. The second assassins creed the gameplay the was awesome and storyline was great except for desmend miles involvement in everything. The third assassins creed had more invovlement in desmend but the storyline kinda sucked and I thought the gameplay wasnt as good as the second. I wouldnt really reccomend you play this game. Usually I like games enough that i do all the sidequests. well in this game i didnt do any of the side quests because they didnt get me anything, they were boring, and they made it so difficult for the user. I wish the creators had a plan before making these games because whoever is the big think tank of these assassins creed games are making terrible storyline decisions
