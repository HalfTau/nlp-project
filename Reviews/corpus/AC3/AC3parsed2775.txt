Having played Assassins Creed I and Assassins Creed II, I enjoyed them both and now with this game I would say the same...If I had to say anything, the gameplay, character and story gets better than it does at the beginning. Even after you finish the story there is a lot more to the game and with these side missions, they can still keep you interested nonetheless.It falls short though in the story but it makes up in terms of character development as you progress through the game.This would be considered one of my favourite Assassins Creed game but unfortunately it doesnt. There are quite a few bugs but they dont make the game unplayable by any means. The introduction and about the first 3 chapters in ways were fun but otherwise not so much. The pacing felt rather slow during those times which then the pacing just seemed rather fast during the later parts of the game.When you get past all that, this game is actually quite fun. I loved its optional objectives/mission restraints as they made the game more challenging in a way. Doing these makes sure you dont just do everything so easily and linear. Patience has its rewards.For AC fans, Id definitely recommend despite if it gets a little irritating and for those who arent, Id get it still if you can be patient with the game.
