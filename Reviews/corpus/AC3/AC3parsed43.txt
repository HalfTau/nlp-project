This was a desperate try to resuscitate whole franchise. It is obvious that no loger are games developed to be of the best quality, but to earn money for the developers. It goes as usual  they see an opportunity to make money and they go for it so they start making many, so called, brand new games with all the new functions but all I can see is just the same game that once was dominant and superb but nowadays no one would even notice it in a brand new cloak. Everything remains the same. No spectacular invention. I must admit, though, that the introduction of multiplayer is very nice and I enjoyed playing it. It brings a new point of view to, so called, silent excitement. Final words mundane, profane, platitude. 3,5/10 most of the points are for few hours of fun with the multiplayer with friends
