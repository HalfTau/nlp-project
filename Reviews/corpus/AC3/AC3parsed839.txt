I remember loving Assassins Creed.  However, I forgot how frustrating the mechanics can be.  Clearly action games like this have improved A LOT since this game came out. Shadows of Mordor, Mad Max, Tomb Raider, Batman Arkham series... all better mechanics and much more fun to play.  Granted the Assassin Creed stories I love, they just need to fix these cumbersome controls and the stupid optional mission criteria.  And playing it now, I am shocked how much it isnt as opened world as I thought it was.  I would recommend this game to those people that are looking for a good assassin game, but this is in my bottom top 10.Based on how much I played this game, I am going to say this is a recommend.  However, I would say before you play this game... if you havent played the other games I mentioned above... play them first.
