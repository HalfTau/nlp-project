Oh AC3, you let me down and you bought me back up. Im mixed about this game, but overall I enjoyed the experience.You start off as a different alter ego, Connor is cold and angry. He fits the role very well. I wasnt sure at first, but I hope they use him for the next game.For the most part it feels watered down in many aspects. No health potions, running and climbing are mapped to the same button, no health armor upgrades and the weapons are mediocre. I used my starter tomahawk throughout the entire game, and that awesome bow.I did look past all of this though, because the game is still fun. I liked the ability to kill the friendly and not so friendly wildlife, because thats what men do.And holyBOATS. The naval combat was fun and I really got a kick out of sinking enemy ships. This part was especially rewarding, as you see splinters fly everywhere and fires breaking out.They seem to add more to the multiplayer, including I think, Im not sure a coop mode. Ive always loved Assassinss Creed multiplayer, so Im glad about that.
