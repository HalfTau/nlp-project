I hadnt played any of the other Assassins Creed games before this one, but still found it to be an OK jumping on point. You lose some of the backstory of the modern day characters, but that didnt bother me so much because the rest of the story and gameplay are so good. There are definitely bugs in this game, but I found them more amusing than anything and they didnt detract from the overall experience for me. The highlight of this game for me was the naval missions. Ubisoft managed to create an engaging and simple interface for the navel missions that allowed you to turn your full attention to the experience without a clumsy interface interfering with your enjoyment of them. I would have liked more naval missions, but I guess I have AC IV to look forward to soon. My only real complaint about this game is the crafting/trading system. The interface is clumsy and nonintuitive and its not a necessary part of the game, other than to fulfill some of the requirements for 100 completion. I totally forgot or ignored this for the most part and I would say I enjoyed the game more as a result.
