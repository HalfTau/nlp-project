This game deserves more credit then what it receives. It took me about 30ish hours to finish the full story, with extra time for exploration in between. This game introduces great combat mechanics, a better freerun system, naval gameplay, and a large openworld experience. The port isnt perfect, but it runs well enough that you will have a fun gameplay experience. Im extremely happy with this game and I wish it hadnt gotten bashed the way it did at release. A worthwhile purchase, especially if you catch it on sale.
