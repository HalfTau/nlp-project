Assassins Creed III is a very typical representative of the sandbox action genre. While the series is beginning to have just a few too many minigames in it for my tastes  ship battles are particularly annoying if youre an achievement hunter  the core gameplay of the series has reached a point where it is as refined as it will probably become. Combat is easy to master and the stealth aspects of the series have undergone a much needed overhaul regarding realism. In short, AC3 is polished to a mirrored sheen, with an absolutely brilliant soundtrack, seriestypical great graphics, and an opportunity to bring closure to Desmonds story, this game is not to be missed by diehard members of the Brotherhood and is even a decent  albeit not perfect  place to start the series for newcomers.
