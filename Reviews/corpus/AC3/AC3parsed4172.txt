While the introductory sequence is lengthy and boring, this game is an improvement over what is an excellent series. The backdrop of the American Revolution provides an extremely interesting storyline and backdrop especially for history buffs, while the addition of naval combat provides an entertaining new bit of gameplay to the Assassins Creed games. The downside for me is that the building navigation is not quite as well done as it is in the more densely packed environments of the earlier games in the series, a result of being set in colonial America rather than welldeveloped Italy.
