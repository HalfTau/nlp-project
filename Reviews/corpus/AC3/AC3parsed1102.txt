Assassins Creed III is just a fantastic game overall it got me hooked to the franchise like crazy.The combat is brutal,altough being a little repetitive,the soundtrack is BEATIFUL the parkour is fluent,the story is enjoyable,the missions are fun,the multiplayer is pretty good,although not many people play it now.Overall 7/10
