Ive had this in my library for some time and honestly, I just couldnt get into it. Theres something just wrong with this Assassins Creed, theres a whole lot going on in terms of gameplay, but it all feels very shallow. Ive played about twice the time on my Xbox360 awhile back when the game was free for a couple of weeks. There isnt much of a difference other than a tinge better graphics, but thats about it. Combat is nothing special apart from any other AC game, what Ive leant of the story, its basically another case of hit or miss and this certainly is a miss. Though truth be told, keeping up with the AC storyline is fairly easy, even if you skip an installment. Go play AC2 or Black Flag, their gimmicks are better. To add onto that, the same near outrageous amount of collectables strewn across maps where it feels the game is inflated with collectables haunts this series in general. Though the same could be said for just about any major Ubisoft game.On the technical side, the game runs fine. Highest settings on a 1600x900 desktop with a few stutters and frame drops here and there, but nothing major. Graphics look great, as any AC game does. Well detailed environments to mosey about that are sadly underused and mostly filled with collectable items and inane missions.I really cant say Ive had very much fun with ACIII. If youre a fan of the series, youll have a good time I imagine. But the gameplay is stagnant and ACIII is one of the AC titles which just didnt live up to, well... anything amazing.
