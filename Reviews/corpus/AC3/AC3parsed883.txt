Main gameWhile this game is not the most loved iteration of the Assassins Creed franchise, I actually enjoyed it. You do notice that the game is less polished since I encountered some weird glitches from time to time. None of them were game breaking and my game crashed only once  although I do not know whether that was AC3s fault or just my computer.DLC  Benedict ArnoldThis was a neat addition to the game, offering some extra story and content but it wasnt all too special. Just some extra missions which do not take very long. Get this only on a sale if you want to.DLC  Tyranny of King WashingtonThis DLC I really enjoyed! Its a unique experience very different from the actual main game in terms of gameplay mechanics. I got this DLC when I bought the Deluxe edition on a sale, but I definitely recommend buying this DLC for those who have the standard AC3 game! The only two things that bothered me in this DLC were1 there are chests and treasures literally everywhere! At first, I collected them all  which took quite a while  but then I actually noticed that they are not useful at all. They offer upgrades to the quiver and pistol and give you ammo, but I did not use those very often in the game2 the save citizens / attack convoys etc. challenges were very easy to farm and redo in order to get a 100 sync, but they kept popping up if you had already succesfully executed enough of them. Moreover, the attack convoys sometimes glitched, where their guards were sort of rubber banded when you performed an air assassination on them.Other than that GREAT DLC!
