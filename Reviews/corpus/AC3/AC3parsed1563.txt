Liked the story besides the Desmond parts, liked the combat, loved the setting anything 1700s  1800s is great, er, uses Uselessplay Uplay, had problems with that, there servers kept getting overloaded thanks to the Crew. Eh, but still, good game. Contains one of my favourite characters ever, Haytham.Oh, bloody amazing soundtrack too.
