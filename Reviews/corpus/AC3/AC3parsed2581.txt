8 hours in and heres what Ive done so far Walked around BostonRun around BostonClimbed around BostonRode a horse arond BostonPlayed checkers in a sailboatWandered the sewers for an hourPet a sheepGone on a few missions that involve mostly walking and/or running around Boston at choppy frameratesThe platforming is idiot proof and requires ZERO thought.  The cutscenes are mindnumbing.  The combat is sketchy and far and few between.  Stalking basically means walking around quietly.  How fun is that in a video game!Im going back to playing Splinter Cell.
