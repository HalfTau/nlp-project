Might be one of the worst tripple A games ever made.The pacing is annoying, the objectives are frustrating and illogical, the missions are build in a way that you either have to frustratingly replay them because of the illogical objectives over and over again or accept that failing the mission works just as fine for progressing the game.The combat is stillcreed typical a lack laster extercice of pressing b when an enemy blinks red. but not it is enchanced with Quick Time events that ask you to press b followed by a random buttom. Progress! Literally everything is worse than in the precessors, they managed to screw up timing, come up with even more chesey lines for the dialogs, etcDont waste your money on it.
