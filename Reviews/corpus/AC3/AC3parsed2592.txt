Assassins Creed III is an incredible game that attempts to push the boundaries of previous titles in the series. It achieves so much but unfortunately this leads a moderate degree of inconsistently due to lackluster missions, training assassins, and graphical hiccups. The voiceacting and soundtrack maintain the same high quality as other Assassins Creed games, so whether you tracking a target or just exploring the area your eyes will be treated. Assassins Creed III takes a lot of chances and brilliantly constructs a story that will have you playing until you reach the end..
