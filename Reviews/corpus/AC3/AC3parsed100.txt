A Huge mess of a game, massively ambitious but poorly executed. It takes up to 6 hours of storyline on first playthrough before you can even start to enjoy any of the open world gameplay the franchise is famous for. Thats up to 6 hours of running from cutscene to cutscene with very little action inbetween. Hell, its 4 hours before you even meet the main character. Theres a mountain of side activities once the game does open up which im sure were fun when this game was in its prime, but are simply a distraction now that newer and better titles are out. A million bugs, horses that cant step over rocks, bizarre movement paths  even in 2017. Its all very unpolished and jarring. The controls for PC are a clumsy afterthought too, really  porting needs to be given so much more care and attention publishers. You spend millions designing a game for console peasants and cant even be bothered to propely implement logical controls for a huge portion of your customer base on PC. its just not good enough.Bought this on sale purely to catch up with the story after origins released, as i stopped playing the series after revelations which wasnt very revealing  hence embargo out of frustration. Even on sale  i would have had more fun watching all the cutscenes or a letsplay on you tube.Unpolished, clumsy, and jarring yet very ambitious with a lot of content. Not the finest, frankly..Also, Ubiplay is an abomination.
