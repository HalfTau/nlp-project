Dont know why all the fuss about this game. Strong main storythough it takes time to get into it and to read database about historical events/characters for full immersion, good presentantion like in Tomb Raider lets say, lot of cutscenes. Big world, different than AC 2, somewhat like open world region with couple of cities. Side missions are better than in AC2, they all have a small story to it like in RPG games, and there are of course a lot of those generic contracts/challenges etc missions overall are better than in 2. Naval missions are AWESOME! A lot of content...Things that could have been better are stealth mechanic for sure thats my no 1 complaint, maybe more meaningful item/weapon proggression with more impact on the way you fight, more unique enemies like in some other good action games, your own vilage with inhabitants, trade and crafting were great as an idea that wasnt executed well.All in all I think I enjoyed this game more than AC2! Recomended! 8.3/10
