Wasnt as good as black flag or unity but ok.I realize now that it will take time. that the road ahead is long and shrouded in darkness. It is a road that will not always take me where I wish to go and I doubt I will live to see its end, but I will travel down it nonetheless. for at my side walks hope in the face of all that insists I turn back, I carry on and this...this is my compromise!!
