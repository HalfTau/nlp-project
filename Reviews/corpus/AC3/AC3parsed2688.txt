The campaign is very entertaining and does a good job of explaining what is going on if you havent played any of the Assassin Creed games before. The feeling you get from jumping from tree to tree and at the end jumping from 30 feet up to assassinate someone makes the game extremely entertaining and gives you the rush that makes you wanna try it in real life would not recommmend.The only thing I am disappointed about is that I am unable to play the mulitplayer part of the game. Now this just could be Im an idiot and Im doing something wrong, the mulitplayer is no longer up, or something is really wrong with playing multiplayer. Either way I would recommend to get the game to play the campaign.
