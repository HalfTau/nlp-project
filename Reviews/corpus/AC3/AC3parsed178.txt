AC III is one of the best games in the entire franchise, but the climbing mechanics have seemed to become even more fiddly  and unpredictable compared to the Ezio trilogy, and the bugs and glitches in this game do not do it any favours. I found myself feeling frustrated on many an occasion whilst playing, but having said that it was absolutely worth it!When it comes to deciding the best game in the series, Assassins Creed 2 still takes the cake in my opinion, but AC III was a very close second. Well worth the 16 quid!
