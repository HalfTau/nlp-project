I dont know even where to begin... Let me start with the positives the graphics have been greatly improved, the sounds are good as always, the combat and freerun are way better than before, also this game introduces the naval combat in the franchise. However there are couple of things why this game falls short graphical glitches, sometimes the audio is out of sync especially in the DLC, sometimes the combats counter signs dont trigger or the camera angle glitches out a bit, too few naval missions and finally the biggest issue poor performance on PC due to poor optimization. The plot is starting out great, but soon gets boring and the main character, Ratonhnhakton or Connor, is not likeable at all at least I didnt like him so you dont feel attached. Anyway Id say that if theres a deep discount on the title, Id only recommend it to hardcore AC fans.As for the DLC I also have all of them and I can safely say they dont worth it. Why? Because I dont like this kind of plot cant really elaborate without spoilers.
