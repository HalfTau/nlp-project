Overall I think the game is fun. It has a great story to it once again. What I do not like about it, is the mechanics of it. To be honest I think its I do for example not like the way that you can not just run towards a target and press left mouse botton and then kill the target. So I would say it is mostly the controls. The controls are horrible.
