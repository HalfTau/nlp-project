I bought Assassins Creed 3 in expectation of the new Assassins Creed Origins and i shouldnt have done it. Even after all these years the game is filled with bugs and has a lot of annoying gameplay flaws. I know at the time this game really offered more than Assassins Creed 2 could but the gameplay simple isnt entertaining. Navigation errors while climbing trees and buildings, failing sub goals in missions without reason, having to become incognito all the time sometimes not even working and way to much focus on the war of indepedence instead of the story of the game itself are multiple reason that make me hate the game.After reaching New York the now 4th main hub of the game i simply dont want to continue ... I AM DONEAh and for all Nvidea users ... you have to delete the profile for the game to even run it without screen stuttering, shaking and graphic glitches. How comes that something like this has never been fixed ... thanks Ubisoft ... i cant wait for your next title.P.S. I enjoyed AC 2 including all following titles, Black Flag, Rogue and Syndicate ... i still love this series but if i would have bought AC 3 at the time of its release i would be really mad and would have called of this series ... probably.
