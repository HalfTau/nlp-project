AC3 doesnt get the credit it deserves. Connor is one of the best characters I have ever played as in a video game Ezio had his charm, but Connor has depth and has real character development. The story is enticing, and AC3 has complex and heartfelt themes around father son relationships, and of course if the assassins are in reality the good guys, and the templars the evil ones.  The graphics arent groundbreaking but are better than if Bethesda had tried to make it... No offense, I love the Fallout series and Skyrim is amazing The combat is not hard, but it is very satisfying and is much easier than the sht stain Unitys combat was. Honestly what was Ubisoft thinking... Try this game out at least, if it isnt your thing, then theres always the refund option.
