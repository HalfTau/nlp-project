Assassins Creed 3 is one of the best OpenWorld Singleplayer games I have ever played and/or enjoyed.The game looks awesome and you can clearly see that there was a lot of focus on detail in this big open world. The controls feel intuitive and good but are still a bit woolly. The Campaing/Story actually impressed me because it offered a lot of content and playtime compared to other singleplayer games. So all around the game is good.BUTThe Ubisoft launcher is one of the worst things I have ever experienced as a product of such a big company. It is so bad you cant even put it in words. If you donwload this game over steam you will have to install the ubisoft launcher AND create a Uplay Account.I played this game some time ago and yesterday I wanted to play it again. I went on to log into Uplay. This lousy piece of software didnt let me in. And trust me I put in the right information.So now I spent around 100 Euros on products launched with Uplay and I cannot play any of the games I bought because nothing I tried works.I just cant understand why this has to happen. I am logged into my Steam account and have all the information Id need to prove that I bought this game but I cant do anythi g because Ubisoft diesnt really care that much. As long as people pay money for their games they are happy and dont care about how their launcher is freaking bad.I myself dont know what to say to you regarding my review of this game. The game itself is totally recommendable but if I would have to decide again I would NOT buy this game just because of the launcher.Trust ne I am not eccaturating.I hope my review helped at least a bit.
