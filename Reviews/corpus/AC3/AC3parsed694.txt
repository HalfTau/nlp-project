Maybee because this is my first exposure to the AC franchise idk... i played it on my buddys ps3 im poor and cant afford my own atm P too bad its unplayable on my out of date laptop P.  It downloads!! it opens!! It even plays!! but it runs at like 1 frame per second P  Im giving a game a thumbs up in spite of my predicament!! lol
