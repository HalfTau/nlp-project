The sequel to the Ezios series of games goes through quite a few bumps, but its still a remarkable one. Its presentation is good, the parkour at nature mechanic and the naval battles provided you didnt play Black Flag, which improved a lot on it are very fun and incredibily good. Connor, though a bit taciturn, in my opinion is a very good character with a deep and emotional story. His father, Haytham, Achilles, Charles Lee and the others are excellent characters as well.The story, for those like me that dont know much about the american revolution, feels quite confusing at times. Its hard to follow how the war is going, since Connor takes part on it only at a few times. Even with that, the characters shine and the story that goes around Connor is very good, and worth the time. The sidequests are plenty and mostly fun, with highlights to the frontiersman line and the animal hunting parts. One problem with the sidequests is that they were too secondary, in my opinion. I didnt do many things until right before the end of the game simply because the main storyline gave me few to no leads to follow on to procced onto the sidequests. It requires initiative to go through them all.So, although the main characters personality might feel overshadowed by Ezios charisma, the overall storyline of the world being a bit confusing and many sidequests being too detached from the main storyline for my tastes, excellent characters, very good new mechanics, very good plot and some shining sidequests make this game worth it.
