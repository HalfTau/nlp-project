This is one of my favorite assassins creeds. The story, the main character is really a pleasure to go through. One of the major flaws is the loading screen why do they have to make it bright white. They need to make it a darker color what are they trying to give someone a seizure? lol.. But one of the good things about the game is the gameplay. Gameplay is surperb from the fighting, to climbing buildings, and the best part the addition of tree climbing. I recommend this game to any assassins creed fan if u can get past the insanely bright loading screen then this is the game for u.
