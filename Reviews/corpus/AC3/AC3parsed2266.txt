Booooooooring This is a game for your shoe soles. As you need good soles to walk to a, for getting back to b, to walk to c what simply just could have been a anyway.Quest here in other aaa titels would be sides quest maximum.Or to say it in one word again, boring.Nice american style and beeing an indianer makes some difference but not a top game.After half the game nearly, sequence 5 completed, I startetd to think about what story I played and came to the end...not much content for 5 hours of gameplay, running here, walking there, short and boring fights inbetween, so no motivation to continue/finish the game.Well, stop, there have been 10 minutes steering a pirates boat and shoot some others, maybe there would be such a  blockbusting content in the second half again for some minutes. If you are a games collector and want it for your library in a sale, well, grab it, but no need to download/install and play it.
