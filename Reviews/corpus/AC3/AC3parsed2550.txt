I actually really enoyed this game! When this game came out in 2012 I was really excited for it. I bought it a little bit after it came out and then never played it until this year. Now that I have played it here are my pros and cons.The gameplay is classic AC. Fast paced stealth actionThe protagonist, Connor, actually is a good character! Assassins Creed games generally have pretty boring characters There is a lot of stuff in the world to discover and find adding a lot of replayability in the postgame The Stealth missions are really fun if you are in to stealth mechanics The relationship between Connor and his father is really fun and it actually gets quite a few laughs, good laughs. The historical setting is well used. Connor actually affects the American Revolution rather than just lives during it. Like many other Assassins Creed games, the enviroments are really believable and do seem like functional cities The season changes and the forests added a different more nature feel which I liked. The AI is dumb... like REALLY dumb. I often would follow a Redcoat patrol around and stab members of it. I figured out that the AI does not even notice that someone is dead until they hit the ground so I could take out half a patrol before anybody noticed anything. Then, when they did discover the body, they did not attack me, they pushed me twice and then kept on walking. Also, guards can get stuck on objects. There is a lot of features that I dont care about and so I ignore them. The whole story element about the world ending on December 21, 2012 REAAALLLYYY dates the game and makes the modernday story feel weird when playing in 2014. Desmond is a pretty boring character, as usual. If youre this big hero of the American Revolution, why dont the patriot soldiers fight at your side in free roam? that confused me.All in all, I would say that this game is definately worth the 5.00 that it costs when it is on sale. It is really good and it is well worth your time.
