A game so bad I couldnt even finish it. This is where Ubi started to take a turn for the worst. Connor is the absolute worst protagonist in the AC franchise. Terrible writing, terrible animations. I had high hopes for the setting American Revolution but was sorely let down. Not even the badass tomahawk could save this game. 3/10.
