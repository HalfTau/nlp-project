I have mixed feelings about this game but for now Ill reccomend this game.This was my first Assassins Creed game, I actually played and beat it on my Wii U. LOLThe game was fine and the story was great my first time around but that was because this was my first experience to the series. The gameplay was a little hard to get into, and it changes the way the game plays compared to the first few games. These changes are meh in 3 but improved on much more in AC4 and AC Rouge.The reason this story was a let down was because after going back to replay all the games in order I found myself enjoying the Altair and Ezio stories so much that when I played AC3 again it was honestly so boring.All in all good gameReplay Value low imo7/10
