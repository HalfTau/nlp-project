Lacks support for xbox controllers even though thats like... the default. Everything works fine but when its an xbox controller the camera panics and continually shoots to the left side in the most jittery, sporadic fashion. With an xbox controller plugged in, any fall longer than a few inches would immediately cause the camera to rapidly face different directions, and this happened every time I slipped or slid a few inches.Theres an over population of mobs making freeroaming unenjoyable. For example, wandered around a rock and got mugged by a cougar. 3 minutes later was mugged by a wolf with another cougar comin to nip at my nuts. Fell off a cliff because the collission and detection for solid flat planes seems to be nonexistant, and fell directly on to an Elk. Once combat initiated with that Elk, the camera shot in to the rock side that I fell off of, and couldnt be moved. Camera became locked in one position as I was continually  clipped through the rock, locked as well in a quick time event against the Elk.Fell in to a hole that the fall didnt kill me from. Stood there and waited, no way out. Once I ran about 56 feet I immediately desynchronized and clipped through the bottom of the pit.Whats weird to me is that I played this game two years ago and none of these things were an issue then. The camera wasnt freaky, Connor didnt seem to move on his own accord, and the detection for his free running actually worked and .. detected... like it was supposed to. It suddenly feels like a step back in the system from the Ezio line of games. And I know my mind isnt so far gone that Im remembering wrong, because I genuinely used to enjoy ACIII.TLDR dont buy the game, just read the wiki or a synopsis and go play Black Flag. Id love to actually finish this game, and it breaks my heart that I cant bring myself to, but its not worth the frustration.
