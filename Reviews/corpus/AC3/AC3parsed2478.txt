I do not reccomend this game as, even though the story is alright and the freerunning is great, I just wasnt really immersed, and I felt chained to the main story with very few side quests. And to top it off, against what Ubisoft said about Naval Combat, you can not sail out your ship, the Aquila, between missions, which was a let down. Trust me, if youre looking for a good Assassins Creed game, just save up or wait for a sale to get Black Flag.
