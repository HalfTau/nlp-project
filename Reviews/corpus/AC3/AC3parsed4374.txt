While not as engaging and certainly not as addicting as its predecessors, Assassins Creed III provides a great story driven experience that wraps up Desmonds role in the series. The combat system has been tweaked and now seems even more refined, and although I didnt bother much with the side missions, they would deliver endless hours of fun if youre not already weathered from completing those kinds of quests in previous titles. 7/10
