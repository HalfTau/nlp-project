Just another retard that wants to climb everything you run past.  Combat is repetitive and boring after the third encounter, controls are slow and cumbersome.  If youre a creed fan, sure, but if you want to do something other than walk everywhere and get in trouble for killing things out of boredom, probably not your choice.
