I have played the AC series till the black flag. Dunno the native warrior clan is a solid plus to the good storyline in 18th century . Played it 2 times the 2nd time including many of the sidequests even sidequests  are pretty good.Every character is unique ex. Achilles Davenport.Welcomes the ship battles and more parkour moves. Hunting wild animals.Made a fan videojust a taste
