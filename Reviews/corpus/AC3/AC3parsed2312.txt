AC2 trilogy was the best game story I ever played, graphics were nice, control was good everything was fine.And now I started playing AC3 and I just feal sad cause this game suck so bad. It has nothing for it. Lot of graphics bug, like thing not showing, thing disappear and a lot of collusion bug. Maybe with a better engine the game will be controlable but this Anvilnext engine is carbage. Im not sure I will play another AC game, at least not with thie engine.I regret buying AC34 even if they were very cheap in steam sales.For me, AC stop at Revelation, after that Ubisoft is just trying to make money and dont care about us, gamers.
