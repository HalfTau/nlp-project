Alas, I beat the 3rd game after 51 hours of gameplay. This is one of my favirote, although it is the most different, Assassins Creed game in the series. I believe that just exploring and side missions gives this game a huge thumbs up for me, but what really takes the cake is the story. The plot is set with a different character and far from the old Altair and Ezio Auditore sequences of its original lineup crew. The story may be great, but maybe I really also enjoyed it because of the times we are fighting in 1750s1780s American Revolution and playing the unique Connor native american. Some complaints with the graphics would be the FPS drops in Boston and NY, but other than that I really have no complaints about it. Got it on the christmas sale for 7.50 and I defintely would recommend it for such a low price!The game is great, but I feel the best is still yet to come!
