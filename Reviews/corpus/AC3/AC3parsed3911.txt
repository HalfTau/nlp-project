Half the game is handholding prescripted linear sequences. The other half is cutscenes. The entire thing is a mess of badlyimplemented game mechanics revolving around a character with no personality being inexplicably shoehorned into every major event of the American revolutionary war. Avoid it unless you want to see how a great game like ACBrotherhood can be made worse in every possible way.
