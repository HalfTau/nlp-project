My second least favourite of the series, the first game taking position 1, gameplay is good and theres definitely a lot of content but the story failed to catch my interest, the protagonist is a little dull and the environments in which youll be playing in are boring, dull in colour, and there are way too many swamp areas with trees that are frustrating to climb. If you want the full story of the Kenway trilogy, then youre going to have to play this, and its definitely ok, just not great.7/10 imo, failed to keep my interest even when I decided to try the game again on consoles, but its assassins creed nevertheless and still provides a good free running experience. Black Flag was much better, even if the main character wasnt actually an assassin though.
