I have played the first AC series, then 2, Revelations and Brotherhood and those were awesome but for  sake this game is boring and sucks. Many stupid scenes to play like Connor as kid playing hide and seek, stoyline doesnt make much sense, amny stupid side objectives like hunt animals for no purpose at all. Way to end the story of Desmond Ubisoft with a  game.
