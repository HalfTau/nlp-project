Assassins Creed III AC3 continues Ubisofts epic saga, but brings the journey to a close for the games ultimate protagonist, Desmond Miles. While doing so, Ubisoft brings the Assassins to the colonial times of the 18th century and begins an enticing tale of the North American settlement. Following the games predecessors, AC3 still features parkourstyle movement and intense melee combat, but it also includes naval warfare to shake things up. The games naval battles are a fantastic addition that will leave you smelling the salt of the sea and have you jumping when unleashing your ships cannons. However, AC3 has some rather convoluted features such as hunting and arranging convoys. It is between these parts of the game that the menus become tedious and drag the main story along. Still, AC3 should not be passed up. If youre a fan then you must play AC3 to continue the story of the Assassins.
