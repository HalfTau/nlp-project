the storytelling takes precedence over the openworld feel of the previous entries.You are forced trough the game story trough a sizable amounts of cutscene, during what feels like a neverending introduction.You have very little freedom until very late in the game, and even then, youre more inclined to advance the story than unlock the gameworld elementsThe main character connor is dull, he is not an exciting character. he is being tagged along the events happening around him, rather than influencing them.Its a game you WISH were good, but ultimately it is like the main character  dull, because the AC gameplay was developped for an openworld city simulation matrix, while AC3 forces you into plotheavy sequences where the antiquated AC gameplay drags the game back.its a beautiful game, but the setting is boring. It has a good story, but the gameplay to go trough it is outdated, and the narrative is faulty.Pros  beautiful wildlife scenery great combat animations good storyCons  very slow start constant cutscenes interruption quick travel system is infuriating because it forces you in many loading screens boring setting outdated gameplay
