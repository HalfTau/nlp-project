Good, but not what I was expecting in the slightest. I give this game a negative review, not because it is a bad game, but because it does not follow the high standards set by the previous game. I do not suggest you begin the Assassins Creed franchise with this game, but rather Assassins Creed 2 or 4. I would only suggest this game to someone already immersed in the franchise or a fan of the seriesPros You return to the world of Assassins Creed Historical Accuracy Appealing Graphics Gameplay Mechanics Similar to AC1 / AC2 Free Run / Fighting Easter Eggs Hidden Secrets / Inside JokesCons Does not follow the high standards set by the previous games in the franchise Ending Multiplayer Fun at times, but generally boring and repetitive Hunting Seems like a good idea, but I found it to be boring and generally a waste of time Selling Goods In a nutshell you get recipes in the game and can use this weird interface to sell them and its pretty boring, I really have no idea why they put this in the game Main character Very boring personality and lacks depth in character
