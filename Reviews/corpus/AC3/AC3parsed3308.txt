In a brief overview, Assassins Creed III is a step backwards in the franchise but as the game itself it offers very little innovation. The music is forgettable and not very colorful throughout the game. The risk vs reward is not balanced correctly and collecting all the content and achieving 100 will leave the player left unsatisfied and ill rewarded. The story in the beginning is slow and takes a few hours of gameplay before the player is even allowed to explore the world. The present time story tries  to capture the audience but always leaves something more to be desired.The only thing positive worth as the consumer that you will get from this game is the naval battles. Its a small gem in a quagmire of a game. I would not recommend getting this game unless its discounted to around 5.00.
