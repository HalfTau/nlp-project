Im sure you already know if youre going to buy this game or not.  More than likely you know what the game entails, so Im just going to list off some pros and cons.ProsThe game is really good looking, especially for an openworld title.There is plenty of exploration, plenty of sidequests.Naval battles are a really cool addition to the series.The alternate take on the American revolution is kind of interesting, was almost like a refresher course.The game is fairly long, so you could easily spend hundreds of hours completing everything.ConsThe game is very buggy.  Buggy controls, buggy missions, buggy enemies, etc.The game says stealth, but dont expect to be doing any sneaking.  A lot of the time youre out in the open and there are few places to hide.It takes about 5 hours to play as the title character, Connor, as an adult.  So if youre expecting to be a badass assassin in a reasonable amount of time youll be disappointed.The game is utterly frustrating at times.
