Where do i begin. This game to me is the best in the series. This was my first assassins creed and man did i love it. The controls are well thought out. killing animations are slick. and best of all its set during the revolutionary war. Connor is a great character in this game. Some say he is the least lacking of character of all of the assassins  but he isnt  to me. You get to see him play as him when he is little and see him grow up into a assassin. There is alot of emotion to some of the characters in the game at some points in the story there is a good connection for connor and you feel his pain. You even get to play as connors father which is also very satisfying. In all this game is one of my favorite games and it will remain that way for a very long time.If on sale get it super cheap gives atleast 90 hours of content
