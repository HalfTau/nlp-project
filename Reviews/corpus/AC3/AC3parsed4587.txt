In all honesty quite possibly the best Assassins Creed game yet.  Graphics? Amazingly polished, detailed and sharp.  Gameplay? Awesome.  Fighting mechanics and animation? Even better while leaving your jaw dropping and going OOOHHH!!  No joking. Get this game, you will not regret it.   Plus you get to hear Benjamin Franklin talk about one of his favorite pastimes, Women.
