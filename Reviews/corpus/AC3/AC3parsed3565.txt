Assassins Creed III allows gamers to experience Connor Kenway and his father Haytham Kenway possibly the most awesome character in the series so far in the New World. Its refreshing to see the Assassins Creed series properly progress past Assassins Creed II and its two rather similar sequels. The graphics are beautiful and the environments are very detailed. There are also a host of new mechanics such as different fighting mechanics, hiding in undergrowth, climbing trees, and hunting. In a bizarre twist of fate, Connor also gets hold of a sailing ship, which opens a whole new realm of naval combat.AC III continues to have the fun factor of the Assassins Creed games  freerunning around in different environments is inherently an absolute gas. Unfortunately, the storyline is forgettable and a big deal is made out of hunting, which is much less fun than it sounds. The naval combat is fun and ambitious, but many other new features, such as the Assassins abilities, are much less interesting than they seem on face value.AC III closes the atrocious solar flare overall storyline and progresses the story of Desmond Miles. I suggest you play AC III once and appreciate it for what it is  a quantum leap forwards from the AC II series, not an increment  then move straight onto AC IV Black Flag, which is much better in every single way.
