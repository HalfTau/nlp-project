This game was really fun, but I will probably never buy an assassins creed game again.  The devs dont give aabout the community.If you get the DLC, you blatantly cant finish the last mission of the first episode because of a glitch.  How many years has this game been out again?  Its STILL not fixed.  Very poor, its unfortunate that the lack of support and the glitches exist, the games are phenomonal, and the story is great.
