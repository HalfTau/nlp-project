I really like this game, the new setting, better graphics... being able to climb trees, but holyis this game unoptimized. The reason why i would not recommend it is because it has this god awful shakey camera and low fps on high end hardware dont get me wrong the fps is fine for me, its the shakey cam, through out the game its like some sort of glitch. Now, it wont happen on all systems but it happend on mine. If it doesnt have this glitch well I would say have fun but if you have this glitch, i fell ya pain.
