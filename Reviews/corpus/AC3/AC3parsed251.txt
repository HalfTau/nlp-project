I bought this when it came out and I can say that I fully regret my decision. Back then, my PC could not handle such a huge game so I could not play it. Also, the gameplay is lacking in depth and sometimes you have no clue what you are doing. The price used to be about 50 dollars and I am mad. The scenery is good though but the files are very huge.
