Played and loved all the previous Assassins Creed games. What made them good was you actually wanted to be the Assassin, Altair or Ezio But then you have this one. No one wants to be Connor. Connor is like a little emo cutting cry baby. Id rather not have played this game. If youre gonna get an Assassins Creed game, Get the previous ones. Assassins Creed, Assassins Creed 2, Assassins Creed Brotherhood, and finally Assassins Creed Revelations.
