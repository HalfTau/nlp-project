I tried, but I just cant do it. With the exception of a brief segment where the games dialogue is all in Kanienkeha Mohawk language, this game is stultyfying. Its so boring it grates on me to think about playing. When I fail a mission desynchronize it enrages me primarily because I just want it to end. And since the bugs and controls are so brutal that I fail a bunch of missions, it just isnt ending of its own accord. So I have to end it myself. /uninstall
