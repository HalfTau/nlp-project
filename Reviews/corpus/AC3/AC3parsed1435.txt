Amazing game! Great graphics, an intriguing story, thought out side quest, naval misions make me want to become a pirate!. I beat the story in 6 days. Its not very short i just played nonstop About the only trouble I had was when I first downloaded the game I had to get uplay along with it. The game would not save for some reason I replayed the begining about six times untill I found a fix. you have to download uplay manually from the website.
