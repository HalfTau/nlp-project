Personally I love everything about this game, even if I didnt play it that much as you can see I only spent around three hours on the game. Theres nothing wrong with the game its self, everything is fine about the game. In my opinion the SYSTEM is messed up UPlay. You need a stupid account for the game and half the times it messes up so youll have a really really long time trying to figure out how it works.
