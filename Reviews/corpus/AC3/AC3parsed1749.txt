Easily one of the most memorable games in the franchise. The originality of the Frontier maps and the Connor character, along with the great gameplay mechanics for treerunning is awesome. If you are a fan of the franchise, you will enjoy it.If you are new, this could make for a good start but the engrossing story makes some references to the previous games. You wont miss anything but you will surely enjoy it even more if you have played them.
