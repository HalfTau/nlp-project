Great game, until you get to Boston. My modest Dual Core Pentium system was able to handle high detail through the Opera House and on the ship on the way to Boston. Once I got to Boston, though, the framerate immediately dropped to about 1520FPS. Which is completely unplayable. Looking away from Boston, its fine. Try to do anything in town and it stutters and stammers like crazy. Low detail and lowest resolution dont help nearly enough if at all?. Buy this game, but for the sake of your sanity, buy it on console.
