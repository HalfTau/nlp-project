While it was a lot of fun to play, this game suffers from some serious bugginess, which we can assume at this point is how its going to stay. From Trade caravans getting stuck forever, to enemies that dont seem to die when they should. At times, the story seems a bit forced as well.If you like the Assassins creed games, its worth your time, but if finish and polish is super important, you may go insane.
