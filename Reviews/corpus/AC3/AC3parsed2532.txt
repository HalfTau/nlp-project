Ive only played one Assassins Creed game this one. I am convinced this must be the worst in the series, based on other peoples opinions, and sincerely regret picking this up. I really like games that have what I call sneaky sneaky. I was sure that this game would fully satisfy my desire to stealthily slaughter an entire town and never be caught. But I couldnt. And it was lame. 4/10
