The game itself is great... when it runs. On consoles, this game has no trouble, since that is what it was originally developed for. However, on PC, its a mess. Random crashes everywhere, low performance on great hardware, and of course, the Uplay software. This is the first and last Assassins Creed I buy for PC. Im not going to support Ubisofts lazy and halfconsole ports. By buying this, youre only allowing yourself to be punished with third party software and horrible support. Dont waste the money.TLDR Great game, horrible console port. Pirate it if you want a version that will actually run halfway decent.
