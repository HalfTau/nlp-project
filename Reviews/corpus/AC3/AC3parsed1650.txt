Easily the worst in the series so far, Ive played all the games up to this one and have never been so frustrated. I feel they tried to simplify the controls, but it now feels like you have to forcefully smash in each input which ruins the flow of the game, and even then some of the inputs dont register. Completely ruined the experience for me.
