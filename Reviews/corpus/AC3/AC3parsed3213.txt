Worst AC in the series. Story is ok, but weakest of the series. Completely changed the controls so if you played an AC before this game your muscle memory is going to get you in trouble, I played BH, Revelations prior to this.Desmond stuff is boring again.No real point having money in this game, stock weapons are pretty much the best there is, no armor upgrades, and no real point to do anything except the main mission. So its basically run or fast travel from one mission start to another.Only reason I played it was to wrap up the story line.
