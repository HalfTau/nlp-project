I wasnt initially going to key up a review for the game, since after five years anyone who wanted to play it has probably already done so, still I couldnt move onto Liberation without first expressing my discontent with its predecessor.The biggest issue was with the bugs and crashes, after five years Id have thought such things would have been patched up, but alas they persist.Lockpicking was another big concern. Ive seen lockpicking in a lot of games, but Assassins Creed III does the worst job of pulling it off. Too many times it would glitch out, not that things were much better when it was working as intended. The whole thing was too sensitive and percise, and then too chaotic towards the end. Id much rather of held a button for 3 seconds or pressed a button to view an automated lockpicking animation.Horse riding. The whole thing was so contradictory, it seemed like the horse could casually leap over things that it should struggle with, while the smallest of obstacles would block its path, and then theres all the nonsense with trying to shoot while riding.I cant recommend the game in its current state, but after five years of neglect, its current state is its finished state, so I guess Ill never be able to recommend the game.If youre just now picking up the Assassins Creed series and are playing through them, you may wish to just watch a cutscenes video instead and skip over this one and save yourself the aggrivation.
