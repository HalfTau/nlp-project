I was afraid of buying the game at first because of negative reviews. But personaly I loved it. The one complaint I have is all the loading when traveling from one zone to another, its quick but it makes me feel a bit disoriented if that makes sense. It has also managed to keep me hooked more than any other Assasins Creed has been able to, thats mostly because it takes quite a while before you get to play the main character and after you do get to play him it takes a while before he gets his iconic outfit.
