this game is okay, not as good as the ezio trilogy. i liked how the ezio games had roof tops that were close together and easy to navigate but this game doesnt really have that, its more open and you do more running on the ground than on roofs. the boats were not fun to use and i quickly stopped doing the missions and just went through the main story missions.
