The only thing that could make this game more Bostonian is a DLC where you play as Samuel Adams himself  weilding a pint of his Summer Ale in one hand and a Hidden Blade in the other  climbing to the top of the Old State House and then diving bladefirst onto a redcoats face while screaming WIKKID PISSAAAAAAAAH!
