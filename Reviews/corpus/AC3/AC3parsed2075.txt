My wireless xbox 360 controller basically does not work for this game  so it is a lie to say there is controller support.  Id ask for a refund, but you cant get refunds with digital distribution platforms like Steam.Actually, the controller does work once right after reinstalling the drivers for it, but if the controller goes into sleep mode and is restarted, it cant detect it.  If you close the game and steam, start up the controller, and reopen it, it doesnt work.  If you restart your computer and reopen it, the controller still cant be detected.  So, basically, theres no controller support for wireless xbox 360 controllers.If anyone found a way to make a wireless xbox 360 controller work for this game, please let me know.Also, my wife wanted to play it with Mandarin subtitles.  We eventually figured out that theres a steam setting you have to change to make them work right click  properties  language.  However, she tells me the subtitling was incomplete, like only part of the game has subtitles and the rest does not.  I cant verify that, but thats disappointing as well.
