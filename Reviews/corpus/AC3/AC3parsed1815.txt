Its a shame that this game is usually looked at as the worst in the series. I believe the story, the characters and the setting are all excellent. The American Revolution is a perfect backdrop for the Assassin/Templar struggle. You get to play a piviotal role in many famous battles, that any history buff would love.The biggest con for me is that of the entire series, this game has the poorest optimzation for the pc. I can run Unity with max resolution, but ACIII overheated my system several times. Still playable, just a pain waiting for reboot.
