Such an amazing game set in the american revolution, and with both sides of the templar/assassin war shown with their real values for the first time instead of just telling you, hey go kill these guys, theyre bad. granted, you still cant be a templar, but play as one in the prologue, even if you dont know that at first... overall great game though
