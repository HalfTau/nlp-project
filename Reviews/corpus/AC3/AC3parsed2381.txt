I dont know what to think about this Assassins Creed 3...from one side I really liked the New Frontier setting, the feeling of exploration and discovery, plus naval battles which are really enjoyable and a breeze of fresh air in this series of games.On the other side I found a very repetitive gameplay, the same old mechanics repeated continuously, not so interesting missions and a main character that needs some of Ezios charm. Add to that a poor optimization from a technical point of view, primarily when you visit the big cities of Boston and New York.AC3 story, in my personal list, is a bit more interesting than Revelations, but it will never reach previous chapters like AC2 and Brotherhood. Unfortunately, also Desmond tales ending is weak and confusing, leaving the player a bit disappointed after 5 games ! that built high expectations about First Civilizations mysteries.So why have you played more than 50 hours if this game is not that good and interesting? Well, because Im an achievements , and generally I like to explore every little inch of the games I play, and AC3 world is BIG, thats why! Probably it can be finished in about 2025 hours if you do all primary and secondary missions, leaving some achievements alone.To conclude, buy Assassins Creed 3 if you really like the historical period and if you want to see Desmonds finale at all costs, but if you are looking for innovation, please go ahead.
