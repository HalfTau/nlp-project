I vote this as the SECOND BEST Assassins Creed game. First being Revelations, third being AC4BFGood performance over my crap rigPretty good story.Fun gameplayThe starting part is kindof boring ship and the first protoganist.Controls are terrible like any other AC game. Itll take a while to get used to it, so playing through 23 AC games in a rowis a good idea.I r8 8/10 m8.
