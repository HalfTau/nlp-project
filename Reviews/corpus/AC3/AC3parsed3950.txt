There is nothing wrong with this game dont get me wrong but there is nothing here that wasnt in the previous games with Ezio. Even the original character Altair from assassins creed 1 who had as much character as a brick had more personality than this main character Connor. Even after his village gets burned down RPG 101 style I couldnt sympathise with him. If youve played Assassins Creed 1 and 2 dont bother with this one, its not bad just boring, which a mean feat considering the premise of this game.
