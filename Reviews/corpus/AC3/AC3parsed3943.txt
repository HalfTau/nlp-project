I liked the first one because it was something new. I enjoyed the second one  I guess because I wasnt sick of it yet? It fleshed out some mechanics, carried some improvements, and introduced a decent story, maybe that was enough. The sequels  to the second I accepted because they didnt have their own number.This one finally did the trick though, Im now disillusioned with this damn series. Its the same game in a new skin.
