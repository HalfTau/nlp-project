All it has done is add things that could have been in earlier games and has improved already existing things. It has its good points but this is probably the worst in the franchise, I feel like it hardly relates to the other games and the story that is here is uninteresting. It takes ages before you actually become Connor the Assassin not until about sequence 5. Also Assassins Creed III has become just Creed because there is very little assassinating and a lot of doing random stuff. Connor is a dull main character and he makes Desmond look awesome even though Desmond is painfully boring. Connors missions are boring and sometimes frustratingly difficult and in comparison the Desmond parts are better for the second game in a row. I also thought that the ending of the game was quite a let down. If youre not a fan dont buy this game, only buy it in a sale if you want to try it out.
