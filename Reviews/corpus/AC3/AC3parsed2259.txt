Assassins Creed 3 is part of a long line of games that im a huge fan of so this review is a little biased, fair warning.The game takes place around the revolutionary war, you take the role of a native american child forced into the conflict who tries to save his people with the training of an old assassin but through the game mistakes are made, battles are lost and people fall all because one jerk couldnt keep it in his pants.This is one of the last assassins creed games that gave you access to several different weapon types, after this they started restraining you to a type of sword or big weapon and your hidden blades so combat is whatever you want to make of it, a fast skirmish with large axes or a long duel with a dagger. The place this games combat shines is using the special tools at your disposal to lay traps or ambush enemy soldiers like an assassin.The assassins creed franchise is known for its free running, its a core part of every single game and this game took a lot of steps to improve it and even change some aspects but overall its still the same old issue of no i didnt say jump on that!. Despite that its still satisfying to run along roof tops stabbing red coats which is good because the way the map works. In previous assassins creed games youd go to a certain area and reveal a large chunk of the map, in this that still happens but you cant get all the map that way you need to run along certain areas to cut through the fog which is deeply aggrivating.The story of assassins creed 3 really shines out through the entire franchise, in past games its was a simple story line that didnt really attach you to the character much without going through 3 games in ezios case. In assassins creed 3 the main character goes through several mistakes, victories and loses on his quest to save his people that by the end you find it hard not to feel sad for him, it really is the best part of the game.As a tripple A title lots of things slip through the cracks and the game is left unoptimized as hell but this one still does a lot of things well, i give it an 8/10, if youre a fan of the series this is not a game to skip.
