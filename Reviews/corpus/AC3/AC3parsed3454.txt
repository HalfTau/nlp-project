A Vast improvement over the other games in the series. While continuing the excellent story line.This game is full of amazing detail in every aspect Story, Graphics, ambiance, environment, sound and more.I would recommend this for the mere fact that it is always fun to play, and theres just so much to do in it.Just finished The Tyranny of Washington DLC, and its a must play if you enjoyed AC3. It also seems to set up AC4 in a minor way, but excellent story driven DLC however.
