While I personally enjoy this game to some extent, it is not for everybody. What threw off most people is how slow the game is for the first 34 hours. It does pick up after that, but a lot of your time is spent running around from cutscene to cutscene with an action setpiece every now and then. While I personally am a fan of more storydriven cinematic games, dont play this game if you want nonstop actionpacked assassin awesomeness. Go play Black Flag if you want that.As for the story itself, its good. It tells a personal story of Connor, and there is a lot of development in the characters of Achilles and the villains. However, Connor himself is a very boring and uninteresting protagonist. The combat is good, but very easy. All you have to do is counter, break defense, and then kill.Overall, I would recommend this game if you enjoy a very immersive world, and good story, if a bit slow moving.
