This was one of my top GOTY of 2013 due to the fact that it was the best out of the entire series up to date, and yes ENEMY DROWNS IN THIS ONE WOOO!Anyways to top it off some of the most memorable characters and music exist in this game, too bad they make very short cameo. As a player youll be working in Abstergo and entering the animus to relive the life of Edward Kenway and youll be sailing a large area of the Caribbean sea during the age of piracy. more than 40 of the game takes place in the sea which youll be sailing and pirating.This is quite possibly the BEST pirate game up to date without the stereotypical aspects of piracy. Just traveling your boat around in the ocean is quite fun and the weather system is greatGraphic is great on this especially if you have the card to go farther and the monitor. Dont hateMusic is fantastic, so are the sound effects.Water effects is WOW and the weather with the storm and winds is fantasticThe pirates sing shanty on your queue and itll get stuck in your headVoice acting is superb in thisSailing for hours in the sea and just pirating people Sailing, Storms, Taking over Forts, Attacking epic pirate ships, WHALING AND HUNTING ANIMALS cough farcry 3 glad they brought that in, Undersea exploration and more. The costumes can either be ugly or great to some this is all depending on your preference Theres tons of collectables, sometimes can be quite a nuiscance to collectSome of the costumes are meh Samemultiplayer, I played it in all creeds, all they did really was upgrade a new mode and added some new moves, it gets dry really fast after playing maybe a couple of days then youll eventually forget it even exists. Wolfpack is interesting but gets dry.story was decent. Ending was super expected if you follow the series.Some of the really awsome characters in this game make REALLY short cameos, Kid the pirate and blackbeard etc. They are fantastic and memorable but you didnt get much time with them to feel the connection This game was bugged when it came out, I couldnt 100 it and drove me nutsNot enough end game content You can only fight 4Overall a much better game than all previous games, will make it hard to replay the old ones if you touch this one, even going back to HD remakes will make you go bleh.
