Buggy game! !Unfortunately this will be my last Assassins Creed game.This one had a bug preventing gamers from advancing into sequence 12. Luckly theres a weird fix that the community found. But I shouldnt spend hours for an unofficial fix for an AAA title.The series lasted far too long. Its time to part ways. Obviously Ubisoft cares only to milk gamers at this stage and it shows with every new title..
