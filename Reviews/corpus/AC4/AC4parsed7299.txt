This is one of the greatest game I have ever played. I have never spent over 10 hours straight on any game before until playing this. This is unlike any other Assassins Creed game made before it. The naval and sea battles are a massive part of this game and I love it. The effects and gameplay, cut scenes and story, graphics and detail, just about everything you look for in a good game is here and ten times over. It is vast and endless and will end up racking up some serious hours on this game. The things you can do on this game are unreal! Even if you didnt like other Assassins Creed games or have never even played one, you must get this. Hours upon hours of fun!
