After the horrendousness that was Assassins Creed III, I swore off this series, certain that they had decided to churn out anything so long as a new chapter was out every year. A few rave reviews by friends had me dusting off the Xbox controller, and I cautiously dipped my toe into the water that is Assassins Creed IV.Two weeks later Ive played this game for more hours than my full time job and feel like Ive barely scratched the surface  thoroughly enjoying the ride. Its reminded me of everything I loved about this franchise, and Im very grateful to have the opportunity to live it again.Recommended!
