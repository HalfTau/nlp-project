Tail Mission, The GameAfter a promising start, by chapter 8 the game disintegrates into a hodgepodge of bad level design and listless characters.I think I played 9 tail missions in a row before I ragequitted just now. And its all the same nonesense you follow a group of characters, skirting the bushes, and trying to avoid enemy soldiers. At some point the game draws a circle around them and you have to stay inside of it. A few seconds away from it and you die and have to restart from an earlier checkpoint. The circle is for eavesdropping, but you dont really get a chance to listen in because youre distracted.The fighting is another infuriating mechanic its a button mashing marathon and RNGeezus decides how fast you kill. You might walk up and shank two guys, instantly killing them, or you might twirl like a moron for half a minute. Seriously, one time I mashed an UNARMED guy with my two swords for nearly a minute before he finally died. Stupid.You can rake corpses for bullets, but not during ship boarding. You can also rake for them during fortress capture, but not after you killed the couple of guys youre meant to kill. You can hold your breath for minutes in underwater salvage missions, but not while sneaking around in water. Its open world! But you constantly ram into area unavailable walls, because you didnt play some mission yet. You can climb buildings and hide in the bushes, but you cant walk through invisible wall between two trees during a tail mission. GRRRR! The tail missions! Lazy.This is what this game is lazy and rushed. All just to churn out yet another Asscreed game. Throw in some enemy soldiers, make two models walk a path, record 30 seconds of pointless dialog, and you got yourself a tail mission. Tail Mission, The Game.Dont waste your money.P.S. you can leave your game open round the clock and Steam will still count the hours as played Ill be damned if Id wasted 300 hours on this turd, it was a lot less
