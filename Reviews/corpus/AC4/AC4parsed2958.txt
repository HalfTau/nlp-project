i would give this game 3 out 5 , would not buy it at full price , towards the end of the game it seemed to drag on and on and got kinda repetitive and tedious. my 1st AC game that i have played in a while i had forgotten how much lack of choice in the story, being more use to RPGs like skyrim where i can choose my own path. will only buy AC games if they are under 20 i think.
