At the very start of the game, on the very first moment where you gain control, I encountered a broken trigger bug, causing me to have to restart. I got PTSD flashbacks to the buggy mess that was AC3. After working through my trauma with a therapist and support group over a period of two months, I resumed playing. Then I got to the chase scene when youre going after the assassin and I desynched because the target got out of range because my character failed to jump where I wanted them to. I dont even care if the ship combat is the fun part, its not worth suffering through the onfoot gameplay of AC3, and its certainly not worth it for the story. Im glad that the Cognitive behavior therapy skills I learned in my treatment program allowed me to tolerate this second attempt at the game without having an episode.
