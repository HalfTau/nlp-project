Theres definitely some repetitiveness to this game, especially with naval warfare being a centerpiece of the game. Combat is hasnt really evolved since AC1 parry and counterattack everything. The story though, is excellent. Dont bother playing if your machine isnt good enough the lag will irk you to no end.
