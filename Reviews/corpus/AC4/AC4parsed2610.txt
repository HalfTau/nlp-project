I so wanted to recommend this game. I have the PS4 version and wouldve loved it on PC too, however, I cant even start the game! UPlay is one of the worst things that Ubisoft ever introduced. I was meant to get an activation code via email so I could start playing...the code never came through and there was no option to resend an activation code. If you love this game, dont get it for PC, get it for your Xbox or your PS.That aside, if you can get on, shoot me a message on how you actually managed it, Id love to actually start this game!BCB
