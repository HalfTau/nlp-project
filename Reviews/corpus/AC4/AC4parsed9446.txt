Youre an assassin...whos a pirate...The game seems fun enough, but it feels like they added in considerable amounts of open water sailing to lengthen the game. A similar issue as to wind waker in the Zelda series. Outside of that issue it was relatively fun. I hadnt played Assassins Creed since the 2nd game and it has progressed a fair amount.That all being said, if you liked the others you should like this one.
