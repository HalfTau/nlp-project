The Assasins creed Franchise is getting tired.And this is no exception, the initial game played very much into te hands of outside interaction with Ezios real world alter ego. Like anyone actually cared about that.This is just the same as every other game...but with ships.5.5/10  still a good environment to run around stab people.
