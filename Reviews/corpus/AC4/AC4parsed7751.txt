In truth if you enjoyed AC3 then you will like this game.Assassins creed again. It is often said about the latest AC games that it is just like the old ones, with new weapons, a few new mechanics and new storyline.I see this as a good thing, nay, a great thing. Assassins Creed has stepped from its astounding beginnings each time building on what was liked in the last game and added new features.This is no exception, the main storyline is that you are hired in to ubisoft to create a new animus game of assassins. An amusing twist on the reality of the game, with significant and amusing backstory put into it.The clunky ship battles of AC3 are now much better and integral to the game, a little annoying at times, but still a lot of fun.And the characters are more developed for fun than any great historical myth.
