I would say this game is worth a purchase on sale, but not at full price.Im one of those people that stares, mouth ajar, at how people have actually kept up with this series. I only played 1 and 2 and found that was enough. How do you people stand playing so many sequels? This is the third and last AC title I intend on playing, and I think it was a decent one to go out on because the pirate flavour is downright refreshing and honestly pretty fun.The game has great graphics, nice environments and the highlight of the game is just sailing around in your ship, listening to your crew singing away and getting into naval battles which are quite fun and satisfying.My three complaints about the game are1. The Assassins Creed part of the game was just plain unwanted for me. Dont get me wrong, I appreciate the parkour and stealth systems that are in place but I really just wanted to be a pirate. I really dont give the slightestabout the overarching plot or the more traditional AC missions that the game forces me to do.2. The hand to hand combat is pretty bad. It feels pretty weak, lacking any serious visceral impact. I think this is due to outdated animation quality and a lack of proper feedback. Its also laughably easy.3. This game is not well optimized. Its not as terrible as something really bad like Fallout 4 but the performance is not consistent.That said, I do think the game is worth bothering with as I had fun with it, despite its problems.
