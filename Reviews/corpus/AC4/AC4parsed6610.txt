Havent really finished the game, but the naval warfare is the feature I love most in the game. While some of the missions are repetitive and the landscape is quite boring, there are some memorable side quest like hunting fish and raiding bigger ships and upgrading my ship to which I really enjoy. The sailing it self through the ocean with beautiful sunset in the horizon is a pleasure on its own.It may not be the best in the franchise, but I dont mind on recomending it to my mates.God bless you
