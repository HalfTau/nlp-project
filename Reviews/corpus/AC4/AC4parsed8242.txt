This game feels exactly the same as the previous assassins creed games, but it is still great! It has an amazing storyline which is new and is not heavily based off the previous games, so even if you are new to the series it is still an enjoyable story. The combat and free running is as beautifull as it has always been, and making boats a major priority in this one was quite cool D
