I love Pirates if u cant ing tell like really my favorite anime is one piece this aint bad its a little boring and hated some of the story missions but when they are all done U GOT A SHIP TO ROAM FREE and BLOW THE HELL OUT OF EVERYONE YOU SEE and max out the ship its boring but if u got some time i would say this is a game to play if u like pirates just beat the story and while ur doing that slowy work to yo ship upgrades then u can yell at ur moniter in joy
