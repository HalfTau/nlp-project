This game is fantastic if you are looking for a fun pirate/action game. Its got some stealth elements thrown in that you can totally ignore or embrace, depending on how you like to play. The open world is huge and fun to explore however a few things are locked until late in the story like Diving Zones, and the Rope Dart, I think you get that in the second to last mission. The story is interesting but absolute garbage to play. It is an endless parade of tail and evesdrop missions whose biggest variation is tailing in you ship as opposed to tailing on foot. I CANNOT OVERSTATE HOW MANY TAILING MISSIONS ARE IN THIS GAME. However you arent forced to do the story missions do most of the pirate stuff which was the biggest selling point for me.
