A great game, builds off the originals. It takes place before AC3 but its so much better. The few bugs I noticed, which mainly just gave me laughs, were very few and far between. Itll give you a pretty damn long campaign, took me about 10 hours for the main story, with tons of extra content after it. The DLC Freedom Cry is ok, its pretty fun and there are quite a few bugs. Overall a great game definately worth the buy, especially with the season pass.
