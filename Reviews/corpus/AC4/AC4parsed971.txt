The best AC for me so far. Naval combat is insane fun. Everything else is more of the same you kill everyone everywhere, only now with 4 pistols. The story is almost nonexistent in my view. The atmosphere and the setting is gorgeous. I just wish my crew wouldnt be made of such wussies, they stop stinging every three seconds when a new gust of wind comes from another direction.
