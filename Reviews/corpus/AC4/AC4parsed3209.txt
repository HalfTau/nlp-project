Id only recommend this game if you want to play a repeat of 2 and 3 with different characters. Driving the boat was pretty neat, but I got bored with everything else after a few hours of playing. At least I bought it for a really good price, so Im not upset about it. Ill keep it installed and play it periodically when I feel like getting vertigo.
