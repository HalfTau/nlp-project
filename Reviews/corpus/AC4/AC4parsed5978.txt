Another great story told through the Assassins Creed games. I just love how they give their own twist on history.Also it is very much like a fusion between Assassins Creed and Pirates of the Caribbean from the original Xbox. Wouldve loved to upgrade to a larger ship but oh well.I hate the ingame advertisements and microtransactions that EA implemented in. It is so distracting its like Can I just please play my game in peace?Overall, Id buy this game again.
