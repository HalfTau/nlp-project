Its a fun game and loved it while I could. Spent many hours over it and got maybe 50 of the way through the story. I am conflicted to play it again as my harddisk failed and backups didnt have the save game folder which is outside of Steams install paths Note backup the Ubisoft programs folder with your save games.
