Breathing life into a very stale franchise, Assassins Creed IV is a standout in the series. Going farther than other games, it does an outstanding job of world building, and gives plenty of missions to participate in. While the present day story is rather forgetable, running around with Kenway and the crew is always an enjoyable time.
