Loved this game! It has been awhile since a game had me glued to it till the end. I could not play any of my other games till I beat it. The story could have been a bit better towards the end, it seemed as though loose ends were accomplished at break neck speed, whereas the rest of the game had more content in which to be completed optionally towards the goals. The combat system is pretty much still same a revamp would be refreshing on that same note ship vs ship at the beginning was difficult maybe due to getting acquainted with the controls, but by sequence seven I believe the Jackdaw began to become over powered. I mean in the last two or three sequences the Jackdaw was unstoppable. I had a favorite character die on me in a very silly turn of events, but historically accurate and has left me still upset about it. Now I dont even know where to start about all the reasons why I fell in love with this game, it definitely outweighs all the cons I listed. I would like to make a list but it would spoil a lot of the game.
