Its so easy to get lost in this game for hours. The openworld within Edwards story is amazing. Now, the metastory tying this franchise together has gotten...subpar. But that can be easily ignored in favor of chasing down every last manowar. This almost enables Skyrimlevels of procrastination, at least for me.
