The Game itself is great. Easily the best AC game since AC 2. But since you have to use Uplay, it ruins the whole experiance. If you can get Uplay to even run, youll see yourself playing many hours of black flag only for Uplay to erase all of your progress. Because of Uplay I cannot recomend this game at all or any Ubisoft game.
