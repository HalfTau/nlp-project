I loved the original and the sequel! I didnt buy any of the others but this had such glowing reviews that I had to have it! Then I played it... Ive played this game for 10 hours and owned it for months. Its unfortunate that this game isnt as polished or well ported to the pc. Whenever my health got low my screen would shrink to about 1/8 its size and stay in the upper left hand corner or my monitor. When my health regained a bit the problem would be fixed, until I was injured again, forced to view the game in a 6x4 window.It was honestly a waste of 60. Im not sure if they patched it, but from what I played it wasnt gripping enough to even make me check. This is the last 60 Ubisoft will recieve from me. I still have Assassins Creed and Assassins Creed II, and those are amazing. This is just... lacking, and/or broken.
