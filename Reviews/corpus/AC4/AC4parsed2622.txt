Best assassins creed game ever. there I said it.only question I have is why does Jack just naturally know how to do this stuff? he was never an assassin, and never is an assassin throughout the entire game. hes his own man. nobody taught him how to do any assassins moves but hes just as good as altier or ezio?what up wit dat?great game though. I like his carefree attitude. they should scrap whatever they are doing and just make black flag part two. was fricken awesome.
