It is very fun to play, both in seas and lands, plundering is everywhere, the contents of the game is 11/9 BUT there is 1 thing that makes me sad, you couldnt capture the legendary ships and send it to yer docks, I know it sounds crazy to have a legendary ships in yer collections but, why not? lol. Btw it is really worth yer money, happy pirating lads.
