Awesome Assassins Creed Experience! The ship battles were my favorite addition. The regular fighting and assassin missions were done well.This is definitely not a revolutionary addition to the franchise but it is very enjoyable. If you dont like ship battles just try and stick to the main storyline only.If you love the ship action this could get quite addictive
