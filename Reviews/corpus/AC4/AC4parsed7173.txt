The GOOD Beautiful game. Enviroment looks amazing. Everything looks amazing. Sometimes I just stare at the landscape. The free running mechanics look and feel great. It is fun to just run around and see what you can climb and jump off of. Swimming from sharks is awesome, gets the heart pumping. Driving the boat is a blast. Ramming into others, boarding their ships and killing their crews, lots of fun.The OK Storyline, fun but, you know, whatever. Open World but not really. Not if youre expecting Skyrim. You can point your gun at anything which is awesome or you can just press the fire button so he just points automatically and kills perfectly. Thanks for making me more invincible than I already was. Following and listening quests are kind of redundant and annoying. Whaling is fun. Avoiding tornados and huge waves is fun.The BAD Once you finish the story not much else to do really. You get your own fleet but its like a lame video game from ancient times controlling it. Combat is overpowered. Youre invincible once you get down the buttonclick pattern down. yThank goodness the enemy only attack one at a time even though they outnumber you. Lame.RECOMMENDED 6.5/10   above average, lots of fun, not much replayability, but worth the try.
