The most complete AC game as of yet. I have to say, I have no problem with Ubisoft milking the hashashin out of their cow if the games are like this.It playes very much like previous titles of the franchise. A bigger world to explore is present this time, both on subsea level, and above water. With your ship, the Jackdaw, youll have to fight one Man o War after another, plunder poor Spanish fishing boats, and travel from the north Caribbean all the way through to the south.This time around you get to experience the endevours of Edward Kenway, a man who dreams of money, ladies, and freedom. Or should I say WENCHES, GOLD, AND RUM. Yarr. Something. Pirates. Aye.
