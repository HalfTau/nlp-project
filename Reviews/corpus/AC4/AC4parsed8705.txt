Great game, but PC port is completely broken. Im not exactly new to this PC business and my system is more than adequate to play. However, I cant due to constant freezing every five minutes unless the graphics are turned down to the absolute minimum. Ubisoft has once again outdone themselves with a horribly broken and unplayable product. Check the forums for more info on the sheer number of problems on this port. Unacceptable.
