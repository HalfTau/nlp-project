First , I must reveal my bias , I dislike the Assassins Creed games series. I also tend to get bored of any and all sandbox games in approximately 1 week or so.However i would classify this game as neither Assassins Creed or a sandbox. It is a maritime pirate simulator and a damn good one at that. The naval battles are incredible and like nothing else i have seen in a game so far. It makes it come alive firing broadside cannons , chasing frigates , boarding ships and taking them over. For that alone I would recommend the game.Unfortunately the straw that broke the camels back was Uplay.At time of writing I lost 2 weeks worth of gameplay. All of it gone and this is an old problem Ubifost has not resolved judging by forum threads.Sadly I cannot recommend this game for the poor support it received.
