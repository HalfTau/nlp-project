Absolutely Superb.The Gameplay, graphics, and lasting appeal are at some of the highest standards to be set in Action/RPG gaming. ACIV  does not need any intoduction, and new players to the series or people who have not liked previous AC games, definately will want to give this a try. Although the story is not as engageing as ACII, the game its self is definately the most fun AC game yet. It retains the stealth elements of previous titles, yet unlocks a whole kind of game unlike anything Ubisoft has produced for us. I havent had this much fun being a pirate since Pirates of the Caribbean Online.10/10 Overall astonishly fun open world with lots to do.
