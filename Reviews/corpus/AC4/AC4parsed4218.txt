By Far the best Assassin Creed Ive played. Storyline is not the greatest but the free roam aspect of the game is really well done. Not to mention the awesome naval combat which is nothing short of outstanding. The idea of managing your ships crew, taking down and boarding other vessels is one elemnet which they really perfected in this game. The character customization could be worked on and their are a fairly small amount of weapon choices which could also be improved. The melee combat is one of the best ever with a wide range of moves and some awesome different stealth takedowns. Not to mention the amazing graphics which are one of the best ive ever seen, let alone in an Assassin Creed game. Overall I highly recommend this game, by far the best Assassins Creed and deffiently worth a play.
