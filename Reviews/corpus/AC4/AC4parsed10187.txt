If youve played any of the Assassins Creed series you know what to expect coming in to this game.  Kill templars, kill templars and kill templars.  Like other titles in the series this one can be a bit repetitive but I for one am a fan of the series and this was just the next step after AC3.  Theyve improved the ship combat and brought it into the forefront and lets just say that playing as a pirate was awesome.The world is huge and I never found myself running out of things to do.  In fact I kept getting distracted and sailing all over the world instead of progressing through the story.  If you enjoyed any of the Assassins Creed titles then Im sure youll enjoy this one as well.
