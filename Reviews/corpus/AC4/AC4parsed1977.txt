Ubisoft employeeIm gonna make this really cool pirate game.BossWe need another assassins creed with slow walking sections, terrible stealth missions, horrible melee combat, and the stickiest parkour system ever.EmployeeCan it have pirate battles where the player can raid another ship, kill the crew and take whatever he pleases?BossOnly if whatever he pleases is boring loot for our slower than molases artificial progression system. Oh. And remember to lock all the cool unlocks behind 20 hours of slow walking and cutscenes.EmployeeWell can they at least steal ships like a pirate so they can build a fleet and conquer the sea?BossThat actually sounds kinda cool. How about we make a boring pointless minigame about that so we can say that you can do it in the trailers,EmployeeWell, at least its gonna be an open ended experience where freedom and player choice are valued above pointless distractions and linear missions.BossYou mean like a huge open world with nothing but linear missions and mini games sprinkled around our large and mostly empty map?Assassins creed franchiseKill me,Note The game runs like an overweight turtle, but there is a rather complex and difficult solution that should double your frame rate, if not tripple. Find a program called d3doverrider which can force tripple buffering and fix a stupid glitch in game that caps the frame rate lower and lower every time you lag.For computery stupid science reasons you cant do this easily through the nvidia control panel.
