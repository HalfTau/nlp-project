I wasnt excited for this game because its predecessor was a huge fiasco, but this game really surprised me! It gives a huge map, many upgrades and costumes, while the activities vary from harpooning too running around town to catch new shanties. The combat mechanics are the same from the previous ones, which are too damn simple for a game series that has so many sequels and time to be refined. Overall the game is addictive and gives you lots of things to do.
