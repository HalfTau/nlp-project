Black Flag is the best Assassins Creed game since Brotherhood, and arguably the best of the series period. While Ubisoft still doesnt seem 100 comfortable allowing players to do as they please instead of railing them into linear, objectivebased sequences, Black Flag allows for much more freedom than any other Assassins game. The naval combat is the standout feature, and stays fresh thanks to an compelling upgrade system and catchy collectable! sea shanties to be sung by your jolly crew of merry marauders. If youre tired of the sameold Assassins Creed experience, this entry will go a long way in reigniting your enthusiasm.
