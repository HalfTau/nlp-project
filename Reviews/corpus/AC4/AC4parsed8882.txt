This latest installment to the assassins creed franchise is fun to play, has an interesting story and improved game mechanics. i was especially pleased with the pc controls, as in assassins creed III it was obvious it was made for controllers, as you only had 4 weapon shortcuts to represent the pad on a controller. after completion of the game the randopm freeplay gets slightly boring, but that happens with most games and is to be expected.
