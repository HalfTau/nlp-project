O, we be pyrates!Thank the stars that Ubisoft is back on track to actually making the Assassins Creed series fun again. Im not sure how theyll do it again if they change time periods... Though the story is mediocre, what makes this game is the fact that its more of a pirate simulator, as Im sure youve heard.Favorite parts have to be sea shanties and firing mortars at enemy ships. Your ship, the Jackdaw, can be fully customized and youll spend a large part of this game collecting large sums of money to upgrade her.The weather system is pretty awe inspiring. The skies will go dark and the dynamic ocean will grow at random, throwing rouge waves at your ship.All the while, you still retain the ability to freerun around towns like Nassau, Kingston, and scattered islands shooting and stabbing guards and Templars indiscriminatly.Once the main story drops off you lose a bit of desire to return to the game, but keeping you ship and private island up to date while hunting legendary ships is enough to keep you coming back.
