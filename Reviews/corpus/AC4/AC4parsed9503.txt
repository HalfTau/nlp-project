Its an alright game, but every true hardcore Assassins Creed fan knows that since AC III everything went down hill...The game is fairly glitchy which can annoy you almost a the time when youre playing the game. Although I dont want to spoil the ending, it sucks, its boring and doesnt provide the closure that a person would expect playing through the camaign.I havent really played multiplayer a lot so I cant really comment on it. Overall I only recommend this game if you want to follow the story further and play around with the new ship mechanics. 5.8/10
