You may be thinking whether you should buy the game or not after the dissappointing Assassins Creed 3. Trust me when I say, this is a huge step up from that game. The story has drastically improved and is such an incredible experience throughout the game, the gameplay has been improved and the combat system is as smooth as ever. The ship driving mechanics has been improved a lot and makes it easier to navigate during the naval combat. Every part of the game has been stepped up by Ubisoft since the failure of AC3. Great game, would recommend to anyone who likes AC series and even the ones who dont.
