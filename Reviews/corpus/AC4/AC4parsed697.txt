This is a very good pirate game. You find maps of hidden treasures, you go sailing to find them, you find some valuable cargo on the way, you engage in naval battles and so on.Very well executed concept from the thematic point of view.Unfortunately, this game suffers from the same things in every Assassins Creed game, its so repetitive and linear that you do eventually get bored. Missions are basically all the same and while there is a good open world and exploration factor here, side missions are also very repetitive.The UI is awful, I fell like the upgrade system could be much better if it had a better UI.I still recommend this game because its the best pirate game out there. If you like the franchise and you love pirates, this is a must play for you.
