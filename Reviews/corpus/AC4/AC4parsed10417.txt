This game is awesome!The best thing with AC3 was the naval elements.Here is a game built on that, and you are taking the role of a Pirate!! Do I need to say more?One negative thing I can say is that they should have dropped the whole Abstergo and AC aspect of it, and got all in Black Flag with a new start!
