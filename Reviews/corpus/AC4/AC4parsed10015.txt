By the time youre done with Black Flag, which took me about 29 hours if Steams time tracker can be trusted, youll be left with the feeling that although Ubisoft perfected their Assassins Creed formula with number 3, number 4 is the most polished out of them all. Despite this, the games lack of depth, and the failure to capitalize on numerous game mechanics such as a trading or market system, prevent it from becoming one of the greats.If youre looking for an authentic pirate experience though, Black Flag has exactly what you need. It might not be historically accurate, it might be missing a lot of cool content, but Black Flag succeeds in wrapping you in a piraterich experience and capitalizes on the assets it does have. Ubisoft even managed to suppress a majority of references and tieins with previous titles which would otherwise confuse new comers, or alienate players who have grown sick of the tired Animus/Desmond Miles side plot such as myself.For my video review of this title, check it out on YouTube, here
