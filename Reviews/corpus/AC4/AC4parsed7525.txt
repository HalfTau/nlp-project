It is one of the best games in years , The storyline is very good even better then in Assassins Creed III Also the maps are nice to wander around,finding treasures ,opponents or animals you need to hunt down.Ships around to hunt down and capture,to send into your fleet Really missing the Dutch vessels,where they also played a big role in history ,Aruba ,Bonaire,Curacao,Sint Maarten and Saba still are dutch in the carribean  Nassau even is named after dutch  William III from royal family OrangeNassau who became later King of England,Scotland and Ireland  So basically,add some Dutch ships into the game, but this is the only negative comment in this awesome rpg.For sure i would like to see a followup pirate kind of game from Assassins Creed! Best storyline sofar !
