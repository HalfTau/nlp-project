EASILLY the best installment in the AC franchise. Yes, even better than Brotherhood. Not only that, but it is probably the single best piratebased game ever created, beating even the likes of Sid Meyers Pirates. The game itself is absolutely BEAUTIFUL on PC and the animations, especially in combat, are extremely smooth. Though there is still some wonkyness from the freerunning system, that is expected when youre trying to make a parkourstyle game, especially an openworld. Speaking of which, the openworld system is wonderfully done, with land to sea transitions not even existing, save for a few larger locations. And even then, the loading screens dont take that long. Naval combat is back with a thirst for blood. From 3, there have been MANY upgrades to not only the naval combat, but the regular combat as well. Boarding is seamless and an EXTREMELY fun way to make money quickly. This is one of the main gripes ive had with AC since II. It was SO TEDIOUS to go around looting everything, but IV really does an overhaul to the economy, in a good way of course. Its kinda buggy, but again, that is to be expected of an open world game, and even then, I found no huge bugs or gamebreakers. It is much more stable than III. As for the story, Ive never cared about the modern story, but as for Edwards, I can say youre in for quite a treat. Edward is a far better character than Connor, and his transformation is a great experience to watch. I can say without a doubt, that this game exceeds III by lightyears, and is an amazing addition to the AC franchise. I wait to see what UBI has prepared for next time, hungry for more.
