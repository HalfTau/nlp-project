iest game Ive played in a while now.Of all Assassins creed games, this was definetly the most HORRIBLE game theyve ever made.Im an Assassins Creed Fan but Ive never expected my favourite game series of Assassins to turn into this pile of garbage.I dont even want to talk about the gameplay, I dont understand what the hell Ubisoft were thinking.In the previous Assassins Creed franchise, youd find yourself playing an Assassin, or attempting to become one.In this game, youre someone who claims to be an assassinspoilers who stole it from an assassin he killed with his own hands.After you finish this quest, youre an ordinary pirate, the sailing is trash, Im a PC Gamer and Ive never seen something so bad made, Its your choice speed/offense, but then again, do you really want to stand in place and just wait for your enemy to hit you?thatd be dumb!youll just die immediately, and if youll choose speed, its never going to die, youve got to combine, sometimes speed and sometimes attacking, which you cannot really decide by yourself what to do, youre just rotating between the modes while getting damaged.after you FINALLY get the hang of the ship, its quite dumb, understanding that youve got 7000x hp above all other ships.AND ITS STILL UPGRADEABLE!these quests are NOT something youd want to see in an Assassins game.Im sorry, Ubisoft, thats the most trashy game youve ever made, and Im a fan of your company.Youre really been letting me down with this one, and Ive thought...While I bought this game I wasnt expecting it, this game shouldnt be called Assassins creed, dont sell me this sh!t.this game is just another garbage pirates game.waste of my money.
