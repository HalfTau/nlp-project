After 700h spent in this game, I decided to write a little review.SingleplayerIts one of the best parts in all ac series. I m in love with ac2 but ac4 is almost as good as my fav part. It has beautiful, big world which you can easly explore. A lot of quests, stuff to collect. Nice combat. Maybe some easy... but its not a big minus of whole game. Storyline is really intresting dunno what to write here to not spoiler... Its just awesome!. Music and graphics are on high level, great atmosphere of pirate world, ship battles, pirate songs, treasures, just everything what you can connect with pirates.I think only one minus is this ship/pirate stuff... for me personally its too much. It makes from it more pirate than assassin game. But still you can find a lot of sneaky mission and assassin atmosphere.MultiplayerHere I ve spent much more time. And I stil play it. I promise you, you will not find 2nd multi like this. Its still great fun with friends. A lot of nice modes, playing tactical or just jumping around. Abilities are balanced, perks also. I think I can say its the best multi of ac series. Really enjoy it. Just one minus are people who often play unfair... But its not game fault, just people carying for winning far too much. I think only game fault is that it has not so good matchmaking and sometimes you wait for session ages.In my opinion, no matter if you buy it to play singleplayer, for multiplayer or for both i can promise you, you will enjoy it! One of the best ubi games ever!
