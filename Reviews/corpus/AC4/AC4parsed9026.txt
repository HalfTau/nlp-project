This is a great game that I will recommend to just about anyone. The best part is that you can get away with skipping through most of the franchise and still enjoy this game. Edward Kenways roll and personality tends to be more appealing than conners in AC3. Fun ship battles and a great story to follow with plenty of things to do on land and sea. The Diving missions are beautiful and and great addition to the game play. so go check it out.
