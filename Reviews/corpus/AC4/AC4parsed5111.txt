Some people say this game sucks and has no story. Worst one in the AC serie. Well.....slap those people.Its has a story alright. A good one. And the graphics are beautiful. The whole island, sea, and exotic animal theme is just amazing.It has small bugs, theres no denying that. Sometimes your boat will stand vertical in the water. or upside down.happens. Or when you climb a rock, there is a possibility you get stuck in the tree next to it. But is happens.Overall its an amazing game and definitly worth a try!
