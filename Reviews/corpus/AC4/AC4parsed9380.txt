Amazing Game. I have never played any Assassins Creed games before, so, I watched a youtube video of the story so far. It wasnt really necessary.This is apparently a classic assassins creed game on foot, but on the sea, its like Sid Miers Pirates! meets 3rd person. This is a must play, and not because of anything related to assassins creed, but because its an amazing sandbox pirate game.
