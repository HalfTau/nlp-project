Review for the veteran Assassins Creed playersNew stuff Dual weild swords get to feel like Kirito from SAO....or Roxas from KH2 MultiGuns 4 I believe? Deep Sea Diving for treasure hunting and what not Shark and Whale hunting side missions for materials upgrade More emphasis on boating and battleship fights in comparison to AC3Review for those new to the franchiseIts not that bad of a game, youll find that it seems very cookiecutter or shovelware as they call it, once you start going through all the games in the franchise. Parts of the game can be slow at times, like the trailing missions, for one, can be quite boring. Once you get past that hurdle youll most likely enjoy it? Cant say for sure.Troll reviewNever thought Id see the day....when a big boat coming my way.Believe me when I say.....I ED A MERMAID!?!?!?!?!
