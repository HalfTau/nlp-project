Yeah so this could be the best Assassins Creed game EVER, but Ubisoft decided that you HAVE TO DO SIDEQUESTS to actually advance further in the story. If you dont do them, then sooner or later you will find that your ship is too weak to defeat some other ship required to be defeated in order to progress in the story mode. And I hate doing sidequests when the story is interesting enough for me to follow it. So what I am trying to write I didnt like how this brilliant game was ruined by this one stupid decision. But if you like doing every task game has to offer, you will probably like it. Oh and you absolutely have to like pirates, but who doesnt?
