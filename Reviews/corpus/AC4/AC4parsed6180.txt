Well after playing alot of the Singleplayer and Multiplayer, I think I can do an accurate overview of the game.PROS/CONS IN SINGLEPLAYER/Better graphicsFun and interesting story/plot which will guarantee alot of hours spent towards SingleplayerNice combat systemYou can use many different toolssecondary weapons such as smoke bombs, blow darts, and having 4 guns at the same time!As this is a piratey Assassins Creed game, there is obviously alot of emphasis on sailing/privateering and its also alot of fun to just destroy different ships and then choose what to do with them e.g. send to Kenways Fleet or Lower your wanted levelSo many different locations you can travel to and exploreAside from the main missions, there are also a ton of side quests, treasure chests, assassin contracts and more which will keep you occupied and playing this gameAs you can tell from many other reviews, Poor Optimization for PC even if you have a decent graphics card/cpu there will still be frame drops and low fpsSome missions/memories are just annoying usually because you do one small mistake and you have to restart the whole memory this is just my view and the amount of these memories is very littleKenways Fleet takes a long time and is also annoying8.5/10 for most people, 9/10 for me because I just love this gamePROS/CONS IN MULTIPLAYER/Very fun to playThere are many different game modes such as Manhunt, Wanted, Artifact Assasult etc.Wolfpack is also nice although playing against other people is much more fun than playing coop against some AINEW FEATURE Game Lab lets you customize gamemodes and create your own modes that you can save and play with friends for example never ending Manhunt games that take soooo long or super hard Assassinate matches where you gain less points for doing things once you locked a target, the target is locked FOREVER or until you kill him/herYou can customize all the characters and your profile and there are many ways to do soNice leveling system that always has motivation to not only play for fun, but also to level up and unlock a lot of stuffWierd bugs/glitches were you sometimes just randomly go into Limited ModeUplay...There was a HUGE bug in the Quick Match matchmaking where you could never join games and had to make custom games by inviting and having A TON of people as friends Which was a pain in the a but I think they fixed the bug the day I made this Review7/10Overall, I would definitly reccomend buying and playing this game as it is a TON of fun assuming you dont mind the cons and gltichy Multiplayer especially if it is on sale for like 10/20 as full price might not be as worth the money. 8/10 for the game as a whole.P.S. Also keep in mind that this is my second AC game and the only other AC game I played was Brotherhood, so obvously my review can be a bit biased as I could only compare to that game which was released 3 years ago.
