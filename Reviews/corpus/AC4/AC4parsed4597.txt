Having once owning Black Flag before I thought buying it for 5 was a good deal for the amount of content in Black Flag. Its possibly the best in the series for Story, characters, setting and graphics.The world map is vast and so much land to uncover. Sailing is so relaxing and sometimes really wants you to wish you were part of the Golden Age of Pirates.Exploring the Abstergo company is also interesting too and makes you wish you had a similar working enviroment!The only bad part of Black Flag is sometimes the performance. Sometimes you get the odd stutter in frames which can sometimes ruin the gameplay
