One of the best Assassins Creed games Ive ever played. This game has some of the greatest characters based on actual people in history such as Blackbeard, Calico Jack and Anne Bonny. If youre a fan of the Assassins Creed series, definitely get this game. It is a great addition and you get to learn the backstory of Haythams father. Edward Kenway is probably the best protagonist the series has ever seen. If there was one thing I had to complain about, however, itd be the modern day parts. The parts while playing as an Abstergo employee just seem boring and pointless to the game. It does add some more info about the fate of Desmond Miles but it just feels weird playing in first person with no story whatsoever about the person youre playing as. Other than that, the game is great. I mean, come on, it is about pirates. The theme just works so well for an Assassins Creed game. Not to mention the graphics. The graphics seem like a big step up from the rest of the series. The water and environments look amazing as well as the characters. The naval warfare has obviously been upgraded a lot from ACIII. You can sail wherever you want, whenever you want and attack and rob whoever you want. You can steal cargo from other ships and sell it or use it to upgrade your ship. You can upgrade the appearence of your ship and the abilities. There is so many side activities to do such as Assassin Contracts, Templar Hunts and more. You can really just go off and do your own thing apart from the storyline and have a blast. To put it simply, this is one of the best games in the series.TLDRProsGreat CharactersInteresting StoryPirate theme works wellGraphicsNaval Warfare is AmazingPlaying TimeSide ActivitiesHuge MapConsModern Day PartsNo Desmond
