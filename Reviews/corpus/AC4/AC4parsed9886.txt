Forgive me, I have a tear in my eye.The only thing that keeps this game from consuming my days is my constantly overheating computer. It took everything new that worked from Assassins Creed III, and has taken the series in a new direction through a story Im eager to uncover. I havent even encountered the Assassins properly yet I assume they will make an appearance, and Im having a great time plundering Spanish ships and bringing retribution upon those  slavers.Ive played 13 hours and so far it has blown me away. Ive been waiting for a game like this since the original xbox, when I played the Pirates of the Caribbean game. Im actually finding myself wanting to get all the collectibles, which is so far rare for a AC game. The dual sword combat also mixes it up a little, and multiple pistols only furthers the feeling of novelty this game has brought to the table.I still see the same kill moves over and over again, but it doesnt bother me enough to stay away from the game more than a day or two. I would not recommend this game to anyone without a good cooling system, as its hard on your computer. My mediocre rig can actually handle the game, just not for long so be warned!Shes a devil in the sack. Youll love it.
