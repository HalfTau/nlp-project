Impressions I liked the watery theme for loading scenes didnt understand much about what the Sage storyline was about though and still somewhat confused about the first civs maybe I shouldnt have played the games in this order II, III, I, IV whats up with the eyeliner? it was really fun to watch pirates of the caribbean after playing this you must be without doubt the worst assassin ive ever heard of hunting whales made me sad still did it shanties! still somewhat bothered that even though these people lived in undernourishment, sickness and dirt all their lives they all manage to have perfect teeth, skin and the body of a greek god but thats just probably me couldnt air assassinate sharks.
