Heres a review that might help.Ubisoft and Uplay is complete bogus.After all the hours i put on here, 3/4 done the game, my game froze. When i ended the task, i came back to find that my game had been completely wiped. Apparently there is a miscommunication when your game syncs to Ubisoft servers and it just so happened that the server just overwrote my game. Awesome. This a known bug, and Im writing this more to make people aware. As long as there is Uplay, this could happen. Not to mention, why does my single player experience even require to be saved to a web server? Where are those days when things were just saved to the harddrive. Not here, not with Uplay.The game itself is great. Travelling the seas is a fantastic feeling, as there really is nothing compared to it. The fighting is what youve come to expect from assassins creed games, smooth and frantic. And for the first time in a long time, exploration is a real joy to persue and continue, long after youve beaten the main story. But as long as i have to go through another server for my SINGLE PLAYER experience, i wont be bothering to buy another Ubisoft game.
