I was and, for as long as my patience lasts, am super excited to play what basically seems like Sid Meiers pirates with cooler fighting. Instead, it made me install uplay, and has since then refused to work  it just launches the uplay launcher, which kindly tells me the servers for a completely unneccesary block to the game dont work.Dont bother unless its on super cheap sale, and youre willing to wait for days for the Ubisoft to decide to let you play it.UPDATE finally got it working by uninstalling uPlay, installing a downloaded version from the site, manually registering in the uplay launcher. Once yopure in, the game is fantastic, so long as you remember to turn off all uplay functions like cloud storage. Heres hoping that uP goes the way of GfWL
