I picked this up for 19.99 on a Steam sale. My machine plays it on all the highest settings, the graphics are great and its a lot of fun.. for a while.I should have known better with the Uplay garbage and it being basically a PC port but beware that it is highly likely you will run across a mission bug that will prevent you from completing it, receiving the special items like pistol swords  assassination missions for instance.The Ubi forms are a joke. They cram the newer games down your throat, there are a thousand ways to buy but good luck finding fixes to issues with the current game you have. Just beware. I enjoyed 55 hours and was only at 52 completion but I wont be continuing.. or purchasing another Assassins Creed.
