I am going to be straight forward and to the point and avoid writing a biography of this game. Easily the best Assassins Creed game. Alone, the ability to sail wherever you want on the map and do whatever you want at your own pace while upgrading your character and ship makes this game worth the money.Aside from that the story is on point and well done. Every major character is well thought out and explained in detail. You find yourself either loving or hating certain characters, how many games can you say that you actually have those emotions towards characters in a video game?! Ubisoft did a great job with this game, their team killed it. All in all this game is a hit and was by far one of my favorite ubisoft RPG style games. I guess I will be the guy to say that I wished it were Coop in some way and form, but we cant have everything we want. I recommend this game 10/10.
