The concept and story behind the game is fun. It just seems like the creators got together created the most uncoordinated  controls along with a absolute horrible camera and just released it In a  hurry. When boarding other ships your crew will fight their hearts out but not a kill a single person. When trying to climb rigging in the ships you will climb every piece but the one you want. When fighting someone you will fight everyone but the person you want to fight. You might even disarm and stun the person you want to fight but instead of killing him you will turn and fight another person then once that guy is all better he will come and stab you in the back. I have no clue why I keep playing this game.
