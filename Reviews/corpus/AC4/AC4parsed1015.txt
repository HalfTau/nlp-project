I have to say from the start that being pirate and commandering the ship was great experience. Naval battles were great and challanging. You can truly feel difficulty of going against manowar. World is beautiful and full of treasures Exploration is main feature of the game You get to meet most famous pirates like Blackbeard, Vane, etc. A lot of crafting and upgrading Good story Abstergo facility was not interesting Not very historicThis is an recommended purchase for anyone that loves RPG game and Assassins Creed franchise.
