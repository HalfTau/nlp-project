After playing Assasins Creed IV Black Flag for over 20 hours I can safetly say it is worth the purchase. Not only is it a step up from Assassins Creed 3 but it renvigerates the whole series. With the largest world out of all the Assassins Creed games, there is a ton to explore and discover while venturing the west indies. Your crew sings shantyssongs while you sailing your ship accross the vast blue sea. Experiences like these make you feel like youre on an adventure discovering new places and people. Everything else you know and love about AC is here. You can still sign assassination contracts and parcour around cities, but with added mechanics like sailing. The rest you should discover by yourself. Trust me, if interested, make the purchase.
