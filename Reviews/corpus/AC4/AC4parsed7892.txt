Theres been a long time since ive enjoyed Assassins Creed as much as this. The story wasnt as captivating as some of the previous games, but the missions, unlocks, freedom and improvements to mechanics  as well as the awesome ship combat  made this game amazingly fun to play. Invested around 40 hours into it, where most time was spent in sandbox mode attempting to become the greatest pirate on the seve... hmm.. one sea!On a sidenote, the story was less frustrating and confusing with a smaller focus on the Astergo trouble.Id definitely recommend this for anyone who enjoyed parts of any assassins creed game.
