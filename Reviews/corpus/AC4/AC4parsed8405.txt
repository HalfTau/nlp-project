This game is a perfect game the detailed level of exploration is beyond amazing. Having played all games in the assassins creed universe i can without a doubt say that this game is by far the best in the series. The feeling of discovery and fulfillment you get while traversing the West Indies is unparalleled by any other game, the only game that comes close would be red dead redemption. The amount of optional side questing and small events that you can come across is staggering. The water is something that needs to be noted, it is the best water i have ever seen in any game up to this point. The graphic detail of the west indies is amazing and gives you a feeling of being in a tropical pirate haven, the small details in graphic fidelity really set the tone for how advanced this game is, for instance, the sun can periodically hide behind clouds to give a short burst of faded light, I got the same feeling as if i were at the beach and the sun went behind the clouds.Gameplay  10Visuals  10Replay  10Story  10You need a beast computer to really satisfy the requirements of this game, I ran it on a 760 at the time of this review and I would definitely recommend better. This game visually is next level for tropical paradise.I cant say much more to praise this game, its amazing. A must buy, I managed to get it for 30 but would have gladly spent 70Edit  best single player experince i have ever had, yes, including skyrim and red dead.Edit 2  Having finished the game i have changed the story from a 8 to a 10, this game is the best game i have played for a number of reasons, do not miss out on this experince. 10/10
