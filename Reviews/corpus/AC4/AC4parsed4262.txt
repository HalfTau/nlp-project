i remember the first assassin creed when it was released i bought it on day one and my god was i excited to play it and i loved every minute of it. i know it is repeptivie but i have never played a game up until then that gave you so much freedom, i could approcach a situation anyway i like and that was mind blwoing to me. i rememeber going to bed excited to wake up and spend the whole day on my xbox playing it. the recenet assassins creed havent been best imo but i loved this one. the sailing was so much fun and the ocean is beautiful when you crank up the graphics. sometimes i just sailed around enjoying the view.
