After ACR and AC3 I felt that I was through with the series. AC3 was almost a disgrace, but I completed it, with pain and suffering. I really wanted to like it, but it just did not feel like AC should.Then, AC4 was published and after a while, I started hearing positive reviews and even though I had laughed at the idea of assassin pirates, I decided to buy it and try it out. Boy, was I surprised! The gameplay felt solid and even though the plot takes a while to kick in, I really enjoyed it a lot. The sailing was good and surprisingly enjoyable, especially when your crew starts to sing!I really do recommend this game. I had a lot of fun with this game, and if you are going to do everything in the game, you sure will not finish it in just a few hours!
