Ive purchased a few games from the makers of Assassins Creed IV, and each I was able to play, but never finish. They are great games, but for some reason, I couldnt get into it. A little frustrating to say the least when you pay full price P  Dont get me wrong, I really recommend their games.This one in particular really caught me. I was fortunate to have bought it when it was on sale wow, what a deal, but was worried it would be the same for me, that I would hardly play it. It turns out that the story, game play, etc. caught my attention wholeheatedly. Im deeply impressed. Other than an issue I was having with VSync which I did solve afterall, thankfully, the game is incredible. The water and weather look amazing, and the engine for the game is so well made, if you stop and notice the details.I found part of the frustration of these games is that you need to really get to know alot of details on how to play, and get good at it. Otherwise, you get frustrated early, and give up. If you can take the time to practice and get good at stuff, the game is incredibly imerssive. I mean, the boat battles alone are awsome, and the tiers of upgrades and better ships give it a good feel, imo.I am thankful that I got this at such a good price, after having spend so much in the past on their games and not getting the value for it. This one is definately worth it, and is a 9.5 / 10 in my books.
