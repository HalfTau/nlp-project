This game is super awesome, and is really pretty. However, it seems to be far better optimized on nVidia than AMD, because it lags on my more powerful AMD desktop, but runs fine on a less powerful nVidia laptop.Gameplay is really fun, and its a nice story.No cloud saving though, so its annoying transfering save files.
