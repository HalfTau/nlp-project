Nothing beats saling the seas, listening to your pirate crew sing shanties, as you blow ships out of the water. Its a departure for the series. AC needed to take a different direction and AC IV Black Flag does just that. Its a damn fine pirate game.Sure there are issues with the PC version. It isnt very well optimised. But with a little tweaking and downloadingthanks to redditor /u/GraphicJ, to force triple buffering, the game runs fine. There are still noticeable drops in framerates, but nothing but a patch from Ubisoft will solve this.If you want a pirate game, buy it. Youll find yourself saling the Jackdaw more often than sneaking about assassinating people. Sounds strange but its refreshing
