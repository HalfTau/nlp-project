I got the 100 in about 80 hours. I literally did everything there was to do and I dont regret it. Little secrets and collectibles unlock special weapons or outfits or records or notes that unveil many details about the whole templarsassassinsabstergo thing. Also, this Black Flag is not a normal assassins creed. The conspiracy part is only explored through secrets mostly, the story is very different from the other ones but that was expected just think of the end of AC3.There is not much to say. I think that if someone likes the AC series, would like every AC. I personally found a big improvement from AC1 to AC2, and the standard has always stayed the same. Black Flag is a different approach that will for sure develop in a next chapter. The setting pirates, sailing, caribbean is very appealing to me and something different that made me forgive the lack of main story, little related to what has happened until now with Desmond. But as I said, there are some secrets to be found that will explain many things here and there about the whole conspiracy and desmonds past.On the technical side, it is wonderful. The best ocean ever, together with the Cryengine 3. HBAO still looks very very good and animations are wonderful. Combats are still a  , it is basically impossible to die while fighting 20 enemies...too easy, but exploration and views will compensate that.85/100
