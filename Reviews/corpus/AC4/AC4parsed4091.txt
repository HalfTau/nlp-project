I was a massive fan of the original Assassins creed games and quickly realized that the series was bound to lose quality over time as it did.So when I picked up Assassins Creed Black Flag I didnt expect a great Assassins Creed game.And I didnt get one. Matter of fact, I think it would be a terrible game if it focused more on the Assassin aspect of the story, that didnt really seem to fit the main character or the situation he found himself in all that well.But while Ubisoft may have given us a mediocre AC game with Black Flag it seems they accidentally created an amazing and beautiful pirate game.The Pirate story is believable, the setting and maps are absolutely breathtaking, as is the experience out on sea, with the sound of waves crashing against your ship, cannons and seagulls in the distance and your crew singing shanties as you roam the map in search of adventure.If this game is on sale and you can run it I see little reason to not pick it up, its easy to lose yourself in the beautiful world and story and I cant think of a single pirate oriented game that can even reach the overall feel of this title.TLDR Meh AC game, Amazing Pirate game. Do get.
