Black Flag is where its at in the series, but seriously, get Rogue. Its Black Flag v 2.0. Also.. Freedom Cry, one of the dlcs for Black Flag now a standalone, lets you kill slave masters, and free slaves. Get them all if you can black flag, rogue, and freedom cry... Assassins and pirates. Nuff said.
