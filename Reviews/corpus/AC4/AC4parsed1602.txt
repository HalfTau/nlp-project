Played this in 2013. Had a blast. Now in 2017, I went back at it again, and wow I am amazed that it still holds up quite well. Graphics and gameplay are still good for a 4yearold game. If youre looking for a cheapyetTripple A game for your library, this one is it. Loads of hours of pirating fun, and even after all this time, it still takes my breath away.Best.... AC...Ever!
