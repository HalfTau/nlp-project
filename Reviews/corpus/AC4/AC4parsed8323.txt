nice game, good music, has too much to explore and the parts when you are at in the real world may not be what all fanatics wanted but it has some good suprises. great ending. the dlc freedom cry may not be amazing nor be really long the story but shows how hard was the life for blacks in times of slavery. and the music of that dlc is beautiful.
