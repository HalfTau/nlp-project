Amazing game. Honestly my favourite series entry, with my favourite actor Matt Ryan as Edward, classic Assassins Creed fun, but with a pirate twist that only makes it more interesting and fun to play. And of course the cast of loveable characters and their heartwrenching moments in this game make it so charming that I will never get bored of playing it.
