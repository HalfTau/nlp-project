Best Assassins Creed game to date except AC2. The story is really good as opposed to official reviews.Game mechanics havent changed from the previous games in the series, but they have been improved upon.The Ship battles are a great addition, and the OpenWorld gaming has been improved to a point you find yourself wandering in it for hours with many things to do.I recommend this game to anyone who likes the series, or for that matter anyone who likes fun.
