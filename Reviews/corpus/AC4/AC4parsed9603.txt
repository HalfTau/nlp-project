This game is so fun and packed with adventurist things to do, that when i finished the game i was so upset because there was still so much to do around the open world. I highly recommend you buy this game and i personally think Assassins Creed Black Flag is ten times more funner than the past Assassins Creeds. You will not be disappointed. D
