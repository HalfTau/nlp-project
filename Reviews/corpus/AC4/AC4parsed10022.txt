Amazing game! Was looking foward to enter the world of pirating and it does not disaponent. 9.5/10 Graphics, amazing in general and water physics and water graphics are the best i have ever seen. Story line is somewhat fun 8/10 but the side missions and messing around at sea is alot of fun. Side missions are 10/10 assissinations, shipwreck dives, harpooning, hunting, exploring, ect! 10/10 upgrading and customizing, ship upgrades both apperance and destructive power, you can buy items for your character, weapons and stuff. You can also manage a fleet of your own!
