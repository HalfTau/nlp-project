despite Ubisofts best efforts to ruin everything with DRM, this game is actually worth the trouble that Uplay causes.The story is good, and for the first time in this franchise we see a character join the assassins not for revenge, personal gain, or hereditary reasons but rather because he learns through the course of the game the vision and the virtues of the assassins.on top of a well written and compelling story featuring arguably the best assassin character, the naval part of the game is equally good, I occasionally launch this game just to do pirate stuff for a couple hours, theres alot of replayability even after all of the missions and side missions are completed.tldr Black flag is second only to the Ezio trilogy.
