I still remember when boats were anounced in ACIII. i remember not thinking too much of it. In ACIII, i barely played any of the boat levels. now, this game is all about boats. does this make the game bad? no. it just makes it dissapointing. the story is a good one though, and it nicely adds to the AC lore. but the gameplay is what drags this game down. You liked the boats in ACIII? play this game. More of a land type? play every other game in the series except rogue, of course.
