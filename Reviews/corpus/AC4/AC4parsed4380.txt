My favorite AC title just because of the ships, after ACIII I wanted to do more with the sailing and this answered that prayer. I enjoy just sailing and listening to the same repetitive shanty songs over and over and just attacking other ships. As far as story goes its unique and interesting, the out of Animus reality gameplay is spread out and not intrusive like previous AC titles where you were mad you had to do real life tasks instead of progress the story inside the Animus. Graphics are not very beautiful on lower and medium settings but gorgeous on high. I had to turn settings and draw distances down to run higher than 40 fps on my low end machine AMD A8 6500 3.5Ghz 16GB DDR3 RAM GTX750ti 2GB DDR3 VRAM. On highest settings the game bogged badly to teen fps and had bad lag. On medium settings Id compare it to playing on xb360. Lots of pop up too, annoying, you see characters render directly in front of you while walking down the street in a village, or boats pop up 20 feet away while at sea. But, its playable on my budget PC, and despite all of that I still enjoy it greatly as my favorite AC title. I probably put 50 plus hours into the xb360 game, and just restarted again on PC when game was on sale. Im still happy I bought it.
