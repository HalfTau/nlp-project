this is a great game. i am not very far into the game but so far its a good game. i love the navel combat and ship boarding. the open world aspect is nalso nice. i like the fct that it also has assassin missions so its not only a pirate game. its an assassin pirate game. its very detailed with a diverse gruop of places to go such as towns and cities or tropical islands. i havnt tried goung to diving locations and diving but i know you can. overall 9 out of 10 very good game. Its almost as good as skyrim! I got it for 20 dollars and its defenitly worth it. even at full price its worth it but if you can get it on sale defenitly get it.
