One of my favorite Assassins Creed games to date D Though the story is a bit rushed, the gameplay far outdoes any of the games before its fantastic parkour and assassination techniques, its fluid combat system and its intense and gruelling navy battles that reward the player with a very satisfying overall experience. 8?10
