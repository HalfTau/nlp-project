Not a big Assassins Creed fan but I loved AC IV Black Flag! Pirates, ships and naval battles! Caribbean landscapes! Silly characters and better AI compared to AC III Is waaaay better than III and AC Unity P Simple but fun multiplayer. Lack of story and sidequest. Still not a good port for non SLI GTX 700s If you have PS4 buy that version!
