At first I wasnt very fond of this game. I didnt ike the whole pirate concept because I just didnt think sailing around would be that fun...man i was wrong. This game is fillied with so much to do. From infiltrating forts, to destroying and boarding ships. Finding artrifacts to unlock new and unique armour. Stealthly taking out assassination targets, hunting, enjoying the improved and incredibl fluid freerunning, going underwater into hidden caves, building your own fleet and much more. The combat may be easy, but still very satifisying. Stealth in this game is challenging and fun when pulled off right. This game is probably the 2nd best assassins creed game out there after 2. Worth the buy.
