My recipe to enjoying this game.You will need To have done the not too boring starter missions until you get your ship and base.Step 1 Find an enemy GalleonStep 2 Put Pirates of the Carribean Music OnStep 3 Have a riproaring swashbuckling battleStep 4 Turn game off and come back to do it again every so often
