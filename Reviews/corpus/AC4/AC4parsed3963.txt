Game has problem on launch, comes up with ACBFSP.exe has stopped working, I have tried every fix Ive found to no avail, I have reinstalled 3 times. Even though it says I have 50mins, Ive only played for 40min as it did intailly work but no obviously doesnt. Imoff as I had this game on an xbox 360 which I sold and it is my favourite AC. THe game is great but doesnt work.
