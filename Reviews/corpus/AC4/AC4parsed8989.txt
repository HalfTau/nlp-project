There is a game breaking savegame bug that occurs for nearly every PC user.  No sense buying a game you have to start over every time you play.There is an installation bug that occurs for a large portion of users because of Ubisofts stupid client/game portal that only exists to try to sell you DLC.There is, incredibly enough, pay to progress time saver micro transactions in the single player! On a full price game.  What the actual ? They probably increased the progression grind just to make these more appealing a la Diablo 3.Dont waste your money.  Support an Indie Studio or 3 instead.
