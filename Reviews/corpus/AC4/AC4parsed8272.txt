Very disappointed. Brutal optimization, horrific controls, buggy gameplay, and topped off with the fact that Ubisoft is aware of all these issues, and frankly dont care about PC users. Fanboys are also doing a fantastic job censoring any hate and nuking it into hell.The game is awful.The developers are aware.They do not care and want your money anyway.Youd have to be an idiot to buy this game knowing that.Cheers.
