I played one mission of this game, for the LOVE OF GOD. When I 100 that ing level, I thought I was higher than cloud 9. ING REAL! You cant just 100 ing Assassins Creed, but I ing did in less than an hour. Whoever the  replaced Desmond is x10 better because its in first person, that means that the garphics of his whole body is notyour graphics card or your cpu, no instead you follow not this hot actress who played Lucy and died ING SPOILERS , but you follow this other person who would get a 9, and with me would become a 10.GG Ubisoft.Now let me talk about the actual game, thats not about outside of the Animus.Aaarrrgggh. Expect that? Well thats fine if you did, because I know I would have.This game was announced Most Pirated Game 2013, you know, because of the people who pirate the game...oh... I can tell by the dumbfounded look on your face that youre not getting the joke... face palm.No worries, dont worry about it. Theyre not real pirates with guns and swashbucklers, theyre internet thieves I tell you, THIEVES!Pirates mainly say such a gray hat comment for why they do it though, We want to try out the merchandise before buying it, well thats not true, youre 7 hours deep in AC 4 Black Flag, I ing doubt you want to replay through that whole scenario and level up everything. Yeah lets be real, youre going to finish the game and be all, Yeah AC4 was good, I would have boughten it.Now lets get off piracy issuesLots and lots of  Naval Battling, SADLY NO KRAKEN!  NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!I was hoping for DLC, well if you want to fight one so bad, just go play ArcheAge the MMO of Pirates.Gameplay is rather fun, 4 guns, its downright ridiculous! 4 ING GUNS!!!! 3The combat mechanics are a lot smoother and duel weilding blades as well as dual hidden blades as well like the prior games.Its rather odd because in this game youre Edward Kenway, Conners grandfather .so the storyline takes a turn and youre doing crazylike WHALING!!!! O dat whale oil doe sells for high dope  you know?
