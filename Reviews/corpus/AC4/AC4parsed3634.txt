I played the first Assissins Creed and thought it was a lot of fun, though not enough fun to buy the others. However, I was in the mood for a pirate game, and after watching the teasers, this looked as good or better than any other pirate game out there. I was not disappointed at all. This has everything in a pirate game you could want. Your own ship, sword fighting, ship battles, a large map with lots of places to see. Plus you have all the elements from an assassin creed game. It truly is a great pirate game all around. So if you were like me and you are just interested in a good pirate game, you cant go wrong with this game. Some other scally wags complain about Uplay. To be honest, I have never had an issue with it. Non issue as far as I am concerned.
