This is one of the best, if not the best, Assassins Creed games.ProsSetting  Love the pirate setting. If you love pirates or anything to do with pirates this is the game for you.Graphics  Fantastic graphics. The game is bright and colorful. Highly detailed with some of the best water effects I have seen. You can tell a lot of love went into the detail of the game.Gameplay  Awesome. There is so much to do, be a pirate, ship to ship combat, naval/land battles, the Jackdaw its like an in game companion that you upgrade, hunting, harpooning, this game is loaded with all kinds of things to do. Hours and hours of gameplay if you dont just blow past everthing except the main questline. The ship to ship and naval to land battles are so well done and so much fun. I dont how time I have spent just battling and looting ships.ConsGame mechanics. Your character sometimes grabs or jumps, etc. when you dont want him to. This is a small gripe as you get use to it after you play for awhile and it is a slight con in all Assassins Creed games.OverallHighly recommended. The game is just fun.
