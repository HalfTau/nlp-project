I would like to say that I have enjoyed AC games in the past. They had fallen out of my favor in recent years due to the repetative nature of the combat/engine. NOT the case with this one... fresh feel, awesome combat, great exploration feel and the customizable battleship are only a few of the things that make this my favorite Assassins Creed yet! If its on sale, buy it. You wont regret it.9.2/10
