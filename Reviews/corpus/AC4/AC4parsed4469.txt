Havent played an Assasins Creed game in a while but decided to try this one and its great. You can explore a great open world with a lot of secrets and enemies, you can do missions, hunt, craft and a lot more. It does require Uplay but i havent had a problem with it so for me that is not a problem. It can get a little boring after a while but it is sure worth it to pick it up on sale!
