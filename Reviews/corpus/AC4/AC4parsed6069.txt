This.  Game.  I havent loved a game this much in a long time.  I never got into some of the other Assassins Creed Games, but this one is special.  I used to play Sid Meiers Pirates back in the day, and this game has a lot of respect for that legacy and takes many a page from that series.  The ground game is a blast, the naval game is amazing.  I usually hate minigames, but I have to tell you, they did a bangup job on the minigames in Black Flag.  I wont go too much further except to say I spend a lot of time with a big silly grin on my face as I play this game.  Definitely worth a buy.
