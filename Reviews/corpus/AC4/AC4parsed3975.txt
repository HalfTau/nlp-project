I absolutely recommend this game. Even though you need uplay to run this, I feel like it adds more to the whole ubisoft kind of experience. I know many people dont agree with me, but I had no crashes, no data loses, or any large problematic mishaps. Soemthing I dont like seeing is the  limited amount of weapons and fighting styles, but still everything is smooth. Still my favorite assassins creed, even in 2016.
