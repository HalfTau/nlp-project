Great game. The story was just ok for being a pirate story. Expect the tradtional Assassins creed lore and of course the conspiracy stuff with templars. Overall I would give this game a 9. Something about sailing the seas with an almost unlimited number things to explore, all while raiding other ships and forts it just felt so right, and so fun.
