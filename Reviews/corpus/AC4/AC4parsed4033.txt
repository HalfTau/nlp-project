this game is not working, cant launch the game because of UPLAY errors. first i couldnt create UPLAY account through window that opened on steam beccause of server error i had to go to their web page, then when i launched game i got errors in UPLAY application saying cant connect to server try again later. no thanks, instead i downloaded pirated version and it works like charm.most negative reviews are because people had also problems with UPLAY. how is it possible that your company cant fix those errors in years?how is it possible that pirated version of game works perfectly, and the one bought on steam not?refund in progress of course.
