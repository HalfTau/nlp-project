 The graphics, they are next gen amazing for such a world The shanties, nothing is like a sailor singing. The story. It can seem confusing if you havent played any earlier games / read up on it, but I would reccomend ALL of the AC games. Bugs. No social chests, the boat flying/submerging/turning upside down. Its game breaking requiring a restart after every time it happens not that often, but enough to be annoyed Movement, its hard to move around, climb buildings or sail ships. The Tracking missions. Alot of the AC games are tracking a certain person / some people. Its annoying and you will only wish for it to be skippable.
