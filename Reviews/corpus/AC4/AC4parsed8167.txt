Best game in the series, I genuinely didnt believe they would make a better game than AC2 but I was gladly surprised. The content that you get in this game is varied, well paced and engaging. The single player campaign was lacking emotion and plot but it didnt even matter, I was too busy sailing the huge ocean, exploring, collecting and discovering new locations that the main storyline just felt like a side quest. The multiplayer hasnt really changed much, polished a bit more, yes but the multiplayer isnt why you should purchase this game. The single player is worth the full price asked for, the deluxe edition adds a couple more islands to explore and some new weapons, armor and general customization but nothing special. I would give this an 9/10, fantastic game.
