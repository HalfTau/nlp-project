This was my first Assassins Creed Game I have played and I enjoyed it a lot! The ship system is very cool and the feel of being a pirate assassin is very cool. Edward is one of my favorite Assassins Including Ezio  he is a Assassin unlike any in the franchise. If you are new to the franchise and dont know what this franchise is about then give this game a shoot, but fair warning this will spoil some of the story from previous games, so if you are prepared for that give this game a go!! !
