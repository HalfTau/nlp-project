First off, I really reccomend playing this game. I, myself have only played a little over a third of the game. But that is one of my two problems with this game. After a while the game seems like it will go one forever. But if you love games that you will have 100 hours on then this is a game for you. My second problem is that there are some glitches. Not many at all but ocasionally you will be on a barrel and fall through everything. But I love this game, even just sailing to the next place youre going is really cool. You see whales and rescue pirates for your crew to keep. So if you have a lot of time to put into this game and youre alright with the ocasional glich, get this game.
