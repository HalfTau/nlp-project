Assassins Creed IV Black Flag was a lot of fun. Comparing to AC III, the combat was a lot more fun and enjoyable, the characters were a lot more likeable, and the protagonist didnt insist on being athrought the entire story. When I played AC3, after not too long I got bored with the game  then I started to burn through the story to feel better about putting the game down. With AC4, though, I spent lots of time having fun exploring, finding collectibles, doing sidemissions, building up my ship, and of course, being a pirate. The ShipShip combat is, in my opinion, stellar. Not too difficult to get the hang of, but it stays fun, from the first few ships to the 100th and beyond. Looking back, I think there was a 15 consecutive hour period of gameplay in which I bypassed the main story entirely, focusing on the side missions and taking over ships.Comparing to the earlier AC games, especially AC3, the controls were MUCH better in this game. I remember half of the rage I had in AC3 was due to unexpetedly jumping to my death innumerable times just to get to a viewpoint or something. There were a few instances of this in AC4, but they were far fewer and more manageable than Ive previously experienced.I experienced a few bugs during the game, but only once was there an interruption  luckily I only had to replay five minutes worth to get back to where I was, but its still bothersome.With the  to me somewhat lackluster enjoyability of AC Revelations and the rather boring and annoying AC3, I wasnt fully sure about spending the money on AC4. Now that Ive played it, Im glad I did, and this game has restored my hope that this series still has some life and fun left in it.
