Having played pretty much all of the Assassins Creed games though I must admit, I couldnt finish 3 as it was just so tedious I have to say, this isnt really an Assassins Creed game. Which is obviously bad if you are into the whole steath stabby side of things, however to compensate, they made a fine pirate game instead.You can unleash your inner Guybrush and have at the Caribbean and pirate your black guts out. The only let downs in this game are when it forces you to do some boring assassins creedish type missions. Thankfully you can get that over with quickly and go back to swashbuckling.So, if you like a good ole pirate adventure, hit it up.
