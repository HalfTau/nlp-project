So i run recommended hardware and use the latest drivers.My OS is Windows 8.1, which is also recommended.Still I need to run this game in compability mode for Windws 98 in order to even play it.The same goes for every game of the series so far.The sound is therefore kind of glitchy and the graphics run at a smooth 30 fps max.My hardware would totally be able to crush this kind of game since i run 99 of games at 1440p 60 fps.The fact that Ubisoft is unable to get a decent port running is just laughable.We arent talking about a small studio or something.Its Ubisoft which is one of the biggest companies in this business.Also you are forced to install UPlay which is designed by the antichrist and the leaders of the apocalypse.
