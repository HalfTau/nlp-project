For me, this is the final word in pirates vs ninjas. From what I can tell, somebody at Ubisoft said Why not both? BOOM, Black flag was born. Ive had so much fun with this game and Im yet to finish it. You get all the regular assassin based stuff like stalking people, looking for a target, leaping from a building to stab then in the back. But mix this with the swashbuckling pirates life on the open seas and you have an excelent formula for a game. Sure, some people say that AC2 is the best, and on a story front I can kind of agree. But as far as gameplay goes, Black Flag does so much more and so much better. 10/10. Buy it. Dont even question it, just buy it.Also I once pet a goat and it died. GOTY
