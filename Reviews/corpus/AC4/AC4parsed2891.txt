This might be the point where I tire of the Assassins Creed formula. I didnt enjoy AC IV nearly as much as I did the previous games. The story was barebones and not as interesting compared to the other main entries in the franchise. And almost every mission seemed like it had a Tail Someone section, which is incredibly dull and tedious. Halfway through the game I decided to focus just on the main story mission. Everything else just seemed to get in the way.The main addition to the franchise here is the sailing your ship part. However I must say it is not nearly as enjoyable as I though it would be. The combat is simplistic and almost no one can pose a serious threat to you, it just feels like youre going through the motions. It came to a point where I started actively avoiding fighting with any other ship. Which meant I couldnt get enough resources in order to upgrade my ship. So the game started pestering me with warnings before starting a mission that I should really upgrade my ship. But it didnt really matter if I had an underpowered ship. I did the missions just fine. I dont want to think about how tedious the missions would have been if I had a properly upgraded ship.All in all thats the main gripe I had with this game, everything just seems so tedious. This might be franchise fatigue, but I think the deeper issue is that everything is so simplistic. This has always been a problem with the franchise, but in previous iterations I managed to get interested in the story enough so that I overlooked that part. And I think the missions were also structured better. Although by the end I did start to get invested with the main character, its just a shame it took so long.Im still going to recommend this game. Newcomers to the series will appreciate the game, and franchise fans like myself will want to get some more story in the AC universe even though there isnt that much of it.5 / 10
