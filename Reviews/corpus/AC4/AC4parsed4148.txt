I thought this game was surprisingly good! I went into it remembering AC Revelations which I rather disliked, but Ubisoft has managed to build an interesting world with plenty of main missions, side activities and exploring to do.The best part of the game is simply the pirating. Especially in the beginning the ship combat is fun and can be challenging at times, altough when you have fully upgraded your ship you can pretty much walz through every encounter with little trouble. This probably wont happen until late in the game. The land combat is still rather easy but this has always been an issue in the AC series. The side missions are also slightly repetitive, mostly involving taking murder contracts and killing someone on land or on their ship with little variation in how you do it. However there are also side missions with fleshed out characters which are far more interesting.The area is also downright beautiful, the environment looks great and the waves behave realisticly enough its a video game after all, and while the cities are not as epic as Rome or Jerusalem, they still look good and are fun to run through.The main mission has its ups and downs, but overall I thought it was pretty decent. The story doesnt break any new grounds but is solid enough that you wont get bored by it. You also get to meet several historical pirates and important figures but unlike AC3 you dont get the feeling they were forced into it and interactions with them range from normal to the occasional awesomeness. The main current world plot however is pointless. While it was interesting tothe things that happen are forced and pointless. I also didnt play the multiplayer so I have no idea whether that is good or not.I would still recommend the game though, I have spent a lot of time on it and I enjoyed it.
