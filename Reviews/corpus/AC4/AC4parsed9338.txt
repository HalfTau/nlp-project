Yet another Assassins Creed game. Broadened in scope and streamlined. Better than AC3 and with the Naval combat being a big part of the game it brings something new to the franchise even though there were a few Naval combat missions in AC3. But ultimately the now somewhat tired mechanics of Assassins  Creed hold this franchise back. Ubisoft needs to really try something different next time or players like myself will get tired of the same old thing every year. Also, does the game need to be so filled with collectables? Most of the collectables just unlock pretty meaningless stuff like character costumes and stuff the game doesnt really need. It just feels like mindless filler content.
