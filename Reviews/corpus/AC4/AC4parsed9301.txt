Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is a great step up from the previous installment, Assassins Creed III. You can quickly immerse yourself into the game and start killing people. Although the same feeling from the first 4 ACs was not completely transmitted into this game, the variety and large world make up for it. This game will please AC fans.
