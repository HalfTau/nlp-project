EDITChanging this to a positive review.Enemies can now swim 10/10 would swim again.Seriously thoughI do really like this game, its fun, challenging and rather large compared to the other Assassin Creed games.PROS1. Large map with lots to do2. Hunting isnt the only thing that your character is good at Looking at you here Connor3. Youre a pirate4. Rum5. A GTAesque wanted rating system6. Plenty of weapons and outfitsCONS1. A little grindy and has a heavy focus on Complete this challenge to unlock2. Reports of game saves being lost. My advice is to turn cloud storage off on UPlay3. Youre still an OP killing machine with regenerating health4. Legendary ships are either fairly easy or difficult to the point of throwing your computer and best friend out of the window to see the ship disappear.Overall not an amazing game, but certainly a very fun one. If I could change certain things I would only do minor tweaks. If I were an actual reviewer and not some random guy on the internet I would give this an 8/10
