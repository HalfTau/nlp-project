By far the best Assassins Creed  game to date, I just cant put this one down, its a blast. The open world exploration full of ship to ship combat and piracy, then being able to dock into fully explorable towns to do some missions and assassinations on foot...this game is just way too awesome. Its only downside is optimization, it is not well optimized for PC and even worse for AMD cards. Its playable on higher settings on my 7970m but it could definitely be smoother. Unfortunately changing the video settings between low and high seem to make very little performance difference as well, and from reading on the forums and around the net this appears to be quite common, it just doesnt utilize CPUs and GPUs to their fullest for some reason, likely to do with it being a port from an entire range of consoles. Either way, its playable seems to be stuck at around 30fps or so 95 of the time for me. and its super fun. The ship to ship outside world seems to have better performance as well.
