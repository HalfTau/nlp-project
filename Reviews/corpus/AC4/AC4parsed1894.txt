Difficult game. I try 5 times now to get the stuff which I need from a fort. Couldnt killed a man with the axe, because he throwed the bomb on me. Good game, but difficult part make it unenjoyable. You need tried many times before you progress. Also city is big, but not much in it. I doubt I will progress further. I am a fan of pirates games. But for me Sea Dogs is the best one anyway. Assasin promise a lot, treasures, ships, cities but before you progress its take ages. I only play this game, because this about pirates.
