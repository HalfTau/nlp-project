this was awesome but after i played the sacrfice island mission a few days later the islands were gone like the whole digital deluxe was missing, no aveline dlc too.... i dont know about the multiplayer items cause i havent played multiplayer because of internet issues but im assuming theyre gone too... im reinstalling it to try if i just dowloaded it incorrectly or something... still awesome game though 10/10 in my book cept for that missing dlc thing
