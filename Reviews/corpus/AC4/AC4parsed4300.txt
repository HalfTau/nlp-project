Love this game so much DAlready have 96 of synchronization50 hours past two weeksEDIT Campaign was good and enjoyable No one play multiplayer. But one thing is little bit weird, there are legendary ships which cant be beaten because when i destroy first one, second one rush me with no fear and ram me like butter ....Also i have fully upgraded ship elite, just dont know what i suppose to do with it.EDIT 2 Legendary ships was easy, you just need to know how to manipulate with your ship EDIT 3Game completed on 100 had lot of fun with this game!
