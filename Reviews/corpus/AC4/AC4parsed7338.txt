Well, fans of the genre will like this game. A huge open world, fasttravel to every place, much stuff to find, to upgrade and to enhance your ship and your character with. This game has everything it needs.Do I miss something? Not really. While my creativity tells me, that it would be nice to have a real home with the ships Ive captured which I can call to help me out on the sea, my own ship itself is already good enough to handle everything alone. The option to build or upgrade owned ships would be nice too, but as I said, you dont really need it. Another option could be equipment for your crew, so you equip them similar to AC 3 and tweak them to your likes. Maybe even with levels and a possible option to heal them after they have been injured. Right now, my crew is just a number and they live and die like a simple number, which is sadly a little bit too flat for my taste.But this is picking out stuff on the peak of a mountain, because the game is great. The naval battles are awesome, the sea looks great, it makes fun to sail and the character handles nice. So all in all, Id say its a 9/10.
