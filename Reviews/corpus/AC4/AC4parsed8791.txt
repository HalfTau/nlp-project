I really enjoyed AC4 and love where they are taking the series. Its not just all assassins anymore, this game is a hybrid of a pirate and assassin game. They managed to give AC4 its own identity rather than it being just another Assassins Creed game while still maintaining all the core elements of gameplay that makes it an AC game. If you enjoy the AC series and love the idea of a pirate simulation type game ala Sid Meiers Pirates! then check AC4 out! Sure you cant choose to be a Privateer and have the freedom to work for the King but as long as you enjoy raiding ships and plantations, then this game is for you!
