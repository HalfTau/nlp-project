Honestly i was giving up on the franchise after the III but, after hearing so much about it from friends i decided to give another chance and i was not disappointed.They did something i already knew was comming which is expanding the naval mechanics shown on III and i have to say it became the soul of this game. They did it beautifully, one of the top enjoyable mechanichs of all the time for me.The story still didnt quite captivated me like the first instalments but i can say for sure that it returned my faith in the series since this time i actually cared about the main character and enjoyed some of his life lessons and how things turned out.The DLCs story wise are extremely short but the Freedom Cry was the best giving an good arc to an overlooked character, the costume ones as expected give a little flavor but thats it.The Multiplayer ends up beeing the same thing as previous games but something extra to try and keep it fresh but i feel kinda saturated with it.So in the end this was an game resparked my interest in the series so if you are having doubts about the series aswell i suggest you give it a chance.
