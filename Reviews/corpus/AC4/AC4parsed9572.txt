I am a big fan of AC2 and brotherhood. I liked AC3 but have a hard time finishing it. In AC4 the action almost never stops. The story was fantastic, in the beginning you truly felt like a pirate and did as you wished. I would march right in and kill everyone in sight. As the story progresses my play style evolved naturally. Much more hide in the bushes and wait them out. While I didnt connect to the support cast like I did with Mass Effect some characters did manage to leave an impression. Only two, but still its better than many games.I recommend this game for fans of AC. I enjoyed the ending, not surprising, but a nice way to tie things up into a nice little bow.
