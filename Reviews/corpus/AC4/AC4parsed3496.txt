this game have huge map and location to explore. you guys probably need 30hour just to explore all location in this game maybe more and another 20 hour to get 100 complete.the animation is goodthe graphic is goodmusic isbrick, damn noob composer like all ac game really, except villa monteriggioni music BG that one is the only good music in ac seriesgameplay is funstory is mehi did say the location is huge, right? it is huge BUT all location in this game looks exactly the same. EXACTLY THE SAME which is boring afyou go to first city in the game which is HAVANA and you can expect all the city in the game looks exactly the same.when i started play this game, i was expecting city with some dark, cool stuff like in pirate of carribean.and i wish controlling the weather in this game is not counted as cheat cause when you use cheat in the game, any progress is not saved.conclusion  get the game on sale ONLY! 75, not worth the original price.
