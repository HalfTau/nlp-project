As a die hard fan of assassins creed,this game is like assassins creed 2 but even better.You will spend hours boarding ships to get cargo and upgrade your ship to board more cargo .It sounds repetitive but its really fun.Plus new graphics are amazing if you are playing on an good gaming PC.Even on medium its beatiful and on high its real life graphics almost.World is big as russia plus china combined.You will start to fall in lvoe with your crew.When you are sailing they sing sea shanties which are really fun to listen.Combat returned with the counternever die which i like ,im to used of orginal ezio games that used counter as life forever button.New pistol aiming is amazing,and the swords are good,but i much more prefer stealth so i use hidden blade,which is as always same.So many details and amazing story i cant explain it all in this review.You have to try it to get the feel.Overall its a great game and must have for any assassins creed fan.
