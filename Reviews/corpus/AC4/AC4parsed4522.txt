This is THE BEST Assassins Creed game! The characters are interesting and memorable, the ship battles and over all sailing is really fun and it has a much better parkour system than Brotherhood.Let me put it in perspective on how good this game isIve owned Assassins Creed Brotherhood for one year and Ive only played 8 hours. Ive owned Black Flag for two weeks and Ive played 41 hours.10/10
