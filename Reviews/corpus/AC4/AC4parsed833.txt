Let me start saying that I am not a fan of Ubisoft and I find ridiclus that I cannot have my achievement here, not using uplay to purchase game as I do not buy EA Games anymore.Said that I really like the game and this was also my first AC game as I never been really attracted by the series, the story is well narrated and it does really feel like a very good pirate game yes it has that Pirates of Caribbean feeling!. Naval battles are very enjoyable as much as taking over fortress. Some of the mission can be repetitive, especially tail this, tail that kind of missions however all in all it is a solid game despite some minor technical issues.Fframe rate drops on a i7 4790k and MSI GTX 1070 Gaming X  both overclocked which is ridiculus for a game from 2013, however I have to say that hte graphics are stunning and it truly brings to your home that carribean feeling, impressive for the time it came out.I have not played other AC however it would have been nice to see a serie based on black flag as a stand alone piratas game.If you have issue with AC.exe crashing jut try two times or so and it will eventually work, it gave me that problem only a couple of time towards the end of the game, we are talking about Ubisoft so no surprises about being like EA.
