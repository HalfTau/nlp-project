Great game, so many nautical miles better than Connor Kenways story, piloting a ship was the most fun part for me I actually think I spent more time at the helm of the Jackdaw than chasing down the storyline.A warning though, make sure you disable ubisofts cloud server sync AND always run uplay as adminstrator a bug still wuth the latest AC games, I found out the hard way after a 44 hour save file up and disappeared, now 87 hours in I have completed the story and roughly 90 complete on the whole game.Much recommend, Game itself 9.5/10, it would be a 10 for me if the bloatware that is uplay wasnt present, alas the frenchies try to match big boy steam and cant even code their cloud servers correctly.Anyways, back to the high seas for me YARRRRRRRRRRRR.
