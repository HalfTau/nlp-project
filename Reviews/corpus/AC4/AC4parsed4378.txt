The only Assassins Creed game that Ive played before Black Flag was AC3, so I presumed that I hated Assassins Creed games. Wrong! AC4 is great fun. Ive hardly completed any story missions, instead Im roaming the open seas plundering other ships. The Spanish must hate me. The story missions that I have played so far have been fun.I definetely prefer the combat style of Arkham/Shadow of Modor, but the game is still enjoyable. I can even manage the stealth, and I normally cant manage stealth games.But, as I mentioned, the pirate ship side of this is incredible fun and a great and rewarding gameplay loop.
