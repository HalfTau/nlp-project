Alright, so I know for a fact that this game is one of the best in the whole series, since Ive owned and played it on console.But, i traded it in long ago. Now that i see it on sale for lunar revel I purchased it without thought. So after 3 hours of downloading i launch it, and uh oh uplay... At the time i didnt think that much of it, and went on to create a uplay account and launched black flag from steam. BUT WHOOPS UPLAY SERVERS DOWN SINCE 300 PM! I waited for this game and now the fact that I guess i need to be online for this game to work... EVEN THOUGH I WILL ONLY PLAY THE STORY THAT HAS NO NED FOR ONLINE CONNECTIONS. Why steam, why.
