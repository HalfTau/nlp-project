Nice gameNice bugsSTOP WITH THE TRAILING MISSIONSbtw the game is totally BROKEN on radeon this is t, if you have problems playing it shacking screen , moving HUD but frozen screen etc... its just that UBISOFT SUCK BALLS like seriously i have 17 hours on this game , i had to change my graphics to medium to play the game , and then few days after , i had to disable pretty much everythat radeon bring , such as rapt to actually play the game before i was totally unable to play it xdddd.Do i recommend it? Yeah its enjoyable but if you have a radeon , i fear that itll be more boring than anything.
