Not a bad game and more fun than the previous game in the AC lineup.  The ship mechanics help bring something new to the table, while still keeping the tried and true yet refined climbing mechanics used in the previous games.  Overall, not a good place to start in the series but if you see it on sale it can be worth picking up.
