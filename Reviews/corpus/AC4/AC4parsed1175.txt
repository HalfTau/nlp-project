Ok, this game surprised me. I picked it on the summer sale. Ftr I have played the first couple titles. They were fun but the second was essentially the first. This one is essentially the same when it comes to land fighting. You have all the same moves and whatnot. The sailing is a great way to break up the monotonous land stuff. Building up a great ship and building a crew is so fun. Taking down other ships and having your way when they are down is just so much coolness. Definitely recommend.
