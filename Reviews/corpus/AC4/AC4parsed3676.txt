The senario isnt that good compared to Ezio Trilogy, but i wasnt expecting it to be that good neither. Those three games were fantastic. However the gameplay is seriously good and being the captain of a ship makes you play only this game. Also multiplayer is really good, especially compared to old ones. You can customize your character a lot more in the multiplayer of this.
