This is the best Pirate game I have ever played. When youre sailing over the ocean, the water splashing over your beloved vessel, the wind playing with the custom sails you picked for the Jackdaw your ship, duh and at the same time your whole crew sings a shanty ... This alone is worth playing. Of course theres a story thats SLIGHTLY about Assassins, but seriously, its the story of a man that wanted to become rich and famous and loses so much along the way. Hey, its a bit like Scarface. PirateScarface. But without the dickishness of scarface. The protagonist, Edward, is just a human being with his mistakes and funny sides and moments that make you really feel awful for him.So yeah, if you are sick of the Assassins Creed series, but are eager to play a game about piratesThen get it already and play it, lass!
