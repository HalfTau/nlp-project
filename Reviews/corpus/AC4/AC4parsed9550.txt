Really nice graphics, many different minigames and sidequest. Marvellous ship simulation. And then there is the controll. Simply bad and annoying. Very often youre dont even have control and Edward is doing what he wants. Many bugs like clipping events which prevents you from skinning animals. You often dont see the indicator for the counter and so on!Simply not sophisticated, so no AAA title...
