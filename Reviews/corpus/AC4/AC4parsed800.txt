I want to play this game again more than I want my money back. But I feel like I need my money back.I 99ed this gameon ps3. I bought it again so I could enjoy it on PC. NOWHERE did it tell me that I also had to download and create an account on Uplay. This is called malware. Software that goes onto your computer without your permission.I even created an account and logged in. No connection to uplay can be made.Exited Uplay and tried to launch again. Got an error message and cant play.This is almost 2018. Get yourtogether Ubisoft/Valve.
