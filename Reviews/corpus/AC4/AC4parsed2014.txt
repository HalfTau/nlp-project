Its a typical AC game. This one has an incredible amount of tailing missions, which i hate. also, its hard to accomplish the objectives it says. hide here. it says, but you cant.I have a decent computer w 16 gigs of ram and a 840 Nvidea GEforce, but i recieved a reeeeeeeally low framerate. running steadilly at 25 fps at medium graphics.also, the plotline took a strange twist. you are someone else navigating desmonds memories, and desmond is out of the picture somehow.
