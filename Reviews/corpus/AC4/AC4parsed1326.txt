Though it isnt the newest game, Ive found this game refreshing to go back and enjoy again lately.  As most people have heard by now, finding the shanties when exploring and having your crew sing them when sailing is a truly unique experience.  Ive recently switched to using the Steam Controller on this game, with one of the community provided configurations, and am finding that it works very well.  I highly recommend the game though formulaic, as most AC is now, its a really enjoyable way to get lost for a few hours ata time.
