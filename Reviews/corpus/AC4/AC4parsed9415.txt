This is a pirate game, not an assassins game. Forget all that Assassins vs Templars nonsense. It is a pirate game, and a fun one at that. Although this is not quite the Sid Meyers Pirates 2 we never got, this is still an excellent pirate game in its own way, to make up for what could have been. I definitely recommend this for its pirate content.There are a few things that Ubisoft did that irked me wrong, mainly taking away player freedom on certain missions by forcing the player to take the cowards route and flee, instead of staying around and sinking all foes down to Davy Jones Locker. It was quite revolting.Also a few things in the story dont really make logical sense, and it makes it hard to take the story seriously.Freeroaming and pirating is a delight, although it is a shame that the game area is only little above a 1/3 of the Caribbean, and not the whole Caribbean.Overall I would recommend this to others. 7.5/10
