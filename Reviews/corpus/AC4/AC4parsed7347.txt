Once again a great accomplishment from Ubisoft. The story folds out great and you get carried by it to the point that when you actually finish the game you do not reliase it until the credits start to role. Ship controls are smooth during combat and the modern day story plays out nice however the reason why Abstergo Entertainment were employing/hosting S and R just proves my theory that they were Abstergo agents from the getgo.The art within Abstergo Entertainment was amazing especially the entry lobby. The art within the animus was amazing too. There were very minor glitches in graphics, physics and positioning but it was so minor you most likely will not notice it and it does not happen during the main mission neither.Oh and good luck with those legendary ships, try to keep your rage down ShadowThe Shadow Network ShadowNET
