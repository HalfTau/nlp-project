The only AC game that matters. All else is hogwash.Dont buy this game because parkouring across buildings is fun its not. Dont buy this because you care about the overarching story of Templars vs Assassins in the future/past you dont. And, please friend, dont buy this game because you think contextsensitivity is smart gameplay press A to win.Buy this game because youre an fing pirate.Sail the salt sea as your crew sings chanties. Harpoon whales and dive with sharks. Explore ancient ruins on jungle islands. Casually dispatch enemies by the dozens as you board their vessel. This is the best pirate game by a long sight. The story, excluding the Animas portions, is fairly good. The characters are likable and well realized, and the voice acting is superb. But, damn, those Animas parts of AC games have to go.
