This is not a negitive review for the game, its for the pc version. The game itself is amazing and the endingwill not spoil it was equally amazing. The downside though is that its supper laggy, i have a moderatly good pc and i was getting on average 8 frames per secondthis is really slow. I reccomend that you get the Xbox or PlayStation Version, do not get the pc version.
