Yarr!Its a fairly average Assassins Creed game for a good portion of it namely, all the ground segments. You have a fairly standard assortment of weapons smoke bombs, up to four pistols, swords, hidden blades, and three kinds of darts, and, while fun, is nothing special.Then you get a ship. And then much piratebased fun was had.The sailing feels awesome. Naval combat, while still a bit basic, is suprisingly good fun. Ramming enemies is satisfying. Using the swivel guns is satisfying. The shanties are nice to listen to whilst sailing about, and its quite fun to take advantage of, and avoid, the stormy weather. The thick clouds of white smoke that you get in naval combat do their job quite well. It takes a little bit to get to the ship portion, but it is ohsosatisfying when it is gotten to.There are also other waterbased sections that I wont spoil, but they are quite satisfying to go through, if tense.Overall, a good game. Also, makes me wish for a sequel or spiritual successor to Sid Meyers Pirates with this sort of perspective available.
