Ive been after this game since it came out. It really picked up what 3 dropped. Its an Assassins Creed game through and through but now you can just pissball about on your ship when you dont want to bother with the land missions. As for the story, Ubisoft did a truly amazing job. Blackbeard, Kidd, Vane, all of them incredible characters that you really connect with through Edwards story. If you want an Assassins Creed game then get this one, the others are fantastic as well, save for 3 which was a bit disappointing and Unity being buggier than an unpatched version of Fallout 3.
