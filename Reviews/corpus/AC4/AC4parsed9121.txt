This game has the great assassin gameplay of an Assassins Creed game mixed with some pirate elements reminiscent of Sid Meiers Pirates!, which combine to make an excellent overall package. My only complaint is that the story leaves a bit to be desired after the strong stories in some of the past entries in the AC series.
