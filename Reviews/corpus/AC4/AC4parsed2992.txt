Oh my what a great game. I love pirates and sailing ships, and a few other assassins creed games. Just love the way it is with pirates. The thing I dont like is how the character loves to jump up into everything or off of things when I dont want him too. There were a few sad spots in the storyline, but other than a few hiccups and occasional glitches that only happened once in the game, it was a great game.
