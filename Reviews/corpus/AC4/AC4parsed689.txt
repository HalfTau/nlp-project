trully beautyfull.atmosphere  environment really immersive.far too easy  repetitive outside main story ! except legendary ships, the rest is rookie level... always some incoherences about gameplay controls with keyboard  wih time, player customs it, but keys  functions of keys could have been more sensed for optimal gameplay or need a gamepad ofc.fight  combos are fun but a bit drawned  confused when too many ennemies around or during fight on a ship deck with plenty of actors, etc... not a drama, but efficency in dogfights was limited bcoz of that... note i need a gamepad for Origins ! lola good RPG game, for sure.just lets hope Origin will be more challenging, but beside that, i dont regret to have bought AC4 such later in 2017.
