Fans of Assassins Creed have been follownig the game for years, myself included, so when I picked up the game I expected brilliance as per usual.  While not as mind blowing as its predecessors, the naval system has been vastly improved.  Much of your time is spent on the seas, and its great that the ships have been improved and thought out.The story fits nicely to connect to Connor from the previous game, coming full circle for those who enjoyed his story.I could go on about the story, the fighting, but if youve ever played an AC game before its all the same, and familiar as usual.  All in all, I would always recommend an Assassins Creed game.
