As far as pirate games go, this is by far the best one out there. As for a game about an assassin... not so much. Those parts are still a ton of fun, but what makes this game great is that you are given the freedom to go pirating as you see fit in a completely open world full of enemies, activies, and tons of great sights. Not to mention that the story aint half bad either! All in all, this is a must for fans of assassins creed and newcomers to the series.
