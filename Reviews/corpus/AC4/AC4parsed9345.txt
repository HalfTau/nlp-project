This game is just pure fun! An open world with pirate ships, what else can you ask for. In all seriousness, black flag has exceeded my expectations. The game has plenty of new and fun things to do besides the main storyline. I recommend this game because its a blast to play and the gameplay will keep you having fun for hours on end. Fast travel does take off the boring edge of sailing out to sea for long periods of time.
