Assassins Creed 4 is a pleasant suprise for me, I had lost faith in the series after Assassins Creed 3 because it was such a huge disappointment. Assassins Creed 4 is better in every aspect. I never really liked the storyline in Assassins Creed games, because I think its not enough real history and too much scifi, but at least the main character and most other characters are interesting and likeable which was not always the case in Assassins Creed 3.The best things about this game however are the amazing graphics and beautiful scenery. There are many moments you stop doing activities and just stand there enjoying the clear blue water, tropical plants and warm sunsets of the Caribean. Lighting and water effects are truly amazing. Cities are really lively and are way more suitable for freerunning than in AC3. Just cruising around the Caribean Sea with your pirate ship and listing to your crew singing sea shanties is great fun as well.So Id say you should buy this game, even if you never played an AC game before or think AC3 was a disappointment.
