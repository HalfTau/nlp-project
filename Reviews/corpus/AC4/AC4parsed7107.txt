Never really got into the original Assassins Creed or any of its sequels, but when I heard about this I put it on my wishlist and waited for it to come up on a steam sale. Got it in the June sale and its one of the few games that Ive paid 35 for and gotten my moneys worth out of.Great game with great graphics even on my GTX 580 and an engaging story, although I thought the out of animus stuff was a bit weak or at least not to my tastes. Well worth putting up with uplay for and Im now actually looking forward to Unity when it comes out. Only downsides I really found with the game were the few glitches/bugs here and there although nothing gamebreaking and that after playing 2/3rds of the way through the story the tail/hide missions did start getting a little stale. Ship combat is good fun, as is clearing the decks with sword/guns whilst boarding and little things like the legendary ships and the diving sections were nice bonuses. Definitely recommend getting it if you even remotely like pirate games and some plunderin!
