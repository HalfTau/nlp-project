So, I had to assassinate a target, I wont mention his name as not to spoil it, and it was optional to kill him from above. So I got to an elevated position and the moment I striked, a soldier walked past my target and I accidentally killed the soilder God rest his soul. Matter of fact, I tried to escape as to do another attempt at the airborn kill, but another soldier decided to help me by throwing some explosive close to my target. My target obviously died and I had nothing to do with it. So I recommend this game for how helpfull even your enemies are.
