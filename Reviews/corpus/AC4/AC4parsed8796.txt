Compared to the previous two AC titles, Black Flag regains a lot of the momentum the series had. The graphics, sea battles and sailing aspect are top notch, and the lush jungle islands are fun to stop off at and explore. The Kenway story isnt bad, though the Abstergo section is wayyyy too meta and uninteresting for its own good. Controls are about the same as previous games, i.e. not good. Youll probably fail each chase sequence at least once because your character decides to go down a ladder instead of run past it.Anyhow, Im about 6 hours in and apart from control issues Im enjoying Black Flag a lot. If youve been burned by Revelations or AC3, this will make up for it.
