Incredible comeback for the AC series, unlike most games that has multiple sequels and prequels, AC did not fail to astonish their fans once again in their 6th series and even capture fans new fans me.Single player is great from gameplay, storyline to world dynamics. The world of AC 4 BF is incredible from adventure, from the ocean to land and even underwater. I dont even need to say about the graphics is amazing, it is pretty much a better world, better graphics, more ocean animals, more treasure version of Farcry 3. Towns are amazing as well, you no longer need to just find chest to get rich now, because of the alternate ways such as hire contracts from not only cities to cities but even little islands. Also there are storage house that provide metal and clothes even money offers you another way to upgrade your ship besides stealing and destroying boats.Multiplayer is great also. Though it did not offer as much new dynamics as single player. But Single player patch the holes of multiplayer beautifull.
