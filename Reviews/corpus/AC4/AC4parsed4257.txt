The game itself? GREAT. really, probably the best pirate game in history. The only thing Im gonna complain is SCREW YOU UPLAY! CAN YOU PLEASE JUST  OFF AND LET ME ENJOY MY GAME????Yup, if you ask me if I recommend this game or not, my answer would be YES. But before you buy it please prepare yourself the Uplay might ruin your day.
