Well, you know, you know what everybody says about AC whine The series shouldve ended with ezio, EVERY single sequel is superbad!!!!! whine. I am really not that guy, but Im gonna be honest This game has nothing to do with Assassins Creed. While it may be okaaaaay as a Pirate Game, it has the typical AC problems after AC 3 The fighting system is way too easy If you are somewhat concentrated, you can just mow down 30 guards with no problem.It basically works like this The enemies attack you sloooooooowly one by one. You just wait till you can counter an attack, allowing you to kill your attacker with a fancy animation. And another one. And another one. Until theyre all dead. Not challenging at all if you ask me plus the Batman Arkham series has a similar, but much better working system.This makes the new stealthsystem pretty much pointless, because you can always just hack n slay yourself through the masses of yellow and red enemies. Another thing I absolutely hated were the reallifeAbstergothingies. They are just annoying and unnecessary. Controlling and fighting with the ship was fun, but I want actual Assassinstuff in my Assassins Creed games.. Ps Dont get fooled by steam saying I only have 11 hours on the game, I have a PS4 on which I  played it to 81.Bye
