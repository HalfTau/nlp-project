The gameplay is easily the best of any assassins creed game.The freeroaming is great as ussual.. The world is massive, im almost 60 hours in and still havent exlored everything, i have the majority of the side quests to do still. Both normal combat and naval combat is outstanding, i found myself just immersed in the combat for hours and hours on end without ever getting bored. This is a pretty graphically demanding game, but if you have a decent graphics card it is a real treat, the visuals wowd me more than a few times.and best of all the story.. without any spoilers..the story of this game is the best since ezios. Play this game through to the end and you will know what i mean.. the ending is just beautiful.this is one of my favorite games, and is a perfect example of what video games of this genre should strive to achive going forward.
