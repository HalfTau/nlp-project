Ive only played for an hour and I can already tell you that this is the type of game I really like. Being UPLAY, it has many similarities to Far Cry 3, open world, treasure chests, items to find, animals to skin etc, and you open the map by climbing viewing points, like the radio towers in FC3. Love it, recommend it.
