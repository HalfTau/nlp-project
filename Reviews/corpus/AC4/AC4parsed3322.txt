I completed this first on the XBox 360 and now am set to start it on my computer. Its probably my favorite AC game, just edging out syndicate. Ships are fanastic and the sea shanties are one of the best parts. I may have become a little too immersed in the game and gone through two bottles of rum throughout my time playing it. Edward Kenway is likeable, controls are nice and the scenery is gorgeous.
