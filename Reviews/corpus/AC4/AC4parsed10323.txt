This game is amazing.  Ive played every Assassin Creed game that have ever been released, and in my opinion, this game has the best gameplay from all the Assassins Creed games Yes, better then AC2!The world is huge  You got so much to do,  that it is just so much fun! Discover islands, when you take another ship down, or when you take controll of it and add it into Kennways Fleet which is a REALLY awesome feature, really funThe storyline is a bit low in my opinion, compared to AC2/AC3, but it is still great!I think that Assassins Creed 4 is the best Assassins Creed game so far, and if you loved any other AC games, Im sure youd love this one too!Very Recomended!
