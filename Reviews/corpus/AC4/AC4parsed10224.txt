Large open world with an interesting lead, and no desmond!I suppose Im biased really, not only was the boat sections the only redeeming quality of three imo Im also a sucker for pirates, I thought making the player the main character of the real world was perfect and really fit the meta concepts of the series, the only down side is youre mute and completely unresponsive which becomes incredibly grating at many points of the real world story arc.My only complaint is I wish there was more to the world, its big geographically but feels stale...theyre getting close though if they keep up with this trend and hopefully with a more interactive real world story arc the next game could be truly fantastic.Oh and my five year old pc plays this just fine, not sure where the technical complaints are coming from really.
