I dont really review games that often, if, really any at all.The story was phenomenal, best in the Assassins Creed series, and one of the best Ive honestly seen in a single player game, close up with Deus Ex and a few others.Gameplay was standard AC formula when on land, but with minor, yet crucial differences like the addition of the pistols, and blowdarts.Though, on sea, it was completely different. Imagine AC3s ship combat, but a hundred percent more fluid. Traveling was also a truly immersive experience, the various collectable shanties making the ride just that much more piratey.Honestly, my game of the year, even if it came out awhile ago.
