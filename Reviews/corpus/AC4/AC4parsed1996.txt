Do I recommend this game? no.Why? Because of 1 simple reason. The controls are absoluteSee, Ubisoft made the Brilliant idea of making your run command, the same as the Free run command. So that means that, if your character is running, trying to chase a target down which the game FORCES you to do multiple times by the way Youd better hope to ing God you stay away from corners, because you will climb on any and EVERYTHING in the process.This can happen at any point, if your trying to run, youll free run if you come anywhere near any point thats free runable and then bamn, your parkouring the hell of something.That one, simple fact, destroyed the games enjoyment for me. Is it fun? Sure, its interesting, and the ship battles are......ok for the most part, except when you get gangraped with no hope of winning, and your crippled on top of it.So if you dont care about frustrating control mechanics, give it a shot.Ranting aside, it honestly feels the game is TOO sensative for what they were trying to do, which makes it that much harder for the player to enjoy. Every time I have died so far, its been because I said, Run like hell! And the game choose to interpret it as, Run up that wall that you cant climb! Or the most recent one, Go around that corner, which was interpreted by the game as Climb up the wall so EVERYONE can shoot you dead!.Oh yeah, the nonstop tutorials get old as well. And seriously, STEALTH missions with a ing ship.......STEALTH missions. Yeah, apparently, enemy captains cant turn their heads and look right behind them and see you tailing them.
