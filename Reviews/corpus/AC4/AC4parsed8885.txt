Not without its flaws, this game is an incredibly beautiful game set in a tragically underused time period. Gorgeous seaworthy gameplay and a great protagonist yuck ACIII makes up for a lot of small quirks. Still suffers from the usual Assassins Creed problems like an overabundance of tailing and eavesdropping missions, clunky movement/parkour controls at times, and a directionless Templar/Assassin narrative. The overall feeling of the game is almost brilliant though, I cant remember having this much fun in a game. Its utterly addicting to disable and board ships. The sea shanties alone make this a definite recommend!
