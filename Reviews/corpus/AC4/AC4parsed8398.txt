This game is PHENOMINAL. The transition between open sea and dense jungle is seamless, the combat is as M1, M1, M1, repeat as ever, and the graphics are splendorous. Note That may mean that, if your computer is more than about a year and a half old, it may either get about 3 fps, or just implode from this games awesomeness. Its MUCH better than Assassins Creed 3, so dont use that game to judge this one.
