The Single Player is amazing. 100 hours of sailing the high seas, robbing convoys, plundering and pillaging, running through the jungle  finding secrets, solving puzzles, unearthing treasure, deep sea diving, etc.Multiplayer, however, spoils experience COMPLETELY. Its almost like they had first year IT students implement it. Terrible, plain terrible. Off the top of my head latency issues serverside, transaction/money issues serverside, horrible menu navigation system completely different from the one in single player btw, nonhierarchical menus, random disconnects. Finally, hackers, grievers. If there is another known multiplayer issue  this game most likely has it.NoteThis game was bought by me specifically for having multiplayer options, so inability to use them has impacted my review.SInglePlayer 9.5/10Multiplayer 0/10Average 4/10
