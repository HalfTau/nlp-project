While the game follows much of the same formula set by its predecessor, it does so while expanding on it greatly, namely the sailing which is now used to traverse the positively giant openworld.Within this world are tons of fun sideactivities to encourage setting off into the world on your own accord. You can find new islands, hunt animals to craft new items, follow the coordinates and drawings on treasuremaps, dive to the bottom of the ocean in search of hidden loot, carry out naval battles for your enemies possessions, wrestle controls from the fortesses overlooking the different sections of the seven seas and much more. On the story side of things, Edward and his companions are a nice and fresh bunch compared to the underdeveloped cast of the previous installment. Edward finds himself a central player in the events that unfold compared to Connors more observative view and he also ends up eventually changing immensely because of it.
