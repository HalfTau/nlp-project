The best parts of Black Flag are those on the seas. Ship to ship combat, sailing to tiny islands and finding treasure and maps to other treasue this is what Black Flag is about. I even like the Fleet minigame, as it adds an incentive to raid and capture ships so you can build your armada and its not a bad way of acquiring resources and gold. Oh, and sea shanties.The characters are OK. I at first didnt like Edward because he seemed a little too careless, but after playing I can understand where hes coming from hes a pirate, its his job to be reckless. IMO the best characters have to be the side protagonists.The story is OK, too. It can really drag along in these Assassin Creed games, especially the beginning half or so, but its worth going through to get back to the seas in Black Flags case.All in all, the last best game AC game to have been made keep in mind that I havent played Origins or Syndicate.
