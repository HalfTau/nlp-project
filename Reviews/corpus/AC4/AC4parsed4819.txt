Really good game though played just 2 hours but main problem is that at first i founded bit misleading but after that i understand that i was bit stupid that didnt watch where to go. didnt try multiplayer yet but yea  with that much content and crafting in it in my opinion it might be a really fun expierience to try naval battles which in my opinion is really good made even though i just only played opening battle section P
