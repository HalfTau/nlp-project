Finally got around to playing and finishing this game for the first time. Ive played through it entirely via the Steam Link. Worked great.By default, the game runs poorly, often dropping to 30 FPS, but theres a couple of tricks you can find on the internet to remedy this to some degree.Gameplaywise its mostly standard AssCreed stuff except for the naval elements, which work very well with the plot and setting.I greatly enjoyed playing it, Id recommend picking it up.
