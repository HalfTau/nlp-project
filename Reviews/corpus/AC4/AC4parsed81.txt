This is a fantastic pirate game. Edward Kenway is a well written protagonist, but unfortuently the missions are what holds this game back. The story is pretty great but its the missions that drag it down as they arent really that interesting Although at the end it gets a bit better and the whole Animus part is just really weird and doesnt fit in and actually kind of ruins the whole immersion you had in the main game. I wouldve much prefered that the story only took place in the Carribean and the whole Animus part wasnt a thing. The melee combat is unfortuently a bit too easy and can be buggy. For example if youre in combat and you decide to run up to someone who isnt in range, once you reach him and if he instantly attacks you, you wont be able to counter him for whatever reason and youll just eat his attack.But where the game really shines is when youre playing around in the open world. Steering your ship for the first time, and hearing your crew sing is just simply amazing. The naval combat is my favorite part of the game and can get quite intense especially the first few battles, boarding enemy ships just makes this even more epic and the music is just so good in that part. Sailing around collecting chests and exploring underwater wrecks is just another example of why this game excels in its freedom. Taking over forts from your ship is yet another intense and epic thing in this game. I also really like the decision in letting the player get attached to the one ship that you have throughout the game instead of letting the player aquire bigger ships, instead you upgrade each part of the ship to make it stronger so that you may take down those big ships later on.I would definitely recommend purchasing this game.
