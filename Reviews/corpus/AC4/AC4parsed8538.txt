This game is reminicant of the original Assasins creed which I played on xbox. Since then Ive missed the other sequels. This game has some great additions to the original, notably you get to sail about the carribean causing mischief and mayhem, not bad. If you like jumpyshootystabbyhidey action titles, then Id reccomend this to add to your collection. If not, maybe try at a friends house before you buy.The running system is improved but I still find moments my char will stupidly leap in a cameradriven and wrong! direction leaping you to your doom and causing much cursing and fustration. Free running games must be hard to make, and this isnt very hard to play.Not my style of game, but has its moments.7/10
