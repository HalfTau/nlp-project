At this moment I can say without a doubt that this is easily one of my favorite Assassins Creed games, only 2nd to  ACII. I have put in around 40 hours of playtime so far and have loved nearly every moment, outside the rather mundane missions that do spring upbut its very rare. Once I have completed the main storyline I will revisit this review and give my full impression, but up to this point I highly advise any reader unsure of the purchase to get this game. Contrary to what others may state, I have had ZERO issues with glitches or poor performance during gameplay, nor do I have ANY issues with UPlay.
