One of the best ac games although more of a pirate sim than its traditional hunt,stalk,kill gameplay. ac blackflag has so much to do with its huge open world, filled with contracts,upgrading ur ship, upgrading kenways gear, hunting for easter eggs, assasinations. With all that being said it does get a bit repetitive so only play with breaks inbetween. As for story i thought it was a but weak, it does get better later on but just slightly. graphics are amazing, sound is amazing. Ai is extremely weak in this game, sneaking is easy, infact u can walk in plane sight almost haha. overall solid story, kinda predictable, great graphics, repetitive for long durations, graphic heavy gpu is needed. 7/10
