Admittedly, I havent been keeping up with the Assassins Creed series. In fact, the only other AC game I have played was Brother hood, and I remember may parts of it was quite enjoyable, while there was one or two missions that annoyed me, the games was very good as a whole.As for this game, well, much of the same. I really enjoy the feeling of cruising around in my Jackdaw, exploring as I see fit, doing as I see fit and engaging in quests when it seemed like a good idea. From the moment I started sailing and fighting in my ship, I was in love. It adds a fantastic break from the constant parkour that was very prominent in Brotherhood. I still get to parkour plenty, but the gaps between make it much more special and interesting. The assassinations seem a little lacking, but that can be attributed to the lack of fantastical architecture in Brotherhood. For what they had in this era namely pirate ships they have some cool new ways to take out people. Jumping off of the coliseum and landing on some unexpecting guards was very cool, but so I leaping off the mast of a ship.As for pacing, the game seemed okay, but I had some real issues with the Tail Quests. Staying close to a target while not being too close can be difficult, but it becomes even less fun when you cant be detected by any guards scattered throughout the compound. These quests were easily my least favorite part of the game, but not enough to make me stop playing by any means. Also, I have never been a bi fan of the whole Templar, Abstergo, Desmond stuff, but that is all completely oponion based.All in all, I really enjoy this game and plan on still playing it. All of the little shanties and treasures are fun to find, and the side missions are quite fun. The game did drag a bit during some quests but I would deffinatly reccomend this game nonetheless.ProsGood gameplayIm on a boat!Dumbass guardsConsEavesdropping questsAll the nonpirate t XD
