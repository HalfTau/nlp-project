pretty hard on computers, but an absolutely astounding game. took me a little over 70 hours to complete, but I also mess around alot and do side quests along the way.. so it took me longer than it could have. Either way, i wish I owned more assassins creed games so I knew more of the background, but the game does explain what it needs to to acomplish getting a good story
