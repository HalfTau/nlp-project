Great game, a refresh to what is use to be a Assassins Creed game, the pirate thing is amazing and the campaing story is amazing. The AC2 story is the best and then this one in my personal opinion, the customization of the ship, hide out and Kenway is nice. The underwater parts incredible and the hunting in open seas is something cool and bloody. This game has glitches like anyother AC game but still amazing, for me the online gaming of AC is not importan because I dont like it. If you want to play this story with this new assassin go for it you will not regret.
