im not saying that this game is bad but this game is not as good as the previous assassins creeds the element of stealth in this game is all but gone basically its either pistols or swords in this game and the constant buttton mashing combat is poor. the parkour is flawed were you want to do one thing and end up jumping of a ship mast. the main story is dry with unlikeable characters and poor acting. you find once youve completed the single player there isnt much to do and yeah sure you think oh! ill go spend hours upgrading my ship to the max and even when youve done that the naval comabt is repeative and boring. 5/10 Buy Assassins Creed Brotherhood for  sakes its way better
