A shame to a misused franchise.Now im not saying dont go buy it just not on PC, buggy andand fails to bother even start after a few goes, i tried all the fixes out there but it always get back to the blackscreen witch locks up my PC.Im going to get it on PS4 for the sake of the people how put their heart and soul on to Capture of the Body Motion, Mechanics, Acting/Cut scenes, Soundtrack/ Effects Genre  Aesthetic. Not the storylineI dont even need to go on about AC3.Im sorry it was wasted on Ubisoft PS GTX 1070/ i7 NewGen/ 16GBRAM/ 850ww power supply more then enough
