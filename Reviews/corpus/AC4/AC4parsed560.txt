This is the most entertaining AC game so far, theres plenty things to enjoy.Although the storylines weak, at the end it ties very well.Very entertaining and fun.The DLCs are alright, the 3 islands are piontless.Freedom cry have a good atmosphere but filled with repetitve side activities, I like the BGM in freedom city more than the Black Flag XD.
