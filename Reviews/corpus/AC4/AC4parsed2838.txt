Really great game, great gameplay, graphics and soundtrack. Storywise, I wished this game would focus more on the Assassins VS Templars war as the storyline is quite heavily based on piracy and naval missions not neccesarily a bad thing though. Edward Kenway is a liked character even though I wasnt a huge fan of the fact he doesnt show much knowledge regarding the Creed and what it takes to be part of the Assassins Order. Most of the game, playing as the selfcentered and arrogant Edward Kenway thats driven by money doesnt really feel like an Assassin to me. His character development thoughout the end of the game is good but its not smooth, it feels somewhat forced. As a major fan of the Assassins Creed series and storyline, I personally think this game would be better off as a pure pirate game rather than part of the AC series.
