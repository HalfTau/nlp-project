WOW!!!  This is by far the best if not the best AC game yet.  I loved the ability to captin a boat in the last game, but now it is substantially better.  Purly amazing, I have spent hours upgrading this ship and captured what seems like hundreds of ships all the way to the dreaded man of war.  Excellent sea faring ship game.  My only hope is that that milk this aspect of the game a little more.  I really dont want to go back to being just limited to city action when they have given us that as well as playing the part of the pirate on the sea.  I could not get enough of this game.  Simply amazing.  Buy it and fall in love with sea.
