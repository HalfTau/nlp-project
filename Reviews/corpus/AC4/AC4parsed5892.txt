Ive only played the first Assassins Creed before playing this, so my perspective is probably a bit skewed as far as rating it as a game within the series goes.But as a standalone game, and compared to the first game, its awesome. It combines Sid Meiers Pirates! with Assassins Creeds combat and platforming, effectively nullifying any sense of repetition that I strongly began to feel about 1/3 into the first game. I actually wanted to do the side content in this game to make the main campaign go on longer and to feel more engrossed in the game world. On max settings the game looks amazing, especially at night during a storm. The story was interesting to follow too. My only problem was the amount of glitches present in the game... there was a new glitch every half an hour at least. Thats pretty unacceptable. But everything else was way too enjoyable to let that ruin the experience.If youre looking for a game to really play a pirate in, this game is a fantastic choice for you. Probably the best out there.
