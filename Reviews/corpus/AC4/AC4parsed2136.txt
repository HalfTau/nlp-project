Good game, although really poorly ported from console, still suffers framerate issues even when you have twice the horsepower needed as recommended.The main mission is what its all about, the side missions are too tedious, repetitive and boring.The fighting mechanics could be better, since most of the times you find yourself  just throwing a smoke bomb and assassinate a bunch of people, templars whatever is out for you.Pushing you to upgrade the ship is well done, this way you will be able to conquer Man o War class ships.It bothered me throughout the game that Edward Kenway isnt a true assassin in a traditional way, he basicallly stole his way in. Also I  dont like his face/jawline so much with his perky blue eyes, the cover art of the game isnt even the face of Kenway lmao, the cover art looks more like Ezios face from ACII which is more badass.I actually quit playing AC Unity after suffering all the horendous bugs and issues, after trying for 8 hours I just gave up, besides the fact I forgot along the way what the whole purpose of the mission was. It just seemed pointless killing random people and continue with the struggle, therefore I picked up Black Flag which is in any way superior in gameplay, Ubisoft where did you go wrong with Unity.All in all its 3rd on my all favourite ACs above AC1 and AC2  , so recommended game for sure!
