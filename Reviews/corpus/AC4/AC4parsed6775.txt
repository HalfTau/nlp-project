My problem with the assassins creed siries in general is that everytime theres less stabbing and more gimickyI can remeber in ACI that I was chasing a fat sultan and that he was surisingly quick so I killed him with a trowing knife.The only assassination I think was clever was, SPOILER!, when I tosed a smoke bomb at the sage, stuned him and killed him.The boating is fun but it gave me the feeling that the creators kicked it until it had bled out enough fill up content to fill the game with, also exploration is fun n all but I just kinda wanted a elite hull. They should have raised the price of the elite objects and given you a discount if you had the blue prints.If you really liked the older games, wait for Unity. If you want something new, try this game.I really buged me that I couldnt change the partical life because it gave my rig a hard time.I did like the game and the facial animations were REALLY good, Edward is a well written caractar, James Kidd is too.I didnt mind Uplay and have never had any difficulties with it.Ill give it a 6.
