I really have enjoyed all of the Assassins Creeds that I have played. So far Ive liked Assassins Creed III and IV best. What Assassins Creed IV Black Flag brings to the table is a much improved sailing mechanic which is really fun! It also seems to not have inhereted the bugs of Assassins creed III. Overall I would definitely recommend this game however it does see some serious price cuts during Steam sales so I would hold off until the next sale.
