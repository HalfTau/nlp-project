Damn such a shame, this game is freaking amazing. But of course it has to be ruined by a horrible PC PORT.Pc Specs To get an idea of how badly optimized this game isGtx 1070i7 4790k16gb DDR3 RAMI am getting a solid 30fps in naval, wildlife, and sometimes city gameplay. I didnt buy a 620 graphics card to dim down the settings just to get 60fps. This is ridiculousIt is so horrible, the fps drops are all over the place its unplayable.Get it on a console, better experience and an Amazing game!
