Not much to say, just a genious game, so both thumbs high! Each level, a new surprise and all the staff you can do, outside of main missions, is very nice. Hunting bull shark is just wow and I cant do it to often with my age, without risking a heart attack D This game ist just to recommend! Buy it in sale, or out of it, this game is worth every cent.
