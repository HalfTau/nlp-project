This is a console game  action orientated and fairly dumb.  Buy it if thats your thing, but be warned  if you want a broad sweeping adventure with interesting sidequests, go for something like Skyrim.Few points in summaryGraphics fantasticControls using keyboard  mouse not great, theres a bit of lag and its not intuitive, which means things like changing weapons in combat is clumsyInterface Poor  sometimes youre presented with information for no apparent reason and you cant get that info backStealth Dreadful  you cant even crouch behind a wall, you have to wait until the game thinks youre in a stealth environment, so any follow the ... missions are just rubbishStory what Ive seen so far The 18th century pirate storyline is interesting, but the 21st century office worker storyline is dull and pointless
