The game is good. Got it for around 7 during the holiday sale. Only problem is that it maxes out at 30 fps with vsync enabled. Turning it off grants you 60 fps but at the expense of screen tearing. Not sure how to remedy this so that it is stable at 60 fps. Will jump up to 60 fps during some parts of the game but drop back down to 30 after getting through whatever area you are in. Currently running it on an fx 8320 at 4.3 ghz and an r9 380.
