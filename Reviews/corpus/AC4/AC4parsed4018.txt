IGNORE THE GOOD REVIEW PLEASE READ THIS ONEDo not buy this game i am sick of the praise ubisoft gets from it because all the good is taken away once you realize you have to run this on uplay, uplay is a third party thing you need to use to be able to play the gamei just wasted my money on this game to find out about uplay, uplay is a half built piece of crap thing made by ubisoft that doesnt even let some people play the game because it does not connect to wifi for me and many others
