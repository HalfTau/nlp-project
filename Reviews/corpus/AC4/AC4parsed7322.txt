Firstly, Id just like to start by saying that I played AC I and AC II, but havent played any titles since. I loved the first two games, even if the first was a little repetitive. This game is not like them, everything seems just a little too complex. Sure, its kind of the same, and I like the idea of it being a pirate themed game, but I just cannot get to grips with it.Many will point to people like me and say herr derr they just cant do it and theyre absolutely right  I cannot do it, but thats precisely why Im rating this game thumbs down. I liked the previous titles but cannot get to grips with this one. If you liked every single title in the AC franchise then yes, get this one  it genuinely looks good! If like me you havent picked up an AC title in a few years, go back and play the previous titles because it seems there is a bit of a learning curve, and to be honest I dont have the patience for it. This isnt the game to get you back into AC.EDIT Would just like to point out that I got this for 20 in the steam summer sale, and to be honest, Ive had two hours of frustrating gameplay out of it for three hours pay  doesnt add up for me. If youre unsure about this title and havent played AC for a while, think even longer  dont just think F it like me and buy it  its not worth the pain!
