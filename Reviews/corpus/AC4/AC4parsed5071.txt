This would be an amazing game if it would not be an Assassins Creed, but its still a great game.Sea battles and activities are spot on awesome. Ship combat feels easy and challenging at the same time. Ship boarding is great way to test your melee combat skills and tactics. On land combat and activities feel same old Assassiny, that get boring after a while, island exploring is sometimes challenging for no reason, making full exploration a pain to do, when you cant seem to locate one particular chest.Stealth bush system is great new addition to the tactics, and add some stealth element to rather boring town combat/exploration. The pirate story side is really great apart from boring Assassins and Templars for the 4th time. Theres lack of melee and ranged weapon variety, and once you get couple thousand R money, you dont have to invest in those.Personal gadget upgrades are a nice touch to make you hunt for specific animals and their hides/bones. Ship upgrades are really nice, and require you to obtain cloth, wood and metal for them via sea battles, apart from R money and schematics. All around its a nice pirate game, even if its the same old Assassins Creed under the cover.
