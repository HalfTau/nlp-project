Nice graphics, nice world, beautiful nvidia physics, nice main character, but Ezio more charismatic and better! But this game have old problems with gameplay and the same type boring missions.Conclusion much much better than Assassins Creed 3, but I love Assassins creed 2 more, Ezio Auditore da Firenze forever!My score 86/100 must have   ,  ,     ,   ,       . ,       1  ,        . ,   ,  ,   ,              ..       ,     .
