Lets get this out of the way first. I really dislike the Assassins Creed games. Theyre dull and come out so frequently that I dont even get a chance to finish the last one before the next one comes out. Assassins Creed ranks up there with Call of Duty with being one of the most absolutely overrated and overhyped game series of the last few years.Having said that, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is awesome. It is awesome for one reason and one reason only. It stands as the best Piratesim that is currently released. The piracy stuff is totally cool, a lot of fun, and fairly immersive. Enough so that the atrocious stealthassassination gameplay can be overlooked. It isnt that the stealth stuff sucks but I hate it.I recommend this to anyone looking for a really fun piracy game. I recommend this to anyone who has dreamed of playing a game with a fun and engaging shipsailing mechanic.
