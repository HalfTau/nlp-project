Only payed it for a few hours ... not that i got bored of the gameplay, i still like it, but i found the storyline to be a bit boring and very unbelievable even for a work of fiction.EDIT Gave this game another go and this time played it for a little bit longer. My previous thoughts still stand, but i liked the bhip parts of the game a little more that the standard stalk and kill gameplay. Even then towards the end of the game it felt like it was getting a grindy as the difficulty of the ships i was encountering required me to upgrade my own ship, which is fine but, that in itself required me find and loot many more ships. A little too much imo for a game that is mostly single player.
