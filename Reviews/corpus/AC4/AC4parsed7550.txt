This game requires UPLAY on top of Steam, which is basically the same as GFWL, Origin, Gamespy,, or any other redundant DRM out there.  People pirate games because of this kind of thing.  I bought it, but Im irritated.  If it gets any worse Ill end up a pirate, too.  Game makers  Please dont make me hate you any more than I already do for DRM.
