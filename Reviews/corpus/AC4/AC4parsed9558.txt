I absolutely recommend this game.  I was very hesitant after AC3, as I felt it was too much of a grind and it doesnt stand out really well in my head.  ACIV Immediately makes its own place and makes itself worth every penny.  I didnt even buy it, girlfriend bought it for me to cheer me up and I have been playing it as much as possible since.  I have put 12 hours on the game at the time of writing this, and am only about 50 through the story.  The side missions all stand out in their own way and feel unique.  Complete with equipment crafting, outfit crafting, whaling, hunting, and upgrading your ship.  I havent had this much fun in a game in quite some time.
