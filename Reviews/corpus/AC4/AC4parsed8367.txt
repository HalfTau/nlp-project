Awesome game. After playing through Singleplayer, the plot and storyline along with the gameplay itself was one of the most entertaining and thrilling Ive ever had the pleasure of enjoying. A must buy if you can scrape up the money, took me 23 hours to get through the main story and I skipped alot of the, also amazing, open world action. Get it if you can!
