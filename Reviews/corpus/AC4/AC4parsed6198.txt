I recommend it because i got this for 7 euros.....  this game is old by now and it still has hilarous and also sometimes gamebreaking bugs it also crashes a lot!!!.... not only stuck animations and sometimes floating stuff in the cutscenes...also missing ships... airdroppping ships.... waterholes.... crazy physic f ups and  super glitching ragdoll BS.... also the whole officegameindustrie breakign the fourth walll part of this game is horrific BS !! its like playing a super cool pirate game being interrupted rudly by some super  office walk around do BS gameplay with lazy minigames no body needs.... id give it 70/100 .... because the whole shippirate cruising thing is awesome.... still way to go ubisoft ...also uplay is a piece ofand this game is still a buggy mess after such a long time.... way to go ubi...also the writing is ed up ... whats up with bigpiratetramp ....did the game lacked some big boobs so badly ?.... cmon ubisoft...
