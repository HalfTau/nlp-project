Overall, this game is a very fun experience that makes you feel like a complete badass. D   But the only two problems that bother me of this game is if you are using keyboard and mouse instead of a wired controller, then you will sometimes get a sore feeling on the finger that you put on the shift button since you use that button throughout the whole game to free run. And the final problem that this game has, is the moments when you are sailing your ship and it takes forever to go place to place without crashing in to a rock or going in to boring naval battles.But besides that, this game has a lot of intense and thrilling moments including the very well planned out stealth missions that never get old!
