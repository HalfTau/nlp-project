Probably second best in the series so far. Reminded me of why I liked the first one, great story with lots of twists and turns, good character development to where one can relate and get attached to the characters and their personal stories. Great graphics, lots of good side stuff to do. Over all aside from a littel forced side stuff in order to get a few essential upgrades, took me 25hrs to complete the story. Id say its been a awhile sinc eIve played a sp that the main story took that long to do. Far cry 3 only took me 14hrs so ya great feeling in the length note no dlc added on so this is just the core. Overall highly recommend and if you happen to see it on sale to nab it as I almost didnt but I finally caved in on the steam summer sale on the very last day and so glad I did easily wouldve paid the full price had I known it was this good.
