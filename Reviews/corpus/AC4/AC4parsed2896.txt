While the Assassins Creed series may be running on a downward hill, there are 2 things about this game that I love and that make it stand out a bit. 1 Edward as a character is very well defined in the beginning of the game and his actions dont act contrary to that definition. 2 Naval Battles. This entire game couldve been something on its own if Ubisoft had decided that the ship segments were worth looking into a lot more. Even in its current stage they are still tons of fun especially when you get into battles with more than just you and another ship. Overall pretty decent game, would recommend to all.
