One of the best titles in the AC franchise imo AC 2 also comes to mind, what I like most the sailing, the Shantys, the scurvy, fleet micromanagement  and the story, a solid title, three years after release and till the end of time keeping it in my favorites shortlist.I like sail ships so I might be slightly biased to that part of the game, I still think its a winning combo and a change of pace for when you dont feel that stealthy or in the mood to assassinate.
