The twentyfour hours I spent playing seemed to melt away like sweet, tender meat. Its almost like I was having FUN. Unlike most games in this franchise, this game sports an evenly staggered mixture of unique gameplay elements. Half the time youll be engaged to the classic stealth assassinations, but for the rest youre swashbuckling on the high seas.Every tedious moment I spent in an obnoxious tailing mission is well worth tolerating as a means of later getting to the real meat. The Piracy. I was bombarding a huge fortress when during the middle of the fight a MASSIVE rouge wave surged from the horizon, demanding my full attention lest I capsize.All the while shells rang out overhead, scattering upon my ship threatening to sink me as I took on damage and water. Enemy reinforcements were soon upon me as well and I was running out of ammoso I rammed my ship into one of the enemy boats, scuttling it but not before swinging onto their deck and stabbing fifteen people in thelike a boss. I cannibalized the ammo and ship parts to repair my own boat and continued my assault on the original base, which I soon saw explode spectacularly as a hailfire of mortar and cannonballs converged upon it.My ravenous crew wasted no time invading the twisted burning wreckage of their base, climbing through the rubble to swordfight the survivors as they furiously poured out against me. After planting my knife into the head of the commanding officers I broke into the war room and punched the  commander in the throat.The seamless combination of boat combat and traditional melee fighting make this the best game in the franchise. If you play one game in the series make it this one.I like this game more than I hate UplayUplay is a tremendous dumpster fire filled with bodily fluids and dead dreams. If you release a game on steam, youre only doing yourself a disservice by forcibly integrating uplay into it.
