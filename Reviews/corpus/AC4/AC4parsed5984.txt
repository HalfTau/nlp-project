I have to say with the last couple of Assassins Creeds I have been pretty let down, but this one I loved. I felt like this series needed a new direction to go in, and this delivered. AMAZINGLY. I may be a little one sided, because the Carribean pirates are one of my favorite points of history, and this section of history has alway fasionated me immensely. I will be playing this game again in the near future.   8.5/10 An all around fantastic game.
