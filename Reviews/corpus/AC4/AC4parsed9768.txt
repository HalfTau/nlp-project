After Assassins Creed 3 i was really skeptical about buying this one, but im sure as hell glad i did. Ive yet to complete the game, but from what ive completed so far i can say that the gameplay is the usually, fights are the same, scaling buildings is about the same speed as Assassins Creed 3, the ship battles are better, and its all about pirates! also the world itself seems HUGE compared to other Assassins Creed games because of the addition of islands and sea adventures. Another note is that Assassins Creeed 4 manages to bring back the mystery that the previous installments of the AC series of seemed to lack. Just like AC 2 the best one IMO the game sets you up with a sleuth of information waiting to be found and decoded through video and recorded messages left over from desmond and research teams of abstergo.
