This is the first AC I have played and it gave me utter goosebumps. The graphics were amazing, the story was very original, and the options while playing were incredibly diverse. One could engage in hunting, assassinating of course, many other quests, and sail the seas of the Caribbean in your own boat and upgrade it. Personally, I am a great fan of buccaneering and pirating games during the reign of the European powers in the New World and this was highly satisfying. The game was well layered, not superficial at all, and the assassin vs. templar line fits in perfectly.
