The game starts off slow, but once you get going, get out of Havana the game is so much fun. The ship combat is so addictive for me, Ill think to myself Ok, I just need this one ship for the metal Then another ship comes along, then another. By the end, Ive forgotten that I was going to stop. Missions are good, some better than others. Collectibles are fun to collect as well.
