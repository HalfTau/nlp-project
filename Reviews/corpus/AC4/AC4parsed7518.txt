UPlay is still t, so if Ubisofts DRM isnt to your liking, avoid avoid avoid.That said, the game itself is probably some fo the best this series has to offer. Bring a pirate is fun, and thats kinda the central conciet of the game. The plot is forgettable, the characters largely disposable. But it also keeps that crap to a minimum and focuses more on the many piratey activities there are to activitize. That said, its another one of these games. If youve liked any of the past AssCre games, youll have fun here. If not, youll find little new here to really draw you into the series.
