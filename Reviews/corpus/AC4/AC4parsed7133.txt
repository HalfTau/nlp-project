I really had low expectations going into Black Flag, feeling wildly cheated by the past 2 games I had played previously in the long running line of games. I couldnt bring myself to finish AC3, on the account of it becoming so repetitive and boring it just became a job i wasnt getting paid for. Revelations and brotherhood should have been one game but that would have interfered with milking the franchise dry, until it was withered and brittle. Then there was Black Flag. This game has restored my faith in in the Assassins Creed name.While still holding fast to all the things we love about the AC games, awesome hidden blade action, freely running around cities and nature alike, seamlessly dipping in and out of stealth, they managed to throw in an ENTIRE navel aspect to the game. And i dont mean just throw in, they formed the game around it, and it is great. As soon as you start to get a little restless of the same hide and assassinate missions, you are back on your ship tearing through the seas cannons ablaze looking for any ahole unlucky enough to get in your sights. And spoiler alert, if youve been living under rock for the past couple of years and havent seen any reviews or media on this game, but you are an effin pirate in this. That means you answer to no one, and the main character is badenough to pull it off.Great new additions to the franchise, crafting items from hunted animals, using pistols in combos with your swords and hidden blades, and a myriad of other things. Must buy game, and makes me very excited to see what they do with Unity.
