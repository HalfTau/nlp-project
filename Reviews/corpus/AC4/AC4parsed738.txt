Assassins Creed IV Probably the last good one?In my opinion, AC4 was the last good AC game to come out. AC1 created the genre, AC2 and its expansions expanded it, AC3 fukked a bit here and there, but AC4 took it to the next level.The story, I cant really remember. Its about pirates.Youre also a pirate, that killed an Assassin, and took his clothes, and went in search for booty by helping some Templars, and then plottwists, backstabs, fancy story, a dude was actually a woman, Black Beard doesnt die, yada yada yada. Common stuff for an AC game.What really set it apart, was the gameplay. The cities have a feeling of being alive. The shooting with muskets is different than just swords like AC2, the pirate theme is actually fun, and the forrests and deserted islands are fun to move around in and explore. The real trs bon thing, is the pirate ship. The sailing, the exploring, naval combat, attacking forts, invading other ships, stealth killing all enemy crew by sneaking in from the water, is just very well done and genial!This game makes you feel like a real pirate! And the best thing It has the Portuguese navy later on in the game! Being a Portuguese person, for some reason, this made me feel happy!
