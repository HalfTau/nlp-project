Love the game... hate the bugs. Lost 2 characters after spending hours playing because the system crashed. There is no way to revive after your system dies, it just acts like the character never existed. UPlay customer service is useless... easier to just start again from scratch. Not a fan of the multiplayer version and the background story running around inside the corporation is boring but inside the anime is amazing!
