The AC games before this seemed to stumble with the idea of trying to give freedom to the player while putting forth a storyline, both past and present. This is the first one I played that managed to work around that. For a completionist like myself, the ability to complete any area you discover almost immediately was a big plus. The naval combat is hugely entertaining, with the income and resource acquisition at a rate that made your time seem valuable, but not the usual acquire an item through tens of hours of uselesss gameplay that you see in many of these games. 100 percent is achievable, but takes work. You will occasionally be frusterating with the parkour mechanics. The freerunning is much better than previous games, but still not perfect. The only time this really becomes frusterating is when chasing a shanty, but plug in an Xbox 360 controller and this game becomes much easier. Recommended.
