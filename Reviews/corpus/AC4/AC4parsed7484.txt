WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is a trap! Uplay has cancered this game and pretty much ruined it for many players. I have tried a plethora of solutions given by so many sources and I cant even launch the game before it crashes. The game FORCES you to have uplay on and running while you play the game. Is there no such thing as gamer trust anymore? This game is great but Uplay has ruined it. I had this game on xbox for awhile but then I had to sell it
