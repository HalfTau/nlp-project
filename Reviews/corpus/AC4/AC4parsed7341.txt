What can I say about this game? You will spend hours randomly sailing around, plundering everything in sight. It has pirates. It has rum. It has stabbing things, and leaping, and throwing knives at monkeys. You know what else it has? The worst feature in the world. The Animus! Now you work at google. And its awful. Assassins Creed Black Flag would be amazing, except for that annoying, closetalking kid with bad breath that is the Animus, constantly rearing its ugly head to ruin your otherwise fantastic plundering session. That being said, you should play this game. Suffer through the Animus, because the rest is worth it.
