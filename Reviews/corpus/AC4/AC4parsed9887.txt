TLDR this is the best assassins creed game to dateIf you liked AC2, but AC3 made you lose faith in the series, AC4 will make you a believer again. The production values on this one are through the roof. Graphics are unexpectedly good love the new tropical setting, reminds me of Far Cry 3, music and sound effects are top notch. The game also somehow manages to not feel like a tired rehash of an aging series, no small feat for such a long running series.
