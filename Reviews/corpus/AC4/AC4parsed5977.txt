Boot up the game.. great, Im a pirate, wreckingwith my boat. Awesome. Okay, now Im on an island and I killed this dude and nabbed his clothes. Still great. Immersed as heck, I AM a pirate/sailer dude, loving it. Save this merchant guy and captain his ship, awesome. Sailing it out of the bay and then all of a sudden BAM!  your immersion! Youre not a pirate, youre a goddamn  in a simulation. What the ing  Ubisoft? I knew this was coming, I have played AssCreed1, but seriously, just try making one of these games without the utter garbage futuristic storyline that I give less than 0 s about. Seriously, it is the WORST part of this series and feels utterly shoehorned. I dont give aabout futureboy and techno, I want to be a ing pirate/assassin/etc! me this is annoying.Do I recommend the game? If you dont get asoff as I do with the futuristic garbage, then sure.edit ugh, now techno is dragging me around abstergo and telling me all about the place... I DONT CARE STOP TELLING ME THISAND LET ME BACK IN THE CARIBBEAN!edit now Im back in the Caribbean being a badass pirate! When you forget all about the future garbage, the game is utterly fantastic! I just snuck aboard a galleon and stole it! Wonder if Im gonna be able to sa.... ING TECHNOTWAT AGAIN!?!?!?
