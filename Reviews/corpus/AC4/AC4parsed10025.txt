AC4 is a monumental pirate experience in the West Indies as your open world. The freedom to explore, plunder, and adventure to your hearts content is an unforgettable and thrilling experience. The main character, Edward Kenway is definitely welcome to a now ever extending line of Assassins in the AC franchise and I guarentee youll love him. On the flip side, the story has several ups and downs and the modern day detracts the atmosphere of urgency the other games had. Regardless, its a very solid game and redeems some of the mistakes of AC3. 9/10
