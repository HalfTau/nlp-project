Really enjoyed this game. Lately Ive played Batman Arkam Origins, Splinter Cell, and Far Cry 3 as well. I consider them all to be somewhat similar though the latter is definatly more fps in controls. That said, Id put Black Flag 2 on this list behind Splinter Cell.The graphics are gorgeous, and the Pirate Life is great. I get a bit annoyed by the Abstergo Interludes, and sometimes the controls or rather the interface with the environment  facing one way, leaping the other, or leaping onto things that you dont mean to are bothersome as well. The last 2 negatives, for me, are too many tail this guy type of missions and there is a bit of repetitive factor. That said, this is my favorite AC game yet, with a decent enough story to keep it intersting. I also love the Multiplayer, but nothing new here if youve been playing it the last few versions!Im a tough grader, but a solid 8 out of 10 for me!
