This game has all kinds of elements, combat, stealth, adventure, exploring. Its a really fun game, always feels good when you discover a new island, walk around seeing the habitants of the villages singing, working, playing, very atmostpheric. Ship battles are epic, when you first start out with a weak ship, it has the tension of running around dodging the lane of fire then pick a few shots at the ships bigger and better than yours. But when you get your ship to a decent level, it can be very epic as you take on 3,4 ships at the same time in a storm, dodging tornadoes, facing tidal waves. Story missions are boring as hell with a few exceptions, but the story and the main character itself is pretty memorable.
