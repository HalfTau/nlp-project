I really have to say, this is one of my best Assassins Creed experiences ever. I played AC1 and AC2 so far and was so hooked on the story. Sadly, the story around Desmond Miles seemed to be ended in Revelations, which I never played just yet  Black Flag however has a great story of its own, and if you like, plundering, looting, rum and sailing the seven seas, then this is just your game. This game has truly a cinematic scale and could easily be a Hollywood blockbuster. I strongly recommend, playing it, you wont regret it me hearties.
