Ubisoft has such terrible support for cloud saving. Researching the forums, google search after google search to find help.I moved my steam client to another hard drive to have more space for my games and updates. What I didnt know is doing so means you lose all of your work, but keep your achivments. The achivments now serve only to mock you and what you have losted. FC3 maintained its saves. Yet this game doesnt. Why this service is still maintained, if it could be called even that, is beyond me. You LITTERALY have to go through TWO stupid launchers before playing your game.Startup is like thisSteamUplayyou have to install this seperatly and create an accountSteamUplay/ubisoft wants to be like steam so badly it is a cheap imitation of it if I ever saw one.Do not get this game until Ubisoft starts supporting Assassins Creed 4 like they do the s..h..i..t launcher.EditI actually found a solution to the problem. Here is what happened.UPLAY and Steam where located on my C/ Drive in the default settings location. My 4TB Hardrive E/  is where I moved Steam to. After completing steam installation on the E/ drive I launched AC4 BF. However despite the saves remaining in the spot indicated by UPLAYCProgram Files x86UbisoftUbisoft Game Launchersavegames/... the game was not picking up the files and was telling me that I would have to start anew.As it would turn out I found out that if you install UPLAY on the same drive as the game E/ and copy and paste your saves correctly, it fixed the problem.
