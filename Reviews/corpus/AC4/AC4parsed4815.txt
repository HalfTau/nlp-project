In this game youll be playing as Edward Kenway a pirate ruffian with charisma and style.In my opinion this is the best assasins creed game so far!Black flag has alot of content and gametime,a HUGE world to explore and a variety of colourfull side charaters that make this game enjoyable.Also! If you havent played any of the Assasins creed games before IT DOESNT MATTER! you dont need to know the backstories or any charaters from previous games to enjoy this one.Buy this game if you wanna be a stabby sneaky charismatic pirate assasin and rule the seven seas while kicking templar butt from left to rigth!
