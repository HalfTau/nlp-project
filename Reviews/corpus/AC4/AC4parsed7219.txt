Basically the best and most entertaining title in the AC franchise to date, primarily owed to the sailing and pirating part of the game. Think Sid Meyers Pirates only you can straight up stab fools in the neck. The runnystalkystabby part of the game is basically the same from previous games, you still need to follow dudes and creep on their chats but you leave feedback at the end of each mission so you can be all onestar in protest. Played 82 hours despite the fact the game crashed every 30 minutes, thanks Ubisoft, you guys are amazing. 9/10 would pirate.
