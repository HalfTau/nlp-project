Amazing game that really redefined the Assassins Creed franchise. The new mechanics involved in sailing and ship battling are just so great and fun. I could really see coming back to this game just for sailing a very realistic and calming sail across the Caribbean, listening to my crew sing all of my favorite shanties.The game itself of course has its downfalls. Tailing missions in this game are awful, especially tailing eavesdrops. I really hope Ubisoft either drops those or improves them in the future to not be so frustrating and annoying. Combat can also be very annoying. For example, some enemies need their defense broken before you can damage them. I can break their defense and try to attack them, but Edward will automatically target another enemy around him that then needs THEIR defense broken so that I cant damage them. It creates a vicious cycle of annoyances.Still, if you can deal with the downfalls, this game is a great buy and a great play. Despite the cons, I definitely recommend this game to just about anyone even if you havent played the prior Assassins Creed games, I think you could play this and understand most of everything from the perspective of a new protagonist.
