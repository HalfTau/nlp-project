As a big fan of the Assassins Creed franchise I would say it is one of the best in the series. The storyline is interesting from start to finish. Graphics look great at sea and on land.The one complaint about this game I would have is that on PC the game does glitch out occasionally.9/10, highly recommended, for those who played previous AC games as well as those who havent played a single one.
