Its AC bolted to Sid Meiers Pirates really. The AC part is as hold the buttons and the game does the difficult bits for you as the AC games always are and the Piratesstyle bits are less fun and playable as a game 20 years old that you can play on an iPad.Its a button masher really, an endless sequence of slashemup fights where holding e, space and rmb in random sequences sees the game pull off a lot of moves you didnt really have that much to do with. Its like the parkour side of the game hold a few keys and you run forward and climb, leaping impressively from balcony to roof edge to window ledge without actually doing anything else. Its a game for the kind of gamers who like maximum effect for minimum skill.The stealth aspects are not too bad, though mostly the games AI is so blind or deaf that taking your time and plotting a route is more a matter of choice than neccessity. Its only after you attract 4 or 5 guards that fights become even vaguely challenging, so walking through the front door is as good a technique as anything.The games saving grace is, amazingly, the voice acting, dialogue and story which is pretty much the best Ive seen by a long, long way. The actors really bring the game to life and skipping the cutscenes just isnt an option theyre too well done and immersive.Sadly the rest of the game is an exercise in bythenumbers design and implementation. Oh well, at least it was on sale.
