This is one of, if not the best, game that i have ever played. The open world, endless objectives and engaging storyline really put this game ahead of the curve. I have also played other creed games such as 3, and I think that while there are many similarities, this game is still better. Also, I loved how the game was based around the boat, that was a great idea, granted the storyline is about pirates so there had to be a ship somwhere, but the extent to which it was intergrated was amazing. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the creed series or even if your a newcomer.
