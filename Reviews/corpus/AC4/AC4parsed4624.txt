Played for about 30mins. First i was told to go to the ships wheel to steer it, reached the wheel, NOTHING happened. Reloaded the game, got loaded INTO the ship, swimming in a glitch between the ship and the water. Played somemore, reached havana, synced at multiple points. Came back into the game later and NO saved games found. Refund please...
