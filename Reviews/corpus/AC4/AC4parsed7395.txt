This game is has a great feel to it, it may not have the older assassins creed feel but it certanly delivers in other ways like a good storyline and amazing graphics. Sure I had my doubts about this because of the pirate theme but i found myself ennjoying this game quite alot I would recommend this game to anyone. 9/10
