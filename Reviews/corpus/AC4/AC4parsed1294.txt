This game is a great entry in the Assassins Creed series.it doesnt feel as much like an Assassins Creed game as the other games. Besides that there arent many problems. The naval combat is great though. I really like how the AC games choose specific people from history include them in games. Black Flag has no shortage of historical figures including Blackbeard, Calico Jack, and Stede Bonnet. AC 4 doesnt really continue the story for the series, but it is still an amazing gaming experience.
