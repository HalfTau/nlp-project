i enjoyed this game. you get to free roam with a ship and doing so you can fight enemy ships and upgrade your ship. which is awsome! story is about pirates more then assassins but im completly fine with that. out of animus is cool. got jumpscared by a native who was hiding in a bush that son of a . multiplayer is ok.9/10
