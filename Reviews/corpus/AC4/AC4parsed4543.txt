Everything about this that isnt Assassins Creed is great. Despite the usual Ubisoft openworld collectathon and the thousands of repetitive side activities, oversimplified melee combat, and general lack of challenge in onfoot gameplay, theres a lot to love here. I was surprised at how much the main storyline carried my interest mothering Blackbeard is a major character, which helps. I might be overly enamored with the pirate theme, but the naval combat and fleetbuilding elements are really nice. Its a shame that more isnt done with it, really.Like any Ubisoft sandbox game, youll probably lose interest before you get through all the available content. But until that happens, the creative direction alone should keep you HOOKED.YAR HAR HAR I DESERVE A KEELHAULIN FER THAT ONE
