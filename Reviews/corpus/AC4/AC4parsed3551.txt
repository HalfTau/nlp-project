They really pulled all the stops with the production values on this one  I mean, the shiptoship combat, which is just a sliver of the overall experience, would be viable as a full release Age of Sale naval game.Just a tremendous amount of atmosphere meshed with solid gameplay in a massive freeroam Caribbean playground. Im hardly a completionist type player, but in this one I find myself tracking down all the little nooks and crannies of the maps just because I want to soak is all up. Highly recommended.
