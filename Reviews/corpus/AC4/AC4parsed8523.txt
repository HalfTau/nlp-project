TLDRPirates  Cannons  Assassins  Treasure  Limits  Amazing GameThis game blew me out of the water pun intended.The biggest thing I loved about the game is the sheer amount of exploration in it. No other Assassins Creed game has really touched on this before. You can travel all around the carribean either on land or by the ocean, all the while passing ships, fleets, sharks, whales, sunken treasure, pirates, bounty hunters, etc. This game has alligator fights! It has privateering! It has shanties! And the best thing about it is you arent forced into focusing on the story the whole game! Probably around 90 of the game is NON story...The shipfaring is a big part of the game which is well thought out. You really feel like youre controlling your crew through an epic battle and the struggle feels real. Boarding ships is easy and the game does a great part of transitioning into a boarding from a fight. It never gets old! Probably half of my played time is sailing around and plundering ships.One bad thing about the game is that it doesnt have a lot of assassinations... but honestly who cares? The least fun parts in the game in my opinion were when I was forced to sneak around in the shadows instead of staggering up to my foes and shooting them in the face like a proper pirate.Caveat I havent played an Assassins Creed game since Assassins Creed II. So I wouldnt call myself a die hard fan.
