Just bought this copy, downloaded/ installed, new gpu drivers and it wont load certain areas, mostly around fortresses. The sounds work, i can tell my ship is being hit and some indicators work like the map so I can see where to stear my ship but it freezes the rest of the screen so I cant even play past certain points, also if you leave the area it comes back to full working mode, but if you return to that area it freezes again
