who in ubisofts pc team optimised this game and thought it was a good idea to release it? i cant even get this to run any better than medeum to high on an EVGA GTX 980 SC Edition without dropping below 30fps1080p yes i like 60fps but i dont mind 30fps as long as its stable. the game itself is good but my god does it need optimising for pc.Secondly, lets talk about UPlay... my god why do you even exist? you are as like origin, why do you exist in your buggy state?all in all, 10/10 for the gameply but 5/10 for execution, Ubisoft what happend to you, you used to be my favourite developer in the Prince Of Persia Sands of time days
