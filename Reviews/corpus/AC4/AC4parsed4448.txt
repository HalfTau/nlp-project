Amazingly fun game!I was waiting for it to go on sale and grabbed it when it was cheap, well worth it.So many different aspects to the game and things you can do I have yet to get board.The content is challenging, then you upgrade you pistols, swords or ship and take on even harder challenges.Keep an eye out for when its on sale again, well worth it.Some people are rating this game down because they can not link to uPlay, I had no issues at all with this, for me it was a single click.
