This game is amazing, the pirating is the better part of the game altough it gets fairly repetitive.Another thing to note is that the story is mostly not about Assassinsmore about Edward and his adventure to fortune.this means more pirating, more for the gold instead of for the guildThere is also and seemingly endless world and there is always something to do.From stabbing people the old fashion way from rooftops too whaling.This is really a fresh start for the series and one of the better parts too.Concerning Edwards personality, It is in my opinion the best character in the game,he is fun and charismatic the opposite of Conner the main char of AC3.It is also a very interesting thing to see Edward go from Pirate too Assassin.Until about the 3/4th part in the game Edward would work for the Templars for the right price.What gives Edward a more all for the gold instead of an Assassin kind of character.Of course the city that we used too upgrade is now replaced with, Edwards ship the JackdawAnd the Assassins we used to send on mission is replaced with Edwards fleet,Sending the fleet on missions will unlock new trading routes and those have to be protected too.Overall in my opinion this game deserves a 8,7/10
