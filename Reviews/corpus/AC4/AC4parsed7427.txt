A game that has brilliant visuals and incredible game play. Although played on AMD therefore no PhysX, it is still incredible! The landscape is incredible and many hours can be spent on this game. Storyline is extremely rich as is through the whole franchise, and it only gets better! This game also includes a lot of side missions and side story lines thus adding additonal game play hours! With online functionally however, it is just like previous ACs however it obviously has the characters and locations of that of Black Flag. I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who is interested in the era of the British Empire and the carribean of 1715.
