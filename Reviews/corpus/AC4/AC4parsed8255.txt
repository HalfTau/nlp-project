Just wow i am only 25 through the game and i have already been playing for almost 20 hrs. That in its slef if impressive for a modern game. The amount of content in this game is almost undending. There are a few anoyances. I got to close to a ledengary ship A special ship battle to early and my ship was terrible at this point. Every time i died it would reset me at the begining of the fight some how the ship disapered and i got away but it was a while till that happned. The dramatic weather changes are really cool and battles during stroms are even cooler.In my opinion this game has saved the franchise. 1 was cool, 2 it stared to shine, Brotherhood was the best Till this, Rev was meh, 3 was fun till Conner turn into a babyman who only did this for himself, but 4 is a combonation of all the great parts of them all.Recommnended to everyone
