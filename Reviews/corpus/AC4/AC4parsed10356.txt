Better gameplay than part 1 and 3, lacks memorable story like in the 2 part minus expansions. Turned off the game  forgot the name of main character. Clearly the game is not ment for PC without controler. In order to defend from sword atacks you need to press E while moving with WSAD keys. Make a mental image of someone atacking you from opposit directions and try to defend while also atacking with left mouse buton. Shift key or right mouse buton would feel more natural. Missing horsies or npc telling the news in town hanging or veding fx not the one time skripted events, also noone minds if i kill soldiers and loot them miss the natural reactions from part 2. And yes, if you pick english as spoken language you constantly hear npc talking in other languages at least try broken english pls.
