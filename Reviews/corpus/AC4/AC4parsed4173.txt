DISCLAIMER....SPOILERS CONTAINED......I want to say that overall, I really enjoyed the game. The naval battles and pirateering were absolutely on point. Theres nothing better than blowing away a ship and then taking it over. Well played UBISoft, you got my attention. Ive played every game in the series up to this point and I will say that this one by far exceeds most of my expectations. The gameplay mechanics are quite similar to the other games in the series, which always helps.I did like to see all of the collectibles in the game to include the treasure chests, animus fragments, diffrerent outfits Assassin and Templar, and buried treasure. Another neat feature was the diving bell. I thought the underwater adventures were a nice touch.BUT, here is my beef. Ok UBISoft, if I am paying 4060 dollars for a game, DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT rehash the same storyline that was in the originial Assassins Creed. Are you friggin kidding me right now? If I pay that for a game, I expect to at least have a story line that I can follow. Abstergo Entertainment are really Templars? CMON, like I didnt see that one coming like 6 miles away.Would I recommend the game to others? Absolutely. Best game in the series, so far.Overall Review  7 out of 10
