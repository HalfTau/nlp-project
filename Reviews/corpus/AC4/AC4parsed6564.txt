This game was a great game that was super fun to play. In a couple of weeks I had 30 hours in the game and was a good way thorugh the storyline, but the next time I get on, I quickley noticed that the game told me I had 0 hours. I loaunched the game just to realize that all my data and hardwork got completely deleted. After doing research I found that its a bug with Uplay Ubisofts Steam and it occurs with all new Ubisoft games. So with that said I dont recomend this game or any Ubisoft game to people unless they are willing to randomly lose all their data out of no where or until Ubisoft gets rid of Uplay or fixes it.
