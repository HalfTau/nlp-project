Not just best the Assassins Creed game but best pirate game, ship game  hunting game all in one. Fans of the Assassins Creed or Batman Arkham series, this game is for you. I am 18 hours into the game and just at 15 completion, lots of value, highly satisfying.Good PointsReally makes you feel like a pirate.Classic Assassins Creed gameplay.Amazing Visuals Lots of graphics options.New setting with less convoluted story, but story is still good.Lots of activities to do other than the main missions.Bad PointsVery High system specs to see it at its best.Controls are ocasionally clunky when platforming.No steam achievements or trading Cards This is a personal disapointment only, Uplay achievements are still present.VerdictGreat game.9/10
