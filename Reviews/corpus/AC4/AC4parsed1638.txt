Honestly, if you like Pirates, you like looking cool while killing people, and dont mind funky/slightly odd controls, you like traveling on a Pirate ship, with your whole crew singing songs, capturing ships, fishing beluga whales and sharks, finding treasure underwater and in deserted islands, taking over Spanish and French fortresses, and able to ignore the stupid office gameplay, then this game is for you.Finished the game and its great for being one of the few AAA Pirate games out there. You can dislike Assassins Creed as much as you want, this game in particular stands out and is way better than 3 and its successors.
