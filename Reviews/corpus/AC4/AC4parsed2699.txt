Awesome pirate game! The main story might take a back seat to the exploration and pirating, but nothing beats the feeling of sailing through a typhoon to fight a fleet of Man o Wars while your crew belts out shanties at the top of their lungs. And only a couple hours in youll be singing along every time.10/10 Would sing like a drunken pirate again
