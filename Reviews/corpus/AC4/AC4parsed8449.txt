Do I recommend this game? Hell no, but should you buy it? Yeah. Ive been playing Assassins Creed from the start and any self respecting fan is reading this then you understand what im about to say. I will say that its a good game. Ubisoft heard the internet as we rallied and told them what we thought of ACIII by saying WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? WE DONT PLAY AS THE MAIN CHARACTER UNTIL SEQUENCE 5 AND DONT BECOME AN ASSASSIN UNTIL OVER HALFWAY THROUGH THE GAME! They responded very appropriately by letting us play as Edward from the start . . . AS HE MOCKED THE CREED, SAID SCREW THE ASSASSINS, DIDNT MEET THEM UNTIL HALFWAY THROUGH THE GAME, GOT DRUNK, AND DIDNT EVEN BECOME AN JOIN THEM UNTIL SEQUENCE FRICKIN 11 OUT OF 13 AND THOSE LAST TWO SEQUENCES WERE SOME OF THE SHORTEST!!! Good gameplay but the story basically sucked compared to the other games in the franchise. The story sucked compared even to Liberation. Lets find legendary treasure and get drunk and get money by pretending to be someone else! Unlike any other pirate game my On the other hand, naval battle mechanics were improved. Theyd have to be because they take up 40 OF THE MAIN STORY ALONE. Graphics were beautiful and multiplayer is still kinda fun. Ya know what isnt fun? Losing your 100 synch save because you didnt have internet. If your a fan of the series, ya gotta buy it but your gonna hate it and if youre new to AC, I recommend starting with the first one but youll have fun with this. Great integration outside the animus and the puzzles I could do for days. So do I recommend this game? Hell no, but should you buy it? Yeah. And people. Quit hating on this game just cuz of ubi. Get over it. Ubisoft is their own company and this game is just in the steam pipeline. Let it go already.
