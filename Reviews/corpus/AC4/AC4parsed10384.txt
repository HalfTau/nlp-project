oh MY GODS, it was so good game series, but this game is full of bugs, the free run mode is the most buggy of it all, i need to walk around stuff all the time so not to be stuck by a wall or a small flower, plus the story is change in this game, like the big bad girl you free in the last game is not free now, and a lot more is not fiting together with the other games, AND you need to use UPLAY, as always a think ok only because the game is very goodthis is NOT, but i most say I AM SO VERY VERY SAD TO PAY FOR THIS GAME, IT BREAK THE STORY    IF you love the game, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE, BUY THE OLD ONES.
