With 111 hours under my belt I can tell you that this game demands a lot of your time if you plan on completing as much as possible. Again just like AC3, this game pulls away from the bustling cities of old and throws you into an archipelago of land masses within a huge sea to traverse. Youll spend just as much time if not more sailing the seas, blowing up ships and stealing cargo than you do on land. Upgrade your ship as you go and defeat tougher ships out at sea, it really does sate any pirate urges you may be harboring.I loved it, give it a go.
