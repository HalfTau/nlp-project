Best game in the series by a fair bit.If you ever played the old ones and thought that the gameplay was great, but it was lacking something, well this one has that something.The only negative thing I would mention about this game is the variety of enemies, it seems they thought that this wasnt an important part of the game. I would disagree with this and hope that there will be a DLC or update later down the road update  DLC that introduces a couple more.If you are thinking about buying this game I would heavily recommend doing so.
