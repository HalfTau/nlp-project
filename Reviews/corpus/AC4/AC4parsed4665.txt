Forgot to put a good review in for this game lol.This aint a review its ....The game is great, love Edward Kenway and his adventures a different look into the world of Assassins creed, Read all the books and found out what happened to him after the game, Ties nicely into Assassins creed 3, Rouge and even a little into Syndicate! !
