A HUGE improvement over Assassins Creed III, thankfully.  A lot of games have tried the whole pirate tale angle and left a lot to be desired Black Flag really scratches that itch, but its also the most satisfying Assassins Creed game that Ive played.  Huge maps that offer several ways of carrying out your objectives awesome pirate ship battles and a greatly improved combat system.Definitely worth it.
