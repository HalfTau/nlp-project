This is my first Assassins Creed game so I had no assumptions or prejudices for or against the series  I was only interested in a pirate action game and this delivers.  It is an awesome sandbox experience set in the pirate heydays of the early 1700s with wonderfully implemented shipship warfare, meaningful upgrades to your weapons and ship that are actually worth saving up for, and lots of side tasks and collectables.  Along with this great pirate experience is a terrific stealth action game, probably typical of the Assassins Creed series  but set in a gorgeous Caribbean setting.
