Honestly absolutely great game..I missed a couple of the creed games.. but that said.. this game is incredible.. Had maybe one bug since release.. and it only occured once and was fixed with expedienceQuite a bit of replay value I would say.. sailing around listening to them shanties and sinking ships is good good good fun
