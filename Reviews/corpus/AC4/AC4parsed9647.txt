Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is the latest in the Ubisoft series. This time the main character and hesitant assassin is called Edward Kenway and hes a pirate. Kenway roams around in the Carribean and this time I found the ship better suited and implemented than in Assassins Creed III. A pirate needs a ship anyway. I loved most of the game except for the part with Kenways fleet which only worked on the release day, and afterwards hasnt worked a single day. None of the social parts or Kenways fleet or ACInitiates works for me, which does hurt my experience as a gamer. I expect a full experience a not some halfarsed experience, where some stuff doesnt work. Uplay connections were up but still AC4 couldnt connect to Ubisoft.So far, recommended, rated 7 out of 10 for bad product delivery.
