Single PlayerStory  8/10Combat  5/10 All you need to do is counter  Naval Combat  10/10  The main reason I bought this game Customization  8/10Exploration  9/10  Lots of places to see Missions and other activities  8/10  Enjoyable I would say MultiplayerOverall  2/10  Its really bad, didnt enjoyed it even a bit MiscellaneousOptimization  5/10  Bad port, constant frame drop near foliages and vegitations The game is quite old but still enjoyable to this day. The frame drop is somewhat bothersome but I still play the game for fun. Would recommend to others but only after mentioning the state of the game now.
