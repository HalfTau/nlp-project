Black Flag is competing to be the best Assassins Creed title since Assassins Creed II.Not only the story is well written to a point that not only the gamer relates to the main character, a pirate named Edward Kenway, it also creates an emotional tide with the adventure and exploration of sailing the high seas and hunting treasure and other bounties while discovering more about the Assassins, the Templars, and the secrets of both.Sailing.Before Black Flag was released there was a game no one heard of called Pirates of The Burning Sea, a F2P MMO that currently had the title for best Sailing experience, Black Flag took that away and better.With a immerse and easy to understand camera and control mechanics sailing in Black Flag is an amazing time, so much so that the game gives you the option to Fast Travel if needed, and I played for over 50 hours completing the game, without Fast Traveling Once.With the additions of random AI Ships with Different Random Cargo roaming the seas, special challanges, secrets, and different weather and time conditions, the sailing it self sells the game.Running.The main aspect of running and jumping on rooftops and trees to explore ways to complete your objectives still a big thing and very well crafted, the only Con to it is that often you find yourself jumping in Hay Stacks or Trees just by running Aside some, which is a very hard thing to balance, but even tho very frustrating at the time, it goes away as soon as you get done with it.Storyline.The main storyline is very interesting to watch read and play, with various famous characters as usual of an Assassins Creed game, introduced very well in the story.The ending feels solid, and with enough questions for more story, but not enough to upset anyone.Multiplayer.The multiplayer feels more balanced than previous AC titles, with more maps and a more fluid and Skill Based mechanic.The only bad thing is that as always and sadly gamers would always for some reason find ways to exploit game mechanics for an easy win.The game introduced GameLabs a feature that allows players to customize Game Modes, everything from what skills can be used, to how much a kill would be worth, and what kind.The issue currently with GameLabs is that you can only play your custom made Game Modes with your friends, and only find a Random Approved Type on the public lobby.With enough luck, that would be fixed, and a new feature would allow gamers to publicly host GameLab creations for any player to pick and play.Overall this is the level of detail the so called Next Gen titles should be all about. Great environments graphics, level design, interaction, and details to very small things.This might be the best AC Title so far, and might also be GOTY.710
