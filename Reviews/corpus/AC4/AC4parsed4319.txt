This game has huge reuirements for a computer!!!!  Couldnt play it on my computer and was unable to get a refund for the 60 dollers i stupidly put into this piece of junk.  Its just like all other assassins creed games, your jsut  pirate this time.  Its boring, unoriginal and is as big as the earth itself1/10Would never suggest this game, get skyrim instead.   Its made by a different developer and is more enjoyable, and is considerably smaller, but still can provide more than 400 hours of entertainment.
