In it, you play Edward Kenway, father and grandfather of AC3s Haytham and Connor Kenway, as he sails freely across the carribean, looking for plunder and a mysterious object created by a precursor race. In all honesty I consider this the least AC like game in the series, but one of the best pirate simulators Ive ever played.Graphics are beautiful, even on lower settings, and the npcs have more realistic actions and movements than previous titles. 4/5Combat is a refined version of AC3s, where you have an option to attack, counter, or break defense from the get go and some other options depending on the situation. 3/5Freerunning a staple of the pre AC3 games, is notably lacking. There are major cities where freerunning across rooftops is possible, but the majority of the game is at open sea or minor islands. However, the swimming and tree climbing mechanic has been polished from AC3. 2/5Story SPOILERS Note that I havent gotten too far in the story Sequence 3, but from what I have seen Im not too impressed or too disappointed. Edward is so far blissfully ignornat of his choice to be an assassin, and considering he stole the robes off a dead one and began pretending to be one, thats all hes done so far. The only interesting bits so far have been the bits outside of the animus, where instead of Desmond we are playing a nameless intern signing on at Abstergo Industries entertainment division, a project headed by a group taking the genereous genetic donations of one Desmond Miles. 2.53/5./SPOILERSOverall a 3.5 out of 5. Longtime lovers of the series may feel out of place, but new fans and old might find something to love in the gritty life of Edward Kenway, privateer and pirate.
