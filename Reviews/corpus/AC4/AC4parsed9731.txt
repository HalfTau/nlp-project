Ridiculously fun. The first AC was too repetitive and made me skip all the others but when I received this as a gift from some kind friends, it sucked me right in. Now I have to backtrack and play from AC2 before I end up spending all night and day in front of this game!Especially fun in Big Picture mode with a gamepad!
