I dont play singleplayer games. My son was playing this multiplayer on his PS3 so I saw that I could get it onremove the underscore  for 6.50 so I got 2 copies so we could play together. I looked atand saw there was an average of 1600 people playing and that was only those who bought this on steam, it doesnt include those who bought the pure uplay version, so I figured there was 67 thousand playing.Well there might be .. but they arent playing the multiplayer. The multiplayer matchmaking is simple to use, yet difficult to get a game, its basically completely screwed up. If you select a gamemode such as Deathmatch, it automatically selects a map. If there is nobody playing that map/mode, it searches a different map .. and so on. There is no way to see which mode/map is being played and join that.The singleplayer game .. no idea if its any good as I dont play singleplayer games I already said that once.The multiplayer game .. its wonderful fun. Around every corner could be your adversary. You have to be stealthy, hidden, skillful and at the same time watchful of those around you so you can spot your victim your own killer. The shooters like Rainbow Six are fun and exciting, but in a different way ... its difficult to explain and needs to be experienced. You kill your target, but someone is also chasing you. You find a group of civilians to blend in with and try to hide, but your pursuer wanders by and notices you .... stealth, excitement, tension. Best multiplayer game I have played in a long time.If only it were easier to find a multiplayer game.I have to press Yes or No for a recommendation. I press Yes because it is a great multiplayer game and supposedly single player also. I wanted to press No because its very difficult to actually find a multiplayer game.A gameplay video ... cant do the game justice because the tension of being hunted and the hunt cant be
