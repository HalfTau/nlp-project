Love this game. Dissapointed with Ubisoft for losing my save game after they updated the Initiates program. But the game is fun and good enough to play through all over again. The Freedom Cry campaign is excellent and has a different feel to the character. Id suggest this game for anyone that likes the AC series or is interested in open world games. Especially if sea combat appeals to you.
