What to say about this iteration of Assassins Creed?I know I said that AC 3 was the best one that Id played to date, I still think its awesome, but I may have spoke too soon...Assassins Creed Black Flag has become my new favorite goto game when the weather is nasty out and indoor activities are all that can be done.I especially like the sea battles. These were first introduced in AC 3 and thats why I liked it so much, but in this one, you can upgrade your ship and crew, add armor, carry a whaling boat, prettymuch whatever you want to do. There are literally all kinds of ways to make money in this game, for anyone to be broke in this game is ridiculous when its so easy to make money. You can whale and sell the procedes from that, you can of course raid other ships for new crew members and items to sell, you can make money from treasure hunting and various other business ventures as well.In short, if you are playing this game and are broke, you are lazy, theres no excuse for not being a very rich pirate in this game...All in all, I highly recommend this game if you are an Assassins Creed fan, its got it all...
