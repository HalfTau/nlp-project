As my first Assasins Creed game, you know I really liked it. Im a FPS type gamer and this was as significant change of pace with a cool story and alot of gameplay mechanics that were first over my head, then I gradually grew to master. The combat system itself isnt necessarily weak but its easy to see that enemies were engineered to be easy to beat, so theres that I done good feeling when you take on a mob of six people and kick their butts. With alot of challenges in a world that turns to freeroaming when you beat the main story, it gives alot of play long passed the time the story is finished.Didnt have much experience in multiplayer because frankly Im bad at any Player vs Player game, so I just avoided it so it wouldnt ruin my good experience with the series. I will say however that when I did dable in it, I was a little dissapointed to see that there werent any ship to ship battles taking place. If there were, Id make a fool of myself nearly every day trying to git gud.Good story, above decent graphics, lots of content even without DLC and loads of fun, Ubisoft did great with this game. Highly recommended to casual adventureres and harder core gamers all around.
