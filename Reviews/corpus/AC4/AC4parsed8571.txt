Damn fun game. Have got myself singing DO WHAT YOU WANT CAUSE A PIRATE IS FREE, YOU ARE A PIRATE whenever travelling the seas. Not the best story in the world but still a pretty damn good one. Plays the same way as AC you know and love.Requires a decent PC  570gtx 1.28gb, have to turn things down to normal at 1440p and still get framerate drops during storms and when shooting cannons smoke.Highly recommend getting all the DLC bar the MP skins  Freedom Cry is very enjoyable and a great look into the history of slavery and conveying the emotions surrounding. The Time Saver DLCs do exactly that  save time finding things. Big thumbs up for those.
