You should definitely get this game, totally worth the money. It is a must own game, especially if it is on sale.Easily one of the best games in the series, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag allows you to explore the Caribbean as Edward Kenway. Edward is so unlike the previous assassins and it is refreshing to play as a pirate, doing whatever you want, whenever you want. There is plenty of content in the game, but the side missions gets a bit repetitive, this includes those ING TAILING MISSIONS WHICH ARE STUPID AS .problemThe graphics are pretty good, considering when it came out. When I turned the settings to the max, it crashed whenever I played for a minute or two Im not quite sure what the problem was because I just turned it back to its default settings and everything ran perfectly fine.The movement system is alright, but sometimes Edward doesnt move the way you want which pisses me off and the ship gameplay is amazing. The map is huge and you can choose to do many side activities like hunting animals on sea and land as well as diving. Many of the side missions for capturing forts are repetitive and the naval missions on those forts and the tailing missions are back again Overall an amazing game, would recommend to anyone, especially if you are new to the series.ALL of my game saves have been deleted. I had almost every area cleared out and was just finishing up the naval and assassin missions. Make sure you backup your saves when reinstall or reset your pc! I dont know why it didnt save to cloud....
