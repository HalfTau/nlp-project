This was actually the first Assassins Creed game I was introduced to, and as soon as I saw my friend play this on his xbox, I was immediately hooked. Id have sleepovers and stay up all night playing this game with my friend, and we had tons of fun. Before this, the only Open World games Id ever played were GTA San Andreas, so you can probably guess that my mind was blown away by the graphics and gameplay of Assassins Creed.However, some of the missions were a bit annoying and the sailing took too long sometimes.For that, Id rate this game a 9/10.
