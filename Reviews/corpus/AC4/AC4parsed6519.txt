The story felt somewhat bland, in comparison to previous ACs, felt dragged and unimportant. I feel as though this was more a pirate action adventure games than a continuation of the AC story.But, theres nothing wrong with this being a pirate action adventure game... Because its a damn great one! The action is genuine like previous ACs and with the additions of ships and boarding other ships it felt great and refreshing. Also managing your fleet is a neat addition, similar to Assassins you employ, instead of sending them on missions, you send your ships to battle other ships, and send supplies through trade routes  earning you  and collectibles.The story wasnt pushed, and felt more like a sideobjective, but this opened up the world for you to explore without feeling the need to push through the story out of interest or sense of importance.Ship battles, and sea explorationUnderwater explorationContracts/CollectiblesPersonalised island/baseHarpooning activitesPeronalised fleetShip customisationLikeable character/attitude Unfulfilling storytelling Ship invisible/underwater bug8.5/10
