Strong 8/10Game would be perfect but due to a lot of controller oriented bugs on land  never on sea sometimes even often its frustrating. Nonetheless its one of those games that are really worthy its day 1 price.If you are an old gamer and in your youth you enjoyed Sid Meiers Pirates  this is your game for dozens of hours just play and forget this ACs series typical crap.
