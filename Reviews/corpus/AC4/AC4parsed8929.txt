This  game has been rather interesting and is pretty good at keeping its player occupied.However, unless youve got mad titans running on sli, be prepared to play this game at its lowest settings  even so, its vsync will diminsh your fps, locking it at 30frames while the developers laugh in their pile of money.For those wondering heres what Ive got  not much, but enough to get most games at 60f. z77 sabertooth, 12gb corsair vengeance  1600, gtx 670, i73770.
