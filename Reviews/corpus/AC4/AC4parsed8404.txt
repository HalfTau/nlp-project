Best AssCreed since ACII?Controls are still horrible 6 games in the series. Character is pretty much all over the place and moves glitchy as hell. Main missions are still boring. But the rest is just great. Best pirate game Ive ever played. Lots of fun. Neat sea battles, lots of upgrades, fun treasure hunt. So is the multiplayer, which is almost like seperate game in scale and presentation.Quite possibly the best Assassins Creed game.
