What in Davy Jones locker did ye just bark at me, ye scurvy bilgerat? Ill have ye know I be the meanest cutthroat on the seven seas, and Ive led numerous raids on fishing villages, andover 300 wenches. I be trained in hitandrun pillaging and be the deadliest with a pistol of all the captains on the high seas. Ye be nothing to me but another source o swag. Ill have yer guts for garters and keel haul ye like never been done before, hear me true. You think ye can hide behind your newfangled computing device? Think twice on that, scallywag. As we parley I be contacting my secret network o pirates across the sea and yer port is being tracked right now so ye better prepare for the typhoon, weevil. The kind o monsoon thatll wipe ye off the map. Youre sharkbait, fool. I can sail anywhere, in any waters, and can kill ye in oer seven hundred ways, and that be just with me hook and fist. Not only do I be top o the line with a cutlass, but I have an entire pirate fleet at my beck and call and Ill damned sure use it all to wipe yeroff o the world, ye dog. If only ye had had the foresight to know what devilish wrath your jibe was about to incur, ye might have belayed the comment. But ye couldnt, ye didnt, and now yell pay the ultimate toll, you buffoon. Illfury all over ye and yell drown in the depths o it. Youre fish food now.
