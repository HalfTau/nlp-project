I have never written a review on Steam before but I feel compelled to now. Bought this, installed and try to fire it up  gotta install uplay. Bloody hell, really? Fine. Go through all the ballache of creating a new account because I cant remember anything about the one I set up yonks back but get it installed and try again. Black screen then crash, joy. Google around for like an hour trying to find a solution, then give up. Maybe I will try again some other time. Specs for those who wonder  i5 3.4ghz intel processor, gtx 770, 8gb ram.
