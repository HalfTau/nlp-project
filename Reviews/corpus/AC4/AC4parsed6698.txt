While alittle different from the past assassins creed games, it is still a great game with lots of potential now and in the future. Liked the combat and the way it played a lot, what i didnt like is the pirate ship. There was to much action on the ship which i didnt like much since it didnt feel like assassins creed. Otherwise great game!
