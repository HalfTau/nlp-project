Man, damn, Im really surprised that more of my friends dont own this. Personally Ive been a fan of AC since the beginning, but I can understand that a lot of people have gotten a bit sick of it, especially those wretched tailing missions. Not only that, but I understand Im not exactly alone in thinking AC3 was more or less a monotonous failure with a boring main character. I was pretty disappointed, I had high hopes for the new setting. Because of that I was pretty hesitant to get this game, but I ended up caving cause hey, pirates! But man I am SO glad that I did that. The game is far and away the most polished of the AC games, and features a more diverse setting. More or less half of the entire game takes place on water, which I was originally concerned for since I didnt care much for the naval campaigns of AC3. However, I was pleasantly surprised and the naval combat and exploration felt very smooth, interesting and refined compared to AC3. As a result of the almost 50/50 split between land and sea missions, the game also felt more varied and I found myself less likely to get bored by monotony during extended play. If you felt disheartened by AC3 and/or the past few AC games but enjoy the core idea of the series, definitely give it a go. The gameplay is not drastically differing from its predecessors but it is hugely improved upon, and the naval aspect is definitely a breath of fresh air. Apologies for the wall of text.
