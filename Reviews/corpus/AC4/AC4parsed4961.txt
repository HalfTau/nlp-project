I do/did love this game as its a great addition to the assassins creed series however I was on the last chapter and had done so many side missions, finishing off islands, collecting collectibles etc and then 1 day uPlay decided to delete my save file. 60 hours of gameplay gone in a flash, very disappointed and no longer play , played 2 hours just to get a feel but I doubt Ill be playing any more.
