Ive only played for a little while but so far so good! Im really enjoying the game so far. Works pretty smoothly, though I did have a hiccup at the beginning.To those who only get to the based on historical events screen and then are met by a seemlingly endless black screen, just have Steam verify the game cache something along those lines. Ive only just used that feature today and youll be good to go
