Never touched this long for a long time because this was the game that made me upgrade my crap PC to a decent one. After 4 years of its release its still a wonderfully crafted game and the replay value is very high because you can always play as a nasty pirate who sinks all those man of wars without much fight. You hide, you do stealth with your ship at the start and then go into one nasty pirate once you upgrade your jackdaw. and as usual The core game  grrreat!! The real world portion  Meh!! Who the hell is desmond miles? The guy that played a 30 minute cameo in entire series so far? Should play even if you are not a AC fan since the core AC thing died with Rzio. At least for me! !
