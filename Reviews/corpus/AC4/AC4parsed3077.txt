DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I made the mistake to buy it on steam summer sales and its not working, read on the internet that there are many more that arent able to play it.UPDATE!After reading every possible solution online to get this game to work and many disapointments later I finally found something that worked for me. I cleared out space on the same drive as my OS is installed on and the started working! So finally Im able to give a review based on the game.Black flag has a good story, not the greatest but a decent enough story to keep it interesting. The story also have an ending that Im very pleased with. Aside from the main story there are a lot of things to collect and do, even to the extent that it might get boring to collect everything. I liked the changing weather in the game, the environment, the parkour aspect even though it could get really frustrating at times when the character kept on jumping on thing or hanging from ledges when he wasnt supposed to. The map is fairly big and has many places to explore both above ground and in the sea. This game was worth buying. I will change my thumbs down to thumbs up.Inconclusive review, might continue at another time.
