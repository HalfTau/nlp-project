Well, first of all, its a good game, totally worth the money I have spent on it. The best things are probably the great graphics, the vivacious story and the ambience. The game really makes you feel like you are a dangerous pirate feared by many lads that are sealing under both the spanish and the british flag. The game does contain some annoying glitches, but it doesnt really affect the gameplay too badly. The title can be a little bit misleading, because it is more like a pirating game than an assassins game. I found the missions in the game very nice. There are a few types of side quests, like the good old assassins contract, and the templar hunt. They arent too repetitive, they wont get boring. the main missions will always be something new, which is nice. Both the side missions or the main missions are doable if we look at the difficulty.7/10
