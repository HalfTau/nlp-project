EFF THIS GAME RIGHT IN THE FACE!!!!!Its sad really, b/c i really want to love this game.Im running a top of the line rig with triple 27 monitors, and every time any sort of action gets going, the game glitches out and i get a tiny version of the screen in the upper left corner of my viewing area. Ive looked online for solutions, tried them all, even settled for trying to only use one monitor, and it STILL FKING FAILS!! WTF!!!!GREEDY BIG CORPORATION PUTS OUT UNFINISHED GAME seems to be the norm nowadays.AND!! the STUPID UPLAY app just clogs up the game even more, so now we cant sit down and just play a game without launching all kinds of other support apps?? UGHI also love how when you try to contact support for either steam or ea, theres nothing but a loop of webpages with Q  A, lol, no way to write or talk to a real person. Theyve totally insulated themselves from their customers. I might be saying goodbye to steam after this.EFF YOU EA and GO TO HELLEA  the ruination of good games.
