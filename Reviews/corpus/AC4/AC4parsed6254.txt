This is definitely the best Assassins Creed game of the bunch. AC3 was a very ambitious game. While it wasnt terrible, it wasnt able to complete its vision and felt uncomplete. This game, however, completes AC3s vision of exploration and naval combat. Edward Kenway is a MUCH BETTER protagonist than Connor. While the setting might not be as interesting and the historical figures not as apparent, the story is overall a lot better than AC3s. Definitely worth your money.
