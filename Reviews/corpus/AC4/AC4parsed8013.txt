Spiritual successor to Pirates of the Caribbean Armada of the Damned.A fun pirate game with the general things youd expect killing, building a ship and attacking the British and Spanish navies. Typical Assassins Creed movement and combat, with a disappointing lack of weapons in comparison to AC3.The Assassins Creed part of the game feels more like it was attached to what should have been just a pirate game, but it doesnt take away from the fun of the game.Best parts of the game are exploring the islands/sea, customising the Jackdaw and Edwards loadout, and the seashanties.
