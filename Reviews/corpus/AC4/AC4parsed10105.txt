The incredible world of Assassins Creed IV Black Flag has kept me happily occupied for longer than any other game in the series. At no point in my ton of hours played was I ever at a loss for something to do sailing wherever, hunting, harpooning, treasure hunting. Black Flag delivers a world overflowing with stunning places, amazing secrets to discover, and infamous pirates to stab.
