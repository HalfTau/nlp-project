Play with FXAA! I couldnt even get SP started till I lowered it to FXAA... I also have shadows on very high and non of the soft shadowThe game doesnt stutter so long as you optiimize it for your system .. P A lot has changed in the past 5 years ..I heavily recommend this game as it is the only one that will truly somewhat let you feel and play like a pirate! The ship mechanics are incredible!! I had an urge to be a pirate and this is damn near the only game to fill it! D
