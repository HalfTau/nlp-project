OK. This game moves away from the conventional Assassins Creed games and is more like Pirates Booty, Arrrrrrrg! If you liked the ship part of AC3, then youll love the endless hours of repetitive ship action on this one. Thats my moan out the way I really enjoyed this game and at the very end, I realised how good it was. The character development is really nice especially in the main protagonist as he is a right git at the start. There are a few twists in the game in the loosest sense of the word and it has a pretty strong story which I enjoyed playing through. Although, its not the AC that I remember, I would really recommend trying this one out.Great game give it a go!
