probably the best ubisoft game ive played out of all the Assassins Creed series ive grown up with the series and black flag stands out for me so far. With all those sunny beaches, tropicle animals and even naval wars. very nice combat animations and many things to discover and do. the storyline is fantastic and so is the voice acting each character had something special about themselves. i give this game two thumbs up i advise you guys to play this if you havent.
