A very good game. One of the classics of the franchise. You have an open and a quite interactive world where you can do a whole lots of stuff. This also has a companion app which is really useful while playing. The storyline is good. The graphics are amazing. You can hunt for animals just like Assassins Creed  III.You can search for treasure and find secrets, et cetera..Just go for it, its quite worth the money.
