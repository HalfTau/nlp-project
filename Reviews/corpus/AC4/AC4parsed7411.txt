The fourth edition to the Assassins Creed franchise. The gameplay in this is all the same as in the previous one, Assassins Creed 3. Although, there is a slight difference where you can now release the wheel while still being on the ship, upgrade your character, Edward James Kenway, and upgrade your ship,The Jackdaw, as you progress through the game. In my honest opinion, I felt that this game was a little too rushed, which gives the story a lacklustre feel. The storyline is not too good, but the gameplay is to a whole new level. It is definitly a game worth buying.
