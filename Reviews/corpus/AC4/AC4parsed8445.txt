As much of an awesome game it is, I couldnt play it. The reason I got 6 fps. I get 4090 on games like Killing floor and Planetside 2. But this game just took my fps away. So I spent an extra 60 bucks to get it on my ps3, and Its glorious.Overall advice Make sure you have a very good computer before spending 60 bucks.
