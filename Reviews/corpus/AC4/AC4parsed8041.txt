graphics 10 ... doesnt get much better these days.voice acting 10 ... charaters are memorable and convincing.physical combat 9 ... same as AC3... but thats not a bad thing.naval combat 10 ... very well done!story 9 ... deep, intriguing, and compelling though kinda slow first half of gamecontent 10... main story alone is 50 hrs... all content  over 100 hours... wow!over all a very impressive game!now, is it perfect? no.there are a few minor bugs...But this is about as good as it gets note Freedom Cry DLC is excellent...but best played toward end of main story 80 progressDLC events take place after main story. Nvidia userts turn physics off for DLC...it will cause a crash in some cutscenes and odd graphic problems.
