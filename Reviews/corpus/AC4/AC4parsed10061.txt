Good game about pirates, a bit strange game about assassins. Some chapters are awesome, some are just good , but there are no bad or boring chapters. Edward is a very charismatic, interesting character, which has its own position in life. Gameplay is quite diverse from classic assassins creed missions to hunting sharks,whales and orca.The only thing that disappointed me is the poor optimization for PC. And the lack of diving places.If you havent played the previous games,it does not matter, you can still play Assassins Creed 4 there are not so much related with other parts things.9/10
