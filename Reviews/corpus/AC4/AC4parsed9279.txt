Gameplay is pretty good, spent hours sailing around exploring place but the story is very boring and you just seem to do the same thing in every mission, follow Target1 until he leads to Target2 then kill Target1 Next mission. was very disapointed with the ending as it just ends and all of the computers that you hack in the game give no form of extra story, the only thing you get is a little memo on one of the games menus saying Good Job you will hear from us soon. to which you never do. i was also a little disapointed in the Aveline section of the game as i was expecting them to of bundled in the PSvita game into the game but nope you basicly get a mission which lasts 5 maybe 10 mins at the most and makes no sense as to why its in the game having not played the PSvita version as i have no idea who these people are and at the end of it it seems to just cut off mid sentance and takes you back to the main menu, which i assumed was a bug but nope was intended. overall id give it a 6/10 and would recomend it if your looking for a game to spend around 40 hours in with many enjoyable parts which all come from gameplay, as long as you can get around a lot of bugs some quite funny and a very boring story which is nothing as interesting as previous games then its a must buy.
