I was a bit skeptical going into AC4 but I was pleasantly surprised with some gorgeous graphics and solid gameplay!You take the roll of Edward Kenway, the grandfather to the protagonist from AC III and probably the most badpirate ever!The game takes place around the Caribbean isles with sailing as one of the core mechanics.You can wither hit the story head on or sail around with islands hunting animals, requiting pirates, raiding ships, conquering settlements, finding ancient artifacts or discover secrets about the assassin order and learn more about the immense story.Assassins Creed 4 is an amazing game with a deep and interesting story with stunning visuals and smooth and responsive gameplay.
