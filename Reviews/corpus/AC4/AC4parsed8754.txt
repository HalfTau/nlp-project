By far one of the most fun games ive played in a long time. Brutal, unforgiving, yet comedic at just the right moments. Plus the extra missions and side quests dont feel like youre pulling teeth to get that 100 completion. Now im going back to play the other Assassins creed games and I know theyll all feel slightly hollow and bland in comparison.
