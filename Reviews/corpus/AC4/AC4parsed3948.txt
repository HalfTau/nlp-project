My favorite AC game to date  good story, both land/naval battles, and a large map to explore. However the console controls sometimes show their annoying traits in the PC version but its never a dealbreaker neither is Uplay. Over 85 hours on record and the map is not yet fully explored. Youll love the characters introduced in AC4 based on historical figures and lament their loss before the end of the game as you all go your own way. Certainly one of the saddest, emptiest feelings Ive ever had in completing the storyline of any game. Well done UBIsoft.
