I am a long time game player, all the way back to Manic Miner on the Spectrum. I have played all the AC games including the latest Syndicate. I had a hardware issue recently that lost me a few files, including my AC4 save games files. Brilliant. I got to play the game all the way through again. THIS IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVERY PLAYED. Great game play, great story, best AC game. Best game full stop.
