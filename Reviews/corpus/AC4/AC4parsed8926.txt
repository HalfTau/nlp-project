A game that was going some where, then too a wrong turn and fell off a cliff.Here I am happily playing the game, the progress tracker said 58 and theres me thinking hmm, I have time to do some real world activity and since one of the real world characters just tried to kill me I figured a little exploration was a good idea. Once finished I logged back into the Animus and WHAM! The credits roll. Game over. Do not pass go, do not collect any Reales and no incentive to keep playing the sand box after the credits finally finish.Would I recommend this game the buttons at the bottom are asking me. To be honest Im not sure.It is a good game even though we seem to be back to running up invisible walls and I felt more than a little limited with the total number of throwing knives you were allowed. But having said that the crafting system is effective and makes sense for the most part along with what you have to do to get the materials, and that alone makes a change these days.The world is well fleshed out and free ranging.If Im brutally honest the thing that lets the game down is the writing. The story is good and solid but you jump at break neck speed from one plot point to another and by the end you are left with so many unanswered questions it beg the question were the writers trying to make swiss cheese or while setting up for a sequal or DLC were they sacrificing their writers integrity?I give this game 8/12Good graphics and characters. A plausable story line in the creed universe and an amusing and likeable main character but with more plot stops and unanswered questions than the JFK assasination.
