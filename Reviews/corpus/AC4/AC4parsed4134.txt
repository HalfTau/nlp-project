I have been absent from Assassins Creed series, And i think it was needed vacation because oh boy how i liked it Best Radio/songsLots to do in a game / In Edwards worldStory was interestingUnknown Metal armor and he still plays with his hood even though he dosent have a hood.There are people still playing MP.Badass CharactersAtmosphere/World / Italy is still the best/Economy felt this time much easier and not enough things to upgrade, I remeber it be more challenging i hope i dont mix it up with tropico 5Ship battles went too repetitive in the end, but really liked that part of the gameI only affraid that next year on sale time the next assassins creed is also dead cheap so i will be on yearly release while still few years behindRating Nothing is true.
