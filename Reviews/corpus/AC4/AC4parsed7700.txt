I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.I have played every Assassins Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassins Creed.First of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same Press B to counter, but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.While most of the time you are at sea pirating, the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.The story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.I have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I dont find it that interesting and varied.Overall, this is the best AC game so far improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassins Creed Unity.SCORE 90/100
