Its been over 3 years since this game came out, and Im still incredibly impressed by its stunning visuals, epic storyline and fantastic gameplay. There is not a better game on Steam to decimate fleets of Frigates and Brigs. And the ending? Emotional... gripping... spectacular... these words come to mind. Do yourself a favor... buy this game before you buy your next one.
