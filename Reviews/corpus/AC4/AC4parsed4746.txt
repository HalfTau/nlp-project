Featuring an array of leisure really titanica, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag has characteristics which should always be at the heart of every game at free exploration, which is a cohesive and credible, and many secondary activities to justify the roam around the map. If to this we add a compelling plot, well placed in the historical context of reference and fun to follow, the result is a chapter of the saga able, finally, to stand up to the second episode for innovations, the centrality of sea life, and content density. Sorry didnt see the same courage in facing some of the ancestral deficiencies, such as the combat system, weapon anchored again always limits, but the renewed emphasis placed on stealth reminds us that the soul of the Assassins Creed race much more again on a concealed blade, compared to a sabre in combat. Just twelve months away from the third chapter, the qualitative leap also brings a pleasant surprise, with Ubisoft who, unexpectedly, one of the best signature entertainment products that the saga of the killers has ever offered to fans.
