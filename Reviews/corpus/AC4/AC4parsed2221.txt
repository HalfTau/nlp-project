Basically a game that is genius. It probably didnt take that much effort in the world building relm. But the other parts are where it shines. I say this, in awe of how genius it is. You dont have to create a huge land mass to create a great open world sandbox. It is just small islands. Ubisoft captures the idea of piracy and makes it do its bidding beautifully.
