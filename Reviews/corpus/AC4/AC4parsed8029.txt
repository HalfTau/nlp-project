Okay Ill make this easy for ya. The games awesome and its the best in the series to date. You might take some issue with the story, since its pacing and content is kind of different from what youre used to from the previous games. But everything else is above and beyond superb.Ive played all games of the series and loved them but I still cant get my head wrapped around the fact that SO MANY devs and publishers already screw up part 2 of their series  but AC got it right  every new installment better than the previous one. Its just mind boggling.Anyway, you like Action and killing people?! Buy this game! No need to be a fan. Games too awesome to take a pass on.
