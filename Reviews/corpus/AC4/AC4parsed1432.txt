I really enjoyed this game as I love pirate settings.Graphically the game is stunningly beatiful, even if it demands a high quantity of hardware resources.Gameplaywise it offers classic Assasins Creed combat and stealth mechanics coupled with ship fights on the sea!Like always there are many collectables and side quests, if you like collecting stuff thats a plus, personally Im not too fond of that. Crafting and upgrading the ship and your equipment is fun too and there and the other activities like diving, playing a checkerslike boardgame or searching for treasure chests with maps allow for a broad spectrum of fun things to do if you dont feel like continueing the main story.The only point that I partially critizise is the story, I liked the characters but somehow often I didnt felt like wanting to know what happens in the story, it didnt mesmerize me like I thing it could.I only have played a handfull of multiplayer matches so I cant really judge that part of the game, but as a singleplayer experience it was well worth the time and money I spent on it!
