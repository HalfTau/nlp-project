Best Assassins Creed in my opinion.The story is fun and exciting. Ship combat is truely awesome with great upgrades for your ship, which make you want to go out of your way to get the materials,The only real negative is the weapon system which kind of feels like there isnt that much need to get better equpment as you just start with double hiddden blade. So all you got to do is press e the left click to kill. This however is a tiny detail in what is overall a master piece.10/10
