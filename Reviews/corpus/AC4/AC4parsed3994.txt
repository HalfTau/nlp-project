i54460GTX 970 2way SLIWindows 102160p 4kAll settings max, except AA Off, HBAO Low, PhysX Off.Great game. I had issues running it, changed compatability settings and now it runs well. The PhysX setting doesnt work, it destroys fps. Also HBOA at high destroys fps depending on where you are. I tried at all resolutions with the same results.So far this is my favorite game in the series. The gameplay is a joy, thrilling, and surrounds you with an atmosphere that you want to be in. The graphics are a work of art, in comparison to the other AC games. One that I will keep on my HD to go back to from time to time just to explore.
