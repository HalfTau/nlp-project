Yes i know this Game is about pirates, but no, that doenst mean you have a Game about assassins being 50 shipmissions... they are boring and unless you grind other ships before you proceed with the story, you will get your ship sunken in a couple of seconds because upgrading it is sooooo expensive and wihtout it, yeah, either you cheese them by buying mortar or try till your hand bleed.If they would have cut the shippart to maybe 25 of the Game it would be good.
