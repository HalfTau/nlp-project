I really loved this game on console, so the only reason I bought this game was to play with a fps of 60. That did not come close to happening... I have a GTX 780 and an i7 4790k with a H100i watercooler and I can barely mantain 40fps with physx turned off. Honestly the only thing I can really do if I want to max it out is sli another 780, but this is the only game I have ever had below 60 frames on so Im not doing that. This seems to be a common theme with Ubisoft... making games have unreasonable hardware requirements.
