This version may not have the same style as AC used to be most of time you spent on sailing and sinking other ships and do some treasure hunting.but its a good one in AC series in this version sailing and battle ship is awesome I saw someone sink the other ships about 350K times thats mean its very fun even I am still sink the ships about 400 after end of the game.the only thing I think its not much good is about the story and characteristic of Edward he is not much attractive character like the other hero in AC series because most of time in story he show the behavior of greedy not a hero who lives for ideal like the other AC seriess hero.
