FIrst AC game where I care about characters and where all game mechanics really work. Even better, you never run out of things to do. Its just impossible to get from place A to place B without getting carried all the way across the map.And did I mention it has pirates in it?! Creed? To hell with that! I came here to kill, rob and sink ships! Ahoy!
