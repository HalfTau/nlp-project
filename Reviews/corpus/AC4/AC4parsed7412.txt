 OMG, I HAD NO IDEA! That Black Flag could so well encapsulate the whole meaning and feel of a true pirate experiance so well. This has to be the best gaming experiance I have fealt up to now in any game! !I have never been drawn to any pirateing games, as knowone has ever mastered the physics and scale of the idea the feeling of size when you stear your gallion, the responsivness of the stearing the sounds, the options in battle, the sea, I have never seen a sea more realistic, it beats the sea in Battlefeild hands down. Dam, this is a gaming experiance well above anything I have experianced before. I have steared a few large boats and barges in my time and they have got the handling down perfectly. You hear the wind and can see it on the water and then feel it in the steering! You shout out Brase to the crew as you stear towards a giant wave and feel releaved afterwards! You dive for treasure and you feel your there. Your crew feel like your crew because of the way you find them.If the HUGE open sea is not enough, then enjoy the many islands and the hunting. Crafting better equipment or just selling it. Naturaly there are plenty of large towns to visit and missions. The music is very varied all the time and as you find new Shanties/songs for the crew to sing you just want to sing along.My advice is...Da nat bea missing out my lovlies on here yonder it be a HUGE gaming milestone in seafearing history me ladsand ya not find a better experience.
