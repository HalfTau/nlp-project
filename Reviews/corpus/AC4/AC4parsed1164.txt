More Black Flag, less Assassins Creed plz!A bit more info...While the sailing and piracy portion of this game is what youll really enjoy, I did find myself getting on shore to do some storyline quests to unlock the diving bell, etc and grab seashanties. Those guys are like a yeolde iPod and youll want as many shanties as possible because I guarantee youre going to be singing them..Im not sure when it happened but at the end of the game I realised just how engaged I was with all of the characters, something I didnt intend for and havent found in a game for a very long time. They even managed to fix escort missions! Though, the parkour  / prince of persia style locomotion system is still a bit crazy at times, more than once I found myself stealthily walking behind my prey ready to strike when they finish pushing the narritve along with endless dialogue and suddenly our protagonist would decide to grab onto a ledge 2 feet away and just hang there while guards notice and proceed to poke him with beyonettes...That said, the save points are incredibly frequent without making the game seem like a press X to win, the environments and combat are amazing and this is some quality story telling that will sneak up on you without ruining whatever pirate shinanigans you decide to take your crew on.
