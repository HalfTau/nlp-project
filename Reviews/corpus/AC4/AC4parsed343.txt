Quite an enjoyable game.Basically, what i loved most about black flag was the overall feel of the game. The hunting, jumping from ship to ship, fighting 3 enemies simultaneously without much difficulty but still getting the thrill of it....its all these small details and experiences the game gives you that just lets you enjoy this game as a whole. Fighting with your ship takes a while to get used to but once you do, its much more enjoyable than i thought. To improve, more stealth aspects could be addded to the game cos no matter how stealthy you are, eventually after the first 10 or so enemies youll have to come out and fight sword to sword.Overall, would recommend you to get this game on sale and give it a go
