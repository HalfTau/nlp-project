Not gonna write a long review.This game is absolutely awesome in gameplay and 7/10 for storyline. The story only get excited during the last few sequences. The story of Kenway been an assassin is just almost similar to AC2.Alright, now here is the positive reviews for this game 1 Great environment gameplay with max settings. The PhysX made this game looks way greater and real.2 The combo skills is magnificiently awesome and real. Easy and good position keys for you enjoy the game.3 Bunch of good side missions while ongoing your main mission.The negative reviews for this game 1 Have some glitch bug when you use small boat to teleport you to your own ship, eventually caused your ship gone to somewhere else.2 The save data must NOT be synchronized with Ucloud via Uplay, else your save data could gone at some certain time.Overally, this game is worth buying during the 50 discount with dlcs bundle. Therefore, TRY THIS AWESOME GAME before the AC  Unity is released !
