What I can say about this game is that it is definitely one of the best Assassins Creed Games out there, but that does not mean the games outsanding. At some points you will love the game as you perform extremely cool maneuvers and acts of badassary upon your fancy Brig The Jackdaw, and in others you will despise as one of the games bugs occur or the character simply wont do what the player wants him to do, breaking all the immersion you had. Several times I have experienced bugs such as1.Your ship decided not to spawn so you are literally stranded.2.Complete an extremely long mission because the game keeps pushing you into new missions you have to deal with right there and then and find out when its all over Uplay didnt save your game.3.Uplay4.Saves being deleted by Uplay5.Uplay again just so you understand how much of a problem it is.Id recommend you play this game if you have the heart for it. Many times I have just exclaimed Oh for  sake! and been extremely put off by something in this game and not play it for two months or so. If you can bear through all the game breaking bugs and put up with Uplaysthen this can be really fun Most of the timeEDIT I literally can no longer continue the game because the damn thing refuses to save completely now Well done Uplay. Youve ed another game.
