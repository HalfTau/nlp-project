Picked this up on sale as my first AC game, I love pirate stuff and I love it mostly for that. Although I feel like they could have done a lot more awesome things with the pirating things, its still a lot of fun esp for the price when its on sale.avoid the multiplayer because ubisoft and microtransactions and no freaking sea battles in mp /.
