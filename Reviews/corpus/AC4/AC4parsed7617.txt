This is probably one of the worst PC ports I have ever played on PC. Ubisoft is on a track record with that lately but Assassins Creed III ran leagues better than this. The framerate gets capped to 30 fps Except looking at the sky at any setting since theres no triple buffering and the Vsync sucks, so you have to find a work around it in order to run it at 4560 fps. The method I found makes the game crash a lot. Its a shame, this was shaping up to be the best Assassins Creed game for me since Brotherhood. I am really dissapointed that I cant enjoy this game and I doubt Ubisoft is going to patch this game anytime soon since its already June and the game came out months ago.UPDATENow, lets just say I did a quick google to fix that work around and got it to wrok. Well now, this changes everything I just wrote. This is the best Assassins Creed in a long time. I really love the sailing and the combat feels like the ezio trilogy again which is awesome. Its a good game especially if you can get it on the cheap. Just be aware the port isnt great and work around that to have fun with the game.
