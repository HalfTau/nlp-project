After playing Assassins Creed 2, I was certain I would never play another game in this series. I ignored 3 completely. This one was on sale, so I figured I would only be out a few bucs at halfprice... and the ads looked decent. I LOVE THIS GAME. No more linear story line. A freeroaming world where I can engage in naval battles all I want without having to stick to a storyline? Love it. I spent the first 4 days I played it on my ship, plundering the West Indies, before I moved forward in the storyline. The story itself is turning out to be not so bad either. Again, I cannot overemphasize the freedom of movement in this game. The graphics are gorgeous too... the waves and weather changes at sea, the smoke from the cannons, even the combat, all fantastic. Bottom line Get this game.
