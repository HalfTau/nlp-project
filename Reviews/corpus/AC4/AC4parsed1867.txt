Very enjoyable for the first 2030 hours. Great gameplay, good mix between stealth and action, and the ships and larger map comes along just at the right time, as youre getting bored of the linear storyline. But then, well, it kinda fizzled out for me and became too grindy. But well worth playing for those initial 2030 hours, fantastic.
