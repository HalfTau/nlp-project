Im a fan of the series for many years and I love this series of games.Assassins Creed IV Black Flag  a very worthy continuation of the series, perhaps even the best game of the series after the Assassins creed 2. Great game, with a nice storyline, nice graphics and gameplay. Very good game.Guys, I advise everyone to play it!
