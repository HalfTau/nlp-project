To mirror my fellow gamers comments, this game requires the use of UPlay, which has had a ton of problems including connectivity. Extremely disappointing that the minutes Ive racked up for this game was trying to connect to the UPlay service. I highly recommend not purchasing this game unless youve had no problems connecting to UPlay for other games. If the Steam moderators are listening to your customers voices, please break away from Ubisoft. Thanks.UPDATEAfter a bizzare change/update of the UPlay program, I was finally able to access the game. So far, my progress have been saved and I am enjoying the game. No idea how UPlay finally got itself to update, but Im not going to try to understand technology.
