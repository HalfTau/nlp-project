Some people might argue that its not the best Assassins Creed game ever made, but its the one I like the most. Ubisoft took the elements that made AC a good series and mixed them with the open world features that made the success of Farcry 3.The pirate setting is one of my favorites, and is very well represented here, with likable characters, a vast sea area full of islands and hidden treasures, as well as enemy ships to sink or board. The story is pretty good, although Im only at 15 of progression. Its easy to get distracted by the big number of side activities. You dont have to do them all, you pick what you want, when you want it. I think that AC4 can be fun for different types of gamers in different ways.On the technical side, the game is pretty, with detailed models, textures and lush environments. The water/waves simulation is impressive and makes the navigation and naval combat or hazzards like storms quite realistic and fun. The PC optimization could be better, although I think it runs pretty well on my laptop with i7, Geforce 680M, SSD and 8GB RAM, around 4560 FPS.I encountered no bugs or crashes so far, although the Ubisoft servers were down once, which prevented me to use the minor fleet system in the solo game.The multiplayer modes are the same as previous games, although you now have the possibility to define your own rules and create your own game modes to play with others. I like some of the multiplayer modes, but prefer the solo experience of AC4 a lot more. In previous AC games, it was the opposite for me.I recommend this game to anyone, even those who didnt like the AC series. Its worth a try as the sea gameplay is completely different and the game world is much more open now.
