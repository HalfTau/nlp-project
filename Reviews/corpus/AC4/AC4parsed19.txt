Very fun game! Replayability isnt like an endless world game, but youll get entertainment worth well over what you paid!! See myhours I even bought the Season Pass, because the game was so much fun.The detail that was put into AC4BF is incredible! The combat abilities are extremely fun, especially once youve unlocked all of them! Disarm an enemy, and use his bayoneted gun to stab and blast him in the gut with a finisher?On top of your Pirate/Assassin abilities, you can hunt animals incl. whales/sharks!, go diving for treasure, control a fleet of ships that will bring in lots of , and even play minigames like Checkers, Nine Mens Morris, and Fanorona!
