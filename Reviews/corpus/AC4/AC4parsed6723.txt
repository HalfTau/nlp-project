If you are a completionist like me then you will definately spend alot of your time playing this game. Not only is the map huge and bigger than any other Assassins Creed map, but the story is very compeling. While on your way to do piratey stuff, you will be bombarded with countless loot that is ripe for the taking. This is a game that will want to make you want to spend yet another 60 on the sequel Assassins Creed Unity.
