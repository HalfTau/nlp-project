I consider the Black Flag as one of my favorite AC episodes. The sea battles are exciting, though at the beginning I didnt think it was easy. Also, the game is doing well on its theme  Assassination. There are multiple weapons, like handguns, various darts and swords. By the way, its also cool to play stealthily  to assassinate targets in silence. Id really recommend this game to my fellow AC fans.
