This game feels amazing, the graphics stilll hold up by todays standards, and it is so much ing fun! This is often called the best assassin creed game, and I can see why with this being the first game I played. Even today I still remember the ship combat being one of the best I have ever experienced and the game was near flawless with minor glitches, but none of them were ever game breakig. A solid 9/10
