One of my FAVOURITE GAMES of the Assassins Creed series  ...In the late game the fighting system is really easy like in the other parts BUT i still love it sneaking around and killing every damn enemy ! DBy the way Assassins Creed Origins did a good job in making the fights harder.I love the setting of AC4, its so much fun to play and it never gets old.100 WORTH BUYING IT !! !My Review 9.5/10   Arrrr Pirates D
