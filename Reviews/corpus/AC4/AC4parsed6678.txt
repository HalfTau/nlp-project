Why isnt the game even loading. I had paid all the money and didd everything that was a prerequisite, freed space on my computer. I tried to open it but its just a black screen and if i touch any button on the keypad my laptop says it isnt respoding and it just closes. It is either Valve OR Ubisoft fix this i dont care about that but if this aint gonna be fixed i deman a refund valve AND I MEAN IT.ITS EITHER U FIX THE GAME OR I WANT A REFUND!
