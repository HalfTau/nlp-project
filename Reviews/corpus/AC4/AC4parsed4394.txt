I didnt have an up to date gaming PC until a few years ago, so this was my first of the AC games. I still havent quite finished it, but I think I picked the right one. Pirates are great. This game came out so long ago, that theres no point in reviewing it, but I want that next level pillar of community badge. So I like this game, OK? Theres a review.10/10 would review again.
