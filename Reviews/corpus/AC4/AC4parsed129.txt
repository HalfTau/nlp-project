Had this game for the 360, and bought it again for the nostalgia. Great game, great story, great characters, just a shame the controls are pretty bad especially for a game that emphasises how mobile your character is meant to be. I mean, how am I supposed to catch sea shanties when Edward cant free run in a straight line half the time, or stops moving for no reason? That and countering is frustrating as half the time, it doesnt actually work. And sometimes I cant attack. Other than that, great game. That said, it is a Ubisoft game so I cant be surprised when it lacks polish in certain areas.
