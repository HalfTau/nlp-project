Black Flag is a prettty amazing game. It take far too long to get behind the wheel of your own ship and until then the game is a litle too linear and dull, but once youre actually a pirate? It really opens up. The various types of gameplay  style, freerunning, fighting, piloting your ship  all work very well together. Theres an element of grind when it comes to upgrading your ship which is essential  but it took a very, very long time for me to get bored of attacking and boarding ships. Kenway is also the most interesting AC protagonist, Id argue, as hes not even as Assassin most of the game, is ridculously suicidally stubborn and has a playable psychotic break. Amazing stuff. The loss of Desmond is welcome and the stuff in the modern day is less intrusive and actually more fun. I liked being a faceless, voiceless first person guy with a tablet way more.
