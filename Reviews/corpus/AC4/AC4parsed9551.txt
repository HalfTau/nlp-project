After Revelations I started to lose faith in Assassins Creed AC3 was not better, but then this game came out... I have played all of the AC games and I can call this one my favourite. Ship battles are excellent, side missions are not that filler like they used to be in previous AC titles just remember flag hunts in first AC or cheating husbands in AC2 and this is the first ac game where I really enjoy exploring the free world. If you was disappointed after last 2 games and you still thinking if you should buy this game or not, buy it! I am sure you will not regret this.
