I was never really interested in the Assassins Creed series. Ive played the second one because everyone told me it was the best and it was pretty good, but I think my favorite has to go to Black FlagIm a huge pirate fan, so you can kinda guess that Im already in love with this game.Gameplay Well its Assassins Creed. Stealth and all the buttons are pretty much the same as every other Assassins Creed.Scenery Loving it. Really beautiful and glooming with light everywhere I go. Best part was how you can go to Havana, Cuba. Easy 10/10Story I like it. Dont hate it. Nothing else to it.Boats Pirate ships, dawg. Lovin it.Overall Id recommend this game to just about anyone who likes stealth games or even pirates.
