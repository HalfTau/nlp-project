This is by far the best Assassins Creed game Ive ever played. The carribean environment is beautiful, mysterious and immersive. Not to mention the world is full of places to explore and things to collect. The game also has a great parkour, and combat system. Climbing buildings and fighting enemies is easy and fun. I regard this as the last good Assassins Creed game. AC Unity and that Brit one are just god awful. If you cannot decide between AC Black Flag or AC Unity, do your wallet or mother a favor and buy AC Black Flag.Graphics 10/10Story 8/10Mechanics 9/10Sound 9/10
