Ive played all the various AC games and this one Ive enjoyed the most.Large maps, broken up with ship battles and the normal Assasins missoins and other excellent game story line.I have to say Black Flag for me wins over the latest AC syndicate.Im looking forward to the latest release of Assasins Creed Origins and hoping its better than Syndicate.Im playing through Black Flag as second time as all my save games are gone from my cloud saves Hoping to grab some acheivements I missed on teh last 200 hours of playing.Its cheap right now so for hours of good AC gaming grab this and ENJOY!
