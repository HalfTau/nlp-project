This game plays better as a Pirate simulator than an Assassins Creed.I say this, not having played a single AC, because I loathed the sections in which I was forced to be an assassin or a modern day dope and pined for the moments of being a pirate again. The fighting mechanic is simple, sometimes boring, but visually impressive. The ship warfare is the games strongpoint, with an upgradeable ship allowing for enhanced shiptoship combat that later changes to melee when you board an enemy ship.However, I grew to despise the arbitrary victory sidequests required for defeating an enemy ship and I found my army of pirates to be less than useful. I would have appreciated a larger variety of ship options, and I thought much of the side missions were a bit tedious.The assassinations mostly bored me to tears and I found them to be the least interesting part of the game. There was nothing about the game that discouraged me from running straight up to the target and shooting him/her in the face, which is what I did 90 of the time.Just kidding, there are mechanics that keep you from doing that immediately, and those are obligatory follow the target missions that take 30 years each and instafail you if you so much as sneeze and are also the worst thing ever.However, the collectibles made me feel like a pirate looking for treasure, and the fort sieges were exhilarating. Sailing aimlessly on the open sea watching dolphins and sharks is great, although I feel like the game missed the opportunity of having some stunning sunset backdrops. The story follows an upandcoming pirate witnessing the rise and fall of the age of piracy, and made good use of infrequent cut scenes to endear me to the characters and later regret their demise. The scifi central story was servicable, but I truly felt invested in the game and its characters. I would like to see another AC game with similar mechanics, perhaps based on the naval warfare of the Napoleonic War, a la Master and Commander.
