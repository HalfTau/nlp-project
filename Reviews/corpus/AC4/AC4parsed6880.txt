Hands down the best game in the series, and strangely has the least to do with actually assassinating people. More aptly its Pirates Creed, because 95 of what you do is old time Caribbean piracy events, and its GODDAM AWESOME at this part. Additionally, Edward is probably the most interesting and likeable of the AC protagonists to date, with Aveline being a close second from Liberation.
