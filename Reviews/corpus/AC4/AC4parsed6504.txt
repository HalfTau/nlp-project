As much as it pains me that there are so many clones of this game out there, this game is amazing.Graphics are fantasitic. Some of the best environments ive seen in a while though im writing this after Playing Farcry 4.. cant beat those views.Sound is unreal, from the ambient sounds in the towns, down to the different sea shanties your crew will sing as you find them around towns and jungles.The sea conbat has been refined from AC3, and made me want to just sail around blasting other ships for hours.So far the story is kind of strange, as far as the Abstergo part. Dont want to spoil it.The Pirate story is pretty well written, though im still not through close to even half of it Sailing around battling bigger ships to use in  my fleet is time consuming, as well as taking over forts. Voice acting is well done. I cant stand when a game has voices that dont match the character. None of that here.The map size is... huge. But, its a LOT of ocean. There is still loads of activities and random ships and flotsam and wayward sailors, and random islands, and crap loads of other things to find.The only part that i wasnt really pleased with was the Fleet missions. Although there is a mini game to play to make the routes safer, it just kind of seems tacked on. Dont get me wrong, i still laugh as i destroy a schooner with a fire barrel before even shooting the main guns on my bigger ships i cant really explain why i dislike it other than i just think it feels like it was an afterthought. /shrugOverall 9/10 would bang again
