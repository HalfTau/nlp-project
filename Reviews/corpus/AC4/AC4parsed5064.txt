This is an amazing game! The story, the realtime sailing and getting to see Edward evolve is a lot of fun! However, no game is without its flaws. In Assassins Creed 4, the controls are a bit hard to get used to, esspecially since Ive been playing Assassins Creed 2 for a while. Buying this game through steam doesnt actually give you the game either. It instead gives you a code that you need to register on Uplay. This game is also damn near imposable to play without a good computer and a gamepad.All that said, I dont hate Uplay. I dont hate Ubisoft. Ubisoft just needs to get theirtogether and focus on PC a bit more.
