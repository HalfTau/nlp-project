In my opinion the best Assassins Creed game. Sadly, you have to play occasionally the Abstergo parts, to get back to the pirate part. This is very annoying.There are a few bugs, sometimes you get stuck in the environment and you have to restart the game. But not too often, about every 510 hours.The movementcontrol is ok, but sometimes it drives you mad.The sword combat is lame perry, hit, parry, hit, parry, hit, hit  hit. You have to do that frequently and it does not functions really. You better sneak, its much more fun.Graphics are stunning, and no other game gives you an experience like that.The seafarings are the heart of the game and battles on the sea are great.I would give 8/10, because of the annoying Abstergo part and the lame close combat part.I bought the season pass too, but its kind of dispensable.Someone here explained how to activate it.Right click on Assassins Creed Black Flag in the library.Then choose View CD key and copy the season pass key into clipboard.Paste it in your Uplay account under activate product. Now you get a few new contents, two new harbors with missions and the Single Player Campaign Freedom Cry.
