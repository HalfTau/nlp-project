The Assassins Creed series was never my type of games. I actually never really all enjoyed the series with the exception of the first.BUT THIS IS AN EFFING PIRATE SIMULATOR or as close to one as you can get. While the game never takes away the copy paste element of ALL the other Assassins Creed games, this one has a much more tollerable experience... if you like pirates and simulated games. Black flag has stunning realism in the ocean sailing. There are strangely fun events to partake in and loads of ships to sink, destroy, or board. While you do still do the traditional island hunting, stalking, hawk diving, assasinating of traditional Assasins Creed games, its a bit more free roam. Therefore, it will not force you to continue the story line if you just want to kill some whales and blow up ships. Upgrades for your ships, and crafting elements are apparent in this one.Id say Black Flag is one of the best, top notch Assassins Creed games released so far. On PC, expect some framerate dips if you arent running a brand new 1000 rig, but its not unplayable. Expect some frustrations with controlling your charecter without a controller as well. Id strongly reccommend a PC controller for this game. It will make movement on land with all the traditional Assassins Creeds mechanics and sailing your ship far easier.None the less, Assassins fans will have a different viewpoint than myself. As notsomuch a cult follower of the series, to another Assassins fan, get it. To a nonAssassins fan like myself, its worth at least finding a friend that has it to try it. You may be impressed. Perhaps youll get it on sale, never beat the game, and roam the ocean like I do. Im pretty pleased with the sailing myself. Then again, I always wanted to be a pirate. RRRGGG!!!4.0/5 for an Assassins Creed game4.5/5 for a pirate simulatorId pay 30 for this game anyday. Not sure if Id really pay all that much more for it though. Happy sailing!
