i bought this game with great anticipation to play it. after hours of trying to figure out why it crashes on start up i have given up. ubisoft has the worst technical support page i have ever seen. i have had zero luck getting any help what so ever. i would love a refund for this but unfortunatelyi know this wont happen. i am hearby never buying another game from ubisoft again. sincerely a very annoyed and dissatisfied customer.
