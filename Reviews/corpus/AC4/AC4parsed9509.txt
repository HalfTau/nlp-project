Great game and would like to say I have been able to complete it but Ive lost all motivation to finish it. After playing 53 hours of the game I have had to repeat one 10 hour session of gameplay because of corrupt saves, I tried diasabling cloud syncing and again lost 21 of progress, 76 to 55 complete which was probably more than 10 hours.All that assided the game is fun, I liked the story but if the saves become corrupt its really really boring redoing everything.
