Picked this up during the sale was not disappointed at all.  This game is fantastic.  The story is more captivating for me than previous iterations, it has tighter controls and faster freerunning, and it features the best pirate ship sim on the market.  Gives me hope back for Unity and the future of the franchise after a long period of stagnation.  Check out my full review here in 1080p... complete with shanties!
