What could go wrong with a game that lets you play a pirate? Apparently a lot of things. terrible sidequest design repetetive gameplay after 20 minutes Animus...the immersion killer poor craftingThis game could have been a blast. The seabattles are fun and a great experience overall, if Ubi would have made a stand alone pirates game, this could have been it, if the crafting/trading had more depth. Is anyone still interested in that templar / assassins story?A Tip for Ubi screw that assassin/templar story. add solid trading / crafting add more ship classes Name it Pirates! make profitOh... Uplay.
