The game is a wee bit repeatitive but so fun to repeat those challenges. The game is replayable and has great FPS on older machines like my AMD 2010 computer with a medGeForce graphics card. Everything is well balance. I guess my only con is the DLCs. Would of been nice to have more treasure chests to find for .99c. If you pay around 15.00 for a copy, you got a right on deal! Overall I am always excited to play. Ship combat is outstanding !
