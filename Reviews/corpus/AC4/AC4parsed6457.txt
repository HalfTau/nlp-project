This game was a wonderfully made game for its time that surpassed its predecessors that came before it, the gameplay was much improved as compared to the previously made games. The introduction of new things like actually experiencing what happens in reality as a staff member of Abstergo and in the past/animus as Edward were interesting as we get to see things from a new persons/our own perspective instead of Desmonds. Although we can no longer call for help while on land like in the previous games, this game makes up for it with having a crew while at sea. They really focused on improving  the naval combat for this game most likely due to the good response from the fans of Assassins Creed 3 where there were naval missions to play in as Connor. I personally didnt like it in AC3 but after playing this game, I realised that the naval combat is much more fun in this game. Edwards loadout is quite different from most of the previous assassins. It consisted of Dualwield swords and a maximun of 4 guns with the miscellaneous tools used by the other assassins which makes him one of the most badass assassins who ever lived. This game was really one of the more wellmade Assassins Creed games when it was released but as always there will be a better AC game like AC unity.
