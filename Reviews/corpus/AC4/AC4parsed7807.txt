I seriously cant stop playing this game! This is the best Assassins Creed Ive ever played. Maybe its because I have a soft spot for pirates and their ships but I havent been this addicted to a game since Red Dead Redemption. All the elements of the older games are present but the monotony of parkour and puzzle solving is broken up with being a bad pirate. Ok, enough with this review, back to sailing my ship!
