Avast, swabs. Who doesnt enjoy being a pirate? This game provides that NC Wyeth experience without the rum, sodomy, scurvy and the lash which might make it more authentic. Piloting the ship, knifing landlubbers, ogling buxom wenches, and gaining more loot than a rogue can chew on make this very enjoyable. And damn those waterspouts! Full sail ahead!
