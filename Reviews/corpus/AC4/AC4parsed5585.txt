After playing trough all the Assassins Creed Franchise including Unity and Rogue i think this is arguably the best one of them.Not only are the Naval battles better then the ones that the new adaption Rouge has well its like they copypasted Black Flag in everything including the hunting and other mechanichs and just added a new story but i think that Black Flag is better in the Naval battles because the games story is centered in them.Grapichs and Enviorment  BreathtakingStory  Epic, well i mean who wouldnt like to play being a Pirate of The CaribbeanNaval Battles  AmazingRating 10/10
