Three out of five stars. This will probably be the last time I buy an AC game. The glitches are painfully abundant and yes, most of them are game breaking. The story is really good. Its nothing life changing but there are a few lines that resonate very nicely. The music does its job. The graphics are deserving of a AAA title. The mechanics are very fun when they work and I mean theyre very, VERY fun. Still, the glitches are just everywhere and large portions of the story are bland. Normally the AC titles have some sort of half baked, preachy messgae buried somewhere an this one very well might follow the trend... But honestly I cant remember huge chunks of the main story, let alone what the subtle background contained. The massive open world feels great though and when the game works, it works. Im glad I played it but the bitter taste it left in my mouth has turned me away from supporting any more sequels.
