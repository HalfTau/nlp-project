I dont know how good the gameplay is yet but I am going to state that I do not recommend buying this game already after spending many hours just getting to the title screen.It begins having to choose between multiple editions with exclusive content and there being no clear information on the page or ubisofts website of what is in each edition many people will be forced to scour forums just to figure out what they are trying to buy. This means even before buying the game Im already annoyed with it... but then there is more.After waiting for the game to download you will be unable to open the game until you sign up to ubisofts gaming service and install uplay which will run in the background as well as steam if you want to play the game. Thenunlike 99 of games on steam you will have to type in verification codes both into uplay and in the game itself.This is the biggeston Ive ever had getting a game to play on my computer and ive had some pretty convoluted systems. This honestly made loading games from tape on a bbc micro/acorn electron feel like the better option. This is not the future of gaming and regardless of the gameplay I will not buy another title from the series until this nonesense is gotten rid of. Seriously wtf is this bs...
