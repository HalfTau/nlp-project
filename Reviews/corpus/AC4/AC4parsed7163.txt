Friggin Pirates! That is the reason I bought this game, and I was not disappointed. Honestly, I pretty much ignored any of the Assassins Creed tie ins and still completely enjoyed it. This game could drop the A.C. garbage and stand on its own as a free roam pirate simulator. In fact, Ubisoft should actually just branch off and make a free roam pirate sim. This game is definitely worth it, and its easy to ignore the Assassin/Templar junk they throw into this one.
