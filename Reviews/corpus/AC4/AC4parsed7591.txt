Ok, so at first they pull you through what seems to be a tutorial, but very, very soon you start enjoying the open world with your ship the Jackdaw. Fighting both landbased targets as well as other Spanish and English vessals with increasing difficulty as both your experience as well as wanted level goes up. Im not going to say much more as I do not want to spoil the experience of such an EXCELLENT game. Drink up me hearties yo ho, yo ho...
