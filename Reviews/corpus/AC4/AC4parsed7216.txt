The first game in the series that I really got into. Although it makes me sad that the pirate mechanics will probaly wont ever be used again, the game is stellar. Graphics are beautiful, the various gameplay modes are exceptionally fun, and there is a LOT of content to get through. Even the social minigames Kenways Fleet, is a fun little diversion. Certain side missions did feel tedious and unrewarding at times hunting, whaling, and diving.Now Im hoping that I liked this game enough as an Assassins Creed title enough to like future games in the series. If not, Ill still have an amazing pirate game.
