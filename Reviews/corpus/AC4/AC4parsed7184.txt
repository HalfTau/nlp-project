This game had the most amazing story.  I was a badpirate who traveled the world, assassinating bad dudes, ruling the waters, and doing what I had to do to get all the best equipment in preparation to the climax  the showdowns with the four legendary ships.  Theres a pretty cool stealth game on the side with a great story about some famous pirates too.  Overall 10/10 worth full price and then some.
