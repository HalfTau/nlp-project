Very unoptimized. Even when using Rivatuner to lock the game at 30 FPS, I get frequent drops. I lower the settings to medium, no AA, and it still happens. I have a Dell 7577 with the i5 7300HQ and GTX 1060 Max Q 6GB w/ 8GB RAM so I dont think its the laptop that cant handle a 2013 game. Im able to run The Witcher 3 at Ultra locked 30 FPS or medium/high 60 FPS with dips at times, especially in the city.Amazing pirate game, meh Assassins Creed.
