Id love to be more articulate than this but I just cant be right now..... Assassins Creed needs to  off. I read good things about this game and its the same, brokencrap theyve been hawking for years, and Ive played em all. Spending hours on a ship doesnt make up for the fact the the free running hasnt improved since AC2. Im not going to prattle on ad nauseum about how this sucks, it just does. I feel like I should try to play a little more because Ive never given up this quickly into a game before but, thus far, Ive had exactly zero fun playing this game.UPDATEThe ship combat and exploration, really is kinda fun so, I have to amend my prior statement I have had some fun with this game. That doesnt change much else. The story is meh, and, the whole Abstergo, peices of Eden, or whatever, meta story is just so much nonsense I cant even pretend to care anymore. Enough venting. I really want to love this game but so far I just cant. I think this franchise has finally jumped the proverbial shark. Or should I say it in pirate  jumped the shaarrrrrrrk.
