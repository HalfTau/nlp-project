Best damned AC since AC2 itself.This game actually has a decent story, some interesting characters, and unlike Connar from AC3, actually comes off as some sort of human being. Id say this actually makes up for the horrid experience of AC3.Gorgeous graphics backing it all, this is definetly the best AC yet.
