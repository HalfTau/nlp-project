Another solid release of Assassins Creed. A good storyline, although admittedly it does just feel sometimes like they wanted to make an assassins creed game with pirates in. The core map mechanics remain intact with smaller urbanised areas where you undertake missions and larger open travel areas connecting them  a formular Ive always thought worked very well.The core storyline watch out spoiler alert doesnt really pin you down as an Assassin much until right towards the end as mostly you play a self interested pirate hoping to score his island of gold. The fight and climbing/free running mechanics show a few improvements though as always they have a strong tendency to drive you crazy when you climb something tall, then accidentally hit the wrong direction and Edward jumps off and dies.Generally I would say this is a great game, theres plenty to do which is interesting outside of the main storyline and enough twists to keep it interesting.
