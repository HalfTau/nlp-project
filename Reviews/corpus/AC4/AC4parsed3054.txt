I had never played any AC games and I have to say Im disappointed. The combat and stealth are kinda shallow and the exploration is repetitive. The missions can be fun on occasion. The naval combat is ok, taking over ships is probably the best feature, but it could have used a bit more guidance. But the main reason Im giving this a negative review I can live with uplay is the irritating breaking the 4th wall abstergo subplot, which is so lame and obnoxious that I stopped playing. Enemies are already so dumb, generic and robotic that they already break the 4th wall, if thats what they were going for.
