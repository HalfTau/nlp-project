This game is by far the best in the series. The qualityof textures and shadows in unfathomable and then story is truely immersive and fabulous in its experiences and openworld nature, The excessive audio features not only add to the greatest of the game.If you love pressing play millions of time and then reinstalling  UPlay and the game itself overand over then I most definitely recommend this game for you.11/10  IGN
