This is in my opinion the best game in the long list of titles in the Assassins Creed universe. Most of the old mechanics are kept from previous games, but the game also introduces a couple of very exciting new ones. Almost gone are also the storyarch outside the Animus, which Ive never found particulary enjoyable.
