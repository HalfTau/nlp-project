This game is huge and beautiful but with those aspects the game also has several glitches. The glitches are humorous and will not screw you over at least. Going for 100 completion as soon as I can which I am enjoying doing. Amazing for an Assassins Creed game D but the ship boarding short cutscenes get very old very quickly.
