Fantastic game. If only they just did a game like Pirates with the ships and the carribean just as they have it in this game. Another great game in the Assassins Creed catalogue but in my opinon the ship combat and board actions are by far the most enjoyable feature of the game itself. Nothing like upgrading your ship so you can take on bigger and better prey. Nobody is safe in the carribean. As for the assassin gameplay, its very much the same as it has always been. Complete a contract, collect goodies, go through the main storyline as you play for access to more stuff. Not bad but nothing majorly revolutionary there. Definitely get this game if youre a fan of Sid Myers Pirates! games.
