I dont typicaly do reviews.  However, this game prompts me to provide one.  Excellent is all I can say.  The story line is captavating and the ship battles are exciting.  Even though the end of the game is sad it is truly epic.  Dont change a thing!  I would recommend this game to anyone who briefly wants to live the virtual life of a buccaneer.  A great escape from reality.
