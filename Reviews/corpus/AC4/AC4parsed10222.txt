Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is an amazing game on its own, and arguably the best game in the Assassins Creed series. What makes Assassins Crred IV Black Flag shine particularily a part from its predecessors is the introduction of opensea naval combat which, if you played AC3, was teased a little bit with Connors seperate line of naval missions featuring his ship the Aquila.New mechanics for the naval combat have been added for Assassins Creed IV Black Flag as well as an abundance of costumization features for Kenways ship everything starting from ship weapon upgrades to cosmetic enhancements for the Jackdaw. All of this can be obtained by plundering ships, raiding plantations, and diving underwater treasure sites.All of this would not be possible, however, without a crew. Fortunately for us Kenway will come across recruitable pirates during his adventure across the West Indies. Oh, yeah. Your own ing pirate crew!Of course, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag woudnt be an AC game if it didnt feature any of the core assassin gameplay weve all come to enjoy from previous installments of Assassins Creed. Everything we come to expect from the series makes its way back on to Assassins Creed IV Black Flag.
