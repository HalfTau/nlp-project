Last year, Assassins Creed III left a sour taste in my mouth and made me hate the AC series. When ACI IV was announced I had no interest in it whatsoever. I even decided to skip the game and not bother with AC anymore. My mind was changed only after getting positive feedback and hearing nothing but praise from my friends about the game. Much to my surprise, after finally deciding to buy it on sale, its my favorite AC game after AC II. I might even go as far and say this is the best AC game to date in terms of gameplay and overall fun. Pirate themed games are scarce and the mechanics are extremely well executed. The game gives you complete freedom from the get go and doesnt restrict you to the narrative. Story wise, its not the best AC game but I think its a fair trade since the focus on gameplay and fun paid off. I can easily see myself playing this game for a very long time even after finishing it.
