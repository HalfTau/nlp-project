I wouldnt reccommend the PC version of this game. Its a fun game normally, but Ubisoft has some sort of grudge against PC users. The game is buggy as all hell, not to mention all the crashing due to issues with the save files and something to do with the sound files or sound card or something according to forum users...  No support from Ubisoft on the matter either. Im already regretting my preorder of Unity if this is how Ubisoft treats their fans. Save yourself the trouble and get this for a console, preferably new gen if you want something relatively close to the PC graphics.
