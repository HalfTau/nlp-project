The gameplay is decent for open world sandbox types. Responsive parkour type running/climbing/jumping. Combat is decent for this style.However, If you have a single brain cell in your head do not buy this game. The narative is so completely insulting it is horrifying. I bought this as a way to redeem GTA sandbox games to myself after playing Watchdogs and wanting to write an actual physical letter to steam for letting me pay such a rediculous price for such an underwhelming game. Now ive done it twice with this game. If you respect yourself and want to use your money as political speech toward horrible standards in gaming prioritizing graphics over everything else, the dumbing down of games for mass appeal, then DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
