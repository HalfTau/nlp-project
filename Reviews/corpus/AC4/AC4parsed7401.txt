Its another open world Ubisoft game. Ive grown tired of the same formula they use in all their games.Climb tower to unlock parts of the map. Skin animal x for reasons unknown. Kill all enemies in random outpost to liberate it.Been there, done that for 5 AC and a few Far Cry games.If this is your thing, go ahead, youll love this aswell. Ive had enough. Mix it up, Ubisoft. Eventually more people will stop buying your games if this is the only way you know how to make open world games.On the plus side, PS4 controller worked out of the box.
