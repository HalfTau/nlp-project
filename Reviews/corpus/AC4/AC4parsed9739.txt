AC has redeemed itself with this title. After successive disappointments since ACB, AC4 has reinvigorated the series and raised the quality at least to the level of the former defining installment AC2. The combat is more fluid than ever, and the freerunning and level design on which to use it incorporates the best of past installments. However, the biggest new feature in this game is the open sea, and it truly does make you feel like a pirate when you are plundering British and Spanish vessels and exporing ancient ruins in search of treasure. In the end, whether you want a great pirate game or another truly great AC game, this is the game for you.
