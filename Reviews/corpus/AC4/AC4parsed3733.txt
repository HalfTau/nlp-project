Now that Ive finished it heres a review!Considering that I havent played much games and I got this game for 5 dollars on Lunar sales, it was amazing.Graphics are great, story is pretty good, some actual character development and many things to do out on sea. The ending was great and the feels were real. Oh, and the soundtrack! The shanties and the OST are brilliant, and made the experience even more dazzling. Amazes me how detailed the game was for the price I got the it for. Great game, although I dont think I would have enjoyed it as much if I got it at the original price.
