100 recommended, i hadnt played any AC game before but the pirate ambiance attracted me to try this game out, and all i can say is, GREAT! You get the pirates, the ninja type of assasinations, the naval fights, open world, everything is there to have hours and hours of fun with this title. I hope there are a lot of DLCs for this one.
