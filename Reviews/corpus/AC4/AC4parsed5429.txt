you have a ship, a gun, a sword, but no parrot50 points950 leftwell done ladsany way there is no parrot but the game  is pretty impressive. the map is large, there is a metric st ton of content, im about 50 hours in and only 40 of the way done. there are about 5 different basic ships lowest tier to highest. gunboat  schooner, brig, frigate, mano waror galleon, then there are 4 legendary ships that i have yet to encounter .then there are the innumerable  side quests naval contracts, assassin contracts, mini quests, forts, harpooning etc. the money can be used on your gear or ship. both have a significant impact on gameplay. crafting is similar to Far Cry 3 another great game you kill animal, you make stuff and above all else you are a pirate, what else could you want a parrot perhaps, seriously I WANT A PARROT
