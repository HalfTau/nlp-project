Out of all of th AC games INCLUDING Syndicate, which by the way is pretty good, I choose this one as my favorite. the sense of freedom and the Sea combat is amazing. you could spend your time doing side quests or just fooling around at sea gunning down ship after ship. even better you can customize the crap out of the Jackdaw. Even the story was amazing and played with my emotions a bit towards the end.  IMO this is probably the best Assasins Creed game and will be until Ubi can come up with something similar to this in a different era.My only con is the Aveline DLC.. it is extremely linear and seems to be a last minute project. and it saddens me that the only thing you loot off of bodies is bullets when yknow the whole point of it is to sneak around. also you cant level up gear unlike the Freedom Cry DLC. other than Aveline the game is worth the money
