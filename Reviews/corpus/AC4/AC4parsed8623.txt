Total masterpiece! They actually went back to their roots and released an amazing sequel. The way Edward acts and associates with the different orders is total gold. Everything the old games brought they improved on with this one and created a HUGE world to explore. I actually want to explore and do every side quest unlike in AC3 where it was bland and boring. Edward is a killing machine, dual wielding swords and wrecking guards like the good old days. New hero new game, spot on masterpiece.As someone who hated AC3s version of ship battles I was surprised how much i enjoyed Black Flags. They expanded on the ship battles boarding, more guns, and rain mortars to destroy more and more to make your ship stronger. Nothing dragged on or felt out of place. The missions were enjoyable, and I like how they implemented a rating system for feedback on if you hated the mission or if they were well done. Also the addition to salvage underwater wrecks and the environment down there was just beautiful.The only downside I could see is the story isnt as gripping as Ezios story. It was good, but Ezios story was just fantastic and untouchable on scales beyond all comparison. Edward is a pirate, he plunders and steals booty that is all he cares about. He mocks the creed and laughs doing it. Although it doesnt hit the level of legend Ezio could hit, Blackbeard and the other pirates are enjoyable to listen to and work with unlike Connors story/acquaintances.Overall I give this a solid 8.8/10.Also buy Freedoms Cry DLC, Adewale has a great story, and was a character I loved in the main story.
