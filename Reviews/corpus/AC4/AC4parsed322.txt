This game may be the best pirate game but it is obviously the worst among the series this far. Chasing enemies with freerunning is almost impossible. The sword fights are easy as hell. AI is dumb as a pig. Im really disappointed in this game of AC series. Im still gonna have to play it to keep up with the story. Im a completionist but Im not sure I can endure the gameplay of this game. Im taking a break and gonna carry on with another game for a while.
