Iam not a fan of Assasins Creed. But this one i like very much.Its an open world game with many ship fights, which are really fun.Fullfilling missions, discover islands, develop your ship, gettin new and better weapons makesthis game very interesting.I hope that future Assasin Creed games will have ship battles too. Thats the reason why this gameis so good.
