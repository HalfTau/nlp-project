I feel like I should say something about this game since I was very sceptical at the beginning and was ignoring the whole Assassins Creed series for years. Honestly, I can now easily assort this as one of my biggest errors I have ever done.I havet played any previous AC gamesAssassins Creed IV Black Flag game, first of all I should point out that it is very intelligent game with complex and thrilling story and interesting characters, smart dialogues and amazing scenes. The whole game is based on the historical facts, so its educative as hell too.The open world in this game is realistic and fun. Graphics and the games design is perfect. I like the balance between the main story and side missions. The game gives you as much space as you want in the way how you want to proceed. The games soundtrack is brilliant and feelingful aswell as the voice over which makes an irreplaceable atmosphere in this game. The main characters, pirates, are unique and definitely not boring. You will find nothing like wooden leg, parrots or eyepatch here. They are really well written characters.I would recommend Black Flag to anyone who likes action adventure games and ignored AC series, even to those who hate pirates, because this game illustrates them just the way they should be, I know its still very romantic kind of way to look on them, but what the hell.10/10
