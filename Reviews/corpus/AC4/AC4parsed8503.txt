This game by far passed my expectations. The Gameplay was incredably smooth with very few flaws. Much like the other Assassins Creed games the storyline if very in depth and interesting. This game really makes you wish you were born in this time period so you could be a pirate and  someup. All and all i think this was a huge success by ubisoft and a geat expansion to this franchise. Very excited for what the next installment
