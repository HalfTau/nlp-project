Well this sure is Assassins Creed.Suckered in by all the reviews and oh my gosh its so good and different!.  Nope.Replace horseback riding with boat riding.  Assassins Creed 4.  Thats not to say its bad but its just... more of the same.Rating meh, good for a 5er, maybe 10 if you havent played it in a while and like the series.
