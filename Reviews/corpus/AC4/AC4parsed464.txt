I have never been an Assassins Creed fan, I know sacrilege, but I was more than pleasantly surprised by this game. I havent played an AC game since AC2 and about 30min in AC3 and found the controlls to be terrible on PC, that was not the case with this game. Everything seems to flow and the storyline has been fantastic so far. The sea battles are a blast also. The only negative I would really have at this point is that earning money and upgrades is very grindy, but still decently fun.9/10 would recommend to anyone, even non AC fans!
