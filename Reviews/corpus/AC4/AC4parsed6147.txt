If you enjoyed the previous AC titles you will enjoy this one. While I really like AC3  overall. I really had  fun during the ship missions. AC4 builds around this and allows you the freedom to explore. There is something special about sailing around the open sea and capturing ships. Good luck and happy sailing!
