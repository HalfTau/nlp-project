Theres been a long standing debate about which would be better, a Ninja or a Pirate.  On one side, the Ninjas, are a silent lethal killer. Death from the shadows.  The other a Pirate, a hedonist with an itchy trigger finger. The embodiment of the human spirit with a thirst for adventure exceeded only by their greed.  This game takes that debate, and insist on a third option. Be both. A Ninjapirate, where you get absolutely the best of both worlds.
