I for one loved this game, I cannot say enough good things about it. The story was amazing and it gave you that feeling that you were really pirate like in pirates of the caribbean series. It was worth every penny because there was so much to do. The game was alone beautiful and I honestly cant help but only want to play caribbean pirates now. 10/10 would play again
