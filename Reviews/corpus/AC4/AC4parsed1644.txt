This game is fun mix of Pirates of Carribean, Assassins Creed and Star Trek. The last one only is reference to the main character Edward Kenway aka Captain James T Kirk as a Pirate. A brash wise cracking lady killer and former drunk turned hero, essentially Star Trek 2009 in the Golden Age of Piracy. Of course you have the AC elements present as does every installment but this time its very downplayed as an almost side story and completely focuses on you being a swash buckling terror of the high seas. You go after a variety of nations colonizing the Carribean. Cuba obviously is owned by the Spanish, The Dutch are more scattered, the Bristish have a presence. So if you can imagine Chris Pines James T. Kirk personality, with Chris Hemworths face in a Rated R Pirates of Carribean spinoff then this is your game. Highly recommend it. In short it really is a great game and I highly worth the pick up.
