Havent played the previous AC games, but as a pirate game is fantastic. Really stirs up my inner rogue. It takes a few sessions working out the stealth mechanics and limits in this game Eg. Can you assassinate someone at the very last second if they see you..., as with the ship controls.My all time favorite parts are the massive ship battles  boarding other ships in epic skirmishes.Yaarrrrs.
