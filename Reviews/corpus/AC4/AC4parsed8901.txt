This is what ive been waiting for with Assassins creed. Loved the first one and the second the parkur aspect is the best. And the assassinations. Ubisoft blew it with the revolutionary war one, too much jkust plain running on the ground. Thisi s spot on. Free running in the cities, awesome assassinations, and PIRATE SHIPS! I was afraid it would suck and put off buying it, but it doesnt! Its AWESOME. The right balance between sapce, epic battles, and sneaky missions! The android companion app is a great bonus, stuff to do while im away, and now i actualy take time to read all the animus data base entries that weve all ignored in game before! I am still not a fan of the ubisoft installer/tracker, but it enabled this functionality, so its not all bad.
