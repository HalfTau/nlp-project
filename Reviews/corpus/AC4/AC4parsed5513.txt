For Everyone who loves Assassins Creed, I recomend this. It is also a great place to start the series. The naval is a great part of the game, alongside the ship boarding to get cargo that unlocks more Jackdaw upgrades. I spent 2 weeks playing, I had to do l ots of side quests for more money and cargo to upgrade the Jackdaw and complete harder naval missions. The fact that I spent 2 weeks is great, it isnt a game that will be done in 3 hours. There was a great boss battle at the end. The outfits are great, and the fact that you can customize your ship is better. Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is one of the best games Ive ever played.
