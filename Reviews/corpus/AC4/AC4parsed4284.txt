Buy it for the ships! when quite discountedNaval combat in this game is definitaly highlight of the game. Sailing, fighting, plundering and upgrading your ship is extremly fun experience unseen in any other game or unbeknown to me. The sea is littered with activities  plunder some trading ships, conquer a pesky fort that makes your sailing hell, hunt some whales, sing with your crew on poopdeck while drinking rum in real life... I played this game mostly because of the naval combat and paritally because of the story.Plot tries to capture a period of time from rise to fall of the pirate republic. I can see the idea was good but I dont think it was executed very well. You play as main protagonist  pirate Edward Kenway looking for ways to get quickly rich, which runs into rogue assassin just at the beginning of the game which will lead you to the mysterious templar order... Interesting, but the story is fast paced, telling instances months and years apart without explaining properly what exactly happened to the world, which made me wonder what am I doing now and why?. Therefore I also failed to understand characters motivations which made me just more confused.Parkour gameplay is solid, animation is smooth and controls responsive, I cant complain about it. What I can complain about is the melee combat system. It just belongs to the past  to first two AC games. It is all simpled down to waiting till enemy attacks, pressing parry, and pressing instant kill button while others patiently waitit till you finish. It just isnt fun and made me want to go back to ship and plunder some helpless ships...So, if you want to play good naval combat game, go for it. If you want to play good action game with great story, well, get Batman or Shadow of Mordor game.
