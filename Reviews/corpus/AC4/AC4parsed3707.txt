Okay, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is an awesome game. I would recommend this to whose never play Assassins Creed before, especially for anyone who like the pirate stories.Open world sailing with ship, naval battle, and aboard to another ship is the best adventures that the game offers to us. Gameplay is ease but still challenging, suit with any gamers playstyle.The storyline and characters are great, has some touching moments that sometimes maybe will make you cry. But still, I hate when the story going outside the animus .Environments are so beautiful, tropical forest and ocean are wonderful of course with a great graphic card P. Voice acting is well done as well, theyre good at singing.Combat is great, just same like other third person games. The upgrade system is pretty good, you want easy battles, then go hard at finding upgrade material or you dont want find material, then go hard at battles.Cons  Maybe not fully perfect port to PC, some fps drop to 30 may be found. Outside animus gameplay  every times it on going, I always say the hell is this, just back to Kenway story ! Overall, this is the best AC story  ending aside from Ezio story. I really do enjoy this game and always trying rush on main story because it just make me curious. Characteristic  enviroment are just so fabulous, and for combat / naval mechanic are awesome.Maybe this game is underrated I know some people may feel disgusted with AC series, but just give it a try for this one, may you will fall into the storyline 9/10 for it.
