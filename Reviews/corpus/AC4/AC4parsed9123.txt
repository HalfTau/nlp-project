My friends and I have serious problems with this game the worst being that it crashes at launch if you dont find and delete the saved game so you cant save progress. The game might work for you bud Id look up some fourms about the bugs with the game first. When you do get to play it its a beautiful game but its not fun buying something that doesent work and Ubi is not handling it well.
