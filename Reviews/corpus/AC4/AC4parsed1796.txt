Terrible Customer service that gave nothing but generic answers to questions I had. Does not support 3440x1440 among other resolution screens. So i guess if you have a generic 1080 monitor your fine. And you have to sign into the stupid UPLAY account before even playing a game!!! not online just single player, yup still have to sign in. What a bunch of BS.
