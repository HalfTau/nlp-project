The best AC of the series to date. Ive put countless hours into this game and havent missed a single one. I was worried the sea travel and ship battles would be less fun than running around rooftops taking out soldiers but I was wrong. The ship combat is sickingly addictive and doesnt take anything away from the game. I was very dissapointed with AC3 and AC4 has corrected all of my concerns. If your on the fence about this game, trust me, you will not regret its purchase.
