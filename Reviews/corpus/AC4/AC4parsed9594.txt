As a long time Assassins Creed fan, I have to say this is the best in the franchise.I was concerned with the yearly release schedule they have been dong based on Revelations and AC3, but the team behind this game had secured my faith in the game once.At first, the naval combat about 40 of the game seems like it would be a huge gimmick and waste of time.  However, it is very exciting and fun to get into the naval battles.  The game rewards you with resources for these battles which then improve your ship later, which then allows you to fight bigger ships with more resources to get more upgrades.  Its a cycle, but its a fun cycle and I found myself going out of my way to take down as many ships as possible.At the core of the game with controlling Edward directly, the game is solid and rivals Brotherhood in terms onfoot gameplay and mechanics.  While I felt main weapon selection was limited unarmed, dual hidden blades, and dual swords, the combat was fluid and solid.  With running the main story and side activites, they never felt reduntant and each one seemed different.  It kept me engaged in the game and I wanted to keep doing more of them.On the PC, you will notice this is a very high end with low optimization for lower end machines.  However, when it runs, it runs fantastic.  The normal few AC glitches come up, but I never encountered a game breaking glitch.Overall, fantastic game and I would recommend this title to anyone.
