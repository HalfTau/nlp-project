For a long time Assassins Creed II has been my favorite game of all time for its story and gameplay, however, while black Flags story isnt bad I dont find it to be better than AC2s story. The gameplay is FANTASTIC, I havent played Unity yet but right now I can tell you that this is one of my all time favorite games.
