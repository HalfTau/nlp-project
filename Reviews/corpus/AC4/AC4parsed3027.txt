Now that I have reached about 70 total synchronization, I feel that Im ready to review this.Now lets start with what Black Flag does right and notsorightNaval combat is very simple, yet very funMelee combat is also simple and pretty much unchanged from previous AC installations. Is that good thats for you to decide.Plundering ships is fun at start, but when you have to do it for the Nth time it can get a bit boringShip upgrading doesnt require tons of tedious grinding as the more upgraded your ship gets the more powerful ships you can tackle, and acquire more resources!The four legendary ship fights each at the respective corner of the map are fun and different from each other, and provide a reason to upgrade your ship, as they are very powerful and require a well suited shipLack of ways to customize your ship, the only thing you can change are sails, the steering wheel, and a decorative figurehead at the front of the ship!Now, I liked Edward as a main character and how he grows in wisdom during the progress of the game, starting as a drunken pirate, and ending as a full fledged assassin and a, yet I can feel that they wanted to create another Ezio. They have tried to recreate the charm of the beloved Italian heartbreaker, yet not understanding that Ezio had three games to build his character but Edward only has one.The plot was pretty good, I liked it, maybe its not the strongest plot in AC history, but its still enjoyable. Takes about 35 or more hrs to complete depending if youre going for 100 syncThe game has waaaaaaay too many trailing and eavesdropping missions, so much that it actually gets tedious on the final parts of the gameThe outfits I feel are very similar and I found myself using only a few of themGetting 100 synchronization, Is absolutely boring and useful only if youre a completionist. There is just too many chests and animus fragments, that give absolutelly minuscule rewards that theres just no motivation for me to find them!Kenways fleet is pretty much useless, and I rarely checked it and sent out ships to missions.Freerunning is fluid and fast as in every AC game, yet theres also the same problems Edward jumping where you dont want him to jump, and not climbing a ledge/tree gap that is 100 climbable. But despite those problems the freerunning compared to AC 1 is very refined, and is continually being refind with every new AC titleThe game looks good and runs well too, havent run into crashes or serious FPS drops.Uplay gave me absolutelly no problems and works fine, kind of a useless program tho.No useful ways where to put your money, yes, you can buy decors and renovate your stupid house, but I pretty much had forgotten about the place, and It is pretty useless.As in every AC game you can meet a lot of historical personalities such as Cpt. Blackbeard or HornigoldThey still have a modern day subplot that kinda continues the Desmonds story  but not really, I personally dont care about the present day, they could have just dropped the whole modern day stuffAt anytime you can leave the animus and explore Abstergo building and hack stuff to get info about all kinds of stuff, so thats kinda neat, I guess, but as I said I dont care about the present.I have never liked the whole precursor race thing, couldnt they just made them to be simple aliens or something, would be more believable, but thats just me.Doesnt really feel like an AC game tho, because for the most part of the game youre just a pirate who stole an assassins robes and doesnt really give aabout Templar/Assassin war, you just want to get that cashNow, I have always liked AC, yes, its an annual well not anymore however franchise, but I love the freerunning and seeing different time periods and places. Some people say its getting too boring but I still love the games. And in TLDR I can say that ACIVBlack Flag Is a great game that feels like a game with AC mechanics set in AC world but really isnt an AC game, but will still be enjoyable If youre an AC fan or a newcomer to the series! Plus if you can get it on sale like I did 5 or 7 euros your getting your moneys worth!
