This game is awesome.  Imagine riding the pirates ride at disneyland over and over again, except with much more danger and combat.  Speaking of which, the boat combat is amazing.  Its challenging at first but once you get used to it, its a lot of fun.  It has the standard assassins creed bugs like running and then your character might decide to run up a wall instead of forward which causes you to lose someone youre running after, but still.  Its a fantastic title and I definitely recommend it to anyone.
