I love all the assassins creed franchise games, yes it does take a while to set up the uplay account but in the end it is worth it, although the other reviews say that it is a load of rubbish that it wont work and f ubisoft and stuff like that all you really need to do is find the right website and download the uplay luancher enter your code and sail the seas, one thing that i would dissaprove about this game is that, yes as most assassins creed games it is a bit repetative
