Would have like to have played this game, however my Uplay account from xbox has been suspended since it hasnt been used in so long, and I apparently cant create a new one as my IP had been banned from uplay for whatever reason.If theyre going to include their own DRM with these games they should at least make sure it works. Im getting a refund so its a loss of a sale to them. If you do decide to purchase, good luck.
