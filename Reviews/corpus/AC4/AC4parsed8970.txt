Black Flag is everything Assassins Creed 2 was and improves on it. Sailing and listening to shanties is one of my most favorite things to do. Theres also enemy ships to board, loot to steal, fortresses to destroy, and legendary ships to sink as well! Theres a lot of pirates in this game that dont exactly quite fit, and the story is a bit muddled at times. But if you can ignore that and the simplistic combat system, Blag Flag is a game worth playing, and keeping.
