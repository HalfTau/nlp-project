Good game, lots of similar missions to the previous assasins creed games but centres alot more boat combat and boat travel, has good graphics. Has NO DIFFICULTY, literally the whole game feels like you are just walking through a predicatble storyline with little excitement or plot twists. After so many assasins creed games you would think they would make it a little more difficult, sure turning off the HUD might make it harder but it merely makes it harder to find locations and objectives, it doesnt make combat or puzzles anymore difficult.
