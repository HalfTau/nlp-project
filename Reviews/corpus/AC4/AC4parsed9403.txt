Assassins Creed 4, one of Ubisofts flagship titles already named PS4s game of the year does not disappoint. A lot of bang for your buck here, epic storyline with fleshed out cities and islands to explore. Plenty of loot to plunder and enemy ships to battle.If that isnt enough add in a epic story following the adventures of a young Edward Kenway, and you have a great game. AC4 also includes a fully blown multiplayer game, both pvp and Coop Wolfpack modes.9/10
