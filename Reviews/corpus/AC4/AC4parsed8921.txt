Definatly recomend. This is the Pirate Game of modern times. If youve been wary of the AC series fear not as this game offers so much that it would stand on its own and the Assassin story line is just a cherry topping and cake made of awesome. Lets see.... Open World, Multiple persistant systems Hunting,Economy,Villa upgrades, ship upgrades, charecter progression Excellent naval combat at sea and includes an in depth boarding/fight system.  Exploration is big plus with dozens of islands to find and explore. Oah and Pirates! Played over 100 hrs and didnt do Everything. This game was a pleasent suprise, topping the previous AC games and working as wish fullfillment for those like me who still have nostalgia for games like Sid Miers Pirates!  A sure buy if you have the system to run it. A Quick note on that I havnt experience any performance issues with my 770 and run it almost at max god rays low but others have, so do some research if you are at the bottom end of the requirements. For those that arnt no worrys get Sailin!
