This game is the most badass pirate game that I have ever played. There were a few times where I got pulled away from what I was doing and had to wonder around some damned office building, but soon enough I was back to plundering ships. Id give it a 10/10, but this wasnt Skyrim, so Ill give it a 9/10. I cant wait until Black Flag 2 comes out.
