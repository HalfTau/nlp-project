I was one of the skeptics when I saw the first trailer for this game release. Another Assasins Creed so soon, and with pirates?! Ubisoft is cashing out with this one. I said. Oh sweet summer child, how little you knew.Well here I am now, and I rather like Pirates Creed. You arent even an assassin until the very end of the game but I was too busy sinking every merchant ship in the Carribbean to care. Theres a story with characters and events that happen, but to be frank all I can remember are the drunken pirates, Adewale saying HES A MONSTAH, the booty I stole and El Impoluto rising up out of the sea like a giant death whale and slamming into the side of my poor Jackdaw. I wouldnt want a second of my time back from Black Flag.
