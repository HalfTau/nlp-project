Overall, I really like this game.  There were a few kinks that they should fix though, like the full syncs were not in my full view all the time so then I would fail them just because I never knew I had them.  The storyline was much better than I thought.  I admit being on the hate train thinking that pirates arent the most historically best thing and why go back in time to do stuff.  After playing through the main storyline, I felt so attached to Pirate Assassins that I want to be one.  My Assassin pride has gone up after playing this.  I love the character of James Kidd.  The story was so complex and I loved it.  I felt all the sorrowful moments as if they were my own.  It is a game worth playing so many times over.  I know what cosplay I want to attempt next..   I also have to finish making hidden blades again too.
