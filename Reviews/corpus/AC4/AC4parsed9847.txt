Not only the best Assassins Creed entry since brotherhood, but an excellent pirate game in its own right. The story and characters are far and away the most welldone out of any of the previous ACs, and the open world aspects are substantial and engaging. While pirating itself is done well, fleet commanding leaves a lot to be desired, and the presentday sections in true AC fashion can feel like a distraction from the main game. Though there is not a huge incentive to explore many of the smaller islands outside of 100 completition, other side quests and city exploration make up for it.My biggest critique is that apart from optional objectives and quests where detection results in failure, stealth is rarely the best option. The combatwhile fluid and enjoyableis easy enough that Edward will have pretty much no problem with any group size as long as you are attentive. That said, the combat is very visceral and wellanimated, and enjoyable despite its lack of challenge.Overall, an excellent title and easily one of the best Assassins Creed games to date. The nonDesmond based story makes it ideal for new players entering the series as well.
