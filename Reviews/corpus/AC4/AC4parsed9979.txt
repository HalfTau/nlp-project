A great game that took most of the good aspects of Assassins Creed 3 and added an even bigger world to play around in, interesting character, as well as very neat voice acting and an awesome storyline.The only two bad things about the game is the many bugs and the fact that they have removed a lot of weapons, like the knife for example you now only have hidden blades, swords, guns and three blowpipe projectiles, but muskets and axes can be picked up from enemies, though not be active weapons as in AC3.
