Mostly enjoyed this game, better than other AC titles. Havent enjoyed a AC game this much since AC2.  Its mainly the ship combat, exploration and upgrades which make it stand out to the others. Has a decent story, characters and some fun main story missions. I wouldnt say it was perfect as it has the usual AC gamplay once on land. Has the same side quests and unlockables which was a abit boring, made me want to stay on the ship. In terms of peformace it runs okay not a great PC port and ran into a few gliches from time to time.Overall I wish they would of made this game a standalone pirate game without the whole assassins creed tag to it. The assassins creed part of it lets it down. That saying Id recommnd this game to people who havent played a AC game in a while as it serves something a little bit different with all the piratey things.
