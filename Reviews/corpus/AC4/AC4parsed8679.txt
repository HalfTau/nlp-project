Assasins Creed IV Black Flag was an enjoyable game. I felt that it has many similarities to Assassins Creed III with the land combat mechanics. The return of the rope dart was very enjoyable. I would have to say that the most impressive part of this game was the relative absence of loading screens. So often do you find yourself boarding a ship to steal its resources, cannibalize the ship, or send it to your fleet. There is no loading for the initial battle which adds a great deal of excitement as you come at full speed towards your enemy. The story was a bit of a stretch in connecting it all, but it proved to keep me interested. Though anti climactic at the ending, I found it to be very meaningful and introspective, as I do with all the games in the franchise. Bravo.
