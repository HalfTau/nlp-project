An Assassins Creed game that this time gives the player more. Youve got the same old combat that has been present in the series from the begining, but this time They made decent improvements from AC3s glitchy t. There are navel battles just like the miniquests from AC3, this time however you get to do them on the vast Carribean sea. The future story puts itself on the sidelines compared to its import in previous games, that, is a great thing though. The Animus story focuses more on Edward who is a very likable character much like Ezio.This is a pirate game made right, despite all that assassin mumbojumbo.RATE 8/10, Probably the only Assassins Creed game to date that is/was worth its 60 price tag, In Ubis long progession of ups and downs with this series...Black Flag is the only one that feels polished.
