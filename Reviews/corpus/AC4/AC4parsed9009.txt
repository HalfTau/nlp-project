As games go, its not badBUT and its a big but this game was not ready for release. Its as buggy as hell, and random crashes are pretty common.AC4BFSP.EXE has stopped working Is a regular occurance, either midway through, or stopping the game loading at all. This then mean a reboot as thish crashes Uplay  Steam as well.Id love to write a good review of this, but I cant play it for long enough, SO, if you want this, please think long and hard before parting with your hard earned cash, atleast until UBISOFT come up with a working patch
