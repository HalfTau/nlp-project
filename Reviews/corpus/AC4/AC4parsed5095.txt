Maybe this one was not the best Assassins Creed game , but it was still pretty good. The environment looks stunning, the sailing is a little fast, but who wants to spend weeks to reach the next quests destination?I liked the characters really much and the controls just worked for me.And for the completionists there is this huge world to sail and to collect manymany things, on land and on the water.Once I find the time I will play through this again.
