By far the best game of the series so far including unity. The naval mission have been improved and included and overall small tweaks made whih mean the game is much more interesting to play and you have a reason to go looking for all the collectables or activities. Negative points though combat is still simplistic with single button bashing attack although overall still interesting to a pointand following missions are boring. Still worth getting. Unless you hate sea shanties.
