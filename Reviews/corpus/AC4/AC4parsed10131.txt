I have been a fan of the Assasins Creed series for a long time, and by far this game is the best. Ubisoft has done a great job making the Carribean really feel like a living world where there are things actually taking place. Often you will see Spanish and English brigs and frigates duking it out for supremacy while also coming upon the occasional pirate doing their thing. It is a great improvement over the instanced battles in ACIII. What is also great fun is the story of how you, Blackbeard, and others are trying to build Nassau to be a great pirate republic. It really makes you side with the pirate cause. Whats more is that crafting is an actual thing in this game, crafting holsters and pouches for yourself from your basic hunting on secluded islands to whaling and sharking. Ubisoft has really hit this one out of the park, so definatly go pick this one up ASAP.
