It is fun. If you have played previous games, dont expect anything like that here. This is an entirely new game  you can think of it as GTA of sea. Thats it actually. Our Hero is such a great assassin he goes behind unsuspecting victim and kicks him down with his leg for rest of the world to see. Seriously.
