I bought only now AC BF but i would say i would really go back in time and buy it at Day one.I REALLY love pirate games, this one is Pirates  AC, and the mix blends very well I never get tired of finding a tresure or just plunder some ships.ProsImpressive GraphicFunnyMain quest is, almost always, funny and great to playPirates!Side quests are never too much boringI loved hunting whales, Animals and the minigames around.Really great ambientation.Controls also are OK, most of time you can control your char without any problem.ConsSome smaaaall glitches, but nothing gamebreaking.I think Ubisoft spawned too many chest  Animus Fragments around in the open world its a bit boring do 20km with boat per chest.AI of enemies is still toooooo dumb in many chasesId put something more in timed missions with fleet. Or at least made the secure the route a bit less boring to watch.So far it finally beats ACII that was my favourite till i started to play this. Great Plus for this game, for me it deserves all the money i spent on. Im also gonna buy the DLC after i end 100 this one.
