Okay so the open worldis pointless, as very few upgrades are required for mission completion. Story line was great, and if I were the type to cry, I would have. Very emotional at the end. Brilliant credits scene on completion, well worth watching.The music and overall soundtracks were very good, with a nice concept of collecting sea shanties. Visuals were pleasing yet still ran smooth. Multiplayer i didnt experiance, and side missions seemed pointless as you didnt need the rewards for upgrades for main missions. Very easy to avoid dangerous of difficult situations but overall deffinatly worth buying.7/10
