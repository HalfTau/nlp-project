After almost 3 years away from this game i install just for fun to replay some mission but to my big surprise the game have lost my old profile so i was smile from ear to ear when start all over again and man after 4 year since game come gfx still look wonderful and honest i still get that pirate feel and with voice act like Matt Ryan that is make voice to Edward Kenway it cant go wrong.So if you like pirate game this game for you even if you dont Assassins Creed game it still feel more like pirate game then a Assassins Creed game and this for sure the best Assassins Creed game Ubisoft have done.
