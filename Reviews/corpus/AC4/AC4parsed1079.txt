Assassins Clich 4... Yup that quite sums it all up... Story tries to pick up and move on with the saga and to my liking aint able to deliver. The game is glitchy as hell and instead of feeling assassingame is more like piratesimulator wich is fun at first, but becomes boring ckearance festival for completionists such as myself. You round up as a pirate captain among the most terrifying such as the Black beard and when the story as a pirate is comning to an end it shoves you the contrived assassinstory and fares thee well.As for the technical view game is glitchy, combats are basically buttonsmashing against four different types of enemies. You can buy the best swords right at the start and the best guns you get by completing naval contracts. Naval battles and ship hauling are fun and challenging at first, but soon you find yourself sinking all the lesser ships and focus on capturing lvl 60 manowars, while lunatically improving your own ship, so you can take on the legendary ships located on the four corners of the map.So how does it sum up? Switch your brains off and smash your way trough this Ubisoft obvious attempt on trying to revive the saga after the third game which in fact I enjoyed more than this..! and getting the most of the piratemainstreamfad after the success of Johnny Depps role in the Pirates of the Carribean saga!6/10
