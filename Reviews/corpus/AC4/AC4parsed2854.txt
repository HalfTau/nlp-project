i finished this game when it first hit the stores, back in my console days. I recently bought this again remembering good times, i now realise that in my first playthough i played in a far inferior way. i never really used the ship to its full extent, i played it like an Assassins Creed game, as opposed to a pirate game.This playthrough i got lost in sailing around for hours on end just to get some more materials to upgrade my ship, and by doing this be able to sail around more effectively. Whilst the game gives fans of the series the same AC formula in the land sequences the new ship sections gave new life to this game. I actually started to like the main character, as he made his journey from pirate to assassin.This game gave new life to the series, its only downfall is that its connected to the Assassins Creed license, i feel this wouldve benefited more by being a new IP.TLDR this game would be enjoyable for people of the AC games, and people who are just looking for a pirate experience. No one makes you do the main quest if you do not wish to do so. Youll just have to get through some AC mumbo Jumbo to unlock the full map.
