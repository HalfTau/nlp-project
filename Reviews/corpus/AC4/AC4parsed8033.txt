An extremely refreshing take on a series that takes little risks in changing its formula, AC IV Black Flag is the ultimate openworld pirate experience. Ubisoft continues to push the limit with its historical actionadventure genre, giving the player a solid main quest to follow while also distracting with a ton of ridiculously fun side quests. It caters to fans of the Assassins Creed series like myself, while also catering to plain fans of pirates. Its also one of the most gorgeous looking games available today. Buy it!
