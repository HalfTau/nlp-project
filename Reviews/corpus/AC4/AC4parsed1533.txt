Great game, yet the whole registering took me longer than the game did for me. Its ridiculous that a game like this requires all of the email confirmation. The multiplayer really hasnt got anything to offer, but if a game where you can actually captain a ship is what youre looking for, then itd be worth all the fuss it gets you.Edit This might be a part of steams troublesome bugs, but it is worth saying that when I just started my computer, the game had deinstalled. For some reason, it just wasnt installed anymore. I restarted my pc 5 times, no changes after or during this process. Beware that this is a ubisoft game.. And we all know that Ubisoft is worldwide known as a company that tends to overlook flaws in their games.
