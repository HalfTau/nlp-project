I would rate this game a 9/10. It runs smooth on my PC and I am running on old gear gtx 760. Not a single crash in the game either. Controls are great etc. If you like the other assasins creed games then i know you will like this. I found this better than assasins creed 3.The story as usual is quite good. Graphics and sound are even better. I really got immersed in the game play and found much empathy for the main character. I got about 64 hours of gameplay out of this, and then another hour or so out of Aveline. I am now playing Freedom Cry.Many side quests to do and lots to discover. The underwater diving is a good new addition to play.
