Assassins Creed IV is, so far, the best game in the franchise. It may seem like a normal pirate game, and while it may be it also shows aspects of the Templars and the Assassins, as well as tying it into actual history. Overall, everything runs fine. You get to see glimpses of the other games, such as SPOILERS AHEAD. The overall mobility style is a bit klunky, but thats the style that Assassins Creed runs on and shows off quite well. Theas a weapon seems a bit redundant, since you have your. I find that some memories are very vague on where to go, and it doesnt help with the fact that the camera is so far upthat you can see hemeroids and the tiny POV doesnt help.Evenw tih some of these issues, I fully enjoy the game even without windowed mode. And the edition of Uplay items, you get to amp up your weapons pretty early in the game.Final Thoughts 8/10   Could use with less stealth mission. Theyre a pain in theto do without being detected.
