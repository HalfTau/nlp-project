 Highlyrefined combat system Wellbalanced and nongimmicky sailing system Huge, meticulouslymade open world with few duplicate textures Potential for extremely good graphics if you have the hardware Good sound and voice acting Environment interaction is topnotch Missions are designed well and have a large variety Stealth is fun, challenging and diverse Memorable soundtrack Stunning visuals No triple buffering Uplay with its malevolent updates and other skullduggery HUD is tacky, distracting and too intrusive Combat is too easy and unchallenging stealth makes up for this Some aspects are copied from previous games without improvement Glitches of Titanic proportions excuse the pun Kenways Fleet minigame thing is horrible Too many cutscenes especially when doing sailing activitiesThe most refined and diverse Assassins Creed yet, however, if Ubisoft keeps improving each game in small increments and releasing every year or so, this series will turn stale very soon this has already happened according to some. Until then, this game is wellpolished and extensive and thus highly recommended.
