As an Assasins Creed game, its not bad. Now this is only in relation to the whole story going on in the present, and the whole  Assassins vs Templars takes a back seat for most of the main story when playing as Kenway. Which honestly works in the games favor.Its still fun to roam around the large settlements, doing side missions and collecting stuff which still is largely for achievements and challanges only, but the pages now unlock new songs your crew will sing. But the sailing, which youre going to be doing most of the time, is probably the most fun Ive had in a long while. Its fun to board ships and plunder them for their cargo, which is then sold and/or used to purchase upgrades. Its fun to explore islands and sunken shipwrecks though sharks are annoying. The only complaints I have are there arent many reasons to go back once you got 100 completion, if there were usergenerated assassination and naval missions thatd be pretty neat.My point being, I dont recommend this game just as an Assassins Creed game. I recommend this game as probably one of the best pirate games to recently be released. It is a mustown for those looking to play a game about pirates rather than zombies or whatever. If there ever is a pirate rpg game in the future and I certainly hope there will be, itll have to out do this game.
