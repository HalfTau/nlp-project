The story ranges from good to average. Decent for assassins creed standards, but nothing too great. As for the gameplay, one word REPETITIVE. Different variations of the missions with the same core. Tail some enemies, then kill them whether it is on a boat or on feet. Also the game forces you to grind boring side quests reminiscent to MMOs in order to upgrade your ship to progress through the story. If you enjoy this kind of thing, then go ahead, but if you are only in this for the story stay away.
