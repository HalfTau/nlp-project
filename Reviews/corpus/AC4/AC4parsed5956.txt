Launched game... Kickedas piratemofo. A crew member of mine started singing and since singing is for girls and the opera I lobotomized him on the deck actually I didnt cuz that aint allowed. I gave him a swift talking to.Great game for those who hate the Spanish and French so basically the English, and politically confused Americans. Its much better than III, primarily because I can get it above 24 fps. Which should have been easy considering my beast of a machine.Every so often the game makes you follow some pasty white guy and the game gets less good, but it quickly resumes the pirating. Im nontrademarked pirate of the caribbean Spack Jarrow!8.5/10 Would definitely play again if only to work out my resentment of colonialism.
