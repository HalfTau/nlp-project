Love. This. Game. I must admit that I only started playing AC seriously once Revelations came out, so no Im not some hardcore fan who has 100 hours on each game except for AC Brotherhood where they have 200. What I can tell you is, this is by far my favourite AC game so far. Honestly if you are into the sea and this certain time period and you have a bit of cash I would highly recommend it. For people who want to get into AC and just dont know where to start I would say there is no need to go all the way to AC 1 due to the fact the main story is completely new. So youll be just as surprised as all the other players.
