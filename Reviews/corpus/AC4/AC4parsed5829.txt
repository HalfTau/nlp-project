I love this game. Its one of my favorite ACs. In recent years the fourth sequels to games Like BF4 or Halo 4 sucked. But not AC IV, it redeemed the series and put AC back into the fight. This is the best AC other than II or any game with Ezio. Lets hope AC Victory can help the franchise back up again after the flop that was Unity.Assassins Creed IV Black Flag gets a 9/10
