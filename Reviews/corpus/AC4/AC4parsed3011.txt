VAGUE STORY SPOILERSContinually, in reviewing every successive Assassins Creed title, I write that they are full of content, atmosphere and potential, but ultimately mediocre in writing and mechanics.I usually note that there is one remarkable game out of the many games in the series. One that, like the others, is visually beautiful, possessing broad cityscapes and colorful vistas. Like the others, the game I refer to can boast of having plentiful content in a large world. Its also got a great atmosphere and a very complementary soundtrack, just like the other games.Unlike the others though, it has writing, story pacing and character development that is at least DECENT, more openended stealth mechanics and considerably more complex upgrade systems giving players more reason to keep playing and stay invested.Thats this game.I suppose, of course, that I must respond to the weak and feeble objection raised against this game that its Pirates Creed and not Assassins Creed, which is among the more inane and irrelevant criticisms leveled at a game in my recent memory.As if it were at all pertinent to the games overall quality  to its mechanics, to its storytelling, to the content offered  that it seemingly deviates from the other titles primary conflict, theme, and gameplay focus.In fairness, I grant that it WOULD be pertinent if you thought that the previous titles in the series, in their focus on the Assassins, on the templars, and the thrust of the gameplay being about these concepts, were anything particularly good, special, or even decent.If you thought that, and if you do, God help you then it would make sense that this game would seem like a departure from those things and not a building on or continuation of them.Unfortunately for this line of criticism though and like I mentioned at the outset, nearly all the titles in this franchise have terribly poor writing, characters, and storytelling. Additionally, the Assassin/Templar conflict was a totally vacuous and surprisingly weak central narrative. Further, the stealth gameplay was fairly constrained and linear up to this point.I really have no reason to go back through ACI  because its a nonfunctioning horrible mess of a game, or AC2/ACB/ACR as there arent many OTHER ways to go through the games or approach the situations given to the player.They all present the same atmosphere in the Assassins v Templar garbage and its NEVER, EVER been compelling or interesting except to the edgiest of teenagers and anonymoushopefuls.This game DARED to occasionally tell other stories, hear other characters, show and immerse us in different worlds, and surprisingly enough, it was leagues more interesting and compelling than any of the other titles. Admittedly, I find it hard NOT to get caught up in the whole pirate atmosphere and the image of being a fearsome scourge of the seas.However, apparently to some fans, this is a GRAVE, UNFORGIVABLE SIN. I hear this complaint often enough that I devoted this much to it, anyway, moving on.If youre going to leave an bbut muhh Ezio/Altair comment, just stop now  I dont care, bad characters, bad stories, atbest mediocre gamesMore often than not, this game is about a conflicted protagonist who, in seeking out riches, fame, fortune and comfort, ultimately loses people he cares about. In realizing the value of those he lost, his love for them, he comes to a greater sense of respect, care and regard for others and responsibility for the consequences of his own actions.THAT is a meaningful story with real potential to make me care, not the edgy, vapid t that constituted the narrative in the other titles.OH, and I dont have to listen to Desmonds stupid voice or look at his dumb face, so theres points already. Silent protagonist in an Abstergo office who goes around hacking his colleagues computers and forced by the janitor to do increasingly risky tasks, uncovering the conspiracy or whatever.Youre working there and going through Edwards memories under the pretense of developing an entertainment game based off his pirate stories. Its nothing fantastic, but is it better than Desmond and his band of losers? Does it makes relative sense? Yes!The story of assassins and templars is still there, but it is more of a sideshow, thank God, than in previous games, to the characters arc and development. At best, its a helpful vehicle, but only that, in telling Edwards story, instead of the other way around, like in previous titles.For the arc I just described to make sense, the game had to have characters that were sufficiently developed and fleshed out themselves, so that we could care about them, and surprisingly enough, the writers delivered.Moving on, the gameplay is split between the traditional content featured in previous titles  exploring the cities and countryside, jumping from rooftop to rooftop and assassinating targets on foot. The other half, though, is spent on your ship, which has a robust upgrade tree, sailing the high seas.Before we move on to the sailing, a note about the onfoot gameplay the player is given more options in managing crowds and guards, whether youre putting them to sleep, turning them against eachother or disabling their security, than in previous titles.Revelations had a bombcrafting system that allowed for these things to an extent, but it wasnt even remotely necessary to engage with, as the game was mindnumbingly easy and the bomb making was cumbersome.Here, the game is at least challenging enough until youve got a lot of upgrades that it pays to be a little more careful and think about your approach AND the game gives you easytouse tools for your situation. You know, like in an ACTUAL STEALTH GAME.Your ship controls really well, and the games system of ship levels, combat and different resources and items to collect, sell and use for upgrades makes for a whole world of deep gameplay that you can sink a lot of hours into. Your crew sing shanties, which are great and of which you can collect more floating around the cities to add to your collection and the atmosphere while youre sailing.Theres plenty of sunken treasure, upgrade plans, collectibles and large goals to work towards, all to be uncovered by exploring the large map, visiting islands and cities. Theres a LOT of content.This expansive world is a gorgeous, colorsaturated depiction of the Caribbean. Whats more to say about it? Its prettier than any of the previous titles in the series.If youre going to play an Assassins Creed game, this is it. This is the remarkable title in the series that stands out for being above average to excellent in all departments.I couldnt recommend it more.
