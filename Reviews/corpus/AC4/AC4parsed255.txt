It reminds me of The Witcher 3. Great visuals. Freedom of movement, good story... And oh, commanding a ship through the sea, with your crew chanting shanties... Im happy that although the stealth thing is present, it almost never prevents you from advancing in the story only in a few missions you HAVE to remain undiscovered at all costs  not really a fan of purely stealth. So this is an Assassins Creed game that I enjoy playing.Its awesome to board enemy ships by swinging from a rope from your own ship, while a Pirates of the Caribbeanstyle soundtrack plays on.Also, there are taverns in little settlements on little islands in the middle of the sea, where you can hear marvellous celtic folk songs while asking the bartender for information.If you are looking for a pirate simulator, look no further. This is it. Dont forget to catch as many shanties as you can.
