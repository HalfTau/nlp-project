I never bought into the hype around how much fun it was to sail around being a pirate but I must admit the enjoyment of it sort of snuck up on me. Between every destination you feel compelled to blow Spanish and British ships out of the water, just for the hell of it, or to upgrade your ship so as to wreak even more havoc! You can spend hours just sailing about ignoring the story and just doing pirate stuff  the controls are so simple yet effective and the naval combat is very satisfying.However the same cannot be said for the controls for the sneakystabby part of the game, which as always will have you throwing yourself into a crowd of enemies, or hurling yourself to your death off a cliff... However I did come back to play this after playing a lot of AC Unity, which  when it ran  had much MUCH better parkour controls so my view of this may be skewed Another handling problem came with the underwater missions, I cannot express my frustration at how irritating these sequences are with Steam appropriate language. Just trust me theyre a load of fudge.As for the story, Edward Kenway has one of the better story arcs in the series, and the modern day parts are minimal if a bit boring You do end up running around murdering and rescuing without really knowing what youre up too or it could be I forgot as I spent vast amounts  of time being a pirate between missions and objectives and people tend to die like flies just as they get interesting, but overall the evolution of Kenways character is satisfying.The game is solid and quite a lot of fun, I skimmed over a lot of little things like the amount of collectibles you actually want to collect sea shanties your crew will sing while you travel, treasure maps,... as well as how nice the game looks. I recommend it over most of the games in the series besides AC II, especially if its on sale. Freedom Cry is rather ok too, pick it up as a standalone if you want a taste of Black Flag without having to pay full price!
