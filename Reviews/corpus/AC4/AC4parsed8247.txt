The best in the series since Assassins Creed 2. This is mainly due to the setting and atmosphere. Black Flag manages to capture the feel of being a pirate of the Carribbean. The free roaming exploration and ship combat is much better than Assassins Creed 3. Definitely worth picking up but not at full price. I got mine from Amazon for half price, so keep an eye out for a good deal, and jump on it when you find one.
