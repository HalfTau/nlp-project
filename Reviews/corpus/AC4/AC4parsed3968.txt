Actually this is more like a pirate game than being assassins. I bought it for the beautiful Caribbean scenes, very satisfied with the quality of graphic and lifelike seaview. Furthermore, the complete world map encouraging players to explore every corner of the world by finding treasures, collecting animus fragments, and fishing.This is probably the best sea battle game I have ever played, impressed with smooth operation. If you do not like this type of works, then please reconsider before purchasing. Sea battle accounted for most of time in adventure.I recommend it. 10/10.Enjoy your pirate time with Edward Kenway.
