Ive only just started the game, and yes, it does look amazing! Truely! However, I also notice that compared to to AC3, the system requirements have suddenly shot through the roof. AC3 I ran easily on max detail, and now I have to put everything on low to get a decent and smooth framerate. ALso, during cinematics the sound isnt synched. This is very annoying and I wonder if this has to do with my system or if I need a patch or anything...Can anyone help this desperate AC fan?
