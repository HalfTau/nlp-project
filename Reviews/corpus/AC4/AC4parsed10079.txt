Assassins Creed crossed with Sid Meiers Pirates!  a mix that could have gone very wrong, yet works pretty well. Although were straying further away from the storytelling of Altair and Ezio, the storytelling and pacing gives a more fluid and sustained sense than what AC3 did for me which I never finished  contrary to its predecessor, AC4 clicks for me.Some of the graphical enhancements may be hard on midrange or older graphic cards, though, and stormy weather may have quite an impact on framerates. Also, I wish Ubisoft and Steam would come up with some sort of API that allowed to bridge their respective environments seamlessly  Im honestly not interested in building up yet another friends list on yet another publishers platform. Interoperability, please.Still, those few minor gripes dont detract from my enjoyment of the game, and I gladly give this one a big thumbs up.
