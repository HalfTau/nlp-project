Absolutely love AC4! For not ever having played an AC game, this is by far one of the best games I have played. The gameplay is phenomenal and I love how theres so much to do! If you love exploring you can take your time and explore each area. If you like to jump right into missions, theres plenty for you to do. Great graphics and storyline. 10 out of 10 stars
