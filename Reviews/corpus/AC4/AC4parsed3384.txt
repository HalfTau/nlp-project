This is hands down the best Assassins Creed to ever see the light of day. Not because its an Assassins Creed game but because it is an Assassins Creed game wrapped inside Pirate Simulator 2013. I liked Sid Meiers Pirates and this game takes the concept to a whole new level. There is SO much to do.Pros Sea battles You can board ships You can capture these ships and send them to your fleet You have a fleet which incorporates its own mini game. You can send our fleets ships to mission to gain resources and money but first you need to secure the trade routes by doing mini sea battles. You can go whaling and kill sharks You can explore islands from tiny to huge in size and kill the local fauna for resources. You can find things like smuggler dens and dive to sunken ships to find treasures and treasure maps.Correction You can assault several forts and if you manage to destroy them with your cannons you gain control over a section of the map, i. e. no more red zone and collectibles appear. Upgrade your ship Upgrade your characterNeutrals Tons of collectibles and unlockables. Love them or hate them... You need to progress the story to be able to do everything listed above.ConsAt its core its still an Assassins Creed game. That of course doesnt automatically make it bad, but Uplay Very sticky and at times sluggish ground movement. Your character constantly tries to grab on to or step on any possible thing he can find. Chasing something? Better jump on some random post and and squat for a few seconds instead of just running on the street like a normal person. As soon as you step foot onto any roof, you will be hunted by ten or more guards who want to stab, shoot and generally murder you in cold blood for...being on a roof. Silly bugs but nothing game breaking for me so far.
