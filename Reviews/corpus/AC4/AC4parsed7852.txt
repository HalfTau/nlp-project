9/10Graphics  10/10Gameplay  8/10Soundtrack  9/10Story  8/10Never been a fan of the Assassins creed franchise, always thought it was over rated with clunky controls.AC4 Black flag has changed my opinion. The gameplay is improved, yet the stealth gameplay is still not great imo.The game really shines in the pirating. They have taken the best elements of character progression from Far cry 3, excellent ship battles and places to conquer.In fact it is such an improvement over the last games, they could really have released this under a different franchise name.Runs well too, no crashes for me. 1600p with msaa, this game looks SWEET!Seriously, buy it.
