I am a sucker for pirates and raidings. This game would be the first game youd think off if you had to think of a pirate game. The naval combat is overall really fun. The legendaries ships give the game a nice challenge, but I wish there was more to the endgame. I enjoy the characters, but the story could be better. After maxing out your ship and finishing the naval and assassin contracts, there isnt much to do and Id wish there would be much more to explore other than collecting collectibles. Overall Id give this game a 9/10.
