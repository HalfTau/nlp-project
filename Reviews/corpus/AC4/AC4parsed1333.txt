This is not a review of the gameplay, since ive never experienced it.Ubisoft is a terrible company, and this is a pretty good game from what ive heard, ive still never played it since of issuesI just bought the game, and ive spent my entire day trying to fix it. I uninstalled it, reinstalled it, tried tons and tons of fixes, and none of them worked. Ubisoft really needs to work harder on their games so issues like these dont happen. Im about to get a refund, and im never buying from Ubisoft ever again.
