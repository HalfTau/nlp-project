I bought this game on sale 5th Feb 2016 and I imagine so did a lot of other people. Looks like a great game for a wet weekend for 4. Cannot get passed the Uplay account saying your games will appear hereCannot recommend a game I cannot play, will try again later however if it does not work I will expect a refund...This game has since worked and is a pleasure to play. Battling other ships for plunder is a great way to pass time. There is a storyline which if Im honest is not too memorable but the game is vast and enjoyable. Enough to change this review from a negative to a positive.
