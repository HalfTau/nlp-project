As far as big budget games are concerned Im way behind. I just recently started playing Black Flag and after the horrible, slow and boring ACIII this was just a breath of fresh air, even if it took many, many elements from the other AC games. But they also managed to improve on the more mediocre aspects this time, making it a solid game all around, and my favorite Assassins Creed game since Brotherhood which now comes second place.After some tweaking this game runs wonderful, at a solid 60fps. This game is just gorgeous. Man, rarely have I witnessed such a beautiful game. The water, the islands, the details. You have to see it in motion to truly appreciate it. Some of the faces, on the other hand, still need some work. Graphically speaking these are still the weakest, just like all the previous AC games.I think anyone has played an AC game before so they need no explanation as far as gameplay is concerned. There have been some changes this time, in a positive way. First, theres the sea, its open for exploration right from the beginning some side missions have to be unlocked first though, like diving. And second, the Abstergo/real life missions are short, which is a big improvement Id still like to see it entirely removed, however.Black Flag is a huge game. Completing the story will take roughly 2025 hours I think and doing literally everything can take anywhere between 75100 hours. It isbig. And its all very fun to do as well, partially thanks to the sunny setting which absolutely brightened my mood on dark, cloudy days. I wish I had the time to 100 it but my priorities are a bit different in comparison to most of the other gamers out there I like to finish as many games as possible.Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is back after the mediocre ACIII and its bigger and better than ever. I thought I was done with the franchise after the last couple of games but if Unity can even match this one Ill gladly take back those words.Rating 94/100
