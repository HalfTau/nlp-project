One of the most fun and addicting games Ive played this/last year. Theres so much to do and so much to upgrade. You can ugrade Edwards armor with a crafting system similar to FarCry 3. The Jackdaw can be ugraded from a merchant boat to be a beastly war machine. Or even a fishing boat can be upgraded to a full fledged whaling vessel. Hell, even your HQ can be fully upgraded. This stuff isnt cheap either, it costs lots of money and resorces to craft this stuff.The world is open and anything can happen while sailing, you could see a battle between Spanish and British ships, or find a Man o War crashlanded on a island with stranded British soldiers on it. Even find a sunken ship and dive for its gold and suplies, but beware of sharks.Ive been playing a liesurly playthrough of over 20 hours and havent beaten the story yet.To all of you that say EWWWW I GET 4550 FPS THIS GAME SUCKS! try playing it on console at 30 fps. Not fun.
