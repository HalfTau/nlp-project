AC3 was pretty bad.  Really turned me off of the AC franchise.However, AC4 is not getting enough love.  It might not just be my favorite AC game ever made, but one of my all around favorite games of the last few years.  By expanding on the ship mechanics theyve created a world far more grand in scope than in any AC game since AC2.  While Constantinople felt constrained, and the American northeast flat and had a wilderness that wasnt worth exploring once the hunting was done, AC4s varied locations are fresh and exploration is rewarded by both in game rewards and a vistas, interesting terrain and included secrets.You might have been turned off by AC3.  Dont let that prevent you from trying one of the best games of the year.
