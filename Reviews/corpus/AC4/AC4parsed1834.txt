Capn Kristo here,  Iwe got to say this game really suprised me as i wasent expecting much comming from AC2/3, But i can safely say this game is well worth the money. 8.9/10EDIT  Had small issue with Uplay on 2.01.2017EDIT  Changing score from 7/10 to 8.9/10EDIT  I really dont want this game to ever end... it really deserves a sequel.
