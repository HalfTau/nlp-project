This is the breath of fresh air that the Assassins Creed series needed. I wasnt able to finish Revelations because I had gotten so bored of Ezio and the standard gimmicks. Honestly, this game is better as a pirate game than an assassin game. Going around and raiding feels fantastic, and controlling your ship has satisfying weight to it. The game only gets boring when it becomes an Assassins Creed game again, but thats near the very end.
