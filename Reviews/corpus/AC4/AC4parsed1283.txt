Very amazing Pirate Game and the best Pirate Game so far!Unfortunately, this Game doesnt have an ONLINE Open World, which would be awesome!But the Singleplayer is Open World and has a very good Story Campaign!The Multiplayer in this Game sucks because its not Open World and there is no Naval Gameplay!What more can you expect from      f  ucking     Ubisoft?! They could have used the same Open World for the Multiplayer, as well! Ubisoft just       f  ucking    sucks!
