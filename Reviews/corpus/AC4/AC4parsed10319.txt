I was in two minds whether to get this after AC3  not sure if I would enjoy this new edition.  Really, really glad I gave it another chance.  The game feels more open worldly and the Companion App Android  Galaxy S2  syncs up nicely to be able to do fleet admin on the go.Edward Kenway is allot more charismatic than the miserable Im hard done by of Ratonhnhakton  AKA Connor AC3.Still putting time into this and will continue to do so in the future.  Awesome comeback.
