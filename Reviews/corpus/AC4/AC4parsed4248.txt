Black Flag is not really an Assasins Creed game. Its basically a pirates game with assasins outfits and hidden blades in which you plunder, murder, raid, spread chaos, defy the government and increase the power and resistance of your ship to sink even more efficiently fishing and merchant boats.Fruits of Eden, new global order, light versus darkness? Nah. Gold, rum and busty women are the goals of your life in this game. Also scuba diving, shark hunting and panther stabbing games in the always beauty waters and rainforests of the Caribbean.Its pretty cool if you like pirate games, I enjoyed this one a lot.
