This game is a decided change of pace from the other Assassins Creed games. And a big improvement over the disappointment and ridiculousness that was AC 3. So far, this game also has the best and most vivid graphics that I have seen. It takes a highend machine to run this game maxed. Luckily I recently installed an 8core processor, and I still have my Radeon 6970 ... 3yearsold but gets the job done, IMPRESSIVELY!
