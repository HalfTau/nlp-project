Start as a funny game that was following what many of us liked from the first four AC series but then start becoming boring and the ship missions, if you dont upgrade your fcking ship then everything start to suck, many stupid story scenes just to finally kill the Templars. Story doesnt make sense at all and then reveals from where Haytham from AC 3 comes, when I dont give a sht.Plus all that, I just played hoping to understand what happened to Juno after AC 3 ending but NO SHT WAS EXPLAINED, just a stupid scene of a fcking guy saying he loves her and then dying, so it was really a waste of time.Also there are some serious glitches, when you kill a person or an animal, sometimes the body start to move itself and then float and fell in other part. Also you can kill somebody but his body still standing up for you and also if you kill somebody, that you need to snatch, near a tier you will get fck because the body will dissapear and you wont be able to snatch the key or whatever you need to take.Thanks Ubisoft for a game with no plot at all, glitches and making me dont buying any AC game anymore because I feel like it will be more of the same. For fck sake
