This is the best Assassins Creed. Hands down. It drives boldly forward into the setting, tossing off the shackles and burdens of the franchise and declaring that now is a time for light, fun adventure, free of the nonsensical history holding the series back.By the end the game it is crawling on hands and knees to the finish line as it is crushed to death under the weight of said nonsensical history, because no one escapes their past.But its still good.
