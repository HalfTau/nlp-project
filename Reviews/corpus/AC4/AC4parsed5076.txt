One of the best AC games of all timepros great game play. boats. hunting is good. fighting feels good. very VERY hard.sneaking.cons the game makes you fight brigs with a schooner at the start with level 1 cannons. traveling. upgradereccomendations arent always accurate I played a mission but the game kept saying I should upgrade so i did but when I played it with maxed cannons it was easy and it still said i needed to upgrade9/10.
