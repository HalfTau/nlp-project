LOVE THIS GAME!Screw being an Assassin. Its all about getting your own boat and sailing on the open seas. I have spent countless hours sailing around and fighting the Spanish/English on the high seas. The land missions are simpy their to get your more kit for your ship.If your tired or bored of Assassin Creed games this is still worth picking up
