This game is different from most of the others within its franchise. Firstly, this game introduces a whole other aspect which could most likely deter you from the Main Quest itself.  This brings the ability to explore and create your own Pirate Ship and attack other ships, which brings a whole new world to the game.Some of the features you know before are still in the game, the Future, Flashing back to the past, etc. The story is of good quality, but the means to these stories are mudane at times, as they are in most of the previous series.I would reccomend this game, I would give it an 8.5/10.
