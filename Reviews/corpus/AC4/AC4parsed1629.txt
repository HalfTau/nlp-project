Assassins Creed Black Flag is probably the best Assasins Creed game that there is. The combat is the the fun, bloody, skilled fighting youve gotten used to through the previous games but with new weapons and gadgets to help make the experience fresh and updated. The storys ok, i mean its an assasins creed game, they basically all have the same campaign but with a different reskin each time. But hey, thats not why youre here, youre here for the boats. Probably the best thing ever to happen to the Assasins creed franchise, they made the entire game around the new, extremely fun mechanic of boating and pirating. The exploration and raiding youll do out on the open seas will keep you excited and busy for hours while also being intertwined with the story. This is what made this game better than all the others. So many people loved this part of the game so much, it just has to be a part of the newer games, rright guys? They wouldnt risk taking it away from the newer ones.
