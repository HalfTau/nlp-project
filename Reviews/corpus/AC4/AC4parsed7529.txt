Id love to recommend it if all you want to do is piracy. Of course its Ubisoft, cant really play it asis, have to run it as administrator or it wont save my games. Besides that though, just the story itself makes me never want to play it again. I cant really figure out a way to say why without spoiling things, but thats how it made me feel.
