Ive seriously enjoyed this Assassins Creed the most in terms of game play.Being a pirate is great and seeing how things play out in the game is really amazing. The attention to detail in this one was amazing. The story wasnt as good as ACII but Id put this pretty close. The game play is great and feels very refined. Playing the naval battles and still being able to sneak around and kill was amazing.Searching across all the islands for the unlockables is fantastic for a completionist like me and will keep me entertained for a while longer more.My only issue is an occasional bug that comes up where the game will lock on a single frame while sailing to a fort. The only way to solve this is turning on volumetric fog which makes sailing less enjoyable.Gameplay 10/10Music 10/10Story 8/10Controls 9/10
