The one and only gameBesides Legend of the Dragoon where I have tried so very hard to not speed through it. Where I try my hardest to explore every bit to get the most out of it. That is of course, until Im slammed into the Present Day storyline... in which case its a sprint to see how quick I can get out of that Bogus adventure and back into Piracy.Great, GREAT Game. With the Companion app, it really sinks the competition!
