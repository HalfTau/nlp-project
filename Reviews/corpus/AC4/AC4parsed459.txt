I was going into Black Flag not knowing what to expect, but so far Ive been enjoying my time in it. As a fan of pirate games, nothing has been able to hit the spot for a while, but this seems to do just that. Whether its the sword fights, the pirate ship battles, the looting, or the exploration, this strikes me as the perfect pirate game. When it comes to the elements of Assassins Creed, I believe the game would be better off without a few of those elements. While the free running is something I love in the series, I feel like this game could do without some stealth missons or trailing missions. Sure, thats what makes it an Assassins Creed game in the first place, but I feel like it just got stamped onto the product itself. While it follows the same storyline of Assassins Creed, that can easily be removed and the piratey content alone that I purchased the game for could probably be enough to sell the game on its own. The AC brand helped it gain publicity, but without it, I feel like there couldve been a lot more opportunites when making the game, rather than just being bound to follow some guidelines because its in the same franchise. Overall, Im enjoying the game for what it is so far and Im only writing this so I get the Steam Nomination badge.
