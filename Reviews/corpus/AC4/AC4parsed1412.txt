Oh boy, oh boy...At first, I really loved this game. It was nice and fresh new take on AC games with introduced sea battles, some new game mechanics and overall quality of the AC games.Kenway is a likeable character as well as others youll stumble in your quest for booty and rum.However...I cannot express how tedious, repetitive and BOOOOOOORING the looting is in this game. Ive spent 50 hours completing everything I possibly could, but nothing really mattered by the near end of the game. All the costumes, upgraded pirate ship and your hideout dont really matter that much. It helps you complete the game much easier, true, but getting to that point in a pain in theand absolutely not worth your time and effort.The most fun youll have is in naval battles, even tho they can be repetitive as well. The first time you sail out to the open sea and start exploring will be an amazing experience for newcomers, but by the end of the game it might unfortunately become boring and uninteresting to some.The game has only one ending, so my recommendation is to stick to the main story as much as possible. Its a blast and it shows by the quality and effort Ubisoft put into, but sidemissions and exploration is only for completionists and achievement hunters who have a need to complete every single game they play.If I could give it a mixed rating, I would. For now, Ill leave it positive cause its worth it for the main story and likeable characters, despite some problems you might face when playing this game.
