If you enjoyed the ship combat in AC3, this game is your safe haven. Although I wasnt particularly immersed in the game because I personally dont appreciate the ship combat, it is a decent game for some. Theoretically I would recommend the game exclusively to the people who liked the ship combat.However, I am not going to recommend this game because I did not like it. I play Assassins Creed for the urban cityscapes, and this game just didnt do that for me, in addition to having the ship combat that I did not like. I thoroughly regret buying it.
