Just to let you know where I was at when I purchased this game, I was sick to freaking death of the creed games and I thought if they dont do somthing to make this game stand out from all the rest then I am giving up on all future Assassins Creed games because they DONT CHANGE! but after playing this for a while I was plesently supprised by the ship portion of the game and it reminded by of Salty Dogs 2 Pirates of the Caribean. In fact id say I love the ship portion of the game. Besides that there is not much to say. Never made it far in the story because I spend all my time on the boat. Good game but I still dont think ill be buying another creed game unless they call it Salty Dogs 3 and take out all the monotony, alowing you to take over new ships.
