The best game of the series in my opinion! All the great aspects of Assassins Creed with the added fun factor of sailing a pirate ship on the seas and bording other ships.. what is not to like!?! I own this on PS4 as well as on PC as at the time my PC was not really much to write how about. Love this game and it is a permanant install on my system!
