This game by itself is great, when it works right. Not everyone likes the storyline, it breaks away from its predecessors and becomes much more individualized I personally like the change. Nothing more needs to be said. Beautiful at sea combat system and its what one would expect from any other AC game  Pirates.This is why I would not get this game for the PCIt is T T TT Terribly optimized. Currently running an I76700, GTX1070, and 16GB of RAM.Absolute Min. Settings5060FPS with staggered drops every few seconds, down to about 20 or 30Absolute Max. settings 5060FPS with more frequent staggered drops, down to about 20 or 30GPU/CPU never even heat up above 70C when playing common to see 85C when working full power. There is no fix to this, this is just the game, some people have luck with minor tweeks but there is simply no promise of better optimization for a game that should work fine.
