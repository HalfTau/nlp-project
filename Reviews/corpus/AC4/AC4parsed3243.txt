So 36 hours after purchase I lost 4 hours of game progress and now it will NOT Save. Which is a known issue since game came out and was never completely fixed. Im using Nvidia/Intel hardware, everthing is of quality. Out of 193 games in my library this is 3 that simply does not work.Cannot progress, its a broken game. Dont buy anything from Ubisoft/Uplay. I was fooled by the reviews and popular feedback. Dont believe it. We should know better but I thought maybe it would work... I mean common ... I Enjoyed it for the short while it worked but its poorly designed apparantly. Totally normal for Ubisoft btw.DO NOT PURCHASE OR YOU CAN EXPECT TO LOSE YOUR MONEY. It stopped working the next day after 9 hours of gameplay so I cant even refund this pile of trash.ITS A TRAP. RUN! Hide your PCs, Hide your wallets, theyre scamming everyone up in here.Ubisoft dont care at all if you can play. They got your money, good enough.PS Might be able to continue playing, still a broken game from a S company but I enjoy the boat combat too much. God I cant wait for a good pirate game. Avoid buying if you can.
