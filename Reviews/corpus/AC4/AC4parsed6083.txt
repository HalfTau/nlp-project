Just like reading a great book, You will feel slightly lost and sad once you reached the end.It leaves more marks in my thought than any other AC franchises, the great gameplay may be considered as the Best Sim Pirate Game ever made. Some still tedious to play, many repetitions, many nonnotable rewards but you will do it anyway for the sake of the currencies alone. Anyway I will recommend this game not only for AC players but also for any action gamer or people who like simple but noteworthy story.
