Immensely fun. Incredibly saddening. Amazing game by Ubisoft, definitely get this if youre into assassins creed. The ship not boat combat is immensely fun, hours of grinding dont feel too bad. Great story, great game mechanics, just very sad. 9/10 for the sometimes shaking during boarding combat making it difficult to target enemies. Again, great game.
