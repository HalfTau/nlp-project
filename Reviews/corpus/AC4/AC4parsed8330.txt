I bought this game primarilly because I liked the sea battles so much in AC3, But the sea battles arent as enjoyable in this gameThe game isnt terrible and if you are a AC fan like me you will probablly be able to look past these problems.The game is very repetative, I suppose you could say that about evey assassins creed game because many of the side missions are to capture templar hideouts or save a citizen. But this latest game multiplied the those feelings, Every battle you fight is only slightly different than the last, forts are identical with only slight differences in armor and cannons.If youre a hardcore AC fan than go for it, but I wasnt able to play halfway throught the game before I got bored with it.
