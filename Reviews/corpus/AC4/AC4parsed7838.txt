The universe in this opus is really vast and the possibility to leave ship directly to jump on an island really improves the open world ambiance and the new fishing and scuba diving experiment are really entertaining.There are some really idiotic aspects in the gameplay though and the overall concept is really underused in my point of view. For instance not being able to change your own ship when you capture other ones seems pretty asinine, side missions tends to become really repetitive and boring.Another important point  the game is highly unchallenging  once youve learnt the basic combo keystroke for parry or riposte youre nearly invincible even with dozens of ennemies, same for naval combats where you can see that your 50 guns brick didnt we diserve a 3 mast ship ? can sink a 120 Manofwar.And last but not least  the aspect of the ship is really awful when fully upgraded golden canons and blue hull. Not being able to control a 120 gun man of war ruined a part of the game for me.Regards
