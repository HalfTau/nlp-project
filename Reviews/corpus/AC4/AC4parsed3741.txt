Bought this game when it first came out and thoroughly enjoyed it. I even considered this as my all time favourite Assassins Creed game. But for some stupid reason, I cant launch the damn game anymore. Ive reinstalled both the game and Uplay countless times but it still wont launch.I would recommend this game if it would actually worked but now that you cant even launch the damn thing. I have to give it a thumbs down. Judgeing by many comments on both Steam and the games forum, it seems that Im not the only one with the problem so I do advise other people not to buy the game until this problem is fixed.
