One of the best AC games of all times. Especially if you loved the naval missions at AC3. If you are a fan of Sea Legends 1996 then you might like the naval part too The storyline is very smooth and involves quite a few plot twists. For the first time, you are not a nobel or a rebel, just a greedy pirate who seeks personal gain in every task. Perhaps one of the most impressive facts about this game is the map size, as in addition to the 3 large cities, you also have access to few dozen small towns/islands and entire sea map that you can travel to conquest ships of unlucky Brits or Spaniards. Though it is a pity that there are no Portugese, Dutch or French ships trespassing the Caribbean sea.On cons, you no longer have your recruits to fight for you, but there is a solid reaon for it  Major downside is the frame rate. Even on a powerful laptop, I have experienced occassional minor frame rate issues, so I would advise to purchase this game for a video console instead. In order to max out the graphics on a PC, I have set the environmental settings down to Medium and left the rest at High / Very High. Even though there were no visual bugs, I could not enjoy the small environmental details that would make this game absolutelly superb.Overall, the game is great and definatelly worth playing! However, Brotherhood remains my favourite game of the series
