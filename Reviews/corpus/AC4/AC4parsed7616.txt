The story line, action and HUGE open world exploration is the best Assassins Creed AC since the original.If i had to do it all over again, I would not have wasted money on the AC2  3. The AC franchise hit the mark with this one and redeemed their legacy. However in my opinion, there are still issues with the mechanics of game play and I would like to see better texturing. Regardless, if you enjoy sword fighting, ship combat, good plot/storyline, huge open world with hours of side mission activity, crafting, the list goes on... then I recommend this game.If youre more of a linear player, this game is NOT for you.
