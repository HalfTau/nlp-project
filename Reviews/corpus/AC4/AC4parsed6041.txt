EDIT 210115Just lost my save game for the SECOND time even though cloud save sync was off. Ubi shouldnt force crappy poorly written DRM on their customers. I feel somewhat ripped off. This is probably the last Ubi game I will buy in a long time. Shame though, game was goodI feel I need to rewrite this review again.So yeah, I am having a great time playing ACBF. Im loving the views, gameplay and the historical content. Seriously, Ive learned more about history playing the AC franchise than I have learned in class. Is it better than all its predecessors in gameplay? Yes. Graphically? Absolutely. Story? Not quite. I wouldnt say its worse though.The game does have its drawbacks. Or rather Drawback. Because theres only one Bloody UPlay. Its required to play and if itout which it inevitably will in time, youll be unable to play untill you spend some aggrevating hours reinstalling UPlay. I say hours because I also reinstalled AC thinking that would solve the problem... Which it didnt. So dont do that. EVER. That folder is pretty bulky.Moving along, I have also lost my savegame once. I dont think I have to elaborate who Im blaming here, since its pretty heavily implied.. Oh heck, I blame UPlay.PROs Looks bloody stunning Good gameplay most of the time Loving the naval battlesCONs UPlay UPlay UPlay Edward sometimesout, causing him to run up walls and do stupid stuff from time to time And UPlayGood game, but carries an unnecessary load on its back. 7/10
