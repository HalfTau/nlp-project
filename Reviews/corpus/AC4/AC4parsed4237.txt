The good news is it is a brilliant pirate game. The bad news is they got some animus on it DQuick edit  I am 20 hours in and have only touched the story enough to unlock all the ship upgrades.Think of Sid Meiers Pirates! having a love child with 2015 open world game. Then realise you can mostly ignore the generic open worldand just be a bloody awesome pirate DThe only really annoying parts are the future scifi sections so boring I almost miss Desmond, which is a big statement. Its trying to be subversive and have this subplot about a fictional video game company being a pack of evil wits. Too close to the truth to actually be funny in my opinion D
