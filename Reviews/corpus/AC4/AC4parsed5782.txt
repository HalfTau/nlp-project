Assassins Creed IV Black Flag PC Finished this over the weekend around 48 hours game time. Very good game especially with the expanded ship battles from ACIII. Beautiful game too, the setting was absolutely gorgeous, islands, jungles, under water caves all fantastic. Edward is my least favorite AC character so far, yes I much preferred Connors personality and story over Edwards. Ran great on PC with KB/M controls. I did have to use the D3DOverrider fix to get a solid 60FPS with everything maxed. Everyone knows the AC games so there is no need to go into details about gameplay however the lack of daggers really upset me, they have always been my weapons of choice in any AC game and they are completely nonexistent here BOOO. For those that like the Animus stuff I love it there are plenty of very cool tidbits of information if you go around hacking each machine. The possibilities for an AC game are endless and its awesome to think about where they could go with it. If you are an AC fan do not miss this game.
