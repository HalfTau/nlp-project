As the latest game in the Assassins Creed Series, the game has lots of improvements in its gameplay, including its open world experience. Great graphics, great naval gameplay, enough for you to play it for quite sometime. However, its story was not good and meaningful enough as compared to the previous games. This aside, this is a great game definitely worth getting if youre a guy who is interested in history and pirate games.Definitely recommending this  9/10
