I think this is the best Assassins Creed game yet, beautiful scenery and immersive story.When the objectives grind gets a little boring, freshen up and spend some time on the open seas to fight and plunder or go back to the real world for a bit.With always something to do or someplace to go, I recommend this for any action / adventurer.Played in eyefinity, the scenery really gets immersive, love it!
