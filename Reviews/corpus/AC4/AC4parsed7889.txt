Theres something about being a pirate, manning your own ship and plundering others at sea which is just so appealing. The story missions are OK but being a pirate roaming the seas really makes this game. Waiting for an MMO where I and my friends can be a crew, raid other ships, explore islands, protect our home town and rule the seas  CMON UBISOFT!!! !
