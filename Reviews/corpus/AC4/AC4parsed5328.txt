 Good graphics Ship Gameplay Extremely repetitive Open World and too big for it Horrible storyline, that is very often badly written and tries to imply a misplaced sense of depth and which contradicts heavily with your gameplay in the open world. Bad balancing  The controls are so bad, I have no words for them.  Only payed 12 on steam sale
