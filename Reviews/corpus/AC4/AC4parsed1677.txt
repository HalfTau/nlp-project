After 116 hours of gameplay, the game stopped working completely.It does not even launch  it runs for 2 seconds and then quits. Not even a black screen.After spending countless hours reading hundreds of forum posts and support tickets, uninstalling and reinstalling everything, rolling versions back and forth, changing file and folder compatibility modes and permissions, I am sad to say that NOTHING worked.Now what recommendations can I give you? please dont buy this game. It is a time bomb, and when it quits working, thats it.Youre on your own. Good luck.Id give this game one star because it worked for a while. But ZERO stars feels more appropriate now.
