After the cluster of badness 3 was I went into this fully expecting a  cashgrab. Boy was I proven wrong. Once you get into the FREE ROAM PIRATING which is almost immediatley the game really takes off. I loved it so much that I bought it. There are collectibles for days that keep me occupied for hours. Amazing game would buy again.
