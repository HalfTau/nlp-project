ACIV feels like a significant stepup in the AC franchise but also a few steps backward. Here the game shifts its premise to the open seas for the first time ever. The world is argubly the largest in an AC game so far but the various places arent that captivating and eventually, gets quite repetitve to explore.Above all, its the new game features thats what truly stands out, such as harpooning, underwater exploration and naval combat on the high seas.Perhaps of biggest significance, storywise, is that youre no longer playing as Desmond but just a random Abstergo employee. Theres much more to do in the presentday world this time round. Roam the linear Abstergo corridors and participate in boring hacking minigames to find out more on the present day happenings.On the other hand, the games main missions is where Im truly disappointed at. Many follow the same typical mission formula and this is worsened by an excessive amount of annoying tailing missions. Like all the complaints from past games werent enough, for some reason Ubisoft thought itd be a great idea to addtailing missions. Or did they just run out of mission ideas?Overall, I cant say that much of anything impressive of ACIV but the content it offered was satisfying enough, albeit the game still feels very incomplete, or to say, lacking in fullest potential and wasnt as enjoyable as I hoped.PROs Fascinating new setting Main mission constraints are no longer that much a pain in theunlike AC3s...but still sucks Interesting new features like whale/shark hunting and underwater exploration keeps things fresh...for a whileCONs Too many unnecessary tailing missions Locations can get pretty repetitive
