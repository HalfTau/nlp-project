This game is almost brilliant in all the ways it could possibly be! New revamped openworld, new colourful characters, good old gameplay mechanics as well as new ones  everything works out and everything suits thesaga. I am a bit disappointed that theres too much taken fromjust again, rather thanor. However, I enjoy the game and I sense its great potential for the rest of the season with all the DLC and sideactivites like.
