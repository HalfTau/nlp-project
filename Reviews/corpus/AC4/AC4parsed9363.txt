The writing in the main storyline is a bit tighter than some of the previous AC games. The sneaking, swordplay and pouncing remains constant, although less annoying than some of the Ezio saga.The shiptoship fighting feels better than I recall in AC3, which is good because its much more prominent. I attempted to avoid in in AC3  in AC4, it seemed more fun than pouncing on unsuspecting guards.Overall, very fun  its all about the shanties!
