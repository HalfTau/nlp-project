Nice expansion to the Assassins Creed universe. After playing Assassins Creed 3 and being disappointed with the story and shallow main character I can say this installment seems to put it back on track and opens up new possibilities for the AC universe. The only question left to ask is where and when the next game  if they make one  will take place. I wouldnt recommend this game at a price of 60 as the gameplay is almost identical to AC3 with more ship gameplay obviously.
