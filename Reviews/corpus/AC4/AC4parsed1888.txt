i was extremely excited when first picking up this title. it was going to be my first personal experience in the assasins creed series. i was ready to have some fun. and i did. for the first 2 hours or so. the game gets rather repetative rather fast. the only interesting part the story had to offer was the pirate ship part but the actual stealth aspect the game tries to give is lost on the fact that its really not nessasary. forcing a player to be stealth and giving them an ultimatum are 2 different things. i have trouble understanding how the series became popular after having played this. i come back to the pirate ship part of this game and have to say i cant recomend it because the only good game mechanic is ruined by the fact that most of the actual mechanics are locked by uninteresting story driven quests for annoying undeveloped characters. all in all i cannot recomend this game to someone looking for the assasins creed experience or anyone looking for a change to the assasins creed experience as it forces players to resort back to a worse version of the original games. still better then 3 though
