I would not recomend it , Graphics and story are very nice actualy excellent. However the physics of the battle ships and battles are horrible, embarassing.I thought this game is about OLD SAILING SHIPS not some supercharged 200 foot motor boats that turn on a dime and accelerate 0 t0 50 knots in 4 seconds. Please designers I am a blue  water sailor, do not insult my inteligence. Perhaps you should visit Naval Action game to learn about old sailing ships characteristics. I also understand that you try to make the game challenging, but this is just terrible,
