since ive started to play the game all the way through again ive played the game nonstop and ive allready completed the game for long time ago. the reason i love the game so much is because of i love the pirate thing with harpoon takeover enemy ships and just to make sure when ur own ship are fully upgraded its still not easy because after u have completed the main story then 4 legendary ships wil appear on each corner of the map. another thing about is that its not a game u complete on like 1224 hours there are very many outfits, weapons, guns and alot others and then realy big map forts to takeover, treasure, notes, fragments and alot others ill bet on 100 completion of the game will take about 50 hours maybe a little less maybe a little more
