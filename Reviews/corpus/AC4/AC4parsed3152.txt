Took me a few days to get this to run on my pc but I finally figured out all of the problems and it runs flawlessly now. If you cant launch the game set the compatibility to either Windows xp service pack 2 or Windows 95 to get the game to launch. After that you may experience major fps issues even on the lowest settings despite having a good rig. What I did to fix this was go into my Task Manager, go to the details tab, right click on Black Flag and click on set affinity and check All Processors. After that hit Ok and enjoy this amazing game.
