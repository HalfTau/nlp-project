So this time you play as a Heath Ledger looking guy who is emphatically not an assassin, even though he can do all the Assassin TM moves. I guess the lifetime of dedicated training is really just an optional pathwath to assassindom because learning how to sail a boat sorry, ship also seems to qualify.Anyway, BF is basically the only decent part i.e. the shipbased portions of ACIII stretched into a full game. The assassins creed elements are relatively sparse, allowing you to spend most of your time swashbucking on the high seas and ravaging booty.There is some attempt to tiein to the previous 3 titles, mostly via a welldone but choretoplay framing device where you are a nameless and voiceless participant in Abstergos entertainment branch. Its all very Meta while playing a game about pirates you are ostensibly helping Abstergo create a game about pirates. The subtext is that you are, of course, also helping a front company for the templars figure out how to control the human race. We get it Ubisoft, youre the templars, and yes, we will keeping buying your Assassins Creed games as long as you keep churning them out. Humanity be damned.
