Assassins Creed Black Flag is what AC3 should have been. Fun and visually beautiful.Edward Kenway is the second best assassin protagonist in terms of personality next to Ezio. Even after beating the main story, theres tons of activities to do and when everyones all complete, you can still continue pirating to your hearts content. Arr!
