As much as I want to recommend this game, I just cant. after completing 75 of the game I lost all my saves to a single crash. I reloaded the game and it told me all my saves are corrupt. What the  Ubisoft?  how can a crash corrupt ALL my saves. Also, Uplay lies when it says it synces your saves. Game play and story are good but it can all be lost so easily.Fix yourUbisoft
