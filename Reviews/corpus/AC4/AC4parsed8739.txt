This game has a lot going for it.  You play as a pirate of the Caribbean who doesnt really fit in with the Assassins or Templars.  He basically just does what he wants and what he wants is money and gold.  You command a ship around in a big open world with hardly any loading.  One of the things that I was amazed by is how you can essentially stop sailing a ship, jump into the ocean, swim to islands, and continue playing on foot with the standard Assassins Creed gameplay.  Fast travel has been improved greatly this game and is pretty much necessary as everything is so spread out.  One of the great things is each of the synchronization points become fast travel points and you can go to them immediately through the map menu.  You dont have to go to a fast travel point to fast travel.  Hunting and crafting makes its return and its way more fun.  They got rid of setting traps and bait.  Instead, you just shoot the animal with your gun and its over with.  Sword play is essentially the same as before.  Gun play has changed from the previous games I believe.  You can now control where you aim instead of auto locking.  If youre a fan of Assassins Creed and Sid Meiers Pirates, you will enjoy this game.
