Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is a good game. A couple of crashes but its worked fine for me even on an intel i3. The game is free roam and lets you explore the seven I think they have 7 seas seas. Also its a stealth game and I like stealth games exept when people notice you. Best part about it though is where the word pirates comes in. I really like pirates and and I really like this game. A double whammy. Only one con, the random capital letters in the subtitles.
