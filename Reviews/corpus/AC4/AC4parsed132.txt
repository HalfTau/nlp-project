A little backgroundIve played every Assassins Creed to date.  Started very early with AC1 for Xbox 360.Fastforward today, I hadnt installed AC4 until very recently because I thought that I wouldnt like it.  I say to you now  this game is the BEST AC game to date.  Naval combat, boarding semirealistic geography.  You can literally be a pirate of the caribbean in this game.  I also believe that this game has the best AC sountrack of all of the games.10 out of freaking 10.
