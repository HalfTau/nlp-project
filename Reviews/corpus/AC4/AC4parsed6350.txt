proper return to form for the series.Id venture to say this is as good as AC 2! It might even be better, but its still too early in the game for me to tell.Still though, so far, so fun!ProsGorgeous graphics, obviouslyEdward Kenway is as likeable as EzioRuns exceptionally well, if your rig can handle itSailing feels right a good balance of being fun and realisticStory is off to a good startThe setting and characters are an interesting mix of Spanish and English cultureFull controller supportDem navel battles though!Finding collectables is fun again! I really couldnt give a crap about the collectables in the games beyond 2, but now with a more improved waypoint system, and the fact that all the collectables are visible on the map from the beggining, its a matter of here, heres where it is, have fun getting to it! Also, they better contextualize the chase this collectable before it blows away stuff by actually giving you a reason to want to grab itAlso, finding treasure maps that you could follow to find buried treasure was a fun thematic addition!ConsUplayMenus can be a little overwhelming to navigate throughAbstergo/Animus stuff is dumb, distracting, and breaks the feel and flow of the game as a wholeUplayOpening chests and looting bodies is still finicky and slowCombat is simplistic and way too easyUplayAlso, and this is my main gripe with the game, the freerunning engine is starting to show its age, and hasnt had any real improvements from previous gamesRemoving the A button from freerunning and make it so you only have to hold RT to climb stuff was a dumb idea, and youll be grabbing onto things and climbing atop small ledges without meaning to when youre just trying to run normally. Previous games had it to where if you held RT, youd run, but you wouldnt actually grab onto stuff unless you held A with RT. It was intuitive and it made sense. They needlessly sreamlined it, and its a little to sticky.Looking past the cons, overall this is a great game. Cant say its worth the full asking price, as its still just more of the same for Assassins Creed, but theres enough new stuff here to call it worthwhile. Granted, its a full fledged, tirpleA release, so the 4060 pricetag is not unreasonable, theres plenty there to warrant that. But, if you can manage to grab on a Steam, Id definitely go for it!
