This is probably the best AC game Ive played so far. Previous titles made me uninstall them after a couple of hours but this one is absolutely solid and enjoyable experience. The story is interesting and has some unexpected plot twists. The whole pirate stuff is also nice and fun to do. Unfortunately the combat system is still about mashing two buttons until all your enemies are dead. Naval battles are better but with some upgrades your ship becomes way too powerful and even high ranked enemy ships cant stop you. Hunting is fun but when you got everything you need becomes useless. Graphics looks pretty and effects like smoke and fog are really well done.Overall AC IV is absolutely worth purchaising and speding your time among the carribean pirates.
