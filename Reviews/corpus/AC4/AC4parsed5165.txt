Recommended specs / My specsIntel Core i5 2400S  2.5 GHz / Intel Core i5 3570K  3.40GHz4 GB ram / 8 GB ramNvidia GeForce GTX 470 or AMD Radeon HD 5850 1024MB VRAM with Shader Model 5.0 or better / 2047MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670It runs absolutely horrible on my machine. The only way i can get something close to stable 60 fps with 1920x1080 is to have almost everything at the lowest settings and then everyone thing looks just plain awful and there is pop in everywhere.This is completely unacceptable for a machine that has no problem beating the recommended requirements. The game might be good though. Might be horrible as well. Will try it out whenever i get a new computer.
