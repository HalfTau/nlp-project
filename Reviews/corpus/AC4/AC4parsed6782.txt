The game is mechanically very good, in that you play the game for the gameplay not the story go to place A, to kill person B in a certain way C. The presentday story seems like a build up for the next game, and the story following Edward isnt like any other assassins not in a good way, his motives are only fleetingly aligned with the assassins, and without a driving goal or cause it makes the game even more tilted towards the gameplay and mechanics. That being said, its forgivable due to the gameplay being better than any other assassins creed game, and the game being tailored to the idea of freeroaming.
