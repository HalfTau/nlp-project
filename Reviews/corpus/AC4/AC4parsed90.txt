The one thing I hate most about games is cutscenes,  This game is almost as bad as tomb raider especially when the cutscenes determine the outcome of the game and I cant do anything about it.  For starters, 99 of the time Im thinking to myself during a cutscene Why the crap am I  just standing here as the enemy gets away?!?  2nd, how the crap does no one on my island not even see the enemy getting onto my island?   I do a little 10 minute mission, and then when Im done, my whole island is overrun with enemies.  I mean they have everything occupied!   Are all the people on my island blind?    Dont get me wrong, this game has to be the best pirates/ship battles game I have ever played.   But the cutscenes and the stupid chase scenes I feel like I have to do over and over ruin the game.  Hey, some people like that.  But some of us dont like a game that takes control of the character and makes him do what we dont want him to do.   Most of the time it makes my character stupid, and the enemy really strong.   Then when the cutscene is over, I just kill him... After he killed my friends.  Dont get me started on the chase missions.  Yeah, the missions that have everything break the instant you walk on it...  I realize they need to make the game a little longer,  but there is much better ways of doing that.   These are just my thoughts.  If you like this game great! But dont act like everyone should think like YOU if you leave a comment.
