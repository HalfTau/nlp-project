After sinking over 50 hours into ACIV, it is safe to say for me that is the best Assassins Creed game yet. It even is better than 2 and Brotherhood, which were neck and neck for the best one for a long time. The main story is very complex about Edward Kenways journey to become an Assassin and you get to witness how he evolves as a character It is easily the best Pirate game of all time and I hope they do more games with Edward Kenway as the main character as Kenway is probably my 2nd favorite assassin behind Ezio. Definitely recommend!
