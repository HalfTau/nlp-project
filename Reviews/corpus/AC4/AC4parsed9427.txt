As mainstream, bigbudget games go, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is probably about as good as it gets. Sure, the storys pretty soso and the currentday firstperson parts are rather unnecessary, but the main games ability to let the player loose in the 18thcentury Caribbean is something that no other game in recent memory has let you do.And boy, does it do it well. Sailling on a ship, exploring the seas, traveling to cities, whaling, diving for treasure, digging for treasure, shiptoship boardings, getting drunk at a bar and getting into a bar fight  its all here.Another aspect of this game that I thoroughly enjoyed was, surprisingly, Edward himself. His arc is compelling yet believable, particularly his relationship with the Assassins and the Templars. Considering that this is a game about piracy, about epic naval battles and assassinations, the way the game ends is touching and poignant. One could even argue that it was schmaltzy or cheesy, and others that it felt out of place these are criticisms that I cant necessarily disagree with. But in the end, I thought it worked, and that it showed restraint and maturity on the part of the developers.I cant recommend this game enough. As a recentlyfamous pirate once said, Bring me that horizon... Ubisoft brought the horizon to me, and then some. Drink up, me hearties.
