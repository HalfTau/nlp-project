So, bought this game in the Summer Sale 2017. Downloaded it, started it, runs like crap.My systemAMD Phenom II X4 945  3.0GHz12GB DDR3 RAMnVidia Geforce GTX 560TiWindows 10 Home 64BitFullHD resolution 1920x1080Wasnt able to hit 60FPS on lowest settings, despite my computer being at or very near recommended requirements.Tried everything, including a rather obscure Lockscreen trick i found on Kotaku. Nothing worked.That will teach me to buy a Ubisoft game.
