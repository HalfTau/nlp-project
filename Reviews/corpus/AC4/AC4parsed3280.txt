I really love the Assassins series. Always buy them to support the developers. In addition I already played the whole game on my PS3 I wanted it on my PC too, after a couple of years. I decided to buy the game and load in a savegame so I can roam around and stuff but it wont let me. Uplay is a little b!tch and I am a cry baby. Im going to refund this awesome game cause I got no other choice then download the game from a torrent site. 1 for Uplay. ... .
