On consoles, this is a pretty good game. But this is a really crummy PC port. Even once you jump through a bunch of hoops to overcome the horrible screen tearing and broken ingame Vsync, it still runs inexplicably poorly.Also, Uplay. I wasnt able to try the game for several hours after I downloaded and installed it, because of some Uplay issue. Double DRM shouldnt be a thing, and we really shouldnt support the companies who think its a good idea.
