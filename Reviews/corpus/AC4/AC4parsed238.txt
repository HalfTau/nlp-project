Most fun Ive ever had when playing an assassins creed game. Gorgeous graphics and water physics, fun naval combat, great combat and gripping story, from start to finish. Main character is well developed, and the modern sequences are, for once, fun and meaningful. Although, the main missions are pretty repetitive in terms of gameplay tailing missions especially, theres enough here to justify its full priced purchase, especially since you can get it for free on Uplay.
