The fps does not match up with voices in game, it runs slow and choppy making fighting unbarable and free running imposible. Ive googled this and alot of people are having lag, crashes and save issues untill this is fix the game is in an unplayable state. Please dont try and tell me its my pc, beacuse i built it to game and it runs high end games on max grafics with no fps issues and the likeness. When the issue is resolved i will gladly give it a 5/5 beause its beautiful and easy to pick up like all the rest of the ac games. Hard to put down fun to play  plz get a patch out on steam.
