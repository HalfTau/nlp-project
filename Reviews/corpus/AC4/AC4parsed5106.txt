I highly enjoy the AC series, though admittedly AC one and two just didnt hold my attention.  AC 3 I 100 finished and went into this game with high expectations, and OMG did it deliver.  The piracy and ship battles are sooo much fun, out of all the ACs Ive played so far this one is leaps and bounds the best.  Really wish it had a coop function, but story and gameplay are second to none others in the AC series!
