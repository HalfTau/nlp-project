The best Assassins Creed yet.The PC version from Ubisoft is absolutely stunning. In no way is this a simple port from a console version. Mouse support and graphical enhancements are top notch and make this feel like a true PC game. The attention to detail in this game scares me.Although this entry makes some drastic changes to the series formula, they are all for the best. The story is well written, the characters are interesting and varied and the gameplay is superb.Ship and land combat are very well done, and land traversal in the AC series is so far along now that it feels tighter and more responsive than ever.Every activity is enjoyable whether its finding treasure, hunting whales or simply the old assassination contract.I think everyone should play this game, if you lost interest after AC2 or though AC3 was lacking then I promise you will not be disappointed in this entry.Not only the best AC yet, but the best pirate game ever made.
