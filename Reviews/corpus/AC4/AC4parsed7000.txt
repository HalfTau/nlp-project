Without a doubt the best Assassins Creed since AC2. The simply massive open world in this game is littered with tons of things to do, from assassinations, to naval fort battles, to treasure hunts, to collecting sea shanties that your crew will actually sing. The naval combat from Assassins Creed 3 is back and in center stage for this one with a ton of fun new additions to make it even more fun and difficult. The best part, however, is without a doubt the story. Ubisoft managed to take a game about Pirates historys most notorious thugs and criminals, and make it one of the most heartwrenching and epic tales in a long time. The ending nearly had me in tears. It was that good.
