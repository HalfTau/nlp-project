Do not mind my 100 hours on Steam. Ive played it x3 longer than my hours shows.Bought it on steam because i used to love Assassins Creed Multiplayer gameplay since Brotherhood. Sadly this one is sucky my hairy puppyBut what is making me recommend this game ? ITS BEAUTY !We first played as a ship captain in AC III and Ubisoft gave it a go, thankfully!Revelations were my favourite game until i played this one. Black Flag is now my favourite in the series and its stunning world ambiance / graphics.Storyline  8.5/10Gameplay  9/10Graphics  10/10Multiplayer  6/10
