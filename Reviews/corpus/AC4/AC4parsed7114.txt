Definitely the best Assassins creed game since Brotherhood. The ship mechanics were a nice addition that it feels like a new game, without losing the feel of the franchise. On the downside, the combat mechanics are ridiculously easy. The game is not particularly hard, its actually pretty easy, especially if you dont try to achieve full synchronization. Overall a must buy if you like the franchise, but If you dont and youre looking for a challenge this is not the game for you.
