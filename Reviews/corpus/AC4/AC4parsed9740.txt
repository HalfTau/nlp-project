this is the best game in the series since ac 1 and ac2.  full freedom to do what you want. the gameplay is fluid and easy to learn and i have not encountered any glitches so far. well done!!!.  i have been an assassins creed fan since the beginning and have played each major release.  graphics are also amazing
