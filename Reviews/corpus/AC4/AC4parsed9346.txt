Fantastic game! Storyline keeps you eager to keep moving forward. Plenty to do, but the one thing that sets this game apart is the scenery. Graphically beautiful game! Sailing the ocean through a storm and riding the waves, or watching wahles jump out of the water as you sail by. Stunning to say the least. It has a few bugs here and there although dont take away from the game in the slighest. Overall Id give it a 9/10
