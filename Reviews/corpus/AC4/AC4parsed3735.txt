This game is so good. It has amazing ship combat, treasure, pirates, beautiful graphics. Its probably the best pirate game out there. Theres only one problem though...Its an assassins creed game.This game has so much potential, yet its constantly held back by assassins creeds terrible storyline. One minute youll find yourself looting and plundering, doing pirate stuff. The next youll find yourself thrown into this stupid assasins and templars abstergo storyline. Its horrible. Not to mention every 2 missions is some sort of follow this guy without being detected or sneak around these guys without being detected quest. Its such a huge change of pace, going from taking a fort or fighting off enemy ships in a hurricane to sneaking around people slowly or following some guy through the street.Slowly. I know I should have expected this considering this IS an assassins creed game, but it bothers me to see a game this fun wasted on a series im not too fond of. They should have just ditched the assassins on this one and ditch UPlay too while theyre at itThat being said, if you dont mind the occasional stealth missions here and there, this is an amazing game that i would highly reccomend, despite how much i complain about it. It has a huge game world which you can roam around freely, great combat, both on and off the ship and stunning graphics.
