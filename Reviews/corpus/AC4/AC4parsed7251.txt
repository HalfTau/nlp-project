Surprisingly, the best game in the series. The plot is interesting, but more importantly the team has managed to make every activity fun. The overworld map is very useful for hunting down collectibles, and the rewards for completionism are although unnecessary well worthwile.It gives me great hope for Liberation after being very disappointed with AC3.
