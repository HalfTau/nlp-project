 Graphics The graphics are good could have been better but still good. 3,5/5 Sound The sound is awesome. I really like the singing when you are sailing. 5/5 Gameplay The gameplay are really good, the battles both with swords and in your ship are awesome. The storyline is also good. 4,5/5 Other stuff The difficulty is good, not to hard and not to easy. Theres a lot to do in the game so you can play it for a while. 4/5Total score 17/20Its a good game but then we have a problem, as many people probably know the game crashes and your save files gets deleted which not are good. I havent even completed the storyline thanks to that. So if you want to buy this game, you should have that in mind.
