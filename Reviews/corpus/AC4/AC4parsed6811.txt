Though I want to recommend this game... I just cant. It is close, if Steam had a Meh choice in between yes and no Id choose it. Basically it breaks down like thisThe Good It is a pirate game.The Bad It is an Assassins Creed game.It is very clear they intended to make a nice pirate game where you got to play boats, plunder cargo, murder dudes, and generally have a good time. A modern incarnation of the classic Sid Meyers Pirates game. However Ubisoft decided that we wouldnt buy something if it wasnt in an existing series and so tried to shoehorn it in to the Assassins Creed universe and glomed on a buch of stuff that makes it worse.The result is you have lots of fun when the game lets you. When it lets you off the leash and you get to go play with your ship, its great. However that gets interfered with regularly for Assassins Creed garbage including the dreaded Follow the guy but dont get too close! missions, which now you get to do in your ship as well. You are continually having to deal with annoying missions to forward the story and get to play more.Also the PC port has horrible optimization. I have a 5930K and a 980GTX and it still struggles to maintain 1080  60fps with details turned up. Give me a break. I mean it looks good, but it should run far better, it is just more Ubisoft laziness on the optimization front.So while I dont hate it, I wouldnt recommend it. If it goes on sale for a real cheap price, then sure maybe get it. However get yourself a trainer for it too, so that when you get frustrated with the stupid AC stuff you can just cheat your way by it and get back to being a pirate.Its sad, because without the AC content, this would be a pretty amazing game. As it is, the annoyance dampens the fun factor a whole lot.
