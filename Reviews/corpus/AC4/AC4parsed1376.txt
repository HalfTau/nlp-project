TLDRPirates Creed  refreshing and funAssassins Creed  stagnant and boringNote I planned on adding my first impressions video to this review but Valve censored the link for containing the letters F V C and K! So instead, heres a dumb montage video of some of the glitches I came across during my play through.By the third Ezio game I was suffering AssCreed fatigue and I quickly gave up on it. Id played the two previous games in fairly quick succession but the similarities in Revelations were glaringly obvious by that point and I just couldnt bring myself to continue. Even the lure of the wonderful architecture and the likeable protagonist couldnt draw me back to yet another game with repetitive side missions, numerous pointless collectables and stylish but shallow combat.Also, tailing missions.  tailing missions.AssCreed III never really appealed to me because of the historical setting and I only played a little of it. That game had a dull protagonist and a dull setting with the architecture of 18th century America not matching up to what Europe had to offer at the time. This diluted the parkour, the one gameplay mechanic that might have kept me playing for longer.This is all a big preamble to me saying that Assassins Creed IV bought some of the fun back to the franchise for me, by making pirate ships a new core mechanic. The sailing and naval combat are a big part of the game and its good, arcadey fun. It also helps that the protagonist is fairly likeable, in a roguish kind of way ala Ezio.Anything outside of the being a pirate stuff is the same oldCreed worse in some cases and it gets boring quickly, but the piracy setting and gameplay additions are enough for a recommendation.On a final note,  U Uplay.
