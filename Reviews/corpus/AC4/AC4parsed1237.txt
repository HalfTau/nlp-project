If the game is crashing consistently on you, it is due to problems between the local pen tablet service and an audio .dll not working well together. For more info on how to fix this, please check this outI had originally recommended against purchasing the game due to consistent crashing issues see above and the game consistently launching to a black screen. The latter was a simple quirk with my specific type of monitor Dell U2414H, where the game launches and the display cuts out. A simple power cycle on the monitor fixes it. Its an annoyance, but a minor one, and obviously not the games fault.Once I have put more time into the game, Ill try to remember to come back and write a review about the software itself.
