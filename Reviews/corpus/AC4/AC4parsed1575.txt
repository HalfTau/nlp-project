Such a great game.  Edward is fun to play, even if he is a putz, and the characters are all interesting as they come into and out of the story.  This game does have the same issue that other AC games have had of meeting EVERY famous person from that region and time, but that is not to bad as you have a lot to do outside of the plot that you dont notice it if you are not burning through the game.  The ship combat is smooth and finished compared to AC3 and it is easy to see why it grew so popular.  Generally a great game.
