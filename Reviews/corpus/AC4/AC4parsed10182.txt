Amazing game, one of the best Assassins Creeds yet. It takes all of the bad parts of Assassins Creed III, and either gets rid of them or changes them for the better. Tons of game play, 36 hours hasnt even gotten me halfway through the game. sometimes it is fun to just roam around the seas pirating and discovering the crazy amount of explorable islands. crazy good game.
