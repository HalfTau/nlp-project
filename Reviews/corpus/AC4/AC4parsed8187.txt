Assassins Creed IV could be called Pirate Simulator, and the naming would still be correct. Surprisingly though, this is not a bad thing, and perhaps contributes to it being one of the better game in the Assassins creed series. With more focus on Edward Kenway and his pirate crew than the assassin group, this game seems to trail away from the main point of the series, however it still presents more than 40 hours of enjoyable gameplay.9/10. Would play again.
