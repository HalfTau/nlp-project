I dont know what was I thinking  purchasing a Ubisoft game. Damn these summer sales and your irresistable discounts! Huge fps drops from the first moment into the game and then it crashes consintently at a point 50 min into the game. Basically unplayable. Will be getting a refund. Recommend to stay away from this broken garbage.
