Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag really brings back the glory to the Assassins Creed series, as Revelations and AC3, somewhat let us down. In the beginning however, we had a bit of a rough patch with some players such as losing Saved games, and hours of play time spent. With constant updates, it shows Ubisoft still cares about its PC gamer community Optimization being another topic for the most part. Now, optimization isnt much of an issue to me, as my Rig is pretty powerful, but for others whom dont have this, its a real pain, as you have to play on the lowest of low sometimes, just to get a decent frame rate. Even with some of these cons though, its a really quite beautiful game. It brings the best of both worlds, Pirates and Assassins, with the occasional Templar. Now not to spoil anything from AC3, but in this one you may be confused as you play you, in the beginning and not Desmond. This to me is a really great aspect of the game, as you get to be yourself. Now, dont take this as you get to customize how your real life character looks because you cant, I just find it different, and kind of nice for a change. Just like Ezio, even though he was great, it was time to move on after 34 titles with him in it. Overall however, this game is a great buy. If you have a decent gaming PC, make sure to give this a go. Final Score would be 8.7/10
