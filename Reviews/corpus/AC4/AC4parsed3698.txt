so i just bought the game and whenever i launch it says AC4BF.exe has stopped working and then closes it before i even get to the title screen i love this game and have played and beeaten on the xbox and i wanted to play it again on the pc but i cant even get it to launch. ive tried other AC games and they all work fine this is the only game that does it.
