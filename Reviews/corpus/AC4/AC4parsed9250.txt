I would highly recommened this game to anyone that is/was a fan of the previous Assassins Creed games, though my copy got revoked and have to buy a new one just to continue playingI cant speak for the multiplayer yet but the singleplayer is absolutely beautiful and runs like a charm on my system in comparison to Assassins Creed 3 that still struggles in some areas
