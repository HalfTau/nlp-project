Game sucks, out of everything I have ever played this is the only one that doesnt work. It did for the first three days, for over 30 hours of play time. Then poof, the only game to ever keep crashing on me with no fix. I dont mean the I can play and it crashes, I mean the it crashes even before the menu. Never even got to touch multiplayer. So make sure you have a beefy computer, or it just might not work.
