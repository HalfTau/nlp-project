I liked this multiplatform game. I am impressed by the amount of polish the developers put on this game. The controls work very well on a keyboardmouse configuration. I didnt play any of its predecessors before, so I dont care about how it veers away from the previous games. The story is good. The sailing and ship combat was some arcadestyle fun. The graphics are impressive. After the main story is complete, you can wait for the credits to finish and then keep playing the open world. Its not nearly as thick with side quests as Skyrim, but its good.
