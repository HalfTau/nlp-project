Being a fan of the Assasins Creed series since the first one , I will find it hard not recommending this game.Random thoughts avoiding spoilersI dont like pirate thems in moives or games in general, but somehow it worked for me in this game.The new assasin in this game , Edward, is different from the other assassin we met in the previous games. The present day story ended in the last game in a way that made me want to know more about what happend, I was dissappointed  how in this game they shifted , I hope it is a build up so they give us more in upcoming games. so dont expect much when it comes to this part.
