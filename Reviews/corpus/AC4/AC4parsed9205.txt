This is hands down one of the best games I have ever played. Not only are the graphics and gameplay amazing, but the content as well. Every way you turn you Jackdaw there is something to do, be it capturing forts, sinking other ships, discovering islands and cities, or just chasing collectibles, these things make it seem like you could play forever. And who doesnt like that a game they like can go on and on? I finished it with 65 hours of gameplay. I havent finished all the collectibles and achievements, and I havent even touched on multiplayer. I have a feeling this game can easily go to 100 hours of playable content. This game is a must buy.
