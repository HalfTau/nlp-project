I played this game for 5 hours straight yesterday, and I almost never do that. Theres always something to do. You can do story missions until youre bored of them, then do ship combat until youre bored of that, and then you can do side stuff, and by the time youre bored of that you wont be bored of story missions, and it loops until you realize that its a lot darker out now than when you started.Its also dripping in piratey atmosphere, particularly in the music and the sea shanties your crew sing when sailing, which you can get more of by finding and chasing down floating sheets on land. The best part is that you can swing onto an enemy ship, jump onto and stab one guy, then shoot four other guys with your full complement of four pistols, then bam, you have the ship.In short, get this game if you ever wanted to be a pirae, because this is probably the closes you can get.
