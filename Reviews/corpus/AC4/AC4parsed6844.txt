This has got to be the greatest AC game made yet. It improved combet melee and Naval, had a good story of a man trying to understand what it really means to have faith in your own beliefs and ambitions, and the character was someone I personally had a level of connection to. Connor, I think, got a bad rap even though he was an OK character, yeah he was dull but if you just saw your hole town get burned and your only family killed in front of you then how do you think you would end up? BUT anyway, AC4 really improved the fault of AC3 in my opinion and has been ranked my favorite AC game in the series.
