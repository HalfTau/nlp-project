Dont buy. Like many other players, game freezes and I cannot progress despite the constant rituals to get it up and running for 320 minutes at a time.The game is fun, but PC integration seemed like an afterthought. If you really want it, buy the console version.As for me, Im done wasting my money no more Ubisoft purchases.
