Oh lord, whats there to say? The saga continues with another fantastic addition. The naval combat is superb, and the open world feel from FarCry 3 is extracted, refined, and incorporated into this edition of the franchise.

Any scallywag would feel at home ramming innocent and not so innocent ships on the open sea in this wonderful addition to the Assassins Creed saga.And, the twist on the Animus perspective is brilliantly done. If only it were real life
