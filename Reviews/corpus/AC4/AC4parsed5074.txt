The game mechanics are similar to the previous episode, Assissin Creed 3. Unfortunaly, the story telling has not impressed me like the previous episodes with the resulting effect that sometimes i felt bored playing the game. Moreover, I suggest to dont play the game due a really nasty bug that can happen. The bug deletes all your game progress, this happen to me when i was at 70  of the game. Looking around on internet i found that this bug happens to other people at random points of the game and support has not help in anyway on this problem. So.. buy it at your own risk.
