I have been a fan of the Assasins Creed games since the start.Sadly I had not much time to play them.Anyway recently catching up with the games, non of the others seemed to have captured the magic of the first game.not for me anyway.But for some reason this one does. Black Flag in my opinion is a brilliant edition to the AC games.I definately reccomend this to anyone,But more importantly to those who felt the others had lost that touch and want to re kindle their love of Assasins Creed.7 out of 10.
