Let me start off by saying that i am a huge fan of the assassins creed series. The beginning of this while pretty cool is kind of confusing at first even for a long time fan of the series like myself. Once you get passed that though this game is definitely well worth the time spent playing it as its both fun, and exciting combat wise being that there are surprises around every turn with surprisingly multiple ways to actually complete a task.The naval combat of this game is actually pretty fierce at times and the ground combat animations are surprisingly seamlessly blended together for the most part.I have noticed some drawbacks though. Some of the animations and graphics stutter and it does have its boring moments.All in all though i would definitely recommend playing this one as it is pretty good.
