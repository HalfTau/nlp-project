This gmae, man. The best ac title yet! But be vary, you really new a nice rig too run it. I upgade my old fx 8120 to an intel 4770k becuase on the fx i would only get 1520 frames, now i get 60 but these game should not be that demanding. If you a fan of ac2 but not 3 then you will really enjoy this game. It is set up mostly how 2 was plus awesome naval battles! The story is prett y good in this one to, especially compared to 3s aweful story.
