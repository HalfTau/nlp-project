For those not familiar with the franchise of Assassins Creed, there is a big storyline behind every single game. After purchasing this game, I highly recommend you play the Assassins Creed 3 and Assassins Creed Rogue, When you have played all these games the storyline would make more sense. But for this game review, personally I have enjoyed this game, the game can be rather boring at sometimes, but it still motivates you to come back and kill some more templars Templars are the bad guys This story goes on about a pirate named Edward Kenway, who adopted the Assassins life, However this game can be drawn to take you away from the Assassins life, and play more as a pirate. There are ship battles which are amazing, but they can be frustating as some point. The combat is ok, to a simple counter an opponents attack them kill them. There is also a multiplayer. The mutiplayer is also very fun, but it can be very hard to find a game, unless you can play with your friends. This game would also need a Uplay account. Overall this game is very fun, and is very unique from any other Assassins creed game you have ever played, So I recommend this game, because you will not regret, well maybe when you finish the game, you probably will regret it.
