Holy heck this game is fantastic. Ive played AC2 and thouroghly enjoyed it. Not only because of the gameplay and the historic setting but the fact that there is so much to do. Ive only played 18hrs and apparantely Im only 8 through. Basically Ive collected everything in the city of Havana. chests, Shamties, Contracts, etc. And not even started sequence 2 yet. If only AC3 kept my interest as much as this one.Anyway The reviews are right this game is so well done and was worth the 10 I got from the winter sale. I wouldnt have bought if it wasnt 75 off.
