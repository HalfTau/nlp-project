I highly recommend this game, although Ive only played 28 hours so far and still havent nearly completed it, I have had a lot of fun. The primary reason I say this is that its essentially the old Sid Meiers Pirates game which I very much enjoyed, except done up with Assassins Creeds plot and better graphics, as well as much more entertaining ship and boarding combat. On a macro scale its similar as well you cruise around the Caribbean at your own free will depending on which way the wind is blowing, and are free to visit towns and cities to repair, rearm and upgrade your ship and your character  Edward Kenway, you can raid and capture European forts which provide mercenary contracts, insiders whom you may pay off to lower your bounty from either Britain or Spain, and a shipwright, who again can repair, rearm and upgrade your ship  the Jackdaw. The one thing which in my opinion is the heart of the game is the fact that you can simply sail around fighting, boarding and capturing European schooners, galleons, frigates and manowars, all of which have lucrative rewards for those in need of cash. This is highly entertaining and I havent found myself getting board of this particular mechanic once yet.I will also add that the creators at Ubisoft have not optimised this game for PC, and in fact stated they simply didnt care to do so for this title. As such, expect it to run quite a bit worse than Assassins Creed III, even if you played both on the medium graphical preset. Allinall, and considering it took Ubisoft a rushed year to get this game out as they will be doing from now on with all subsequent games in the franchise, Id recommend anyone to buy this game, even if youre not previously a fan of the A.C. series.
