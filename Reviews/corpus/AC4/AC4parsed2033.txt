without a doubt the best pirate game ive ever played it is still assassins creed on land but at sea it changes into an fun and suspensfull pirate adventure . the characters are memorable and fun,the soundtrack is soooo fitting and good the combat is excellent especially at sea the game can be a little tedious at times for example there are stealth missions that forbidd being spotted wich can be tedious when there are like 858658567568 enemies around you va and vsync is really well donethere are some glitches like the jackdaw apearrantly becoming the flying dutch man and rising from the bottom of the seaport / multiplayer while really fun does kinda lack singleplayer coop . however this game is certainly worth the asking price and if you are a fan of pirates youll love this game .Verdict 10/10
