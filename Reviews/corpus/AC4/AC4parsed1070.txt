I am a huge fan of Black Flag  I highly recommend it, even with the rare bug/unskippable actionless cutscenes once in awhile.I am not a huge fan of the Assassians Creed series, which I hope makes the recommendation even more meaningful.If youre looking for an assassian/pirate/open seas video game, this can really scratch the itch.
