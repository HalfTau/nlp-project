Quite possibly the best installment in the series, barring Origins which I havent played yet. Sure, Unity and Syndicate improved on some things here and there, but this one has pirates. Pirates, man! You cant pass that up. Not to mention, its relaxing as hell to just cruise around on your ship and listen to your crew belt out shanties. Beyond that, the other chunks of the game are formulaic AC rehashes  climb the tower, icon splooge on your map, go clear up the map, run the missions, next map  but the piracy part makes up for those shortcomings. Get the basic version on sale, and youll thank yourself for it.
