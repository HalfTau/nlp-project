Loved the game, Has very good storyline yet feels a little rushed at the point when the main char actually starts to act like a human should.There is little to this game that i hated, one is that black beard was killed off way to early and second is Ship it self, you should have been given 2 to 3 ships that you could have changed between and customize and on that point third thing that i hated was that the ship has way to few customizations.Lastly i have to say, EVERYONE has to play through this game!
