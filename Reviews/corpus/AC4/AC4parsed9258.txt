WOW the best AC game yet.  This game is epic, there is SO much content. The first time you take down a legendary ship is very exciting. The story is epic, and really compelling. and free roam pirating is the best you could easily log over 100 hrs of gameplay into this game with so much content. I havent even tried the mulitplayer. Being a pirate, free roaming, looting, being a pirate, buried treasure, treasure maps, compelling story, throwing down with other pirates, killing and assassinations and oh did I mention being a pirate!  This is an awesome game! It has my vote for game of the year!
