dont buy this game on pc, i spent 25 on it and no matter what i do, i cant get it to run, my pc can run every game maxed out so its not my pc not meeting requirements, looked at so many forums and thousands of people are having the same problem and ubisoft cba to fix it, i ended up getting it for my xbox one cuz i got so frustrated trying to sort it. tbh i wouldnt suggest buying any game that goes on to uplay, theyre useless!!! hope this review will save alot of money, i repeat dont buy this game on pc!
