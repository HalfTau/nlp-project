Im not a huge fan of the franchise. I read some very impressive reviews about gameplay  graphics being top notch. This is another game that if you really want to see at its best you will need some serious hardware. If you ever loved Sid Meirs Pirates back in the day and wanted more of 1st person view then this game is for you. Ive played it in 4k and it looks amazing. The controls are similar games such as Arkham and Middle Earth so its easy to jump right in.My only complaints are the UbiPlay thing and Animus. One is a unwanted Steam knock off and the other really takes away from immergence of the game. I also think the programers shouldve taken one more step to make it 3d vision ready as the games beauty could show itself on another level.
