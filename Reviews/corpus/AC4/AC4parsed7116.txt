The best Assassins Creed game except for the parts where youre not on a pirate ship. Why did anyone play these things before then? I think I got this for 10 or so, definitely a good deal at that price but otherwise, for me personally, I wouldve regretted the purchase.The feel of the basic movement controls are consistently terrible, even on a gamepad. The animations are always pretty well synced up though, so this is probably why it feels so sluggish. Not any worse than DeadSpace, but at least in DeadSpace you were a big stompy space engineer so it made sense. Here its just.. I dunno. Youre ridiculously agile but not very responsive, I guess for the sake of realism even though the parkour moves you can do are consistently impossiblely awesome. It gets pretty annoying sometimes when the game doesnt want to line you up like you need to be, as its very stubborn about keeping its animations all synced up and pretty instead of letting you move where you want.Combat/Stealth is okay. You could stealth through things on land if you want to be bored, but its much easier to just murder everyone by countering and hitting X. This is better so you can get back to the ship combat as soon as possible. Batman Arkham Asylum definitely stole this and does it way better, since countering and beating the snot out of thugs is totally Batman and theres all sorts of difficult scenarios to try it out in, but in Black Flag youre just the best swordsman that ever lived for no apparent reason and all the fights are predictable and easy to fudge so I dont know why youd want to bother with the very lackluster stealth here. Youre not Batman and you cant do all the cool swooping and grappling and psychingout stuff he does, so if you want stealth go play that instead.The textures are actually pretty awful if you slow down and look at them, so Id recommend running everywhere at all times for maximum visual pop.
