This game crashes thanks to DRM uPlay, tested on two entirely seperate computers, an i7 Geforce laptop and an AMD Radeon desktop. The message Im getting from Ubisoft is that if youre a legitimate paying customer, they cant fuing stand you. You have to contact technical support like youre fuing oliver twist Please Sir can... in order to get the game working. MEANWHILE IN PIRATE LAND If youre someone who doesnt intend to ever pay for any game ever, Ubisoft loves you. Ubisoft have a massive hdon for the money they think they are missing out on. So much so that they are willing to offer a subpar experience to paying customers in a bid for some imaginary money they think they are missing out on. Message received Ubisoft, loud and clear. I wont ever touch Ubisoft with a bargepole ever again.
