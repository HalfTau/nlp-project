Ok, the game is great. I play games for atmosphere, and in this game, the atmosphere is unmatched  sailing on the open sea, your crew singing shanties.The game itself is beautiful.Then we get to Ubisofts shtty DRM piece of cp called UPlay.Other than the one downloaded witht the game being out of date, the website is also totally broken. Furthermore, when you get your account details wrong in the main page when logging in or making an account, your IP gets blocked for several minutes, which goes up if u attempt it again. The Devs claim it is to stop Brute attacks  the rest of the internet has managed to do it more eloquently, without banning your fuing ip so i cant play for 1 hour. As well as saves being deleted.GG ubi, turned this great games review to a negative one for the st u force me to go thru to play it!
