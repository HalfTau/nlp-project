Heyyo, wow! So much to love and enjoy about this game. Its definitely refreshing how they mixed the ship combat  boarding with the solid Assassins Creed foundation. It reminds me a bit about the amount of fun I had with Sid Meiers Pirates back in the day which is definitely a good thing. Its definitely my favorite Assassins Creed game yet.Side missions / activities are pretty good and varied... Deep sea diving, Animal hunting on land and at sea, Assassin Missions, Trader Missions, searching for Mayan puzzle pieces, Templar key hunts... Lots to do.One of my favorite little side activities is collecting Shanties which is songs the Pirates sing... and each Shanty you collect? Your crew learns a new song! A game where collecting things adds more fun to the game indirectly and in a good way!? Awesome. POn PC it was optimized incredibly well compared to even Skyrim even with packing more detail on screen. The only poor part is the controls when diving underwater and a current carries you... cant spin the camera and know what Edwards skull is about to bounce off of lol... only other control issue? Parcour. The classic controls of Right click enables parcour and Shift increases the running speed is sorely missed here. Sometimes its hard to tell Edward which way you wish for him to move with just WASD, that and if youre trying to make a tight manuver ie, Climbing the masts to cut down a Ships flag Edward will think you meant leaping somewhere else instead of 90 degree turn and climb the Mast some more. Overall? Even with a few control flaws? Its still my favorite Assassins Creed game to date... Definitely worth the money, especially if its on sale.
