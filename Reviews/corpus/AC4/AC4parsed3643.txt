Saw this on sale and thought I would give it a try i was worried on the mixed reviews of all the releases in this series. First off I was in awe of the incredible incredible realism of the game. The Jungle seem so alive with the animals, turtles and birds everywhere. The ocean and waterfalls are amazingly realistic and makes me wish I was there to swim and explore.I have everything maxed out on 1080p hbao and physics at ultra settings and it runs perfectly. So far no crashes or bugs like getting stuck. Very rarely but on few occasions the camera can get block but is easily correct.Game play is a lot of fun and is a breath of fresh air compared the mostly playing fps games. The maps are gigantic and I find many of the challenges take a lot of though complete. The NPCs will react to in many ways and push you when you run into them.I very much recommend if you like trying to sneak around and dont mind have to redo some challenges multiple times to complete. Im still trying to get the hang of sword fights and getting the right button combos.Im playing with a ps3 controller and works perfectly, at first nothing worked till I determine that i loaded a profile for my x52pro into the assassins.ini edit and removed the profile and disconnected the controller and worked perfectly.Like all reviews will continue to update as I play along.ProsBeautiful World, by far the most immersive and realistic Ive played.Lots of different strategies can be used to complete challenges.Plays excellent with ps3 controllerEnjoyed sailing and the first cannon battle.Climbing aspect was perfectly implemented and have no problems.ConsVery Minor night seems to go to fast.Very Minor storms seem to go to fast.Minor Wish some missions the stealth aspect could be better to reduce assassinations.Things I need to researchIs there a wait system in place to wait for night or does night time even increase stealth?
