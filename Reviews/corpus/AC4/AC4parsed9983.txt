Woaw, just woaw! Weve all had this fantasy about being pirates at some point atleast. But all weve had where some fantasy movies, that didnt quite show us, how it really was back then. But this game does, and it does it really well! The ship mechanics are amazing! Its easy to control, and you quickly learn to use all the weapons, in the way, that will make you kick butt! And the story is cool too. You easily get emotinally attached to the different characters in the game, and thats a big plus. Some missions can be a bit frustrating WHEN THE SAME FREAKING GUARD SPOTS YOU FOR THE 5th TIME!. Especially tailing or eardrop missions. But then you come to the awesome mission, and then youre happy again! Plus, theres so much else you can do besides the story. I played for 10 hours maybe, just to get enough materials to pimp up my ship. Treassure maps, are a pretty cool addon too.If these where the only things I had to give the game credit for, I would give it 10/10 no doubt.... BUT!Bugs. And theyre goddamn everywhere! Okay, its not that bad.. But still, during 15 hours of gameplay, my ship disappeared into the ocean in a giant hole, multiple times! Or sometimes, graphical glitches would be all over my screen, and the game would simply start lagging as hell. These dont come that often, but it can really ruin your mood, when youre having so much fun being a pirate.It makes me pretty sad, that things like these arent fixed. So I hope they release a patch, as soon as possible.This isnt that much of a Assasins Creed game. More of a Pirate Simulator. And a pretty good one at that! But, ofcourse they continue with the templars and assasins story. If you havent played the other AC games, this isnt a bad starting point.So Ive come to the conclusion that... This is a must own! But dont PIRATE it! See what I did there?
