Alrighty mateys, so. First things first, this game is actually very, very good. The sea combat and gameplay is so fleshed out it feels like a game on its own, and the normal assassins creed part is well done with a few additions compared to other releases. Theres also some gameplay outside of the animus, but thats focused entirely on story and collectables. This game is insanely fun and has lots of content and things to do.The only problem with it, is that its buggy. There are a couple notable glitches and bugs most of which are funny and entertaining rather than game breaking, but the main issue, is trying to get the game to work. There are dozens of ways to get the game to work, and not all of them do. But the best way is to manually download Uplay from the ubisoft website, then play the game from that. Hope that helps.To sum it up,Pros Fantastic gameplay. Glorious visuals. Truly captures that feeling of being a pirate. Just plain fun! Holds true to assassins creed while adding a new navy element. Most of the bugs are funny. You are a pirate first, assassin second. Morality is optional.Cons Dear god the bugs. It took me a solid two hours of troubleshooting to get the game functioning. Screen sometimes freezes upon entering a restricted zone there is a fix for it Story is paced to be played with maybe an hour between certain missions, while others are meant to be played back to back. Ham fisted plug into the Assassins Creed universe.
