Large sandobx with naval combat, shore based activities and a good long main story to weave it all togehter some complain that it can be repetative boarding actions etc, but then again so was Just Cause 2 in places but that did not stop it from being an awesome game, the same applies here, easily the one of the best releases of the year for PC.
