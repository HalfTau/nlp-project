is an epic tale of pirates, pirates, pirates... oh and pirates!Edward Kenway is a young man who leaves his pregnant wife behind in his personal quest for loot and fame. The only way to achieve his goal is by becoming a bloody pirate.The story revolves around Edward Kenway and his quest to become a mighty pirate in the Caribbean. He meets the mysterious order of the Assassins which he then decides to abandon. The story has some emotional bits but overall, it was rather disappointing. The Assassins plot seems forced and a bit out of place. If this game was called Pirates or something it wouldve been better since the AC plot is so forced.Standard Assassins Creed fare, you jump, hide, kill, run around rooftops, and most annoyingly eavesdrop. Once you board your ship, the Jackdaw, all of that changes. The naval combat and the huge open sea and world make up for monotonous on foot missions. While the naval combat draws so much from the PlayStation 2 game Sly 3 Honor Among Thieves, it is still fun and innovative in its own way. To sail around the Caribbean and sink other ships while your shipmates are singing is a sight to behold.Oh, and the game has a sht ton of collectibles.Beautiful. From the detailed environments to the characters and NPCs to the huge open sea to the animations, it clearly is one of the best looking games of 2013.Solid cast of voice actors and one amazing soundtrack. Youll know youre in for a treat from the main menus theme.The usual AC multiplayer, if you love it, youll love this one even more. If you hate it, it wont change your mind.Overall, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is a great game if you forget that it is an AC game. With 50 hours of mostly great single player content and a good multiplayer, the game is not one to be missed.
