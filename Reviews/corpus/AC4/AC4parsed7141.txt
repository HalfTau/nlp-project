After long years of wating, we finally got a perfect action pirate game. Sadly, this just isnt a great Assassins Creed game. Dont get me wrong, you get to do all the flashy parkour and combat stuff we all know and love from the AC series, but the story just doesnt concentrate on the templar/assassin conflict too much. Plus the outofanimus sequences are kinda niche, but really boring.
