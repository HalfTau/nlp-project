Best Pirate Game ever! Best AC game in the series too. they kept the animus mumbojumbo to a minimum this time compared to the previous games. the graphics are gorgeous and the main character Edward is likeable rogue just replaced Ezio for me!. the ship battles are a lotta fun and theres plenty things to do beside the main storyline as well. The Uplay bits can be a bit annoying at times but i can live with it i guess.Highly recommended. A 9/10!
