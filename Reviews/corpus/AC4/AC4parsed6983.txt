I liked the game overall. Im not a big fan of the lore. Too much minutiae drowns out the important elements of the story. eventually there is no story and its all lore. Boo on that front.However,  the gameplay is strong and ship battles and upgrades and some surprise exploration make this one of the better assassins creed games.
