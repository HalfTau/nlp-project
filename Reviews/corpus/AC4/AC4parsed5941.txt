While not the BEST optimized console port, this is still quite a fun time. I will never own a brig, nor will I ever fire a blunderbuss, nor will I likely ever play another Ubisoft game after Unity, yet this is a great way to depart from the Assassins Creed series. The graphics look about two years older than the time of release, but they are not noticeably bad in any way. Sword combat is not the quickest, however the feeling is fluid and satisfactory. The story is the gold in this stack of bronze. Characters have purpose and motivation, their moralities sway, and they have human flaws. That being the case, I feel as if Black Flag would have made an equally entertaining movie.
