Must have game ! There is no better sea battles around. Ive spent 400 GBP on World of Warships,only in the AC Black Flag game you have proper waves, storms, weather effects and a real feeling for the sea.The sea stuff is so complex, it could be a separate game. Its just awesome and the Shanties add so much feeling to it.If you invest a hundred hours in to the game, you will discover so much more and get a real feeling for what is possible in a game in terms of top notch, joyful sea battles...When you have past the first few dozens of hours on the usual Assasins Creed stuff,then you get the entertainment of the sea content. This is the real game for me !Man, a remake of Pirates with this Blackflag sea stuff would be ueberdueber.Top game
