I would never recommend to buy this! After I had bought and downloaded the game I started it up and guess what? AC4BFSP.exe has stopped working. Looked for countless fixes on the internet and nothing worked. Luckily I only had 6 minutes of playtime because the game would crash after 15 seconds, so I asked for a refund. Thanks Ubisoft, I really wanted this game at first, now I want to get rid of it ASAP. Takes away 19GB of useless files.
