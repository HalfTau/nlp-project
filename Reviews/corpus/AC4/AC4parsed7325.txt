In all honesty, it was very fun. Fast pased ship sailing. Decent stealth and an interesting, banterous character and story. Rather similar in design to the third game in the series but improved in many ways. However this game isnt entirely worth the 40 I payed at launch, but a bargain at the 20 quid its at nowadays
