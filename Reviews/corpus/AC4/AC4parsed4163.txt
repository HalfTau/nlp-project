DO NOT BUY After buying this game over 24 hours ago I am still unable to play. When I launch from Steam, im directed to the uplay app, where the my games section is blank. Having to launch the uplay app directly, to attempt to activate the game, I am given an error message that the uplay service is unreachble and will be restored asap.After 6 hours of back and forth between steam and uplay, Im left still unable to play, with no resolution in sight. Each of them blaming the other, uplay advising I have to activate the product in steam, and steam advisign the game isnt on the list of ones that can be actiavted.
