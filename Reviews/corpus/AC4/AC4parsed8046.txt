There might be one downside to this game due to the fact that theres no achivement sytem for this game on steam other than uplay, but other than that you get what you payed for. I have played all the ac games and i must say this is the best out of all of them. If i were to choose, i would get black flag and av rev over all the other ac games. Lots of detail has been put into this game and im very satisfied.
