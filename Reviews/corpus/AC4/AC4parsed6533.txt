Spent 30 hours finishing the main story, impressed with simple life story of a assassin/ pirate life of Edward Kenway. The graphic is absolutely stunning and gameplay is the best. Like a GTA pirate version lol.Normally I finish one game in about 12 hours, this game has very good story and gameplay, even after I have finished the main story line I think I would love to spend more time beating the legendary ships and explore more in the large map.Definately worth the money
