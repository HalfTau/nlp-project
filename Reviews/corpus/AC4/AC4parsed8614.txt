I never really like the Assassins Creed games so it took some convincing on my friends part to get me to even consider this let alone spend the full 60 on the standard version as I normally only buy games on deep sales. I must say  this a Great  game one of the best I have played in a very long time. Ubisoft put a ton of effort into pretty much all the naval aspects of the game making the ship battles and log distance travel an epic experience. Even though fast travel points are everywhere I found Id rather sail my badship and listen to the more than 30 different songs my pirate crew would sing than use one.
