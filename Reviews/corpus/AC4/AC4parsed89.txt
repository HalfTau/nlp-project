I enjoy the aspects of the open world and the naval battles but the main storyline is repetitive so far. Anyone who likes the Assassins creed franchise will definitrly end up playing it whether it be out of enjoyment or out of obligation. There are many new aspects to Black Flag which make it enjoyable but it doesnt quite make up for the monotony of the main storyline. I reccomend it , but you may find youself only being able to play an hour at a time before getting bored or sidetracked.
