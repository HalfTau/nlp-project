Problems with the game1. Sailors look like gays seriously what the hell Edwards crew even wears blue scarves around there neck I was like wtf and dressed minimum I thought ok they are homos all of them2. Sometiems controls are clunky.Pros of the game 1. The story of Edward Kenway. its awesome how the man strungles in a  life of the pirate.2.Gameplay loved ship battles, especially the mortal shots.3. Side characters like Marry and Anne and Black beard.For years Ive been rushing around, taking whatever I fancied, not giving a tinkers curse for those I hurt. Yet here I am... with riches and reputation, feeling no wiser than when I left home. Yet when I turn around, and look at the course Ive run... theres not a man or woman that I love left standing beside me. Edward Kenway
