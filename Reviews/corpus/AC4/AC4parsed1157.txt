Assassins creed black flag is Interesting. Its definatly got its pros but the cons make them hard to sea. If you love the idea of being a pirate on the open ocean you should probably not get this one. You have a PC go and find the countless amazing pirate RPGs out there. Now for the Assassins creed side of things... If youve never played an assassins creed game this is probably the most fun one to start and in that case hell yea id recomend it. If youve played any of the other countless assassins creed games then just know that its more of the same. If youre not burnt out already from the others you might have some fun with the new boat combat. As someone whos played and beaten AC1, AC2, ACB, ACR, and AC3 I cant bring myself to go on another wonky parcoury climb to another ing eagle. Or a Music note.... So to conclude, if this is your first jumb into a bail of hey then go for it. if youve gotten familuar with the assassins creed formula the boat combat will NOT keep you interested.Congrats you read it.Phylo
