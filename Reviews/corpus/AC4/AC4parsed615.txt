If this is above average awesome mainstream gaming must be in a worse state than i imagined.Update First Assassins Creed game because reviews said it was awesome. Mind blown by amazing graphics and boat fun. Realized core game was a sequence of kill people sequences with meaningless connective narrative. There is no point to doing any of the sequences, no connected story from the modern day, no story from the pirate era. No meaningful rpg progression in game at all. It clicked that the stealth approach has a failure cost but the go in and kill everything approach most boring is 100 certain to win. Almost lost faith in gaming by the second last mission. Watched youtube for the last.How do people like this franchise?
