A great disappointment.  The game is great, the PC port is bad.  Buy the console version, if you can stomach it.If youre thinking about buying It does not support any aspect ratio other than 169, and there arent even any reliable hacks to fix it.  The Field of View angle is terrible thats almost a given sadly, nonadjustable, and also doesnt even have hacks to fix it.  Overall, the letterboxing plus FOV plus general poor performance made me nauseous, which hasnt happened to me since Quake 2, roughly.
