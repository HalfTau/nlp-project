New review.I cannot play this now due to Uplay being a P.O.S.  I am requesting a password reset to see which on the two made inadvertently uplay accounts I have it on.  I just really hate Uplay.  If you want to compete/sell your product through steam you need to bend over backwards to make sure it works properly because at this point Im going through all my Ubi games in my list and marking all the reviews to bad and Im not buying any more of your games Im interested in unless you can prove to me as a customer that Uplay is not going to be trash any more.Old review.This is what the last assassins creed should have been! thank you!
