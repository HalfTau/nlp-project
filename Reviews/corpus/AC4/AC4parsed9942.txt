Assassins Creed 4 is like Assassins Creed 3 only with ships and a much bigger world. Its a completely other game.If you like AC3, you will like AC4,if you dont like AC3, you may like AC4.if you like AC Rogue, you will definitely like AC4.if you like AC Syndicate, you may like this game.When I played AC4 the first time, I hate it.I like AC, AC2, AC3 but the idea with sailing ships didnt fit for me to the Assassins Creed logic and gameplay.Then I played Assassins Creed Unity and I loved it.Then I played Assassins Creed Rogue and I loved it.Then I played Assassins Creed 4 again, and I loved it.I dont know why buy I really needed to play all other AC games to like this game.Its not that easy to play in my opinion like all other AC games, but it is a nice game!The Graphics are really good compared to AC Unity, and exactly what you expect from a AC game with ships and sailing.I can only recommend this game, but I wouldnt buy it for the full price, I would buy AC Rogue instead.
