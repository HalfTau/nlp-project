Good story. The main character isnt a broody judy like Connor was in ACIII. Unlike most, I actually enjoy the modernday segments. The world is rich and the pirate aspect was great. This game couldve been just a pirate game with no Assassins Creed and I think itd have done great  if you like AC or just like pirates, this game is a good buy.
