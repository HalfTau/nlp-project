Absolutley love this game! The first assasins creed game I have played and I will wait for the next newest one because of the crummy reviews on the newer games. Being a free roaming game, there is nothing to stop you to continue exploring the game after the story is over! Furthermore, if you want to continue with the game after you have done the story, you have to wait for the game credits at the end to finish, on the bright side of waiting half an hour for the credits, there is a secret which gives you alot of Uplay points and XP.With my Micro ATX Zoostorm PC I managed to run this game at about 60 fps Vsync on with the occasional lag spike when boarding a ship, however the Nvidia 960 2GB and intel i5 4460 plus the gigabite gaming motherboard handled it well.It had a brilliant story, with a touching end!9.8/10Because of the weird glitches when I killed a solidier, its waist tightened up and went spazzing about!
