I bought this game, luckily on sale.Ill start with the main gripes I have with this game.The game itself is fun though, the free roaming is excellent and there is a big world to explore and discover and do all kinds of side quests but sometimes I feel like Im wrestling more with the controls then the game. I think this is partially due to the fact that the game is clearly a consolefirst designed and later converted to PC.Its also my first AC game and the whole Assassins vs Templar issue is just fluff to keep the game going for me. I only bought it because of the pirates.If youre into the AC thing, this is a good game to explore another part of that and youll get good value for money. If you dont like the AC thing, it still a good buy and youll get a big world to explore and stuff to do, but youll get annoyed by the grievances above. Then I recommend to buy if its on sale or if you got cash to spare.
