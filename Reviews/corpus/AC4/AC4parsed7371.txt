i have only played a  few hours as im writing this review but this game HAS to be one of the best games i have played and ive played saints row 3  4, TF2, sleeping dogs, AC brotherhood, and many others. oh this game is just far over the top.... sadly with all assassins creed games the cutscenes are laggy on  my pc. the words the character is saying is finished  before the mouth animations and what that character is doing finish   but still this is one AMAZING game!
