Ive had more fun sailing the seas, blasting my cannons, swinging from sails, and plundering ships in this game than the rest of the Assassins Creed franchise put together.Forget the story though in this AC it is actually well acted... and just head out onto the high seas.The more you plunder, the better you can make your ship, thus enabling you to take on bigger ships.Hell its so good Ubisoft went back to ships after the flop that was ACUnity.
