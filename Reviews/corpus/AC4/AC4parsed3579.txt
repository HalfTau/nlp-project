great game play, great map, great side missions, great story, great combat mechanics but the amount of boring stealth missions are rediculious and there are so many boring tailing missions which last for hours that the main missions are point but still are essential to upgrading your character. Its the same boring and agrivatingly hard missions copied and pasted over and over again.
