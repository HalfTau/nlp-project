Best Assassins Creed game to date. Its not as tedious and repetitive as what came before and less buggy than that mess called Unity. The story is less Creed driven and much more about friendship and loyalty.The big BUT Though I recommend the game itself it has to be mentioned that Uplay may cause problems for some players.
