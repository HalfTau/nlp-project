A bit of a disclaimer about this game,It took me awhile to figure out how to reduce the visual tearing problem this game has. After that the game is great.Want to be a pirate and plunder and steal all kinds of booty? Then this game is for you. It has a lot of other Assassins Creed elements, but it fully develops naval combat which was first introduced in Assassins Creed 3. At the time of the review, I have about 4 hours into the game, and I love it so far.
