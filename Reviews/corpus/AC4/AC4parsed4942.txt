Were you ever a fan of the Pirates of the Carribean movies? The adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow to become the greatest pirate of the Carribean in his majestic Black Pearl. Ah, the memories.Whats more, if being a pirate and plundering the Carribean on your swift frigate by day is not enough, you can be an assassin by night and carry on the legacy of the previous Assassins Creed Games.Assassins Creed Black Flag follows the main character, Edward Kenway, as he goes from a lousy pirate to a fully fledged assassin for the brotherhood. The combat is very fluid and welldeveloped and the naval combat is surprisingly alright besides too much smoke in battles.Personally, I really enjoyed the 1700s feel of the game, fighting with cutlasses, and boarding other frigates and the occasional Man O War. I put let the Pirates of the Carribean theme song loose as I jumped from the rigging onto the deck of enemy vessels and started my rampage with my trusty cutlass and the jewel encrusted set of pistols.The story line was excellent up until the very end, where it unfortunately took a turn to a work of fiction and killed the immersion it previously provided. However, that negative did not outweight the entire game.The game offers various clothing customization options, which are nowhere as good as the DLC costumes you can acquire. There is a fairly good selection of pistols and swords as well. Your ship, Jackdaw, is also available to be customized.You can fight soldiers, assassinate some pesky targets, run down some thieves, board and capture military vessels, and take on the role of Jack Sparrow...literally...as you sail the high seas and make the Carribean fear your name.
