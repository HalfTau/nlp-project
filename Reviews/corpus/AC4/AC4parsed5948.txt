At first I was skeptical about purchasing this game since I havent picked up an AC game since AC3 skipping revelations and of course the god aweful uplay ubi loves to shove down our throats. But after purchasing it i must say, its the best time Ive had with an AC game since 2. The game is just pure fun, especially aboard the Jackdaw, while keeping a serious touch. The world is goregeous and huge with tons of things to do and explore. Storywise the game is ok, nothing too special but the voice acting does stand out.I will say though, the modern day storyline isnt all that interesting and the game does have some minor bugs. All in all though it is a fantastic game and you are doing yourself a disservice if you havent already got it.
