This game would be awesome, if it wasnt for the idiotic  story line that you are playing a game as a person playing a game. Every time i would really get into the game, they would take me out and do some stupid side mission about a researcher for some company that I couldnt really care less about. It honestly ruins the game and the franchise for me. it has a wonderful concept an ancient order of assassins that always help the underdogs balance the power. Why oh why did that have to ruin it with some cockeyed subplot that causes more damage to the credibility  of the game than leaving it out ever would had.
