Amazing game.ProsHuge world that rewards exploringFun ship battlesIncredible graphics even in 2017Familiar counter attack combat systemMain story missions are varied and funFun side activitiesYoull be singing sea shanties for years seriously I still sing them with friends even 4 years laterCons Requires uPlay, which is admittedly in 2017 a LOT better and more stable than it was when this game came out in 2013. It was downright pitiful back then, The story missions are fun but the storyline itself it very hit or miss in places. I think most of the Assassins Creed games suffer this problem. Parkour can be frustrating. Some of the areas have a lot of climable objects in tight spaces and youll just be trying to run through but you keep climbing on things.
