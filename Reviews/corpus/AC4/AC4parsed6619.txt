Ewally good game, and this isnt being said from a fan boy perspective as I really havent played any of the AC games before this one. The controls seem to be pretty smooth, the story is pretty good, and there is an immense amount of things to do in this game. The only drawbacks that I saw were that at times you were limited with collections due to not being able to access an area, such as the Mayan Stones, Yes, the reward was nice for completing this collection, but I felt a little underwhelmed with it due to not being able to complete it until so late into the game.
