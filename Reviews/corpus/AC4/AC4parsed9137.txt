This is the best Assassins Creed so far, with tons of content and amazing quality!I cant find bad parts, really, I loved all the pirate stuff, the story but above all the immersion of this title.On the old titles of this franchises I kinda hates all the desmond parts, on this release the off animus parts are much more engaging and not so frustrating. They are fast and mostly optional, I like that .Some people would say that is more of the same... but for me this a buy, the change of pace and the pirate ocean scenery are very rewarding.
