The frame rate on this game is terrible.. locked at 30 but then will hit 60 when i stand still. moving through towns i got as low as 20fps...My PC FAR exceeds the minimum spec for this OLD title god knows how anyone played this when it first release on older hardware.Ive researched this and apparently im not alone, this is simply a poorly optimised port that runs like a dog for alot of people.Buyer beware.I have however stuck with the game despite its Frame rate limitations and can say unequivocally that it is by far the best pirate game out their. Forget that its Assassins creed. This is a wonderful pirate conquest and management game.Any devs out there looking for ideas...  this is it, a Pirate Game. Buy, build, manage, conquer, plunder, open world.
