After seeing good reviews i thought ubi was trying to catch up with pc community after the horrible AC 3 port.But NO, i got a blackscreen after launching the solo, got only sounds, tryed to fix it by changing the forge file, did nothing, verified files, reinstalling, nothing worked, even the VPN thing.Dont waste your time in this  port.REFUNDED
