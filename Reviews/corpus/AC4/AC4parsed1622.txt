I owned this game frist on 360, then for my very brief stint with the xbox one. I have since now owned it on pc for a while too. I have 100 completed the game about four to six times now, plus many other play throughs. I am an Assassins Creed fan, I have played them all. From the first all the way to Syndicate, and while the series wanes over the years, I can assure you Black Flag is a masterpiece. Not just for an Assassins Creed or Ubisoft game, but it is an all around phenominal game. A vast open world to explore at your own pace, plenty of cool outfits and upgrades, not to mention tons of collectibles and side quests. The story includes a charasmatic hero, you want to be around, plus an entourage of lovable characters that a player can truly emotionally invest in. I reccomend this game to anyone.
