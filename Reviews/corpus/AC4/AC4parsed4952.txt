Perhaps I was expecting too much after reading all the reviews, but the game is just too repetitive to be recommended. Yes, the naval combat is fun. Capturing the ships and destroying the forts is satisfying. Hunting animals and looking for treasures is ok too. But the rest is just a typical AC game. You just find yourself in the same situations over and over again. It could be ok if the game was challenging, but its just too simple.And then suddenly you start paying more and more attention to poor optimisation, twitchy camera and absolutely boring and dull combat. Overall, the first ten hours of Black Flag are fun. Then you just wish the game would end asap.And then Ubisoft decided their game isnt  enough, so every second mission in the story is tailing someone which is very boring. Sometimes you have to do that with the ship, which is even worse. Theres also ridiculous enemy respawn in some missions.To top that, the majority of cut scenes cannot be skipped. Because seeing the same scenes the ship captured, Kenway unburies a mayan stone or a chest over and over again is very fun, isnt it?Finally, for a game with an open world theres very little actual freedom.You are too far away from an ally. Desynchronized. You are too far away from the target. Desynchronized. This area isnt available during current memory. Or you cant leave the area. Desynchronized.These issues were plaguing AC games from the start. And now, several games later, this isnt getting any better. The world is bigger, but the game is still very boring and repetititve. Bottom line, this is the last AC game Im buying.
