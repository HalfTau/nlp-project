Installed AC4 and played it for a few hours. Then I bought Far Cry 3 Obviously didnt work because Ubisoft Reinstalled Uplay a few times, Far Cry 3 works now Started playing AC4 again, saves gone because Uplay reinstall Np because uplay has cloud saving Turns out they disabled cloud saving for AC4 after a while Saves gone Downloaded saves from the interwebz Didnt work because you arent allowed to share saves Rip savesUbisoft pls..
