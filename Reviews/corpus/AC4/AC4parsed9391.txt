Out of Water Typical AC game. Nothing new.On the High Seas Most fun Ive had in a long time playing with a boat!...The Naval combat, alone, is enough to pay full price for this.I will say its a bit easymode though. You can easily keep your ship fully repaired and zero wanted level by just doing Repair  Release  Repair  Releaseon any sized ship you go against.Its also lame that you can Board in midfight and perform the above usually Repair and not die. Because the shiptoship combat is paused during Boarding fights.
