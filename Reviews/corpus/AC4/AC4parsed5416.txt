I love this game for the amount of different things to do in the game. I have played nearly 30 hours and i have about 15 game completeion in the game done so there is alot to do in Black Flag. The abililty to captain your own ship and take on others is my favorite aspect of this game. Honestly this game is too amazing to describe without going on for a long time, its a great game!
