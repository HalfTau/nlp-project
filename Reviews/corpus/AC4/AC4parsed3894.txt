Quick one sentence summaryYour god damn pirate and an Assassin throw your money at the screen nowSerious peopleThis is a really good game, for being last generation the graphics look. Amazing and the plot is confusing but good but like all games its no perfect I think the Combat system is God awfully but with being said it did get fixed in unity and syndicate and. Even a bit more responsive in Rogue. There are way too many gliches though at one point I lost my double swords wich not that cant happen at least with my knowledge of the 40 some hrs I have. The last thing is Need a good graphics card to run it my laptop runs it at like 15 fps which is like kill me now but if u can look past those things its a really good game and a challenging one too
