This game for me, was the best AC game and also best game of 2013. At that time i didnt have the money to pay for a full 60 game, but i will admit it i pirated it and i finished it 2 times since then. 94 or more in those pirated versions. Now, when it is 5 i decided to show my appreciation to Ubisoft for this piece of art and buy it and relplay it for the 3rd time.The game is nearly perfect from any point, the story is amazing, the gameplay is slightly improved from the previos AC games, but the enemies are still  as  and i think they are also autistic and blind af, the naval combat is just dope, the sound is amazing when you hear your comrades singing while you sail around the sea and also the voice acting is amazing too, the graphics are amazing and it doesnt require a high PC to play it atleast on medium on a good framerate. When it comes to the multiplayer, i just cant recommend this kind of multiplayer. For me it isnt enjoyable and i think the AC games didnt need any multiplayer, but there are some players that maybe enjoy this thing.All in all, I REALLY RECOMMEND this game. I just love everything about it, for me is the best AC game out there. 9/10, because there are some gameplay problems and glitches that just kinda ruin the experience.
