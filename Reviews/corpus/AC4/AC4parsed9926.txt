This game makes any previous installment in the Assassins Creed series look like garbage. Especially after the disappointing release of AC3, Ubisoft had realized that they had to get up and make up for all the shattered hype.This game delivers and it does so really well. Whether it is the classic but improved physics, the amazing visuals the water is nuts, or the way this game makes you feel like a true captain of your own pirate ship and crew, there was no segment in my time with this game where i thought something could have been better. I never felt like i wanted to stop playing.Like most other installments in this series, this game features a double storyline, with Edward Kenway and his pirates being the main one, and the creepy yet fascinating futuristic world of Abstergo, the company that provides the animus for you character to go into the pirate world.The only thing i was disappointed with was that after beating it, I wanted more. Dont get me wrong, theres loads of content, but this game absorbs you into it so well, that it feels like there was none even after 50 hours of gametime. There should have been more of an endgame, but i believe that they wanted you to go try out their new and improved multiplayer.Now Assassins Creed multiplayer had always been fun in previous games, but it wouldnt be something people would look forward to compared to the main storyline. Assassins Creed 4 delivers even in the multiplayer aspect, making it fun, smooth and replayable.
