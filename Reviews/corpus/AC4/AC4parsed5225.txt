The game is really good in many ways. It does innovate within the AC series, following a path AC3 set up, but never went through with. The world is huge, and youre almost entirely free.The combat, as usual, is hardly interesting, however the game doesnt revolve around it.The sad parts are the story lacks backing. No idea how you got all the assassin skills or why you end up being one, it doesnt seem to matter too much, so youre rather on a different path but frequently cross paths with the warring factions.Also, DLC is a scam in this game. The season pass doesnt even include all DLC and most of it is multiplayer skins.The game itself however is worth some good money, I had about 33 hrs of main storyline and a few extras that seemed important, roughly 55 of completion iirc. Thats a good bang for your buck.
