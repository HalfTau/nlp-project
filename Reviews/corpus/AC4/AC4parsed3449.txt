I do not as a rule write reviews,  but because this  game is so outstanding I feel the need to share with others the entertainment I have had ..and am still for the following reasons 1 A dammed good storyline based on real people, 2 The graphics etc are THE BEST I have come across, 3 exciting adventures and sea battles with varying weather conditions to deal with and...look Im sorry but there is so many good things to write I will summerise and recommend you buy it, its great..thank you Assassins Creed staff you are very very clever people.Mike Brake
