Now this is an Assassins Creed game, I havent had this much fun with the series in a long time 2/Brotherhood. The naval combat, the world itself, SEA SHANTIES! This is a vibrant and beautiful game, the story is a bit dry in points, but if you can over look the characters and poor plot points, its a seriously fun game, to play. Also because, yarr harr, you are a pirate!Pirate Assassinos 11/10
