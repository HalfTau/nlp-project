Useless controls and frustrating gameplay. immersion is broken constantly.I will keep trying, but I cant play for more than an hour without getting too frustrated.EditYep, any time my feet are on the ground this game sucks. Fighting is uncoordinated button mashing, anything else leads to death.Everything on ships is fun, but super arcade like.
