Ive played all of the Assassins Creed Games. Well.. not all, I did miss out the handheld releases, but Ive played through the entire main release and the entire storyline so far. I was very excited for Black Flag  because I assumed that what Ubisoft had done was to keep that core Assassins Creed gameplay.. and add Pirate ships. As it turns out, I was exactly right.Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag is a brilliant game. Not quite perfect maybe  but most certainly worth full price. Very interesting out of animus storyline  great locations, extremely colourful, massively open world with some great characters, a very interesting main character with his own motivations. Combat is great, and although it does take some getting used to, and it is somewhat easy to die if you dont know what youre doing  its a fluid system that makes the game just as good  if not a little better as every Assassins Creed so far!Theres a great deal to love about this game. There are a few issues  for example free running isnt perfect. Ive made Edward run in directions I certainly didnt mean him to  which thankfully dont happen too often. There are also some fairly frustrating missions  but are all perfectly completable, with a little effort.In conclusion  the PC edition of Black Flag is fantastic. It looks beautiful, plays almost perfectly and has a huge amount of great content.
