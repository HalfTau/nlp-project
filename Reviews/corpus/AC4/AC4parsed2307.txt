This game surprised me. Ive been following the AC storyline since the start, playing the games even after they started feeling stale because I wanted to know what happens next.For the first time in a while, I had a lot of fun in an AC game that didnt just feel like rinse and repeat. Seems like Ubisoft listened to people who wanted more of the naval combat in AC3, and then spun it off into a huge pirating game thats barely even about Assassins vs Templars most of the time... and that was for the best.
