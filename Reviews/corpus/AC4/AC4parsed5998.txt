Id like to contradict some people who say this game has a lack of difficulty, I beg to differ, when youre plundering a man o war, and youve got 5 to 7 different enemies around you, its not always easy to press E and block it when not fighting with the lightest swords, especially when theres a in the crowd, those seem a bit harder to dodge, you also run the risk of being attacked while countering an attack, while you can probably just counter it back, sometimes when you spam E you may not tap it right on time. but heres my actual reviewthis is my first assassins creed game, and I was really pleased with it, 40 dollars well spent, the campaign ought to last you a few days, and more if you do side missions and other things between the campaign, even after story is finished, youll probably still have enough to do to last you a few more days, and I think its worth playing a second time, just to play it some more and keep yourself occupied until you buy a new game, but thats just me.over all, this is a great game, the naval battles are fun and exciting, especially when you plunder a man o war, or even a legendary ship which Ive yet to do, watch out for that ram! and I enjoy plundering the ware houses, definitely reccomended.
