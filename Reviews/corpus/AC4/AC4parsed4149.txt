DONT BUY THIS GAME UPLAY SUCKSBought the game, installed and now I CANT PLAY IT because stupid UPLAY service is down And it keeps telling my password is incorrect. The reset password option doesnt send the email. I changed the uplay settings and then received the correct error message telling me that uplay service is down...Ubisoft, seriously!? Uplay IS A PIECE OF CRAP!I will never buy another ubisoft game again BECAUSE OF THAT. Uplay sucks. Ive payed for the game on steam, I want to play it throught steam, because steam WORKS!DO NOT PUSH CRAPWARE LIKE UPLAY TO YOUR COSTUMERS
