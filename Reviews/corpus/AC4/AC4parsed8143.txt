Its a great game all in all, but the amount of issues i have had with it makes it hard to enjoy.For example not being able to launch the game due to a bug in the ubisoft software.That problem is still not resolved allong with a few others like random crashes and any time i become low on health the screen shrinks to one corner.This game is perfect for people who want to have hours of fun getting the game to work properly
