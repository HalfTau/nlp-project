after AC3 was a hot pile of garbage, its refreshing to see AC4 embrace the bits of AC3 that worked and refine them so they feel even better to play. i enjoyed my time with AC4 and aside from some REALLY TERRIBLE missions that soured me on the game as a whole for a while WHY WOULD YOU MAKE A MISSION WHERE I HAVE TO STEALTHILY MOVE A BOAT, it always came back to the super fun open seas and running around doin stuff.the character of edward kenway is also SO much better then connor in AC3, in that he is a character and has personality and factors that drive him. his whole narrative arc and the people around him were always compelling, but sometimes i felt like they needed more fleshing out. the way AC4 handles the Templar/Assassin war and Edwards role in it is also really cool, to say nothing of the modernday bits which i found super cool and kinda weirdly selfaware of ubisoft.i spent somewhere around 100 hours with this game and had a blast the entire time. the dlc that comes with the season pass/deluxe edition is also worth the money too, especially freedom cry.
