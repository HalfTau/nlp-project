Lets be clear here, this game is a techincal mess and is the the only reason I cannot recommend this game to anyone.You see it crashes.... alot. You must be prepared to accept this as it is a huge widespread issue just Google it but basically youll either CTD or your PC will hard freeze requiring a reboot.Youll also have to be prepared to go out yourself seeking ways to limit how often this occures via forums, as Ubisoft has given the finger to us PC gamers regarding this.However.....If you can get it to work, it is a brilliant game  the graphics are some of the best Ive seen yet, the story so far 45 completed is thrilling and has me hooked, only thing I dont like is how Edward loves to climb over everything  can become very frustrating. But its a small forgivable gripe.I can easily foresee myself loosing hundreds of hours in this game that is if the game lets me and does not eat my save, yeah you should look out for that as wellThe world is beautiful, expansive and alive. There is so much to do, think GTA  Pirates  AC4.You see its a great game but you are running the risk of not being able to play it at all, or at the very least crashing atleast once everytime you play.Ive heard many people are also having major FPS issues as well and they have Beast or Monster pcs  although many dont give details so I cannot say if this is just an issue with their PCs or just lazy programming by Ubisoft.Im running on a I7 3770k  4.2ghz, Dual 590GTXs, 650GTX for the PPU, 32gb ram  an SSD, have everything on Ultra / Max on 1080p and have to use Vsync to keep my FPS locked to 60 otherwise it tears like mad. Great graphics Great Story Great gameplay Great world Great sound Crashes alot, Im one of the lucky ones that can play the game. There are people who cannot play at all and are still waiting to hear back from Ubisofts tech team.
