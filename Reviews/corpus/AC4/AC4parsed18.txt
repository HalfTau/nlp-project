Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is a very good pirate sandbox with light RPG elements, and not a very good Assassins Creed game.I say that, but this is probably my favorite game in the series, because of how different it is.The game is at its worst when its trying to be an Assassins Creed game. The opening is slow and tedius, giving you a solid 30 minutes combined of unskippable cuscenes and chasing people around on foot. But after thats out of the way you get to go out on the open seas with nothing but your ship, your crew of twenty men, and lots of cannons.That is  after the game tutorializes theout of ever single element of the game.The tutorials are slow and boring and you probably figured out most of the mechanics before they were even shown to you if youve ever played a video game.The story mode is kind of a drag but has its moments. Edward is probably the most interesting historical protaginist in this series, and the way his story ties into that of Assassins Creed III is a cool detail, despite how pushed to the side it is.The story mode also introduces the player to a host of figures from the golden age of piracy, so you can watch them do the famous thing they did and then  off, which is a fun time, if a little repetetive after the third one.There are also of course, the issue of Uplay being a piece of which honestly usually didnt cause me any issues. I still dont like that they force people who buy it on steam to go through their client, and sometimes the steam compatability can be buggy, but most of the time it was a nonissue.Overall Assassins Creed IV is an excellent game, dragged down by necessity of being an Assassins Creed game. The plot can be a bit of a drag at times and the game is most interesting on the open seas but theres more to like than to hate here.
