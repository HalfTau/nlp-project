I want to like this game. I really, really do. But, while its awesome from the few minutes I was able to play  do not change the resolution if you want to be able to play the game at all. I wanted to play with less lag so i turned th resolution down and the game crashed. I closed and reopened it. It crashed again. Here five hours later it will still crash on launch. This game gets my recommendation but be cautious with your settings.
