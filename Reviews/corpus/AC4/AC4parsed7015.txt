This is the first game I have played in the Assassins Creed franchise, but frankly, I bought it because it looked like a nice modern pirate game in the vein of Sid Meiers Pirates! I was not disappointed in the slightest, and in fact, I liked all of the gameplay enough that I bought the rest of the games in the series when they went on sale.Fantastic sailing and ship combat, and the parkour and melee combat are both well done and lend themselves well to both land and seabased encounters.  The story was pretty well done, and I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of many of the famous pirates of the time.  The presentday stuff was a little strange and jarring, but with a little research into the previous games, it wasnt too bad. Still, I feel the game would have been better without it. Its really the only complaint I had about the game, and its a minor one at that.Overall, a fantastic game that I would highly recommend.
