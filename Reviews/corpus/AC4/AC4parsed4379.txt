well, after spending over 40 hours on the game, I have to say, this is the best assassins creed since brotherhood. You get right into the story and your character has a very strong charisma. The ability to explore and do just about whatever you want is a nice change. I trully enjoyed the naval battle and the concept of taking ships to add them to your fleet to complete missions is very nice. I have not finished the game because I spent more time exploring the ship wrecks, the islands, stealing ships, completing the templar hunt, etc... as I said many, many things to do and so far, I have not been bored of it. Lets not forget the other notorious pirates such Black Beard, Captain Kidd, Rackam, etc. Highly recommend this one
