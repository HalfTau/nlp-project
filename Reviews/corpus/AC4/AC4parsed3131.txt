Very good game. Nice to be a pirate for a change yes there are other pirate games I know. Some bugs were noticed but more around towards the end of the game. Like a galleon that is supposed to be ankered hanging on the side up in the air and when fighting on a boarded ship the character starting having fits and almost fell through the ship oh and I cant forget the boat rises from the depth like the The Flying Dutchman does in the Pirates of the Carribean movies.Alltogether great D
