Leave her Johnny, Leave her.Same ness as AC 3 but in less quantity. Controls feel Like a bad controler adaptation with scoups of Bullon top. Uplay just loves to add all of its advertisement wherever it can.On the bright side, the guys in the artist department have too much time on their hands and the screenwrighters love to hold your hand through most situations.I still miss AC 2 through AC Revalations. Guess Ill give them another go.
