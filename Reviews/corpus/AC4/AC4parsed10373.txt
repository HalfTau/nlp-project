Finally an Assassins Creed game stepping outside the box and succeeds wildy in doing so. Everything is fun and works so well youll want to keep playing for hours. The setting and overall style of AC3 was bland, repetitive, and uninspired. AC4 however is far more pleasing to look at, its varied, and will keep pushing you to explore. The only drawbacks would be a lack of weapon and outfit variety. None of the outfits in the base game are all that great or different from one another save for a few,  and if you like beating people in the head with a mace or an axe...or daggers, my favorite weapons...well, I hope you like swords and pistols because thats all youll be getting. Even though some of these weapons are available to other enemy pirates apparently they arent piratey or assassiney enough for you. All in all though its an excellent release for the franchise and Im excited to see whats next. Damn you Ubisoft give me a feudal Japan Assassins Creed
