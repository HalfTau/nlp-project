This game is incredibly fun. Definitely worth the purchase. Im someone who enjoyed the first AC game, loved AC2 and Brotherhood to death. I started falling off with Revelations and I just didnt finish AC3, I did not enjoy that game at all. But this game is just so much fun, I cant recommend it enough.Being out on the open ocean and spotting a ship ripe for the taking is one of the most fun feelings a game has given me this entire year.
