This Assassins Creed.This fing Assassins Creed.The optimization is terrible. Uplay is terrible. The Kenways Fleet minigame and a lot of the sidecontent is grindy, collectible hunting gahbage. Some bugs one gamebreaking for me. Long load times may be fixed by booting from an SSD. Peoples teeth are way too white for the setting.Thats all the negatives I have for it. Its GORGEOUS even on low settings, Im not kidding. It has a HUGE world ripe for plundering and looting. Shiptoship battles are amazeballs. The assassination and movement mechanics are more fluid than water the water is gorgeous as well. The settings are highly varied, with unique music for different locales. Fun characters. Extensive story. Whale watching I have a lot of fun trying to catch screenshots of whales. and DOLPHINS. You can kill almost anything that moves even if you shouldnt. Dont kill doge and mewmew.And just when you think the game cant get any more fun, beautiful, or interesting, it constantly tops itself with new locations and setpieces that you can revisit. Its just greatest Assassins Creed I have played yet I hear Rogue is just as good.Overall, get it. 10/10 as far as Assassins Creed games go Whale watching is life.
