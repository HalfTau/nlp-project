Im part of the small minority that dont think this game is the best in the series. In fact, I dont even think it should be called Assassins Creed. Black Flag feels like Ubisoft started to create a pirate game, and then halfway through decided that it should be an Assassins Creed game instead, so they tacked on a few Templar related elements. Ive played Asssassins Creed 1, 2, Brotherhood, Revalations, and 3 before this one. So I am familiar with the lore of the game and what I enjoyed in the series. For me the wheels came off with the terrible protagonist Conor in 3. Assassins Creed 3 and 4 both feel disjointed to me, and disconnected from the Assassin roots. Somehow the games have become less and less about finding out about the history of the Assassins and their struggle with the Templars, and more about individual characters that just fall into the organization by chance.The game looks fine, the naval warfare from 3 is back and has been expanded upon greatly  so much so that it makes out a giant chunk of the game so if you didnt enjoy that aspect give this a skip  and combat works well enough, but for me this game is just missing something. Like the core of the game somehow went lost in translation. I dont much care for Conor or Edward, and the stealth element has been almost completely removed from this game as well as to a lesser extent its predecessor. In many cases you will be faced with scenario where stealth either isnt possible, or you dont have time to deal with it. The game encourages full frontal attacks in which you endlessly counter attack until heaps of bodies surround you.Perhaps if this was a completely separate game with a different story line I could have enjoyed it, but as an Assasins Creed game I have to say that Im disappointed, especially given the extremely hyperbolic reviews Ive read. 6/10.
