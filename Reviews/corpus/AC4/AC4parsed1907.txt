Nice game.BUT it uses the Uplay DRM by UbisoftAND Uplay stopped syncing saves to the cloud some time ago to fix thingsAs a result, your saves are not synced anywhere, and you can lose them any time.If you add to that the tendency of Uplay to just stop working until reinstalled, and that your saves are in the Uplay install directory, and that unless you look for it, nobody tells you that the save file is its only copy... Recipe for disaster.
