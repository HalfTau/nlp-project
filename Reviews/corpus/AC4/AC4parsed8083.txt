Sadly as with all games in the Assassinating Creed franchise, this game was not about murdering the members of the postgrunge rockband Creed. And although I am still disappointed with these circumstances, this game has good pirate stuff. Despite the disclaimer during game startup warning me that the game was designed, developed and produced by a multicultural team of various religious faiths and beliefs, its pretty obvious from the cobbled together abstract scifi t it was made by French Canadians.
