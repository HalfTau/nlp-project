Do yourself a favor and go to the Steam Community Discussion boards and read about all the issues with the pc version of this game. If you must play it now then head down to your local Gamestop and pick up a console version,  because until Ubisoft patches theout of the PC version this is going to be the worst 60 that youve ever spent. Trust me.UPDATE  I was able to get the game working using the CTRLALT DELETE Task Manager method just before the game loads then clicking the game icon on the taskbar to launch. The game itself has an issue when changing screen resolutions. I cant quite run it smoothly on max settings with a GTX 680M but maybe Ubisoft will optimise the game in the future. Its still a good looking game at just a little below max settings. I wouldnt recommend the PC version in its current state at a 60 price point until it is optimised a little more, but I would say go for it if the price was reduced to 40 and you had a gpu equivalent or greater than a GTX 680M which according tois somewhere between GTX 580 and GTX 570. Although if you happen to have a PS4 and dont want to upgrade your video card then google/youtube some reviews of the PS4 version and you may want to go that route.
