Absolutely fantastic game! Spent over 60h on it and finished most of the side content but not all! Amazing open world fillled with so many amazing things to do! THe immersion is simply wonderfull! Still has some of the good old assasins creed glitch  ie  not always jumping where you want to, some wonky transitions between cinematics and gameplay, but AC has learned to create a much better and much more emersive world that feels living and breathing. As an assasins game i was a little bit let down by the story even though many people will greatly appreciate it, i thought it strayed to far from the classic Assassin vs templar storyline that i enjoy and concentrated a little to much on the life of a pirate which is not to say that that is bad, simply... not really an AC gameThe pirate theme on the other hand is amazing and entertaining. The sheer amount of pirate things to do is simply fantastic!I fully recommend this game, especially if you are not a huge fan of the AC series! Also to note, I have not played AC3 and understand 99.99 of the story so i dont think it necessary to play it! Go, PLAY IT NOW! HAVE FUN!! !
