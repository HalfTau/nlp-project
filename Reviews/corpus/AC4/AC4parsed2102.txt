if you want a compelling main character, you need to look somewhere else. the side characters like black beard and calico jack bring the story to a point where you wont totally lose interest. story telling has never been a strong feature in the assasssins creed franchise, but i would count this games as marginally better than most excluding the ezio games. the real reason for this game is the naval combat. its where i sunk all of my hours, and if you enjoy pirate combat at all i say it is definitely worth picking it up
