If there was one assains creed which wasnt buggy, had a EPIC storyline, and made me have so much fune i couldnt put it down, then this is the game. It is the one assains creed i have to say is perfect. I cant recomend this game any less. The graphics are AMAZING even for a 2013 game, they seem like 2015 graphics, and it is just the best experience possible. Thank you Ubisoft, even if this is just one of the few assains creed games which hold true to their intensions.
