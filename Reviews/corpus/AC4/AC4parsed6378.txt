Wow! An amazing game!  I have played the previous games, but they were quite restrictive.  This game is massive.  So many places to explore and little islands to comb.  The naval warfare is very refreshing and the visuals especially on the open ocean are incredible.  The story is actually fairly good.  The combat is normal.  Easy, but rewarding and there are many different ways to kill someone   For spending just 10 bucks during a sale, it is probably one of the best games for the price.  Wait, best games ever!
