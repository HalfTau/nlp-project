One of my favorite AC games, too bad it runs like sht. Refunded.Played mulitples time over on PS3 and PS4, the PC port is damn terrible.Shows you how much a company like Ubisoft wants people to get the most of of their PC community with these terrible business practices. Even on sale its not even worth getting it. Id much rather buy a PS3 again and play on there than struggle running it on my PC on normal settings...absolute joke.
