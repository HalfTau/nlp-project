yes, i recommend this game. VERY MUCH so. i have a caution for those whom have more than one email/uplay account, however. if you put in your CD key to a NEW uplay account like i did, DONT FORGET THE EMAIL YOU PUT IT UNDER like i did. i did this, after having 7 hunter Man o Wars captured, 50 animus completion, and Elite boat upgrades unlocked! because of my lack of anger management, i now have to REBUY and start again.. with a new keyboard HAVE FUN!
