Im not going to rate the story, which has thus far been pretty amazing. I have spent fortytwo hours in this game and Ive only managed to get through maybe a little under half of the main storyline. The reason for this is the vast amount of gameplay to be found. In previous AC games I would beat the game first and then go through and unlock everything. However, this game is so good that I havnt been able to stop doing the extra side missions in order to finish the game. Needless to say, that is the highest praise that I think can be laid at the feet of any video game. So enjoy, this is amazing.On the other side of things I do want to point out that there are some glitches few and far between thankfully. Also, and Im not sure if this is just because I use a controller, but occassionally Ill have issues with the free running mechanics.
