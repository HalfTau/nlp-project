It could be the greatest game ever. iest naval battles, stupid ugly ram, who could made such stupidity in that game? If you ram the ship your bowsprit will be broken! Manowars more faster then sloops? Hah thats an idiotism. Sail against the wind with all the sails? How stupid. And what to do if you bought game year after and there no  more community challenges? Caribbean sea? Looks like lake, every time you sail there is a land on the horizon, A lot of ships make game so easy to find some booty. Game just sucks. great idea but as always, UBI have spoiled the greatest game. Even dont want to replaySea Dogs 2 has owned you Black flag 11!!! years ago!!! It was the most realistic pirate simulator ever.
