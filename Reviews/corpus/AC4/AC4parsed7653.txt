About 20 hours into the game, I remembered there was a story. For the first 20ish hours all I did was roam around the sea obliterating other ships with cannonballs and was never bored. The main and supporting characters were very well developed, and this has without a doubt been the pirate game I have been waiting for for so long.Did I mention you hunt whales with harpoons? Yeah, thats a thing too
