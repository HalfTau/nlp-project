This game rocks. You are an assassin and a pirate at the same time. You get to hunt animals on land and at sea to get items for crafting. Also sailing a pirate ship with a crew of pirates singing sea shantys in the background totally makes me feel like a pirate. There is a big map to sail around on too. All in all I would have to say this game is great! Buy it now!
