After playing for hours, I realize I hate sailing so bad. It doesnt like previous AC games, which I would spend my time running and walking. Instead, I found myself among the sea for over half of the game, fighting and looting other ships. Personally, I hate all the parts that have ship  sail in them. Other than those, great. Good story, cool characters Kidd is cute xD, not so cool combat moves.
