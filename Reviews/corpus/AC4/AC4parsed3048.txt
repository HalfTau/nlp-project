Alright, after being kind of let down by Revelations and disappointed by AC 3, I actually thought I was done with this franchise, as much as I loved the previous games. Since the ending of AC3 also concluded with the Desmondstory, I wasnt interested at all in any upcoming games.Got this game after a while for 5  summer sale, thought Id give it a try.After finishing it, the thoughts that I had while playing it confirmed themselves This is defenitely the best AC game I have ever played! Why?Great missions/ level design I missed that in the last 2 games, especially Revelations, this one has some really fun stealth missions as well as actionSome of the best features of AC3 got improved in this game SHIPSEdward might be a better protagonist than Ezio what?Cool characters in general a joy after AC3Story was suspenseful and really made me feel somethingThe real life events were surprisingly entertainingYou can finally aim with your pistol...Longer than any AC game I have played beforeAnd there is more to it, love this game, even better than AC2 and Brotherhood. The only negative thing I can really think about are a few bugs, but not nearly as bad as in previous games.Might give the new games a try as well sometime.
