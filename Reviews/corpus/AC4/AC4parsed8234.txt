Creed 3, this is better. Worth the 60Amazing game. Great story, graphics, and gameplay. Game cant be ran on ultra with sli 670s and below due to laggy performance with sli cards and not enough power in these cards.I always wanted to like Assassins Creed, the idea of a parkourish game about assassins always appealed to me. Sadly however, despite trying Assassins Creed, and Assassins Creed 2, I never finished either. This is the first Assassins Creed game ive tried since then and ive gotta say I enjoyed it immensely.My criticism would be that while most of the game is fun? The story missions can be as tedious as they were in the other assassins creed titles.pirates enough said!Best Pirate Game ever! Best AC game in the series too. they kept the animus mumbojumbo to a minimum this time compared to the previous games. the graphics are gorgeous and the main character Edward is likeable rogue just replaced Ezio for me!. the ship battles are a lotta fun and theres plenty things to do beside the main storyline as well. The Uplay bits can be a bit annoying at times but i can live with it i guess.Highly recommended. A 9/10!Absolutely amazing game! I love it so much i would recommend it to anyone. I love the ship battles you can do in this game and think this game was really well done! 10/10Best Assassins Creed game. No question about it. in pirates man! I mean... come on!
