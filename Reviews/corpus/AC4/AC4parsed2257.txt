I love this game but the performance is terrible. If you have a console I recommend it for that instead. Even after a major upgrade performance hovers around 30fps and dips into the low 20s when there is a lot of vegetation.EDIT If you have an NVIDIA 10 Series card like me the game stutters out of control its horrendous.MSI 970GTX 1060AMD FX 63508 GB DDR3
