Though not the best storyline that UBISOFT have come up with, this is the best pirate game out. The off ship gameplay is reminiscent of AC2 though they seem to have gotten rid of that pesky random jumping in the wrong direction bug.The ship to ship combat is enjoyable and you can still board a ship and take out the crew yourself.When you have completely upgraded your ship, there are still ships out there that are a challenge, so the game does not become boring closer to the end.Overall a very enjoyable experience.
