This one is one of my 3 fav series in franchise with Assassins Creed II and Assassins Creed BrotherhoodProsfighting system started from AC3no more complicated crafting windowsGrand Theft Boat except you only stay on your own shipcharismatic main heroKenways fleet you send your fleet on missions and they bring you stuffinteresting main story, sequences quite differ from each other by mood, locations and by things you do, unlike in AC1/AC3 where you basically hunt each templar per sequenceTHANK GOD no more wanted system on lands, that means no more killing witnesses, bribing heralds and removing poster every 3 minutesawesome wanted system on the sea kill boats  kill bigger boats bigger rewards  kill even bigger boats even bigger rewards, and when youve had enough, turn off pirate hunters by bribing dudes on the landsa lot of upgrades for Edward and Jackdaw, but sometimes they require you to find special recipessoundtracks personally I love all assassins creed games soundtracksCons for all AC gameoverstretched gameplay by missions whereyou have to quietely follow dudesyou have to take a fing walk with NPCsviewpoints srsly I hate them, I usually try to visit ALL viewpoints in the beginning of the gameCons specifically for ACBFbad optimisation srsly, system req says Nvidia GeForce GTX 470, mines is a twice of efficient and still 40 fps in big places cities, jungles etc, but even worse has AC Unityno more Desmonds Adventures /, starting from Black Flag the present day scenes go worse and worse Multiplayer I really suck at it, so I dont want to judge itthats a VERY different expirience no more waiting around, you mostly have like 1 minute to livecustom game modes, where you can fully customize session rules, and by fully I mean really fully e.g make a game where only rifles are allowedI suggest you buy console version, or this one if you have latest gen graphic card for 60 fps performance
