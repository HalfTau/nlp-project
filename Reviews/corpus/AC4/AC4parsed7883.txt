The story completely redefines Assassins Creeds timeline. Forget what youve learned before, because it all changes. A bit of a difficult game to run properly, but well worth it. Best character in the series, possibly the best story. The characters are much more 3D than most games, and are well built. The AIs could use small work here and there, and certain mechanics become somewhat worthless after a while, but still stay sharp. 9.5/10, and worthy of any award presented to it.
