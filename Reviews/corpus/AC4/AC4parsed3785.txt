Finally beaten. Somewhat of a slog towards the end. The game really entices you to complete every goal. I even limited my goals and did not seek out the fragments, thank God. Awesome lead. Most fun Ive had with AC franchise since AC2. Kenway is awesome and has a great ending. Sad to see Adewalesp? leave you but was happy to find out hes the leading man for the Freedom Cry DLC which I am working on now. If it werent for the slog I would give it 5/5.
