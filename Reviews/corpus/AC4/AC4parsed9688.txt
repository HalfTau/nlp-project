I am enjoying AC4 rather much. Its the best AC game Ive played, mainly that the activities are fairly enjoyable. I found myself exploring and enjoying the subplot quests and doing those primarily while in most AC games I tend to skip them. The one exception for me, however, was the underwater diving bell quests. Not quite as compelling for some reason.
