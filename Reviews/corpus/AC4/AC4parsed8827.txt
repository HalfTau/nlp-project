Unchanged Assassins Creedstyle storyline mission mechanics of stealthily trailing and assassinating various Templars are boosted by a multitude of fun open world activities. Whenever something gets boring, try something else for a while. Sail around and plunder vessels for upgrade materials for your ship, clear a small island of collectibles, harpoon a giant shark in a row boat, hunt an ocelot, or use a diving bell to explore undewater ship wrecks. Actually, dont do the underwater bits  theyre probably the worst part of the game. The characters are great fun, including Edward Kenway as the pirate you play as, and the cast features famous pirates like Edward Blackbeard Thatch, Anne Bonny, Mary Read, Benjamin Hornigold, John Calico Jack Rackham, Charles Vane, and Bartholomew Black Bart Roberts. A very welcome return to form and a solid entry in the Assassins Creed series, although I expect Black Flag to become a franchise of its own in the near future.
