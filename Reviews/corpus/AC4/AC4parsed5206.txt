One of my favourite games of all time. This game perfectly capures my imagination of being a pirate. It also has a very driving storyline, beautiful graphics, countless side quests and collectibles.This game isnt perfect, it has various glitches that may ruin the experience if you want a perfect game and dont like all that. I thought a ship falling from the sky is hilarious and definately am glad it is broken in some aspects. However, some glitches may prevent you from completing missions or make you go back in the save to redo them. It wasnt a big problem, but it is to be mentioned.One of the best parts is the music in this game. Hearing sea shanties sang by your crew really just made this game the best for me along with what else I mentioned earlier.I highly reccommend this game for anyone to play though to completion.10/10Lowlands away.
