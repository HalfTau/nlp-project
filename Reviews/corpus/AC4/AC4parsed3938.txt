please note that i have never finished an assasins creed game before, untill i played this onealright so lets get to it, your gonna be sailing in this game, all the time, in fact you need to sail across the sea to do anything, but fortunate for us, the sailing turned out to be my favorite part of this game, when you start out with your little jackdaw, it isint much better then a dingy, you will constantly fear other ships because they will probably destroy you, but il tell ya nothing felt better than upgrading that thing into a monster and casualy destroying royal navy fleets because they were in your way, and while your at it, you can take enemy ships to do errands and get you extra cash your gonna need to do it if you want the sea to be safe, and surprisingly, sailing from one island to the next never feels boring, with the crew singing sea shanties and random events happening,and if you dont want to spend time sailing you can always fast travel. so lets kick this off with a solid 9/10 when it comes to the ship part of the game1 because i find it slightly annoying bording ships to get more loot, though its optional.now the assasin part of assasins creed, to be honest, it was pretty fun, though i admit i dont try to be a master assasin and kill every enemy undetected, theres a interesting charm when you use a rope dart to hand your enemies onto a tree, or make them fight eachother with a beserk dart, altough the sword play is much more entertaining to me, being able to fight large amounts of enemies fluently and skillfuly use a half dead spanish guard as a human shield to block bullets while fighting four other guards really adds to the pirate experience, disarming them, shooting them, and using the enviroment to kill as well are features. although it can be a little unresponsive at times, the swordplay/ assasin tools will get a nice 8/10.now actual stealth, it...dosent make sence, i mean yeah you need allot of ways to be stealthed for this game to work, but the guard must be  to not see a guy in all black carrying two swords, four pistols, a blowpipe and a hood, in a crowd of 3 people. other then that, it works as any other assasins creed game would, id give it a 7.5/10what now, charecters i guess?so you are edward kenway, in my oppinion my favorite charecter of all the assasins creed charecters, i dont know why, but even when hes being a totaland does stuff for his own personal gain, i cant hate the guy, and he gets one heck of an endingno spoilerinos, now other charecters, honestly the only guys i gave aabout where blackbeard,kid, and adawele your trusty ship quartermaster, the rest i didint bother to remember. cant really rate this because i cant compare it with other stories because i never finished em.and now the most boring part, adventuring in abstergo industries, gotta be honest at first it felt  being removed from the world of pirates, but i got interested in the backstory and the hiddenthey had, to the point where i heard every single tape they had, and those ers are long, although i never had closure in the end and left me with even more questions, though i guess they need to continue the story with the next game, but we all know what that one is, overall il give this game a 9 out of 10, i really did enjoy this game immensly and will consider getting future assasins creed games not unity.also uplay has never dissconnected for me once,i downloaded it from there website and people who complain about the code, steam tells you the code and lets you copy it with a push of a buttonunless you told it to close and that would be your fault. sorry this review went everywhere and i didint explain the side objective, crafting or legendary ships that willyour , but if you play this game, your gonna find out yourself.TLDRgreat game, Uplay didint  up for me, try it, its 5
