Wow....This game is amazing. I had previously called Assassins Creed II my favorite, and now I can say that this is now equal to if not better than II. The story is fantastic and heartwrenching. The naval battles were fantastic and Edward is a fantastic character.   Visually the game is stunning, even on the lowest settings. The open ocean is an amazing sight to behold. The game is a pretty good length, it took me about 20 hours to beat it. The modern day portion of the game is very different than the previous titles, but it still pretty cool. Reminds me of Deus Ex if you remove the action. Allinall I loved this game and would highly reccommend it to Assassins Creed fans and Pirate fans alike. 9.5/10
