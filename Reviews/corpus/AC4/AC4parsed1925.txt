Before I get into this review Id like to adress a situation with AC3.AC3 followed the story of Revelations where it ended off, Desmond woke up from his coma and was off to another new adventure.In AC3 you overall got also introduced to a new Assassin Connor which most people call him uninteresting or lacking in terms of what Ezio had in store for you, but you shouldnt really put much blame on AC3 because of the Assassin design and what his atitude was in general.Connor in my honest opinion was a brutal as hell Assassin, a loving and caring person when it came to his natural enviormeant the Village and the Homestead, but a literall devil on the battlefield, characther design and atitude in general were pretty good and didnt lack in anything if you understood the point of his characther overall.AC3 overall was a pretty great game cant be top tier like AC2 or BF but it was a pretty great game in general.Now for BF.BF is either Great, Terific, Amazing, Glorious or God tier. Its pretty much an undescribable game for me really I enjoyed the hell out of it as a fan of the franchise for a long time, the overall core gameplay of it was smooth and fast paced and it was just an adrenaline rush in its own ways.The game offered us a better and more extende Naval Combat system which we have been asking for from AC3 and its probably the most fun you could also have in the game, the game in general is mainly covered 60 sea and 40 land making the Naval Combat one of the more important aspects of the game.The Naval Combat in BF is far superiour than what other Pirate/Ship battle games have and its quite alot of fun to just destroy the hell out of some giant fleets.Now overall the story and characther of the game.In BF the story picks off some time latter from AC3.Overall your characther is unknown as he is some kind of employe working for Abstergo as a double agent of some sorts since you technicaly share intel with the Assassins troughout the game in the modern day missions of the game  Shaun and Rebeca  overall the modern day segments are covered in a first person perspective and are just a bit odd, fun but odd, the fun thing you could really have in the modern day segments is just randomly collecting some QR codes and hacking PCs, yes hacking is a thing in this game, the hacking is pretty fun altough it repeats the same short minigame of either switching frequencies, turning a line from point A to point B in order to unlock the file or just a simple cracking the firewall type of game, pretty short but they are also pretty fun in general.The story of BF takes before the actions of AC3 so that means your way behind playing as the grandfather of Connor Kenway.Captain Edward James Kenway or as people called him that started off as a privateer at the begining of the game, overtaken for the lust of having a better life, greed is his main priority he takes as he pleases and doesnt give a rotten damn about anything, but hey thats the usual which you expect from a pirate, but troughout the game thinking that he may be some bad characther he overall isnt, he did get a bad reputation with both secret organizations but overtime learnt the morals of which had taken him quite some time to understand, over that course he sought to fight along side the Creed and follow its morals. He also was technicaly the founder and Grand Master of the English Assassins Brotherhood. He grew to be quite a likeable characther in my opinion atleast.The core gameplay of it is as same as it was in AC3 with a few difrent changes to fit the playstyle of a pirate, duel wielding cutlasses and owning 4 flintlock pistols is the deal with AC4, the naval combat also has been improved from AC3 and also making it the main thing in the game.The game adds another important characther to it the Jackdaw which is your ship that you sail trough the Caribeans plundering and taking as you want, its important that you take of your ship as it becomes quite the game changer if you upgrade it to max and all.Overall the game is good itll take you aroudn 2023h to complete that is if you spend next to no time on the naval contratcs, templar hunts, assassin contracts and such oh yeah and upgrading your ship which will take you quite a while to find the parts as there also a new mechanic added to game called Treasure hunting, you can find treasure maps from dead or unconcious corpses stranded on the shores of the locations you discover, each treasure map will containt either gold or an upgraded plan for the jackdaw and some aditional gold, sure gota love that pirate feel afterwards.Anyways got a bit offtrack there.The game at its base is great and all has a very small amount of glitches  exclude the sinken rising ship thing which ocasionaly happens with the Jackdaw  and so fort.The gameplay is great and is just amazing in some sense as you feel like a genuine pirate with the tools at your disposal.A much recommended game and also a favourite in my category as it just captures everything you could need in an AC game.
