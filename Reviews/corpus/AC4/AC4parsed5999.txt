As a long time fan of AC series I was sceptical of buying this game, seeing as how this game didnt have much connections with the assassins creed. BUT! The more I played it the more I started enjoying it. It feels like this game had more focus on the enjoyment and fun of a game rather than a story progression in the AC series. And yes, the rumor is true....There IS a total mindfck at the end of the game, that you as a AC fan will enjoy. Here are the points of pros and consPROSLong campaignFun and changing enviromentsGood animationsLots of side missionsGood graphicsYOU GET TO MEET BLACKBEARD!!Interesting and fun main characterSea shanties to really get you into the sailing moodGood voiceactingLegendary shipsThe ability to board enemy shipsThe enviroment seems belivable and alive, both at see and landCONSYou stick with the same ship throughout the entire game. Sure you can upgrade it but the size remains the same.You only have swords as your blade weapons at your disposal, unlike AC2 and AC3 where you could have axes and knifes.Kenways fleet seemed boring and uselessWE WANT MORE FORTS!!This might be a crazy idea, but wouldnt it be funny/cool if you could battle some seamonsters? Maybe the legendary cracken?The Do me Johnny shantySome minor glitches.All in all.....get the game
