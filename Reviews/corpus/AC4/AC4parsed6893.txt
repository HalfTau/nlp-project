This game is all about the pirate ships, if they cut that out and packaged it without Ubisofts DRM client I would probably buy straight away. In the meantime however, while the ship to ship combat is wonderfull, it still feels like just another practise in Ubisoft throwingat this IP to see what sticks. The AI system is equivelant to that of most house hold appliances, DRM is clunky and annoying, control mapping and selection was written by an infant. In truth this iteration tries more than previous to expand on the existing mechanics, but still needs work on improving the existing systems. Ultimately, I would recommend purely on the basis of the ship combat, but there is little else to justify paying full price, maybe wait till it hits the bargain bin.
