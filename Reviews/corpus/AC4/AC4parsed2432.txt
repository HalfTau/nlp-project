The last Assassins Creed I played that I genuinely enjoyed, even if they kept taking me to work at Google when all I wanted to do was be a pirate. At some point I think they forgot that the best part of their game was the history stuff, not the weird future scifi, particularly with where THAT stuff goes.Blowing ships up, listening to sea shanties, fishing, and just sailing around are incredibly satisfying. Honestly I remember playing AC3 and thinking man, these ship missions are the best thing in this game, and apparently a lot of people agreed with me and we got a game that was 50 ship missions. And its awesome.The plot was also surprisingly impactful, the ending had me tearing up. But I blame a beautiful rendition of The Parting Glass for most of that.If this games 10, and youre not utterly broke, totally go for it.
