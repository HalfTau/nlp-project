i loved it! Untill i restarted this game...i didnt like the story because i already knew what to do and theres not enought parkour unlike AC3 and ACU..theres just too much sea envoled with this game..dont buy this unless you want brain damage. but if you do buy it just do the story once and freeroam untill you get bored of it
