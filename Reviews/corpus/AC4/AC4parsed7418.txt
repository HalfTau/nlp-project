When Assassins Creed III was released , I play it and I was really disappointed in the game, instead of a step forward the game is a step backwards. The gameplay mechanics was horrible, optimization was terrible too.It was no longer the Assassins Creed I like and Ive play before. One of my favorite was Brotherhood , and Revelation being similar to it too.But AC IV fix all this , borrowing some of the new features and gameplay from AC III and reverting everything back to like how AC Brotherhood and Revelation was but with huge improve graphics.So yeah I will definitely Recommend this game for It felt just like AC Brotherhood which I like , and best of all now its in Pirate theme. You dont get many good Pirate games least no ones I know of. So Im really anjoyig myself with AC IV , like many reviewers said instead of bothering with boring old struggle between the Assassins and Crusaders / Templars.Your a Pirate who follow no rules but your own and whatever you do its all about you and filling your own pocket with riches.At last I finally do feel myself being a ruthless Assassin who kills and hunt for money which it suppose to be !
