Brilliant game! Story was captivating from begining to end and really draws you in to it. Absolutely would recommend to anyone.Only one bad thing about the game which was the parts about abstergo entertainment and it being a simulation at some company, but thats easy to ignore and contributes less than nothing to the game.Its really fun to sail your ship and hear your crew singing as well!
