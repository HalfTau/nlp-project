The game is not optimized for the pc at all, and if you have an AMD card forget about playing it Not that great on Nvidia either. The frame rates total rubbish. Yes if you disable Vsync through the control panel its slightly better. Keep in mind that Betterquot  GoodGame. Not worth the money that it costs, I feel cheated out of my money. You can tell that Ubisoft does not care for its consumer or its loyal gamer. My recomendacion is do not buy, and is you must get on console.
