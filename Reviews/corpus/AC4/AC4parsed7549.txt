Visually breath taking and very good gameplay, the storms on the open see make it feel like you are really in one minus the danger of course, my one gripe for this game is that they had the E button do to many things and often will do things you did not want it to do. Well I guess another gripe would be when running and trying to save time you will often try to run up a wall that you cannot even if you are running away from the wall. But all in all this is the best assassins creed game so far in my opinion, I like how they explained what happened from assassins creed 3 without going to far in depth just enough for you to understand where this one falls in the timeline and how it is even possible for the game to continue. The soun effects in the game are very realistic the waves the birds the cannons even the sound of the wind in the sails is dead on, if you like naval combat from the game Pirates of the burning sea this is the game for you. I have yet to test out the multiplayer but if it is anything like the multiplayer from assassins creed 3 it should be good though the maps did get a bit repeatative however if you are playing this game for the multiplayer you are missing out on a wonderful story line.
