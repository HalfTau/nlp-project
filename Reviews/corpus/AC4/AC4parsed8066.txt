This game really let me down. It just plain sucks. Really. I dont even over act.AC1 was awesome, the next parts ACII, brotherhood and revelations were awesome as well, In terms of story line. I loved the story, the charm, italy, the orient, collecting weapons. Apart from that I knew those memories were mine. Playing as Desmond sitting in the Animus fleeing Abstergo and sabotaging them really got me going.AC4 is NOTHING of that all. AC3 gets good in the eyes of AC4, as you still are Desmond ...AC4 sucks, Youre not even an Assassin. Desmond apart from the mention he Donated his Dna for memories to abstergo. Oh, and you are employed in abstergo. I mean NO WAY ! weve been playing 4 games AGAINST the templars, sabotaging them, running from them. We learned to be an assassin ! Now they stow us in Abstergo Entertainement its not industries anymore... Its just wrong. I do not count on playing any further after a mear two hours.Bad game compared to the other 4 games that stuck together and had me interested.
