What a great openworld adventure game. One minor complaint but not major enough to prevent me from recommending it.PositivesThe huge openworld game environment which is pretty common for any of the new AC gamesExcellent graphics and settingTreasure hunting that actually requires you to use your brain to find the hidden bootyThe NPCs are funnyLots of types of sidequests to keep you busy the diving quest are the best IMHOGood, long main quest that will take you a while to complete Im not even through it yetNegativesOnly one ship my only gripe. You should have been able to purchase, upgrade, and sail different types of ships
