One of the best Assassins Creed games, although it isnt much of an assassin game.ProsThe world.  I could sail around exploring forever.  BeatifulShip combat is fantastic.  I didnt even get the game expecting to like this, but I love it.Variety of items and weaponsdiving missions are funConsMany abilities/finishers were removed that were in Assassins Creed 3.  This game is better, so Im not sure why it removed portions of combat.The game seems blurry/foggy on all settings.  Hard to describeYOU CANT SWIM UNDERWATER OUTSIDE OF DIVING MISSIONS.  WHAT KIND OF PIRATE GAME IS THIS?I love the game, but it has some unfortunate limitations.  Still one of the best AC games.
