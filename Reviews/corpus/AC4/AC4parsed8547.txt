READ ALL TOP NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME.test systems ability to play the gamePositiveGame play This newest installment of the creed series is bring a refined combat system making fighting fluid and easy also fun to use. The new climbing or free running, that had been simplified in number 3 has showed itself once again proving to be fun and easy.Flowing sword play and explosive cannon battles are but icing of the cake for this game.Story As always the writers at Ubisoft have written a masterpiece, the story seemed to have no strange or abrupt periods. Running smoothly and being the meat on the bones for the story lovers.Sea Battles One thing I personally liked about number 3 was the fact we could sail, but I also found a distinct lack of instances where we could go sailing. Through out the whole game sailing is a major player and extremely fun to do, commanding naval ships from schooners to mana wars and taking forts for the black flag is both exciting and productive being one of the best ways to make money in the game.Graphics An amazing game when it comes to graphics, texture detail is great and maps are vast with few loading screens NOTE I am running the game on max settings with every effect enabled on a 1440 x 900 HD resolution screen, my view may be different than yours.NegativeGame play there are instances where freerunning will fail or you are aiming and try running doing this will fire what ever weapon you are using.Story I honestly cant think of anything I would prefer to change.Sea battles When youre not aiming you fire a usable heavy shot no matter what.Graphics Tasking on your system, recommend having a high end gaming computer for advanced graphics NOTE The next gen games such as this and cod ghosts run massively different on almost the exact same systems.Conclusion MAKE SURE YOU CAN RUN THIS GAME BEFORE YOU BUY! The AC4SP.exe can have crash problems here are some links that helped me fix itNOTE multiple fixes may need to be applied.Personal Score 8.5/10Having to instal the uplay is very annoying and the lack of a fix for the AC4SP.exe may be fixed by the time this is out is also concerning. As a long time fan of the franchise I see nothing wrong with the game itself just issues that are unresolved and annoying boot things like uplay.
