I went into this game expecting a completely different storyline, Assassins Creed 3 was suppose to be the end of the Desmond story but in a fashion it continues in 4. I was not disappointed, the story has been very well written through out the entire series.I must also confess that being a rum drinker and already knowing the song Drunken Sailor I was pretty happy with the music through the game, usually I wind up turning it off as a distraction after hours of play but, for this, I listened and found a few more to like Worst Old Ship sometimes mistakenly called Waitin for the Day now ranks among my favoritesThe game has plenty to play through on both land and sea, Ive had a ball blasting and ramming ships Down to tha drink! as well as the usual fights and skulking about. There are a few of the annoying scripted fights but only for the storys sakeWith hints at more to come, I will of course look forward to seeing what may come of the future or in this case the past
