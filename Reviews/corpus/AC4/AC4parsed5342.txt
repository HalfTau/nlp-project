Assassins Creed Black Flag is one of my favorite games. The game is extremely fun and enjoyable to play. When I was playing I rarely came across bugs or glitches. In AC4 there is really never a time you are not doing anything. The game is filled with so many things to do! So I recommend that you buy this game, Its well worth it.
