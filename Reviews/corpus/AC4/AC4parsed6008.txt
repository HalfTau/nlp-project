This game has enough pirate themed content to be completely cut off from the Assassins Creed franchise, but blends the two themes well. I had no problem skipping all the other games in the series to play this, as the Assassins theme takes a backseat in this installment. Loads of fun, with rewards for risktakers, and players who invest time into game completion, particularly when it comes to ship upgrades.Well worth your money, trust me. Even if you havent played a game from the series yet.Solid 9/10
