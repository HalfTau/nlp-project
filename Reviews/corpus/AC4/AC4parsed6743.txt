The best thing about this game are the ships, really. While I do like Assassins Creed, I am beginning to feel tired of them repeating the same game mechanics in every version they release. While the ship mechanics are new, it is not what I am referring to. Its like they keep making maps that they sell as full games, when in reality they could just a easy have been DLC. I do wish they come up with something different. Every game is at their base the same, climb up, hide in secret spot, stand on top of something, dive into a bush or similar, hide in crowds etc.. I have already played the next episode Unity and yet again they will use the same mechanics. That said, the story is why at least I play these games for, and they have all been good so far. Not the best or even the most original but really quite good. And this is no different. I also enjoy playing in different ages, and this is another reason why I like these games. I feel a bit like being in a Highlander adaption from the movie which is also a reason why I liked that first movie so much. But I digress, and I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone. But like I said, I just want them to improve the game mechanics. It is getting really.... really repepetitive that spelling wasnt a mistake   and I do hope they improve it. I actually get the impression that the mechanics feel like they sometimes get in the way of the fluidity of the gameplay. Still, a very good game and you should absolutely try it, if by any chance you are one of the few who have not yet.
