Im a friggin pirate!Seriously, if you love Sid Myers Pirates, youll probably love this. What it loses in the social minigames, it makes up for in the assasinstabbiness. Theres a few pieces that could be done better  The Fleet is tacked on, and could be a better game in its own right, and the pacing is a bit off, but overall, its a highly enjoyable game, and I heavily recommend it.
