Director Gore Verbinski and the crew set sail once again for this, the third chapter in the swashbuckling Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. Captain Jack Sparrow Johnny Depp is hopelessly trapped in Davy Jones locker after a harrowing encounter with the dreaded Kracken, and now Will Turner Orlando Bloom and Elizabeth Swann Keira Knightley must align themselves with the nefarious Captain Barbossa Geoffrey Rush if they hold out any hope of saving their old friend from a fate worse than death. The East India Trading Company and its fearsome leader, Lord Cutler Beckett Tom Hollander, have taken control of the ghostly Flying Dutchman and its captain, Davy Jones Bill Nighy, and now the baleful Admiral Norrington Jack Davenport has taken the helm in a relentless bid to destroy every pirate ship in his path and bring the Age of Piracy to a violent close. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Barbossa navigate treacherous waters and face bitter betrayal as they set sail to gather the only army that can stand up to Beckett  The Nine Lords of the Brethren Court. But Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the lords, and as long as hes stuck in Davy Jones locker, Beckett and his nefarious armada are sure to emerge victorious. Theres still hope, however, if the heroic team that includes Tia Dalma Naomie Harris, Pintel Lee Arenberg, and Ragetti Mackenzie Crook can reach exotic Singapore and convince vulpine pirate Sao Feng Chow YunFat to provide them with charts and a ship. But even the powerful Brethren Court may need a bit of help from volatile sea goddess Calypso in order to weather the coming storm. With the entire future of the pirate way at stake, everyone will be forced to choose sides while drifting precariously to the edge of the earth for one final, spectacular battle. Jason Buchanan, Rovi
