Enjoyable pirate simulator, though the assassins creed saga is not anymore as interesting as could be.. there is plenty of irony on the subject ingame. Could have just been a nice pirate game. Still start it up time to time to sail of in dusk or dawn, listening to pirate chants, yearning for plunder! a much much much better game than AC3, which kinda sucked to be honest P
