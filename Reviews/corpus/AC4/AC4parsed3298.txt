Great game, but I gotta give a shout out to the other reviewers who were complaining about Uplay. Theres a little more to the installation than usual, but if you download the current version of Uplay FIRST, then come back to Steam to buy the game, you can plug the CD key in and youre good to go. Its been fun! Just proceed with caution.
