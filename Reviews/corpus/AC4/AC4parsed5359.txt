Awesome game! I have never put in so many hours into a game. I do not generally like the Assassins Creed series due to self diagnosed super ADD and the fact I always get sidetracked and cant finish missions. Black Flag is just amazing. I am a huge fan of pirates not because of the Pirates of the Caribbean movie  It was the ride that did it for me when I was 8. The game was great. You are sailing the high seas to go on missions where you save people, take out corrupt political figures, and best of all, you get into great sea skirmishes with other ships. You can raid ships, take them over for looting/repair, adding to your own fleet, or lowering your wanted level.The graphics in this game are amazing. I could not stop hitting f12 for a screen capture due to the amazing graphics feel free to check out in game pics in my profile. Water looks brilliant, textures are amazing, field of view and depth are just perfect. The jungles and villages are just full of color, amazing texture, and really cool natural looking. The environment in this game is just amazing.The side missions are worth the near 100 hours of gaming due to exploring, sea battles, and hunting. The the underwater dive bell missions are tense with many dangerous creatures such as sharks, jellyfish, and moray eels, constantly trying to kill you at any moment. If you have ever seen jaws or sharkweek, you feel very uneasy and nervous which makes the game even more engaging.This game is a must get. Whether or not you are a fan of the series.
