I had this game on PS3  and finished the whole game, including ALL side missions. But it was such a good game Assassins Creed or not that I had to purchase it again for PC and play it with epic graphics this time.Btw if Kenway wanted to score big he shouldve gone to the Indian Ocean and China Sea where the king and queen of piracy roamed, respectively. But then the game wouldnt have such a good story and it wouldnt contain iconic figures everyone has heard of, would it?
