I love the assassins creed series ever since playing the first one, and while the series has had some bumps in the road I absolutely love Black Flag  mainly due to the sailing on the open seas, which I had wanted to do ever since AC3 was released with the Aquila.I have played this game on PS3, PS4 and recently PC  it is a great game and once you get to navigate across the open world after gaining control of your own ship it gets even better.The open seas can be a bit bland in a sense with not much in the way of exploring of islands as they are normally quite empty except for some fragments, chests and wild creatures to hunt and skin, and if you ever feel like going on a pirating spree there is always an abundance of ships about.Nothing beats taking on a fleet of Man of Wars to get the blood pumping that or reenacting Mobywith harpooning a White Whale!
