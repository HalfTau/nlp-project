Port is arguably good, tons of graphics and control options. Massive downside is performance, the game has a hard time maintaining 60 fps with even top tier hardware. On a 4690k, 8Gb of RAM and a GTX 770 4gb, I spend most of my time in the mid to low 50s, no matter how much I lower the settings. Doesnt seem so bad until you start to feel the suttering every 2030 seconds, the game will lose 25 frames or so and thats even with the triple buffering issue fixed. The game beneath all the issues is wonderful, but good luck getting there.Id say I recommend it, because I still enjoy the game, but that was after several hours of messing with it, then finally admitting defeat and lowering my standards for the sake of wenches and booty. If the things listed dont sound tolerable, then give her a wide berth.
