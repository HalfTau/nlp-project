This was suprisingly a good Assassins Creed game. The ship gameplay is great, the graphics, open world, map and the atmosphere ingeneral feels very good, theres a lot to do, a decent campaign and good customisation.Assassins Creed burned out for me after Revelations therefore my 8hrs only, the game gets quite repetitive after you have progressed midway throughout the story. Everything else especially the ship combat is great though.Buy this if you have never tried AC IV because it is actually not that bad.
