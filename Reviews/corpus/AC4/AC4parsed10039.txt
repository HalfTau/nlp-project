I am a fan of Assassins Creed universe I love all AC titles, but this one just ROCKED my world.What a brilliant mind, to put a plot from Assassins Creed in a pirate era. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay brilliant and the action ... oh the action! I can sail all day wondering whats next, what will I find on a deserted island, whats next to plunder, which ship should I attack .. and so on. The BEST game with pirates, the BEST of Assassins Creed series, and the BEST game of the year yeah you heard me wright  and I own/ played GTA5 on my PS3.Assassins Creed IV Black Flag its a game that its a MUST for every gamer that calls itself a gamer, and above all a PIRATE. You just have to try it ... I dont care how .. just do it! OH! And the naval warfare ... oh my ... you just have to experience this.Ill take my bottle of rum and Ill go find somethin go plunder. YARRR!!! 10/10
