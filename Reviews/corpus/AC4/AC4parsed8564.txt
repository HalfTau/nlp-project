After the disappointment that was Assassins Creed III, Black Flag is a step in the right direction for the premier runjumpkill franchise. Theres still a lot of annoying elements, such as the outdated combat system and clearlynotfitforpurpose control scheme, but the majority of the game is actually a whole lot of fun.The muchtouted naval system is an improvement on AC3s, but I feel like theyre putting too much emphasis on it. Its almost like theyd rather distract you than fix the obvious problems with the core gameplay mechanics. Nevertheless, its a feature and a mighty impressive one at that.If you werent a fan of the reallife side of the AC storyline, then youll be disappointed that its back, though it seemed a bit less pretentious than in previous outings. Its always been one of those love it or hate it scenarios, but I felt they did a better job this time.Its not a difficult game, either, which can be good or bad depending on your preference, but the lack of difficulty actually seemed to make it more fun to play, as you could set up awesome air assassinations much more easily. The stealth sections are much more forgiving than in previous titles, but still can be frustrating if youre going for undetected objectives.Outside of those issues above, the game is a gem and legitimately fun to play. Kenway has swag much like Ezio did in AC2, which filters down through the story and into the game itself, as every action he takes is saturated in swashbuckling cool. A highly enjoyable game with minor issues that dont really detract too much from the game experience.
