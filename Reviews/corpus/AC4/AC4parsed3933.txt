So far so great! I am really enjoying this game so far. Once I realized that for some silly reason Steam couples the game with a wickedly outdated version of Uplay and then just hopped over to their site and got an updated version it works great. On a quick side note I love that I can launch the game with the controller once I open Uplay, without any third party software at all. So really to all the people who are bad mouthing this game becuase of Uplay, Google is not just for porn, and their are plenty of helpful threads on Steam as well. I just had to throw that out there and get that over with.As for the game itself it is a lot of fun and thus far the story is really interesting and engaging. I could do without the sequences outside of the Animus though, to be honest, that feels a little tacked on. Other than that it is good though. The boarding cutscenes are sadly dissatifying though since they are all the same, if you could skip them I would be super happy, happier if they didnt phone that in, but that is pretty easy to overlook in the long run.I would love to write more right now but I have the high seas to sail, and swashes to buckle! YAR MATEY!
