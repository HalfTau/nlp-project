Pirate part of the game is sweet.  Assasines Creed part is lame.Uplay is like getting sodomized by Santa Claus.  To be specific, playing the game requires absolutely no network problems with Uplay servers or your game desyncs and you restart the mission or whatever.  Uplay servers are constantly bad because they suck.  So you see the problem right?  They have created a closed loop of Suckitude.  Until Uplay is taken apart and hurled into the sun, there can be no peace on earth.  Even Origin doesnt suck to the magnitude UPLAY does.I was actually considering buying For Honor and the new South Park game until I reinstalled Black Flag and remembered why I stopped playing years ago.  Fortunatly this is the only Ubisoft Game I own.  I think I am only out 30 or so.Avoid Ubisoft games if you know whats good for you.
