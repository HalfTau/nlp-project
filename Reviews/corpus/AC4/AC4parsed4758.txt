This game is absolutely fantastic. Ive played it for countless hours on the PlayStation 4 and I just HAD to buy it on the PC. While the PC version isnt always the best, its still enjoyable. The story is a very solid 10/10 in my opinion. The ship combat is also a solid 10/10 for me. I DEFINITELY recommend this for anyone who has not played it already.
