Great Gameplay , Epic Naval combat that is too hard to get bored of it .The Carrabiean environment is just AWESOME !10/10 on the sounds , the soundtrack and the shanties as wellSuper boring sometimes during missions where youve to tail enemies  Boats/soldiers For the story  Edwards timeline is pretty good  The last 3 sequences are very nice specifically  , the ending is pretty nice and emotional.The futuristic timeline is not good at all imo, the game lost it after AC III anyways lol.Overall its a great expericne and should be played even if you have never played Assassins creed before
