Ive played 56 hours according to steams clock. Not that the game would know, since it promptly wiped the save on most recent startup. Given its now about 5 months past its launch date, this is likely the last straw on an unfortunately buggy and obsessively overrestricted PC experience.Its a beautiful game. But not worth anyones time with such a  save system. It kind of tells me to stay away from ubisoft products, since it appears this is a problem of their Uplay system so would potentially catch one by surprise with any of their games. Sadly the first steam game that has managed to actually have the cloud be a destructive element.
