Game ReviewAssassins Creed 4 Black FlagI understand that I am a few years late, most people who will ever play this game have already played it. I played it, and it was fantastic. Once this adventure got started, it was hard to put the game down.By far one of the best openworld games Ive played in recent memory, and easily the coolest pirate game I have played. The setting was interesting, the visuals were gorgeous, and purchasing all the upgrades for yourself and your ship got addicting.I only have a couple of complaints about the entire experience. One, the combat seemed a little sluggish. I would often hit the Counter button right before I got hit with a sword, just for my character to stand there motionless and get stabbed. Maybe there was input lag from my controller or something, but it annoyed me a few times. And two, I wish the story was a little more believable and less science fiction. The whole magical artifacts seemed out of place in a game that revolved around pirates, politicians, and naval combat. The story was solid, however.I nearly 100ed this game in less than two weeks. I grabbed every collectible and did every side quest. The only thing I didnt technically do were all the optional objectives for the main story missions. So the game says Im only at 96 game completion which is stupid... But Im not going to take the time to replay the story missions just to do the optional objectives. In my heart, I know I got 100.Overall I loved this game, and couldnt put it down.9/10
