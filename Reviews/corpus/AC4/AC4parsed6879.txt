I loved Assassins Creed IV. It was one of the funnest games that I had played in a long time. What I dont like is Ubisoft and uplay. The uplay servers went down one night while I was playing and not only did all my progress not be saved but my entire save file was deleted. I lost nearly 45 hours of my life that I invested into this amazingly fun game because Ubisoft and uplay sucks and now I will never buy another Ubisoft game again. But, that doesnt take away from this fantastic game.
