Warning before you get too invested in this game, disable every single cloud based feature in uplay or you will have a bad time.Lost my saves multiple times due to the brilliant uplay cloud sync. Wasted so much time watching the same unskippable cutscenes over and over and over. Now I just want it over with so I can uninstall it and forget about this experience forever. Also, there is no in game warning that your progress was not actually saved when an error has occured, it continues playing like nothing happened until you launch it next time with all save data missing.AVOID THIS GAME IF YOU CANNOT HANDLE LOSING ALL YOUR PROGRESS.Get your act together Ubisoft.
