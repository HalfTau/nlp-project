First Assasin Creed where ive cared for the story enough to watch the cut scenes.Land gameplay is classic Assasin Creed and if you have played any of the earlier releases you will feel right at home here.Ship mechanics are well implementet and you really feel like a pirate as your character stands by the rudder.Well made Assasins Creed and i highly recommend picking it up if you have a few weeks to waste playing this.
