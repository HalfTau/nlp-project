Having played a number of AC games before and after this one, Assassins Creed Black Flag is in my opinion the most fun of all the AC games. The reason for this lies not in mechanics, story or gameplay but rather in the setting. In Black Flag you are essentially a pirate first and assassin second. Ubisoft has done an amazing job of using the game engine to allow you to feel like a fully realised pirate as you scour the horizon for ships to sink or board or as you run up the rigging before taking the plunge from the crows nest into the glistening water below.On the whole the characters you meet are superb. A certain man with a black beard is a truly memorable standout.Graphics and sound are also great. Technically this game shines and is much more polished than AC Unity was upon release although considering how bad Unity was at release that is still not saying much. Running around the world is a joy and the range of weapons at your disposal means doing missions remains fun. The game also continually introduces new aspects to you such as searching for treasure underwater or developing your base or ship, meaning it never feels stale and there is always something new to do.On the negative side, after 30 hours missions do become tedious. I mean, it is an assassin game so dont be surprised if the majority of your missions involve, go here, kill x, escape. The biggest flaw of this game to me is the  whistle action which is used to attract enemies. Thankfully, Ubisoft dropped this mechanic in the next game but here it feels pretty stupid and makes the missions much less challenging. As far as possible I think using whistle should be avoided because it is so contrived and detracts from the game.The most memorable moment I had with this game was sailing into the setting sun at full speed listening to the sounds of my crews sea shanty ringing out across the water. This game has magical moments and if you fancy yourself as a pirate or an assassin it is worth exploring.8/10
