to be read in a calm voiceThis is my first review of the game, that I didnt play till now.  So why am I writing this?Because UPlay.Dont get me wrong AC4 is probably great. Thats why I bought it.But it needs UPlay and here problem begins. I neither need it nor want it, no matter what it offers and whats more important  I simply dont believe it works. And now I have one more reason for it after you download about 30GB, it needs to connect, you cant immediately play in offline mode. When UPlay doesnt work, you are screwed. If there is a server maintenance, overload, DDOS or just anything wrong, you are screwed.Today UPlay doesnt work for me trust me, I tried all the usual stuff as reinstall and so on.. and I know its not Steams fault and all that is because a thing I dont like, I dont want and I dont use.Its my fault. I broke my own rule.For a long time I dont buy games, that requires 3rd party stuff. I never had use for them, didnt create even more accounts, avatars or profiles. And I never will. Also Im an old fart so I remember those days, when if you bought a game, it wasnt right to use it for period of time on specific service, it was actually YOURS.  Thats why I love GOG and Indie developers so much.Steam is a different story, but its a sevice that I CHOSE to use. Also I honestly think it tries to improve itself and I get the feeling Valve loves gamers, do not treat them like enemies that must be punished in advance, because pirates.Do I recommend this game?Of course I wont hate it just for what happened to me. But in order to help you with your decision, all I can say is  Please, take a few seconds and think about WHAT and WHO do you support.Next time I will. Breaking of own rules is stupid, anyway.
