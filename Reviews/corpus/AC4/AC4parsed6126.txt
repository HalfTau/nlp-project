This was the best assassins creed title since assassins creed 2. What is not to love with this fantastic game! I didnt like 3 all that much so as far as Im concerned 3 didnt exist and this was in fact the sequal to creed 2. I have always been a fan of pirate games, I used to play the crap out of the old and new Sid Meiers pirates and this game is vastly superior! Also strange that it was everything except the usual creed stuff that I enjoyed most. Plundering ships, digging up treasure and swashbuckling were all extremely entertaining and challenging. Im also so glad that unlike the previous 3 games that the bonus objectives are mind numbing hard which is a great plus. The story was... ok it wasnt grand but it wasnt crap either. To be honest I enjoyed the game play so much that I didnt really care about the story really. I really like the main character Edward Kenway. Hes smart, funny and most of all Im glad that for most of the game he wasnt really an assassin which was to my liking. I did play freedom cry but that was a very short dlc that had some good points but not much as I beat it in one day easily. Still, there is so much fun to be had in this fantastic game! Such a shame that Unity was such a huge failure. In any case you should definitely buy this game! I guarentee youll love it!
