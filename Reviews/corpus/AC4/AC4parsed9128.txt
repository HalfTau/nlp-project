The visuals are top notch and shine brilliantly on the PC. The sound is immersive and makes you feel completely engulfed in this new world. Combat is entertaining, sometimes a little frustrating as you learn the controls, but very rewarding with fluid animations and awesome finishing kills. The story is well thought out and executed. The pacing of the main story quests is fluid and well refined. I could go on and on because there is just so much to do in this game i only scratched the surface.IMPORTANT If you buy this, make sure to turn OFF cloud synchronizing Steam  Settings  Cloud and do the same on the Uplay browser cloud syncing is located in the uplay settings I played roughly 5 hours and lost all of my progress even though the game showed the saving symbol. Turns out, this is a big bug and a game breaker. However, turning the cloud off seems to have fixed the problem on my end. Happy gaming
