I love the Assassins Creed series, and this is the best one yet. It does a great job of taking historical figures and making them into vibrant characters with whom Edward can interact. The sailing/naval combat portions of the game are also well done traveling between locations almost always felt like an adventure rather than a chore. One of the few downsides of the game is that several of the mission types such as eavesdropping missions become repetitive. Collecting sea shanties was surprisingly fun. I even thought the usually boring outofanimus portions of the game were fun and rather meta in this game.
