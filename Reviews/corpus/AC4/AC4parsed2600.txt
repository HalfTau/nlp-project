There are tons of reason why i highly recommend this game.1. YOU GET TO BE A PIRATE2. YOU GET A PIRATE SHIP3. A little more serious is the gameplay. Its great along with the combat both on land and at sea and good old fashion assassin parkour.4. Good story that will last you a while along with tons of mini mission and such.5. Plenty of unlokcables as well as customizable ship sails, figure heads and upgrades as well as new outfits for Kenway.It can get a little repetitve for a while but so does every other game but there are ways to keep it more lively such as commanding your fleet to make more money keeping up with assassain contracts.Ive played several Assassins creed games and this one had been my favorite so far.
