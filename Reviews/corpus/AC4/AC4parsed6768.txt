Okay, first off, I want to say I love this game down to its core. Sure maybe it has bugs and frame rate problems, but this is still one of my 1 Most Favorite Game!Story Amazing rich and emotional story though you are not tied to it and can go off and do whatever in the JackdawGameplay This is where this game falls a bit. You constantly jump and climb on things you didnt want to. Though overall its okayGraphics When you are looking at moutains, ect. in the distance they somtimes flash back and fourth and also textures take awhile to load in, though other then that, the lighting, weather,water and textures are up at the top for this generation.Open World Perfect, if you want to go to a bar and recruit some crew, to then go and invade a hideout and look the treausre to then upgrade your ship. Overall, I give open world 10/10Overall, I would give this game a 9/10 for its perfect story and amazing open world. I would recommend this to anyone who has a mildy good pc or any consel who wants hours and hours of good open world fun!BlockbyBlock
