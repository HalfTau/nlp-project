EDIT I think it was an update to windows 10 causing me to crash the game all the time on startup. No fix found.This game is actually good.I dont bother collecting all the useless collectibles as per Ubisoft games, but the pirate ship exploration and warfare is decent.Its horribly optimized. Huge fluctuations in FPS.
