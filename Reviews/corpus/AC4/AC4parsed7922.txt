Best only pirate adventure game Ive ever played. You play as Edward Kenway, a pirate, with your own ship which you get to sail around the carribean. You can visit a huge amount of locations the scale of the world is vast, much bigger than 3 or just take to the open waters and plunder wealthy ships and saving people floating on planks of wood. The naval combat is much improved from 3 as well and is really enjoyable to spend a lot of time getting lost in. Overall brilliant game which I recommend to anyone whose wanted a really good pirate game.
