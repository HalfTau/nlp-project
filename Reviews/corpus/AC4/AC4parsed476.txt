I grew up gaming, from sega genesis to xbox to PS4 Ive seen a lot. But Ill never forget the day I went over to a friends house when I was about 17 years old and saw the very first Assassins Creed game, and how impressed I was. It was such a new concept being able to explore, in stealth. Figuring out how to climb on the scenery to reach your target, or to evade detection. Not being bound to a specific path, but being able to explore maps and towns that were more than just a representation, but something the character could actually walk through.This game brought back the thrill of the first game for me. The exploration, the hunting, all of the things waiting to be discovered...10/10, no regrets whatsoever.
