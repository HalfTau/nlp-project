IMHO Black Flag is the best in the series. The ship combat, travel, and streamlined horde brawl combat with its counters and gadgets is the best its ever been. The setting is open and collectibles actually have a fun effect  new sails, wheels, figureheads, canons, and mortars for your ship, new outfits, inventory upgrades from hunting, sea shanties your crew sings while sailing you will find yourself humming along to your favorites, if you have a heart, and different weapons from challenges like the pistol swords.Theres nothing like riding the wind full sail bearing down on a British ManoWar loaded with gold and treasure through a heavenssundering storm like a vengeful spirit while your crew sing Leave Her, Johnny, surprising the slaver s with a screaming volley of mortars before smashing them open with the Jackdaws trusty ram, then swinging onto the deck from a rope and taking the prize bloody with cutlass and pistol.
