One of the greatest game I personally, have ever played. It has its own style.Who doesnt want to sail across the caribbean on there own boat? I sure do, and I would imagine that most people would, with this game you can do that leading you in to a massive world to explore at your own will, having the ability to perform actions like an assassin makes the game so much more fun, as you are not only seen in the light as being a pirate but also a free runner? That is awesome, the game is smooth and the story is excellent.I would definitely recommend.
