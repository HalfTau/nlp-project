Not sure when it happened, but Ive gotten too old for games like this.  The last AC I played before BF was Rogue, which I remember thinking was good but way too short.  I also played I  II way back when and liked them.  But Black Flag.. dunno if its me or the game, all I know is I have plenty of aggravation in my day to day life, I certainly dont need to augment it in my free time. 18, uninstalled, done.
