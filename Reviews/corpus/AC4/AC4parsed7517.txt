This game is incredibly fun and addicting.  I like the gameplay aspects, such as the taking of the ships.  I have never, however, had so many glitches in one game, so be prepared to mess with some settings.  Glitches range from small, like the dead Spanish soldier that floated upward until he was caught in the rigging, to  medium, like the time that my entire ship disappeared and my crew all drowned at sea apparently none of them could swim, which is an odd thing for sailors, to gamebreaking, like the time that one of the forts froze up the graphics of my game but kept playing.  If I hadnt been able to fix the latter, this would have been a negative review.  As it is, the game itself, despite the glitches, manages to tilt towards the positive side for me.  As far as the storyline goes, though, I find it intriguing but slow.  When the game finally gets around to teaching me how to do something in game take a fort, complete a contract, Ive already been doing so for hours in multiple locations.  But this is still a fun game.
