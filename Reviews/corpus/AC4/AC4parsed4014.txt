Be careful. You have to download their UPLAY software. The uPlay software that comes with the game is out of date and requires that you download from their site but nothing tells you that until you google for it. Im going to get my money back. I dont want 3rd party crapware on my machine to play a game. I wish they put big warnings on games requiring 3rd party software. A VERY BIG no thank you to that.
