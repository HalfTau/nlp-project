This is easily the best Assassins Creed game in years, and the second best in the series, behind Assassins Creed 2. After the series traversing rough waters no pun intended in Assassins Creed Revalations and Assassins Creed 3, the series seems to be back on track. Although the main mission isnt a great one, the best part about Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag is the sailing. Sailing around, searching for treasure, and plundering other ships make the messing around worthwhile, instead of doing the finish story mode ASAP thing that I did in AC3.
