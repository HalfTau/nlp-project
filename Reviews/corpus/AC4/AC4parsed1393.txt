Extremely good game, story is the best in the whole series and is extremly well put together, people complain with stupid crap such as Its a pirate game seriously shut the  up, its an Assassins Creed game only in the perspective of a Pirate. I highly reccomend this game to anyone interested in ship and stealth combat, In my opinion the game is underpriced for what it is.However the online isnt very good and lacks unique abilities that Unity had for their online, other than that an amazing game.
