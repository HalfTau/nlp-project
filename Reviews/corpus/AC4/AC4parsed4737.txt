Its a good game, the main problem are the missleading suystem reccomended specifications here on Steam.Following rantWhat are the reccomended specifications for? Running this at 720p 30fps? I have a GTX 570, i7 2600k and 8GBs of ram and just get it to run on medium details 1080p 30fps with vsync on and around 40s with it off. If you want 1080p mediumhigh details at a solid 60fps a GTX 680 or r9 280X is a minimum.
