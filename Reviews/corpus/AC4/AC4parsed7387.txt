At first, I was very exited about this game. But, when I started playing, I realized the most crucial mistake Ubisoft made...YOU ARE NOT AN ASSASSIN.This game is not a real assassins creed and shouldnt be considered one because you dont follow the ASSASSINS CREED, you know, the title of the game.In my opinion, its not worth it.
