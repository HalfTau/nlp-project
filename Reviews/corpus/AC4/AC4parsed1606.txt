Do you like pirates ?Do you like Assassins Creed ?Well this is probably the game for you. Having said that, the game does not really feel like Assassins Creed. It is essentially a fullon pirate game.Pros good pirate feel nice visuals and soundtrack good naval combat and boarding etc.Cons the usual FPS issues fine in parts, but with random drops not much Assassins Creed to itAll in all, Id recommend it more as a pirate game, if you want Assassins Creed, go back to AC2 etc.
