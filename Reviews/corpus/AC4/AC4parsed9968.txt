ACIV Black Flag is my personal favourite AAA game of this fall. The game just feels great and compared to a very disappointing ACIII this one delivers. Edward is a likable character, with a lot of charisma. In terms of quality it is close to ACII, though doesnt feel that fresh, because DUH, THE SIXTH GAME ALREADY. Tons of side activities. In fact this game has so much of them you can literally run out of steam and never finish it. Overall the game feels the same, and plays the same, but theres something that makes it very different. I can applaud to the designers of the game, it looks gorgeous and the atmosphere of the time period  was never been that good in AC game ever. Stealth actually works, its a bit silly, but IT WORKS, PEOPLE! IMO there are still things Ubi could do to make the gameplay a bit deeper, a bit more satisfying, I can even say they could make it EVEN MORE  like Pirates! but it seems you can get everything at once. Also boarding ships feels so great I missed that in ACIII.
