Unlike every other AC game it has the biggest map ever craeted. The game took me about 60 to complete, with side quests, collectibles and what na. To think that all the hidden chests are yet to be found. The bad thing is the story not only concerning Edward Kenway, but Sample17 present day as well. After AC2 the story has become more and more hollower. Gameplay is great. Some bugs here and there, the slow motion is annoying, synchronisation is satisfying meaning do this and dont do that etc graphics are awesome, although demanding, even for a Series 500 Nvidia GTX TM in SLI mode, and AI remains low level. Fast travel is a PLUS in the game, considering the size of the map, and sea battles surely improved after AC3.All in all, I would definitely recommend this game to franchise fans as well as newcomers, cuz it has nothing, well almost nothing to do, with the previous 5 ! games, that featured Desmond Miles, a crucial character in the history of AC.Have fun playing and get ready for many DEsynchronisations !! !
