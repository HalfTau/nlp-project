I havent played any Assassins Creed since the very first on my Xbox360, but Im really glad I bought this one. So far I played about 5 hours and I immediately fell in love with the game again. Get it while its on sale! The game looks great, nice variety so far and the characters are very well designed. The only con is that the gameplay hasnt changed a lot, just a different story but that not necesarily a bad thing.
