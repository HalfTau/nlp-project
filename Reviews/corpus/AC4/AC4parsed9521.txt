This is my least favorite of the Assassins Creed games. If you liked the ship combat from AC3 then you will love this game. I honestly do not like the whole ship based travel system and I find it a bit too long and annoying to go from point to point. I know there is a fast travel system but still. I think AC4 is just ok... Nothing special and I really hope the stay away from this pirate/jungle theme in their next game. I do love the series otherwise and I recommend this if you are into the lore but I would have rather stayed in early America for another game.
