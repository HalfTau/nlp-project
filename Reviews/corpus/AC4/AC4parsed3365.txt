A really entertaning game, and one of the best AC game ever. The Visuals of the game beatifull, the perfomace its great, and the gameplay and the sounds are really good. And being on the Ship, and being a pirate its just fun, and when you crew starts singing,  you cant help to sing along and just go around on the  seas just relaxing. Recommend to buy, a nice game with alot to do, and a good story.
