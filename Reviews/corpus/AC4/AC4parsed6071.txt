10/10Oh yeah, and you also get to be some sort of assassin, although the main character is as excited about that as you are, which is NOT VERY MUCH!  You spend a good 3/4 of the game pretending to be an assassin, when really all you wanna do is just set sail and  ships up.  The AI is TOP NOTCH by the way.  Really, if I know theres a murderer on the loose explicitly killing my crew, Id only really concern myself with it for 30 seconds tops and then probably forget about it.  Who has the time to keep looking?  I have this prearranged path that my OCD compels me to walk along to get to.Pros The ocean ShipsCons Land
