The Assassins Creed franchise has been rather entertaining overall, due to its unique story line and well designed combat system. The new game to the franchise Assassins Creed black flag however has been an interesting one the story line is once again well done however this was the first Assassins Creed I had bought on the PC and was poorly let down by the optimisation on the PC version of the game, causing some poor framerate. However the storyline was well created and the naval combat system was excelled upon. Some features of the game I have yet to explore for example the multiplayer. Overall I would recommened this game and believe it is a good addition to the Assassins Creed franchise.
