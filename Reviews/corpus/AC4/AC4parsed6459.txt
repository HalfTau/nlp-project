Assassins Creed IV is very different to the other games in the Assassins Creed franchise, which is why some people might critisize the game for straying too far from its original purpose. However, I absolutely loved the game. Although Assassins Creed IV Black Flag sets much more focus on being a pirate and sailing a ship, it definetely feels awesome to be an assassin pirate.There are lots of incentives to upgrade your ship and yourself, and to complete side missions and general activities. The story of Black Flag is definetely one of the best stories Ive ever connected to since the dialogue is almost always matched with the gameplay, and especially near the end you gain a deep understanding of the story.But of course, whats a good story without good gameplay? AC4 never dissapoints a pirates wildest fantasies. I still remember the first time I rammed into a ship and swung onto the ship, wiping everyone out in a fury of pressing two buttons. The combat is rather bland and requires little skill, but feels really cool nevertheless.In the end, whether youve played every game in the franchise, have no clue about the games or just wanting to be a badass pirate, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is sure not to dissapoint.P.S pistolswords
