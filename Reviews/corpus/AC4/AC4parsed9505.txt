Good game. 7.5/10.Need to develop fighting and stealth mechanics.Fighting needs to have varying difficulty levels, as well as being more complex, less clunky and with much more variation in enemy types. Just copy  paste the mechanics from Batman Arkham games and its a solid start.Stealth needs a bit of an overhaul, mostly as it should be a larger part of the games structure. Random hiding places and the odd bit of grass dont cut it, and shadows should feel a lot more stealthy. Just copy  paste the mechanics from Splinter Cell Blacklist and that will drastically improve the game, especially as you are an Assassin.These improvements along with an entirely new Era/Time period would do wonders for the series.
