This is probably my favorite one in the whole series.While the story did fully develop all the characters to the degree that they make them seem important, Edward Kenways story is overall fairly engrossing.Gameplay is solid. Mechanics work great. The sailing portion of the game is a fantastic portion and could be a game unto itself.First time in a while a game made me stay up over night to finish I wanted to know what happens that bad.8.5/10
