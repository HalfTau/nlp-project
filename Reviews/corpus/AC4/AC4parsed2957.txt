Absolutely amazing. Frankly, I would hardly call this game Assassins Creed. Its just so different from other entries in the franchise, and its just so much better. I love this series, even despite bad entries like AC3 or Unity, and this game is exactly the reason why. This game proves that Ubisoft actually isnt a bunch of idiots. This game ditched the overly preachy Assassins v Templar shtick that all the other games had, sure both of these are still present, but they are pushed so far to the background that they hardly matter. This game is really about PIRATES. You dont see Assassins or Templars or historical figures on either side taking the stage for this game, you see the famous Caribbean pirates of the 18th century. Edward Kenway, who is the first main character of an Assassins creed game to not even be an Assassin in any way, takes the spotlight, befriending such characters as Blackbeard, Stede Bonnet, Bart Roberts, all famous pirates of the Caribbean. You wont be confined to a single large city or multiple small cities like previous titles, instead youll be able to set sail across the Caribbean, attacking other ships and exploring small islands. The story, as usual, isnt much to look at, but the gameplay and characters are FANTASTIC. To anyone who felt burned by other entries into the franchise, I implore you to try Black Flag.
