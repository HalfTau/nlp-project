its a fun game and worth a playthough and the thing i enjoy i really like about it, but the things that are bad i loathe with a passion and honestly i cant figure out why someone wasnt fired over.its long and the sailing aspect is fun, but at the same time this game will drive any sane person crazy with its idiotic response and bad pathing.  This game should have been one of the best games of all time, but settles for okay get it because its cheap. Love  this one and hate it in equal measures.ai even has to cheat at checkers ffs...
