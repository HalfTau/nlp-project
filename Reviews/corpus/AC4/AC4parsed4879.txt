I was enjoying this game, I really was.  Except when it crashed and I lost all of my progress.  Got my ship and my crew, did some ship missions and did some infiltrations.  Than the screen alt tabs to Windows and I cant get back in the game one of the many issues.  I close the game open it back up.  Guess what, all of my progress is brought back to when I first started my session HOURS EARLIER.  This isnt the first time it did it.  The previous times the game would start and completely freeze Windows.  Now I have to forcefully shutdown my machine to do anything.  Alt  F4 Does not work, neither does ctrl alt delete or shift tabbing.  I doubt they will implement any fixes for this game since its 2 years old but I think I will be avoiding UBI Soft until they make some better decisions.
