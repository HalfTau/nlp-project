There are 2 ways to look on this game and because of it, I will review both of themReally mediocre Assassins Creed experience History and narrative are really boring and barely make better then Assassins Crap 3 Assassination dialogues are the worst in the series Monotonous and repetitive main quest missions Bizarre homo flerting that turns on bizarre hetero flerting which is by the way the best plot twist in all game I found controls were a little clumsy compared with other games in this serieFantastic Pirate Simulator Game engine is put to its limit and environment graphics are really amazing and convincing Huge world and plenty of content to do and explore Very nice ship battles this is the best part of the game Several chanties for your sailorsI recommend the game considering all above and getting this by no more than  20 since the Assassins Creed part of it was really flawed
