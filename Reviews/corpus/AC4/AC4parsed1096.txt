This game is a pretty mixed bag. The story is pretty dull, but the sailing is great. The stealth is fun, but fighting in large groups is broken. Its probably the best Assassins Creed game, in that theyre all the same but this one also has pirates. Its a lot of fun though, if you like the look of the boat business its worth picking up.
