After Revelations I thought I was done with this series. Yet somehow Black Flag can still capture the feeling I had when I played Assassins Creed II. The world is colorful and filled with things to do and see, so if you like exploration youre in for a treat. I never played AC3, so I dont know how naval combat has changed, but it is very enjoyable. Plus you can pimp your ship.Did I mention the game is dropdead gorgeous. It has some of the best water effects when youre sailing on the sea. Battling with three ships while a tropical storm rages on is quite the experience. If there is anything negative I should say about the game is that the combat is still easy. It has been made more diverse with the musketmen and bigger brutes that cant be countered, but you still dont have to run very often. Oh yeah, you still have to tail a bunch of people, which is the least enjoyable part of the game. Luckily you can tag your targets with your eagle eye and see them through wall, so the tailing is maybe a tad less annoying than in the previous titles, but still feels somewhat of a bore and a way for them to not really make decent cutscenes since hey what if everyone just talks while they walk?Despite those small flaws I must recommend this game to all whove liked at least AC2. Black Flag is so very very addicting and offers some of the best sailing/privateering and exploration experiences as of late.
