When you beat this game, theres not much left to do. Im afraid to touch multiplayer because god knows how many ruskies and huehuehues are spamming it up on uPlay servers.That being said, the path to completion is an engaging and enjoyable one. I dont recommend the DLC, though their major bonus is aesthetic. Also, you may occasionally fall through whatever youre standing on. Plotwise, theres a great disconnect from Desmond Miles and something about reincarnation. Truly an asspull. Dont play games for the plot. Play it for the thrill of taking down more powerful ships.
