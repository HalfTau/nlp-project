Ubisoft Makes a game about shipsMultiplayer has no ships UbisoftHonestly it wasnt a bad game single player was incredible, but why even add multiplayer? If youre not going to stick to the premise of the single player gameplay just dont add MP.What I will say though is you should buy this game for a single player experience, incredible SP, just keep in mind that these rich big game developers continue to screw us on Multiplayer.Oh and as for all the complaints like It drops to 30 fps. Well it drops to like 35 on my pc and yes its annoying but its still very playable, my main complaint is just what I stated above.Oh and as for the Ubisoft launcher its ing stupid, but Ubisoft gets away with it so theres nothing you can do.
