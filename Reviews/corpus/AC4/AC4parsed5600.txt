Sorry people the game is a great disappointment alot of bags. To begin with if you have a simple graphics card 2gb memory do not even think to play it on full HD settings cause it will crash continusly. This is somethink that it is not justified from the huge code reusability and I mean the sceneries are the same over and over again the missions are similar too. Follow that guy, listen what the say and then kill. The crashing and generally low frame rates it is just a trick inorder nvidia to sell more graphic cards and this is the reason why they did not include in the gane a triple frame buffering that would solve alot of the problems on the spot. My system is i think it is enough i7 quad 3.5ghz, 16gb ram 2400 mhz, 4Gb 6990 AMD radeon twin core 3DHD and an SSD with more than 50GB free space. As for the minigames do not even thimk to play them because they will drive you mad. The main reason is that every time you are close into winning the program will cheat inorder to make you lose. I never played the miltiplayer but I think, I will not. In general the idea is good to have a game with pirates, ships, missions etc. but this game needs a lot of work.
