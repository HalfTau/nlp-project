If youre thinking about getting the game...Stop  get it already!The combat system  the camera angles are clumsy at best, from time to time...But thats pretty much the only thing bad about it.Pretty much all of the Assassins Creed games have the same issue anyway.But overall, this title is one to own!Own it today!
