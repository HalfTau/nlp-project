What seemed to be another yearly rehash of a series losing its charm turns out to be my favorite AC gameMost people would choose Ezio Auditore as their favorite Assassin, AC4s main character, Edward Kenway is every bit as good as the Master Assassin himself. Where Ezio had spades of style  grace, Edward is a little rough around the edges and has a Daredevil persona. A mix of Sawyer and Gannicus if you willEdwards dual sword fighting style makes Arno AC Unity look like a little school girl. There is crafting, stalker zones for stealth kills, sea battles, memorable music the main theme being a highlight in particular and the ocean/jungle setting is so fresh, its exactly what this series needed7.5/10
