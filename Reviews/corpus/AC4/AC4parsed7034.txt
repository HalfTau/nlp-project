Seriously imporved from Assassins Creed III, Black Flag feels like a return to what made II so good. That is stuff to do, stuff to collect, and fun battles to engage in. With a trimmer story that doesnt feel like its crushing with padding, Black Flag is a great time to be a pirate. The shanties the crew learns to sing are also a real treat.
