wanna be a pirate , like assasins creed games , this may be for you!honestly loved the game fitted in well with all the assasins creed games, was a joy to play love the ship combat a nice upgrade from the ship combat on assasins creed 3, only con is that i did get the strange bug where the camera wouldnt sit still which meant a full reinstall which fixed it for me.
