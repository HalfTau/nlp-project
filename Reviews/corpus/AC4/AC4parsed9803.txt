OK so this game starts you off in some good action, then you kinda have to wait a while for alot of the stuff to unlock later, but its totally worth it.  I would also recommend downloading there app for smart phones, or tablet.  Youll see why when you do!  Its not just an extention of the game, its part of the game...I was trying to wait for this game to go on sale, with the way money is so tight, but I would call it best game of the Year hands down, specially finding out and using the app when im playing the game, and have my tablet next to me, telling my fleet to clear a trading route, and make me some Money!   This game is worth it!  Part of me wants a game , or mode i can just sail the open waters, and do all that this game does at sea, but then it does that and more, and I just dont go to shore... lol..
