As a fan of the Assassins Creed series I can say this game by far has trumpted all the other ones to date. The main character easily over takes that of Ezio or Connor while being a hard competor with Altair for the best protagonist. The story is absolutely involving and it is a great time to just sail around and fighitng other boats or running from them if you cannot take them. All in all Id give this game an easy 9/10 only losing a point for the obvious follow and easedrop missions that are included in the Assassins Creed games. Which is not really always a bad thing minus when the AI runs into walls and forces you to fail a mission.
