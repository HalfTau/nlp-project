Terrible! It could be a great game but runs poorly. I can run dark souls 3, Arkham knight, metal gear solid 5, shadow of mordor, Rise of the tomb raider and the witcher 3 all with max settings on my pc. This game constantly drops frames and even if I turn all settings to minimum, it still runs at the same frame rate! Crazy! I had the same issues with Syndicate. Crashes constantly. Ive given up messing with graphic settings as they dont make any difference and Im uninstalling.
