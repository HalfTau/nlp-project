Hate UBISoft, Nice Game, enjoyed it, hate the fact that community challenges that unlock items in the game were stopped years before I purchased the game, so some content is permanently unavailable to me.  And the Community Challenge forum allows me to login, but does not allow posting.  Its like once you buy the game, they dont care any more.  The achievements are like void since they are only on ubisoft and therefore hidden on the web     Im surprised UBI even allows steam to sell the franchise.
