I held off buying Black Flag for quite a while because I was dissappointed with how little the series and game mechanics  were progressing with each game Brotherhood, Revelations and III were the most meh in my eyes but Black Flag honestly surprised me.Good PointsMuch better as a freeroam game than the last few, you can sail anywhere  discovering and exploring random islands you spot inbetween.Tools and weapons  even though the weapon variety is lacking no dagger, there is some nice new features, such as a sleep dart, 24 pistols carried at once and also dagger, when picked up, will now a throwing knife one which actually kills most targets first hit, for onceEdward  the main character is a far more likeable Kenway than Connor or Haytham, who isnt as naive or annoying as Connor but not as pretentious as Haytham. Hes quite down to earth but also has questionable morals  but you can see glimpses of a better man underneath. Hes more interesting because hes not as gleefully serving to the Assassins as the other protagonists in the series, and actually develops as a person over the course of the game.Bad PointsMore bugs than an ant farm  AC III was pretty buggy falling under docks, dyed clothes not appearing in cutscenes but Black Flag has some spectacular bugs. Kenways ship is notorious for bugs just look up the Acsension of the Jackdaw and happens quite often Ive had the acension bug and one when I kept falling through the ship,, alongside my crew mates, on my first play through. Other annoying bugs exist as well I personally dislike the bug where characters eyes are often shaded in red, blue, yellow, etc, all over the whites of the eyes and the pupils, in pretty much every cutscene.Keyboards are for losers  this game, as a terrible PC port, is havoc to play with keyboard controls. While I got used to it, initially, it became more and more irritating  especially in one big stealth mission near the end of the game where I had stealthed through most of the fort and tried to synchronise on a tower.... I thought I needed to get on top of this little bit sticking out the top and pressed Shift  Space to get on top, only for th game to decide I probably wanted to jump off the tower to my death instead..... . the replays of that mission were plagued with similar issues as well  I attempted to air assassinate my target, who was in range and I was pointing at them plus they were highlighted and instead Edward assassinated some random guard far to the right of him i was at a slight angle, and WASD keys seem to decide who you assassinate rather than the mouse There are other little issues with the freerunning that wil just infuriate you if you use a keyboard so for your own sanity use a Xbox 360 controller  Ive also struggled to set up nonX360 controllers with it and the buttons have been all muddled up
