A good pirate game, not so good Assassins Creed game. 100 sync is pretty hard. Social chests are almost impossible to find. Also, if you buy a new pc yes I know, never buy prebuild and dont take the HHD/SSD that has this game installed from your old computer, you hace to start over, because this game doesnt have steam synch and uplays one doesnt work.
