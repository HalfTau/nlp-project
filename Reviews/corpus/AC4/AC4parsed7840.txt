Having played all AC games and having spent about 300 hours in doing so i can say without doubt that this one is the most fun, intriging and exciting above all.Removed from the morality issues of Ezio and all his baggage and the monotony and boredom of connor, black flag gives us Edward a small man with big aspirations. Not being bogged down with the weight of the assassins from day 1 is a refreshing change of pace. and the freedom to hit the seas and have a crack at who ever and whatever crosses your path is great.Hitting locations simply for the hell of it is great also, i spent the first 30 hours just sailing about picking stuff up, going to islands and boarding ships.Also the stealth thing is back, ACBF makes you think about attack plans whilst trying to assault a castle or takedown a target, no more running headlong into a target, hitting him hard, then diving into the sea......no no you need your thinking caps and paitience.All in all i have enjoyed this greatly, and the plot although not quite so grand is facinating, and you feel that you could leave it to explore without making it feel unimportant.Only downside is the whole animus thing, being kicked from your pirate adventures to walk about an office for the actual story is frustrating. and i feel that the AC games suffer from that.But all in all BRILLIANT
