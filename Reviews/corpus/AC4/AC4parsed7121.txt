My favorite Assassins Creed yet!  Looking forward to Assassins Creed Unity come Oct.  This one will be hard to top but Ubisoft hasnt disappointed me yet.  I have been into this series since AC2 and Black Flag offers piracy, plenty of assassination targets, and a great and in depth storyline.  Definitely recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed any of the previous games.
