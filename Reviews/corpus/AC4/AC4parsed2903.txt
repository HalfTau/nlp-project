So played this game for 75 hours on ps4. And bought it on pc in the summer sale. Im a huge ac fanboy so i might not be completly objective. Its my opinion.StoryYou follow Edward kenway. Grandfather of Connor Kenway, father of Haythem Kenway. He is a pirate. And you get in touch with templars. The story wasnt the best one but was still fine i think.gameplay You can explore the caribean sea! There are lots of little islands and a lot of big ones as well. You can hunt, loot chests and collect animus fragments there! Partly because of the ost you really get this pirate feeling while playing. The gameplay was used again in ac rogue. So if you like rogue you would LOVE ac 4!graphics My pc isnt the best. far from it! I have to play this game on low settings. Every thing turned off or low. To get 5055 fps. Wich is fine to me. It looked very good on ps4. This game came out in 2013. But it still looks good imoVerdict I love all of this game. I havent told you everything there is to do. Because i was suprised about all the things you could do. And i want you to have the same feeling! I HIGLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!8,5/10about the dlc If you buy the deluxe edition you get a mission with avelin. Wich is only about 3050 minutes. Its fun but i dont think its worth the money for most of you.Freedom cry is very big! But its not an huge open world. There arent a lot of things to do on the sea. I would reccomend it tho
