Apart from AC2, Black Flag is my favorite AC game. It can become a little bit repetitive, but the sheer number of options you have make it easy to find something new to do. This game makes me really wonder what it would be like if Ubi went all in on the pirate idea and made something like a modern day Sid Meiers Pirates.
