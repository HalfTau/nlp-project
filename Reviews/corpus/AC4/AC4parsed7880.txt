Easily one of the best games I have ever played. The AC series failed to capture me until now, and this game is a 10/10 without hesitation.The gameplay is incredible, the storyline is excellent, and the fun never ends. From the getgo you are running through beautiful terrain and hunting/killing/collecting/crafting/sailing for hours on end. The cutscenes are well done, the backstory is suiting, the flow of the game is perfect, and the amount of things to see/do/collect is astonishing.You will not be disappointed with this game, even if every other AC game hasnt been your thing.
