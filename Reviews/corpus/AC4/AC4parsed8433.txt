I went into this one very optimistic after watching a few videos, and I was not disappointed.Youve got your typical ACstyle gameplay here, with cities to explore, buildings to climb, and plenty of ways to kill or escape your enemies. Theres a big multiarc story which, as with AC and AC2, kept me interested from start to finish, with a solid and surprisingly emotional ending. Theres plenty to see, find and do afterwards or in between the story missions as well. And of course, topnotch visuals, both technically and asthetically.But the real treat here is the ship and the sea. Ive been looking for a good sailing game for ages, and of all the places to find one, its the Assassins Creed series! Solid controls and mechanics mix with varying degrees of challenge depending on where in the Carribean you choose to sail, and it makes for a very enjoyable gameplay experience. The sound and visuals really shine here, too pristine waves, singing sailors, thundering guns and billowing sheets. It all kept me yearning to get back out on the sea every time I came into harbor.Theres some blemishes on this gem, tho. A few graphical glitches mar the pristine scenery glowing eyes during cutscenes, and some lighting glitches during the outofAnimus sequences as of 1/24/2014... hoping for a patch!. But these were localized, and dont detract much from the regular gameplay. Some of the ground missions have annoyingly high guard counts, which can make for slow going as you sneak or slice your way through the story, tho some may find the chance for more fights enjoyable. There are also some spoilers for those who havent played the earlier games, so if you want the full AC experience, I dont recommend starting here.But if you really wanna be a pirate, then by all means, climb on board! All in all, a good installment in a brilliant series.
