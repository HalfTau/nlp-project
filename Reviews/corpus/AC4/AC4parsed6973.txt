This game honestly saved the series in my opinion. I hate to diss on Connor, but Assassins Creed III was pretty awful.The enviornment in this game is beautiful, the storyline is compelling, the mechanics are pretty easy to follow and the game has a ton of content that will leave you wanting more. Trust me, youll love every bit of this game.
