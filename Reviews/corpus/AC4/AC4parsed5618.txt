After playing other games like The Witcher 2, The Eleder Scrolls III, IV, V, Venetica this is the best game yet. Im 74 and sort of a geek for my age but enjoy gaming. Assassin Creed IV s graphics and control of characters is outstanding. I only play the single game. Highly recommend for anyone wanting a seafaring back in the 1700s buy it. The only slight complaint is I have lost the main quest line and have not found it. Im sure its somewhere on one of the islands I havent discovered. Also, buy all the DLCs.
