Monkey Island 3Yarr! Harr! Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag is a truly a masterpiece comparing to dullnes and naivety of AC3. Its as good as AC2 was when you first played it and yet so much different.Over 70 hours of gameplay and damnit!  i want more!After playing infantile Connor, the Edward Kenway experience is like  a fresh sea breeze. Pure scoundrelship, shiver me timbers!Audio experience and the way its crated into the story is simply amazing. You will often find yourself starting sea battles only to hear some epic music. If you listen closely to sea shanties you can hear how some pirates are out of tune with rest of crew, amazing little details.The game has lots of little pleasures  side activites like diving, searching for lost treasures, hunting templars, comanding your fleet and many more.If you love upgrades as I do, you will find the AC4s upgradeomatic system perfectly balanced.
