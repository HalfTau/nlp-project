The game is fun but the lore is missing. It seems like you are a fake in the game. Also the Uplay system is annoying! I cant stand how clunky the interface is and how inconvenient it is to use their service. Steam has proven itself to be great and now all the other developers try to use their proprietary clients... ShameUbisoft has some bad ports to pc and seem to rush their games.
