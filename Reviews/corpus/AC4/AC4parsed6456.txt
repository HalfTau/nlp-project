Assassins Creed IV continues the trend of terrible assassins creed games. It continues to depart from everything that made the original great. Executions are limited and stealth mechanics are not great. You dont really feel like an assassin and the templars dont really feel like that much of a threat. The modern day stuff is also terrible and offers very little depth.That being said Black Flag is an AMAZING pirate game. I havent been so in love with a pirate game since Sid Meiers Pirates.  If you play this game strictly to sail around, capture outposts and collect sea shantys you will not be disappointed. This is my favorite game in the series but not for the reasons it should be. I dont recommend assassins creed really but I do recommend Black Flag for anyone that wants a truly great pirate experience.
