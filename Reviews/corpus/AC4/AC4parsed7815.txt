Going into Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, I was expecting fun. Reviews of the ship gameplay had been favourable, and that seemed like the selling point of the whole thing. Despite the often repetitive gameplay of the sidequests, it was indeed fun. I found myself lost exploring the oceans, firing off cannons at ships twice the size of mine just to scrape together the metal needed to make myself an even more menacing pirate. With sugar and rum exploding out of my sleeves, I really did feel like a freedom fighter of the 18th century. Even when I was ashore I felt like a true badarse, firing off my four pistols while simultaenously fighting off guards with swords and knives.That being said, the game as it stands isnt hard. Theres certainly enough challenge to be had in the side quests and optional objectives within the storyline, but if you want to just charge in with no concern for the silent approach probably closer to a true pirate, then so be it. And I love that. Optional difficulty that isnt a menu option is really what makes me want to keep playing.Sure theres not much replayability, but it was certainly a game I enjoyed. Ill definitely be watching Ubisoft closely for the new Assassins Creed release and most likely continuing my adventure in Black Flag, squeezing every bit of gameplay I can out of it.
