Played alot of the Assassins Creed games but this is by far the best so far. Good graphics and very versatile gameplay.FOR THOSE NOT GETTING THINGS TO WORK !!!At first I struggled to get the game going, kept saying Uplay unreachable but then I downloaded the standalone Uplay launcher, logged into it, copied the game key from steam, which you find in the library and when first launch and activated it on Uplay. Had to do the same for both DLCs that I bought. Bit of a hassle but yeah DRM is insane these days for some AAA games. Im guessing the launcher that comes with steam is an old one and didnt get updated somehow.Once you did it this way it will always use the new launcher when launching from steam.
