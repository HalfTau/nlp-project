Highly recommended to everyone, even if you are not a big fan of Assassins Creed series, if buy it, you wont be dissapointed !Positives Long, interesting and touching story line Lots of collectables variations of different robes armors etc lots of different tools Stunning Graphics First ever multiplayer with advanced anticheating systemNegatives Enemies are a bit too easy AI is programmed to make only 3 enemies attack you at the same time, even though there could be 15 enemies standing by next to you, they just politely wait until you murder them all
