Great game. Bought this game twice, on console and PC. I dont regret buying this. Unfortunately its probably the best pirate game ever made and its an assassins creed game. Ship combat is what makes this game feel so good. Just wish there was more depth to it. After you get the upgrades, and fight legendary ships, you just feel done with sailing.Good game, probably the best in the  franchise. solid 8/10
