Possibly one of the best pirate games ever created. Play as Captain Kenway, a notorious pirate assassin who roams the Carribean in order to loot and plunder enemy warship and defeat foes. Hunt down your enemies in true Assasin Creed style, and upgrade your warships with the finest arsenal money can buy. This game offers a good degree of difficulty and lengthy gameplay. 9.5/10 recommended. Well done Ubisoft.
