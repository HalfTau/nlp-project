Love this game. There is literally so many things to do I find myself doing a main mission every couple hours because the side missions keep you busy. Love it.Heres a tipIf youre trying to get 100 completion of one of the main cities then start by doing the Templar missions. While doing them you will be taken around the entire map and you can easily  get chests, fragments and song sheets along the way.Happy Sailing!
