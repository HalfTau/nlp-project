I bought this game in december and forgot about it started playing it a couple months ago and i have been playing an hour or two a day it is very fun and you want to know what happens next. It has a lot of different elements than other Assassins Creed games like a ton of using your ship. Also the A.I is twice as hard in combat and when they look for you when your hiding they fan out and check all the closets and hay wagons instead of one guy checking.
