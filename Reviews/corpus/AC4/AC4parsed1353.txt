Assassins creed has always had a nostalgia effect on me, so I had to buy it. Black Flags is a good game. I really enjoyed the difficulty on the legendary ships. In fact the ship battles are the best part of this game. One thing that started to annoy me with this version and others is the assassin missions. I remember in brotherhood if you werent stealthy the targets would escape on a few missions. The devs seem to have abandoned this design and has made these tasks too simple. The optional and easy assassin missions felt copied and pasted and there are other areas in the game that lacked in variety. I recommend playing this game. I would also recommend buying brotherhood and II before playing this title.
