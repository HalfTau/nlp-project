Great job Ubisoft!   I got a bit worried about the AC franchise after AC III but they brought it back brilliantly.  So far Im loving every minute of it.  Of course theres still moments when your character will jump of a cliff rather than climbing up a tree but other than that sort of thing this game is amazing.And the graphics, wow.Edit  I just lost a 70 completion save game and was doing one of the last missions.
