This game was beautiful. Honestly, i never played the other assassins creed other than this and the second one, but easily this one surpass most of them, I think. I never interested in assassin creed game because the gameplay was repetitive but I like the concept. I bought this game because the game is so different than the other game, instead of riding a horse from town to town this game you sail from island to island. No wonder it got the ps4 remastered version.
