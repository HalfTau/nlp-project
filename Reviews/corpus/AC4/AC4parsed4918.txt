Bought this game in a saleAttempted to make Uplay accountUplay was unavailableAttempted to play Uplay in offline modeMust sign into Uplay once to play in offline modeGets frustrated and requests refund for game that requires broken Uplay accountSteam support is unavailable at this timeSeriously, Fk off uplay, no one wants you. And valve you should stop accepting this bs. Either have the game hosted via steam or dont bother. From now on Im personally going to automatically downvote any game that requires a 3rd party drm crap simply because its overcomplicated and completely unecessary.
