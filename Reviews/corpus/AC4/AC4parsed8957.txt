The best game in the series thus far, and this is coming from someone who was VERY skeptical about continuing this series after the way AC3 ended.Seriously, I wanted to hate this game but simply could not. It is that good.I highly recomend it to long time AC fans and new comers alike.AC4  AC2  ACB  AC3  AC1  ACR
