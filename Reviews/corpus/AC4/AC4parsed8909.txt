Love the game! It is the first AC game in the series that I play and I love everything about it. The graphics are amazing, the story is catchy, there is a lot to explore and the naval battles are just amazing!!Positive aspects I really started to like the present day missions  the computer hacking and stuff, however I foresee a grimm ending ? please dont spoil it for me I like the fact that the resources metal mostly are kind of scarce and you either get them from naval battles, wreckages or warehouses the world is huge Some negative aspects tail and evesdrop missions are kind of repetitive and while you get the hang of it I would much prefer to do different stuff some unrealistic fort takeovers   super tornadoes while attacking it and after you capture it, its sunny all of a sudden like... come on!Update Good God, I played like 55 hours without ever using mortar??? Just  accidentally  found out how to use it Update 2 Just finished the game  didnt like the ending that much... Maybe Ill try to defeat all the 4 legendary ships actually just 3 left and collect all the animus fragments and to get 100 sync.And also I should play Freedom Cry.Overall a great game, IMO!
