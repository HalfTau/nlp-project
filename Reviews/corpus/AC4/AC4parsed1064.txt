A great reboot of a series, however not flawless. Good optimisation Sea exploration and sea battles Huge world to explore Good characters Game lenght Repetitive side missions Way too many silly collectibles Sea exploration is a great concept but can be too slow and boring sometimesOverall 78/100Recomended even for those who arent big fans of AC series.
