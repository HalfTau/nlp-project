As of late AC series is not experiencing its best days, and its understandable, recent games have neitehr been good, nor innovative. Rehashed, some say, a yearly brand with nothing to show for.AC4 was non of those things. Black Flag is beautiful game, set in pristine locations and told with story that both inspires and makes you dream and wish, that for a second you could be a part for it, if just for a little while.The characters and cast are abosulutely amazing and the memorable scenes and storylines will keep in wanting for more long after youve finished the game.Building upon the open world, hunting, stalking. exploring and wandering that was AC3, Black Flag perfects it in a way to fit a true pirate game, and without doubt one of the best pirate themed games ever created. Edward is a wanderful character and only loses to Ezio because the time with him was rather short. Had it been a trilogy, the wits and charms of Edward wouldve, without doubt, won him the greatest AC character title.The ship battles are exceptional, and even the buggy boarding can not cast a shadow on the well crafted system and the thrill you get when hunting for your next prize.If you have not played it yet  do it, youre guaranteed to enjoy every second of it!
