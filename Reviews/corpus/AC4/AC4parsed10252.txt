You know, after all the hype of Next Gen, Clouds of Smoke, PhysX, Rain Particles, ship fighting, tropical islands, i cant help but think even today, this PC game is another port of a terribly coded console game.I loved AC3, and this one, while being a new story has some really annoying things in it like Rate this Mission feature at the end of each mission. Like Ubisoft wants us to do their job of analytics and speaking with the customer themselves to tell them which missions were fun? How about reading the forums or popular user review sites instead?Did I mention there is no way to save your game, back up your game or rageface.jpg when you get to 50 game completion for the 3rd time and it keeps losing your saved progress and achievments.
