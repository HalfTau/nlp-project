For those with a generally weak laptop or possibly any laptop in general Do not buy. The game has problems launching and always crashes on a black screen as soon as you launch the game through UPlay. My laptop met the system requirements but still crashes every time. I dont know if it is because of a compatability issue between Steam and UPlay, but it still doesnt work for me. If anyone can help me out that would be appreciated.
