A fun pirate game that, unfortunately, also makes you go through the painful Assassins Creed tedium. The best times are had at command of your vessel pirating your way from one ship to another, hoarding loot, and purchasing upgrades. Unfortunately the main storyline of the drawn out templar vs. assassin war is painful nonesense and, as usual, feels badly forced into place and sticks out as something that clearly shouldnt be present.Its fun overall but comes with several eye rolling moments that causes you to be patient while working past them. The best AC since Brotherhood and will likely be the last good one for a long while.
