This is a pretty nice substitute for Sid Meiers Pirates, aside from the parts where you can not pirate and have to wander around in the office completing some dumb tasks.Also that one part later on with the huge unskippable emo moments, but Im suffering through this in hopes that this will end up badly for everyone but the protagonist.
