Black Flag is the pinnacle of the Assassins Creed series. The music and ambient sounds really gives this game an incredible atmosphere and roaming the seas while your crew sings shanties is really satisfying. Sailing, ship battles and boarding are the best the game has to offer and luckily is a big part of the game. Combat and stealth is as expected from an Assassins Creed game, good but not perfect.It all makes up for a rather lacklustre story, bland main protagonist and rather dull moments out of the Animus.Requires Uplay.
