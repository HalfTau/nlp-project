My favorite of the AC series. Although the series defintely started to get stale around AC3, the pirate aspect of Black Flag makes this one stand out. I spent hours ignoring any of the main story and sailed around in my ship looting and plundering every ship within sight. As far as the actual story and whatnot, its more or less the same rehashed AC game.The Caribbean setting really makes this a visually appealing game to play. The water on the ocean looks amazing and the world feels alive both above and below the waters. I like that they changed the AC staple of upgrading your home to focus more on your ship. They have a more preactical feel as you can notice your ship is able to take on riskier battles the stronger it gets. It feels like a modern version of Sid Meyers Pirates!The gameplay can get rather repetetive. Attacking Forts is a good time but they start to feel like a prescripted event after awhile. If you like AC games, then youll love this.
