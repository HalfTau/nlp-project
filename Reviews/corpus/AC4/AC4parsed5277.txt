I got really hyped up for this game with the summer sales going on. I had been a fan of the Assasins Creed series for years and finally I had a chance to get the newest games. Sadly though I cant even play the game even though I meet most of the recommened requirements and am way above all the minimum requirements. So I just spent my money on about 30 gigs of nothing. Dont get me wrong, if my PC cant run it that means its really high quality but if you want to get it make sure your PC is really good because odds are if you have anything below the recommened requirements even if its above the minimum requirements, you cant play it. Thanks ubisoft for your hard work, but wish I could actually play your game /
