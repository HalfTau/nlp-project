Because of all the horror stories Ive heard about the Assassins Creed series Ive stayed far away from these games. However, this Christmas sale I was relentlessly throwing my money at games, like you do, when I saw this gem for 7. I did some research and saw some good reviews. I bought it and loaded it up.Ive enjoyed this game for about eight hours now and I cannot pull myself away. The satisfaction of sinking Spanish frigates and looting gold from a body you just shanked with a wrist blade is indescribably awesome. The open world just makes it better.The PC port infoIts not a very good port, to be honest. The graphics arent as good for the performance you actually get out of the game. Other games with bigger worlds and better graphics run twice as fast.The vertical sync is absolutely awful. If the game drops below 59 fps the game locks itself at 30 fps, so just keep it off. The game is hardlocked at 61 fps anyways so no point in keeping it on. Use D3DOverrider to tripplebuffer the game.TLDRExciting pirate simulator.Combat is satisfying.PC port isnt good, but isnt awful.
