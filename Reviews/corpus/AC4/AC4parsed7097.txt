This was by far one of the better games of the series..Its a fun openworld experience, which distances itself from the AC Series a bit  but is still close enough to have the familiar jumping, backstabbing, acrobatics of the series.Compared to the previous installment.. it is far more optomized for the PC and really didnt feel like a console port at all.Overall, its a great game with an interesting story that can get a bit repetitive towards the end. Not everyone likes fishing and crafting.. not sure it really has that big of a place in this style gameThankfully, you can avoid alot of the crafting and just play the action  but its there as some side frill if you want to enjoy it.
