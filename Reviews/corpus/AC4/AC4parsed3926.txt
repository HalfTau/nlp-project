This game... Where do I start? it has amazing gameplay, amazing graphics, and a kickstoryline. This game is by far in my opinion the best asassins creed game yet. You can sail the 7 seas, assassinate people just like in the otyher assassins creed games, and do pretty much whatever you want. Definately worth its weight in green.
