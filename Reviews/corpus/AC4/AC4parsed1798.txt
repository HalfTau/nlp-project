The best of the series, in my opinion. Fantastic gameplay, good story, some relatively difficult puzzles to solve, and being a pirate, what more could you ask for? The only thing I didnt care as much for was the Fleet operations. The battles took too long to resovle considering it simply being turnbased combat simulation. i didnt think the time spent in what is essentially a minigame was worthwhile. Luckily its completely optional. Everything else I enjoyed and will likely have another playthrough or two in the future.
