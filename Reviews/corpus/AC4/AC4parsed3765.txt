Stabed a pirate. Got attack by authorities. Evade them with parkour. Got away. Would stab pirate again.Assassins Creed 4 is the best Assasins Creed game in my opinion. You get a huge open world, a great story, a great main character and none of the dramatic real world garbage. The game is set in a huge open word with three main cities and a lot of islands to explore. The naval combat is amazing and I would play a game based on this mechanic alone. The rest is pretty typical Assasins Creed stuff.
