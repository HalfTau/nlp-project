A very entertaining game, at the start it seemed like it would be a game that I would just roll through, but once the story gets going, I found that it was a very good one. It does a different take on the Assassins, more focusing on the character than the Creed, but anyone who has played a previous AC will definitely enjoy it in my opinion.
