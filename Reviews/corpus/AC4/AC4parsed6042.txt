Assassins Creed IV Black Flag was my first Assassins Creed game that I have played, and I loved it! I was fully immersed in gameplay and had the true pirate experience in this game. Very fun!If I had to give it a rating on a 1 to 5 scale, it would be a 4. The only reason it did not get a 5 is that while there is a multitude of different things to do on the game, you do get a feeling of repitition after a few hours of playing.,
