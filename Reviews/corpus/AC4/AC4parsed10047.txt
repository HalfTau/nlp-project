This game never ceases to amaze me, I have been following the development of this game for months and because I have been an Ubisoft customer for about 4 nearly 5 years, I was invited to a VIP seminar Assassins Creed Black Flag online where I logged in with my VIP pass code and just sat there watching the seminar for an hour. Thank god I have good broadband because it was a live steam from Montreal. As the seminar was in Montreal and I am in the UK. Yep do the math which it meant it was at 1100 GMT.Dont hesitate on buying this game just buy it. I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed. Each level is packed with an assortment of tasks to keep you going for ages throughout the entire game. Ubisoft went back to the drawing board with Assassins Creed Black Flag. The start of the game can be a little daunting... I have removed this section because this would spoil potential purchase of this game.Each level is stunningly designed and there are more places to hide in AC Black Flag than there was with AC3. The only gripe that I think people will moan about is the fact the way in which you control Kenway has changed slightly because there are more keys than AC3 and this has annoyed some fans of Assassins Creed. But I found the changes to be better than before as you have more control now in a close contact area of the keyboard compared with AC3.I would highly recommend that you buy Assassins Creed Black Flag official Guide from Amazon or your favourite distributor of shop. The guide has been published byand it a bumper of a game guide with 385 pages of illustrated guides and some of the best concept and artwork I have seen for a game. This guide also covers side missions as well, which to be honest not many game guides cover all the side missions as well.The guide also comes with a pull out poster size map which believe me comes in handy when you are playing the game and to make sure you get 100 synchronisation which is what you are looking for
