Absolutely beautiful game, a true!It is even worth tolerating UPlay!Total 10/10, I never had any problems with any of the DLCs either, you just have to redeem everything you buy through Steam on UPlay as well. I actually bought every single DLC Season Pass  all of the time savers and they all worked.The freerun is amazing, the fact that you can swim pretty much anywhere is also amazing, you can go to islands and hunt animals and search for treasure, you can invade naval forts and claim them in the name of your pirate brethren, you can harpoon seadwellers, board enemy ships, take down entire fleets!And there is even an app both on Android and Apple phones that allows you to take the adventure even further and actually earn ingame money while away from your computer.Extremely addictiveExcellent naval combat and explorationOne of my favorite games everIf it is on sale, it is a musthave for just about everybody, even them scurvy landlovers!
