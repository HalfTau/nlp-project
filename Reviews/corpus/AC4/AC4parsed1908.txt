Playing through the main storyline was an absolute joy, apart from all the pointless collectables, tail missions and completely unneeded Abstergo subplot, this game is a fantastic entry to theCreed franchise, if not the best. The ship battles were glorious, the sea shanties were amazing, the settings are rich and vibrant with life, its a must play, really.
