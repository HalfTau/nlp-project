Not nearly as good as AC 123 in my opinion. I just reached the end of the game and the road was...painful. The story inside and outside the Animus is overall boring. The gameplay is exactly the same as in AC 2 nothing new or interesting to discover and the sidequests or challenges arent remotely worth it or fun to accomplish.Ubisoft tried too hard to put french everywhere. It got on my nerves from beginning to end and Im a frenchcanadian from Quebec! Except for the main character and some other pirates, the voice acting is pretty bad.Id give the game a 4/10, just because its still barely enjoyable in the beginningHonestly, thats the last Assassins creed for me. Ubisoft should stop milking that franchise.
