I am torn on whether to recommend this game. The reason for this is because I love the game itself, but it is just so poorly optimised. The game itself is incredably fun, and I love pretending to be a pirate. Plus, as a history buff seeing people like Edward Thatch aka blackbeard make me nerd out a bit. On the other hand, it is a uplay game. I could barely get my game to run at 30 FPS and had several bad glitches. So I am going to go ahead and recomend this game for its sake, but just be prepared to deal with uplay.
