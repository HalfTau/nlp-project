Highly recommended for those interested in openworld and stealth games. You will be thrilled with so much actions before you know it. The game itself introduces a strong focal point in naval exploration for the first time in the series, which is something quite unusual. Another relatively similar game to this is the newer Assassins Creed Rogue. Like all games in the series, the game incorporate both present modernday events and a fictional history of real life events based on the 18th century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, featuring three major cities of Havanna, Nassau and Kinston. The plot is long lasting and quite overwhelming as you progress further in the story.
