You should buy this game just for the sea shanties. The sea shanties are ing great I sing them all the time, when Im working, when Im in the shower, when Im drunk off myThe rest of the game is quite fun too, although by the end the mechanics are somewhat repetitive  and I suspect theyre especially repetitive if youve played other assassin games before.I dont recommend doing any of the fetch quests except for sea shanties of course.The naval combat is quite fun and challenging.
