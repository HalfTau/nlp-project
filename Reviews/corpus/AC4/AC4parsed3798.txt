Okay, up front, this is not so much a review as a rant. Not against the game itselfits fun, I enjoy it, glad I bought it.  The graphics are gorgeous . . . with one exception.  Why, oh why do game makers NEVER get the ships right?Okay, I hear you all shout Who cares? Its a game moron!  Well, clearly I do.  Im a sailor and ships matter to me. As I already said, the graphics are beautiful.  Buildings, landscape, people, animals, all gorgeously rendered with very good accuracy. And then there are the ships, ships with meaningless rigging, weird looking sails, hulls that only vaguely resemble an actual ship of the period. Dont even get me started on the fact they can apparently sail in any direction regardless of wind direction. I mean the game designers clearly spent a LOT of time working on the graphics. Could they not have spent a little MORE time getting the details on the ships right. Honestly I wouldnt even quibble about the ability to sail directly into the wind so much if they just looked right.  Its not as if its hard to find information about ships. There are hundreds of books out there.  I myselftho I blush to say itam an expert on 17th19th century ships. I would be delighted to consult on ship design and appearance.  I might not even charge if it means a game with ships that look right.So to sum up Yes, its a good fun game. But for a game that is supposed to be about ships, the ships are very disappointing.  Not that Ubisoft is alone in this.  The next game of this sort I see with accurate well detailed ships will be the first.
