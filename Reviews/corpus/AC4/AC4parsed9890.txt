After almost 50 hours of gameplay I finally 100 memory synced and the reward wasnt worth it at all.The worst part of the entire thing was doing the mind numbing Uncharted chests/fragments, I can explain it in steps100 Uncharted1. Start sailing your ship.2. Open the map and mark a chest/fragment.3. Sail to the chest/fragment.4. Jump off your ship.5. Swim to the island.6. Climb tree/rock and get your chest/fragment.7. Swim back to your ship.8. Climb your ship.Now repeat steps 18 76 times until you get all 46 uncharted chests and 30 uncharted fragments.But if you ignore that everything else you do is pretty fun, I enjoyed sailing the ship but the real fun for me was exploring the lush islands on low settings because the game is horribly optimized.Also the out of the Animus stuff is pretty fun to, I enjoyed the puzzles they gave you for the activities there and you found out some pretty cool stuff.All in all the game just sucked completely.8/10
