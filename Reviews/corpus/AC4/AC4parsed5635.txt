One of the most entertaining titles I have on my PC. There are a lot of things in this game which are quite tedious and not fun such as the diving bits they couldve been made better than they are.Steam Store doesnt show that I own most of the DLC except the timesaver packs  worthless because the icons can be unlocked using maps in game  but Steam library shows I own the DLC. It is very annoying that Steam knows of DLC in one area but not the other.Ive been waiting on a good pirate game since Disneys game but I believe that Disney got the sea battles right and Black Flag was meh. I did like boarding on Disneys game because you could enter lower decks and find chests, hidden treasure, etc but in this game you could only stay above deck unless it was a mission...Id recommend getting this game...
