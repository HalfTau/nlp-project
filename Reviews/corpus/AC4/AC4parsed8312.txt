This new addtion to the franchise was not in vain. It exceeded my expectations since the undeserved demise of ACIII and is living up to the name. Just not in a way you would expect.ONE problem I have with this game is I feel like its a Pirates of the Caribbean game instead of an Assassins Creed one. This disappointed me at the beginning but I overlooked that. Instead I found myself exploring a whole world just like I once did in the great Read Dead Redemption. The characters are as memorable as the AC Ezio storyline ones and the locations are very exotic and intense.My favorite thing throughout the whole game was sailing out into the sunset, listening to my sailors sing sea shanties and being a true pirate. Which is more rewarding when you actually play it.The story was lackluster, but the gameplay quality has improved greatly. Did I fail to mention ship battles? Highly recommended if youre a devoted fan of the series or if you simply want to try a pirate/assassin game.
