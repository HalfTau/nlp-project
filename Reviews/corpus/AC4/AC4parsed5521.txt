So after putting in more than 50 hours and getting over 75 completion I lost my save in a BSOD. And for the third time already... Note that no other program causes BSODs on my computer, only AC IV.Seriously Ubisoft, last time you get any money from me.10/10 for the game0/10 for Ubisoft.I wont even try to finish the game anymore, Ill just find a Lets Play and watch the ending.
