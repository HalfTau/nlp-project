Disclaimer never played any of the other Assassins Creed games.Its buggy and kept crashing for me, I think it works better for Nvidia graphic cards not sure and I have AMD. With that I understood the overall story and in my opinion the game is a lot of fun. The assassination/spying part is fun if repetitive, a lot of collectables that you dont really need but most of them are in good reach so not a problem, playing the pirate part is awesome whether boarding ships, hunting whales or just surfing listening to pirate songs. Also the main story was very interesting especially towards the end, developed characters and a huge world to explore, a definite buy.
