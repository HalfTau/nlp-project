Do I recommend this game? YES!Do I recommend this game on Steam? NO!The game game itself is a master piece, its graphics are great, it has a story rich storyline and has hours of game play, but with buying it on Steam it doesnt save the game correctly and does lose your save unless you do a couple of tweaks.Just beware about buying it on Steam, but do get the actual game, its great.
