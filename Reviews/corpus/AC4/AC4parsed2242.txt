This is far more diverse compared to other Assassins Creed games.I really loved the feeling this game brought me when i started the game.and then later sailing the vast sea of caribbean,filled with islands, relics, secrets, treasures, forts, villages, enemy ships and even more.As soon as i realized how big the game is and how much there is to do and accomplish,i thought i will do 100 playthrough and i did, it lasted 73h for me.Visuals are really good, but i had to tinker with the graphic settingsso that there is not so much stutter, even had to download a separate program,just check from the community guides top ratedSounds and music were immersive and fit right in to the pirate theme.The shanties were so well made that i sometimes just made an additional tripto just hear the pirate crew singing and shouting.Story didnt kick right in for me, it lasted some time before i got into it. Its good tho,butMissions were different from each other but still had the same idea many times, but it didnt matter because the place wasnt always the same and there were more options to assassinate and strategize.One thing i hated was the tailing missions, like in every Assassins creed game.Not every one of them were annoying or painfully long, but some were just too boring.The grinding can be real in this game. You really have to invest time to this game to get all the collectibles.I still have Freedom Cry to be played through, but before that i think i will take a little brake fromthe pirate world and focus on some other games.I really recommend this game, as its one of the better games of the Assassins Creed franchise, if not the best.9/10
