Great game, the story is good, combat is exciting but sometimes maybe too simple because there isnt much variety to the tools. You need to progress in the main storyline to unlock certain upgrades which may prevent you from doing things a certain way. The naval combat is good, roaming the oceans on the high seas but it does get boring after doing it over 200 times. I wouldve liked it if they kept the hunting aspect from AC3, beause in AC4 there were either 12 animals at a time and they were hard to find even in a designated area. I wouldve also liked it if you could actually have different ships to navigate, you do man other ships as part of the storyline but those are just basic ships with no upgrades.
