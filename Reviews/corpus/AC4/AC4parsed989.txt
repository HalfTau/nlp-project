Ive just finished the game and after some time reflection this is my reviewPros Large, atmospheric and detailed areas to explore Various side activities to do  Treasure hunting, Contracts and Animal hunting Different gadgets to use  pistols, swords, rope dars, blowpipes  Historical characters  Blackbeard, Anne Bonny, John Rackham, etc Fun and intensive ship and Fort battles The Ships have good mechanics Great character and ship customization The shanties were really amusing to hearCons As the game goes on youll realise how repetetive the layout of the main quest is You can buy the best weapons in the first 2 hours of the game on the first island Some minor glitches Uplay can be a pain for some playersFinal verdic   8/10Ive put 40 hours in this game and theres still places Ive not explored and conquered. I do belive you wont regreat buying this game and that youll have your money worth.
