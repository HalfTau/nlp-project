Fun pirate game with some annoying Assassins Creed stuff jammed into it.ProSailing physics realistic enough, but more fun and forgiving than actual sailing.Ship combat allows sinking or boarding and capture of  enemy vessels.Burried treasures with treasure maps.Fluid violence mechanics that skillfully integrate sword work, pistols, and various specialty tools including a handful of coins.Stealth not required for success in most story missions.Pirate Hunters give a challenge as well as a chance at highest quality vessels to capture.Realistic levels of corruption and bribery.Famous pirates Blackbeard, Mary Read.Shanties sung by crew while sailing around.Fast Travel. Both around the big map and within the various locations synch points.Real World story can be very interesting.ConsLots of poorly done stealth sections, especially the annoying tail and/or eavesdrop, make many main story missions a pain.Lots of good equipment is storylocked behind midgame or lategame missions. You cant get a diving bell till phase 6, cant get a blow gun until phase 7, and the rope darts wait until phase 11. There are only 13 phases, and number 13 is an epilogue.Combat sequnces, especially when boarding large ships, can be buggy attacks are not executed, or blocked, for unknowable reasons.100 single player requires tedious repitition of various activities, removing the fun from playing.Multiplayer uses a completely different control layout than single player. And isnt much fun, in my opinion.Real World story is mandatory.
