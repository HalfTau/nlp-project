In my opinion, its the best Assassins Creed game in the series, at least since Brotherhood. The story is fun, the open world is huge and engaging, the sidemissions and crafting are integrated enough within the story arc and setting. I did the full story arc and about 70 of the game in 36ish hours. On the flip side, there is still some control glitches but less than most AC games and way, way too many tailing missions for my taste. I havent tried the Multiplayer and I dont plan to. I do plan to finish exploring all of the caribeans, getting most unlocks and finding those buried treasures.
