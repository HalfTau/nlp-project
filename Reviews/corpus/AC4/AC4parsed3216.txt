I guess the game is okay, just more of the same, and ships seemed fine for what they are. BUTPC port is ABSOLUTEThe controls are at best mild suggestions the game ignores at its leisure. Play with a controller or not at all, but Id also guess the same issues are present there. Be prepared to try missions again and again until the controlslottery lets you win.I mean, how in HELL do you mess up reading commands from keyboard and implementing them? EVERY OTHER GAME EVER has been able to do that!Not to mention the animationkillloops, where getting hit during animation such as putting your gun away after firing results in the animation restarting  indefinately. So if you shoot someone anywhere near melee, be ready to watch yourself die, because you got stuck in an infinite loop while a guard gives you spanish steeland kidney transplant.Id refund the game, but sadly, by the time youre mostly throught tutorials, the time for refunds has passed. If Id paid full price instead of Steam Sales price, Id be ing livid. As it is, Im just pretty ing angry.DO NOT BUY THIS
