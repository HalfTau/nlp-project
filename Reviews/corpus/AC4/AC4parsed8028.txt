A diamond in the rough. AC IV has a fair few unfixed bugs, parts of the game are via a website that frequently fails and claims that its a Beta, and theres various oddball moments such as punching someone or using a sleep dart and having it register as a kill. Theres a lot of clipping errors in the clothing and  other small matters.None of these prevents you from enjoying the game though  And at about 80 hours of gameplay, with a nice variety of outfits and upgrades to chase, its a worthy chapter in the Assasins Creed series.Especially once its on sale.
