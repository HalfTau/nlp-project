As far as the Assassins Creed franchise goes, this game has to be a personal favorite. The graphics are quite nice, and the gameplay responsive. The angle of piracy has got me hooked indeed, as the beach like visuals and stunning lighting make the experience feels fresh. Aside from the dull eavesdrop and tailing missions, the mechanics of boating and overtaking ships will keep you entertained even with the main story finished. The only downside has to be the added PhysX, which allegedly improves all aspects of smoke in the game but ends up making the smoke look unnatural to its surroundings and greatly hurts performance. Beyond that however, the music, gameplay, and incredibly detailed open world truly flourishes this games presentation and appeal.
