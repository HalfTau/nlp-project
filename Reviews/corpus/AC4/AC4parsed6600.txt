If you want to buy an assassins creed game and do not own this, get it. Unity is buggy and has some microtransactions. Blackflag is fun story is crappy though, has a lot of freedom to do as you wish and at 9.99 its a bargin at time of posting this review. 19.99 is a fair price too for a 1 year old game.
