Awesome game!  I got it on the Christmas sale and it was worth every penny.  Nothing better than being a pirate and doing whatever you wanted.  Naval battle were repetitive but still fun.  Minor gripe was that my player could climb and 10 story building but got stuck on a 2 foot wall or rock.  Annoying.  Overall 8/10  !
