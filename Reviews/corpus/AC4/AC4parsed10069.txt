Asssassins Creed IV Black Flag is the best game in the series. As said on the Weekend Confirmed podcast, the series was always meant to be a pirate game, and Black Flag really makes you feel like you are a pirate. Naval combat took a big leap foward from the last game, crafting is much easier, Fast Travel is connected to the Synchronozation Points now, and there is nothing better than sailing on the open sea to a Shanty or two. If youve never played an Assassins Creed game, this is a good one to get started with.
