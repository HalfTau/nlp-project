Unplayble, requested full refund. got it within an hour.Running windows 10 with 16GB of Ram, Nvidia GTX 960 4GB  and 8 core AMD at 4.0ghz. both Assassins Creed III  Syndicate run with little issue though Syndicate has to be on all low probably because of my AMD processor for whatever reason nothing i could do with black flag would bring the framerate above 22fps on average. and i looked for eveyr possible solution all those with the same issue had one or another fix their problem but not for me it was frustrating because i know my specs are fine. i would have happily played this game with everything off and or on low at frigging 720P BUT that didnt even have an affect. super frustrating. super disappointed. guess ill just have to buy this on PS4 when its that cheapTill then Ill just pretend to be a pirate in my backyard. no matter what my grandmother says.... THANKS UBISOFT.
