At first this game dissapoints being a poorly optimized port from PS3 judging by those files steamsteamappscommonAssassins Creed IV Black Flagmultivideosps3name.bik with framedrops in open spaces, which are primary part of the game, and out of sync engine cutscenes  Id really prefer them prerendered in this case, I wouldnt mind extra GBs. Laptops HD5400 cant handle them unfortunately plus 13.4 driver shuts off displays backlight for reasons unknown, but it handles enclosed sequences, Aveline DLC and multiplayer.It just needs better preferences section  I cant turn off bloom, multiplayer graphic settings dont save at all, MP and SP .exe are separate, but I cant have fancy French voiceover and English voices for SP. PunkBuster service may need some kind of repairing  but it works, I never noticed cheating. It feels like in development game was remade, so software experience was partially forgot so new problems appear.But gameplay is awfully addictive, I just got it for multiplayer but was dragged into pirating, I still played half of it one more location/mission and Im done. Shanties are amazing! Exploring is interesting even with reused  buildings  settlements look way to similiar. There are activities for any taste, and they feel like one whole thing. Aveline DLC was enjoyable no learning curve bullcrap there, straight to actionWhats best for me is multiplayer, it just keeps improving with every game. Now theres Game Lab for costumizing game modes, Assasinate mode, which encourages stealthiness and caution even more. Wolf Pack is like a missing piece  its both practicing ground and coop variant.
