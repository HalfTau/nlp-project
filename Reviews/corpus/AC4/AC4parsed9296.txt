The GoodSailing Activity is Really Fun  spent 90 of my time sailing the open seas, lots of things that you can do on board your shipNo more lockpicking on treasure chests  it was really annoying on AC3, good thing they removed it on AC4, imaging all the trouble you would go through just collecting thos treasuresCompanion App  good for managing your captured ships, while you are away from your PCThe BadVery short main story  Ive played all of the other AC franchise gamesPC, and this one feels like the shortest, but I guess they have compensated with side quests and collectibles, so this isnt a deal breaker for me.Boring Assassin Contracts  the quest requirements for a fullsync assassin contract is pretty dull, most of it just involves you not being detected before the kill.RecommendationsBuy all the DLCs  they are very very helpful and can save you lots of time.Do as much sailing and side quests as you can before moving on with the main quests because it is really short.My wishlistI wish I can use my captured ships in fleet vs. fleet battleBetter assassin contract missions
