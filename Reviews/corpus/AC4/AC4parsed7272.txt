Edit OK, Im changing my review to Recommended. Once I disabled cloud sync I had no more problems. Love the game.Previous Comments Its a great game but the save system is badly flawed. You can loose your entire game progress at any moment and have to start completely over. Im talking New Game start over. Unbelievable? Yeah. I was shocked.And its been broken since its release October 2013. As great as the game is, its pretty pathetic to not be able to count on a single save of any sort.If you do purchase/play, its recommended to use a third party save system such as Game Save Manager and to disable the cloud sync. Yeah. A cloud save that can completely fail with no option for reloading from a local save. Pathetic.
