Great game, awful port, and when I say awful, I mean awful. It is hands down the worst port to pc I have ever played. I seriously regret purchasing this. Not only did I have to put up with crashes, lag spikes and glitches, but the game did not save at all the last time I played it, lost over 8 hours of gameplay. I do not recommend this game to anyone.
