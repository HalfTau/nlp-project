This was my first game of Assassins Creed series and i must say ive became a Fan, this game is really good, there are lot of things to doand many ways to kill the enemie... I have already conclude the main story but i just completed 53  of the game! Damn, i need to conquer all the map or i cant call me a pirate /Anyways, the sory was really good so if you want to play a single player game with a great story and lot of things to do then this is your game!
