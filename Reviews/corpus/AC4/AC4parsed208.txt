This game is by far the funnest pirate game Ive played, let alone the AC title for it. It could be a stand alone pirate game and still be amazing. The way you set sail with your crew, putting the fear of god into anyone at sea to cross your path.Taking down my first Man O War. I freaking jumped out of my chair, I fought that  for 10 minutes not super upgraded with Jackdaw your ship at the time. I mean whats not to love? Okay, maybe you dont get other ships... However, I like the idea of having one ship, as you build it up, fight bigships with it, dive from the very top a few times, or jumping from your ship to board an enemy ship... You come to feel like YOUR ship cant be replaced. I mean I get it its a game, you want bigger and better.Pros.Youre a pirate.You own an island.Pushing your crew out of your boat, when you try to board the enemy ship.Blowing the hell out of naval fortresses.TAKING OVER that same fortress.Shark/Whale harpooning at sea.Cons.Youre not a pirate in real life.
