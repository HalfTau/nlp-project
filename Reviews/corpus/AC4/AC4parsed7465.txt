Possibly the best entry in the series so far, and a huge improvement over 3. The main storyline quests are still a fairly linear experience without much freedom to deviate from the scripted manner youre supposed to complete missions in, but in terms of sidequests the game opens up incredibly early, and apart from a handful of storylinespecific locations that dont unlock until later in the game youre free to explore more or less wherever you want. Shiptoship combat is a big part of the open world experience, and its very well designed and satisfying with a huge number of upgrades available to improve your ships capabilities, and the option to capture enemy ships for bonus loot and put them to work in your fleet.Unfortunately the melee combat is kind of a mess  especially in large encounters where it can be almost impossible to attack a specific enemy reliably, which is doubly infuriating when faced with a combination of enemies that are immune to different types of attacks. And the free running still has a mind of its own sometimes, resulting in Edward being really, really interested in running up and down a wall continually instead of going around corners. But apart from a few minor control issues, the overall game experience is a huge improvement on the previous instalment, and the number and variety of side activities provides plenty to keep you playing beyond completing the main storyline.
