Im going to be honest. This game was a birthday present. I wasnt too crazy about it. I was pretty dissapointed with Assassinss Creed III. Lemme tell ya. Its fixed. They have cleaned up the combat. You actually feel like a real pirate and the fleet system is fantastic. Even if Assassins Creed III wasnt your thing this will be. Amazing Game! Better have a powerful system though! !
