As you probably have heard a dozen times by now, this game consists of two parts  an awfully tired Assassins Creed game, and a rather beefed up naval combat from AC3. I will also reuse the same arguments from previous AC reviews and say that it feels as awful as ever to wander around the map collecting dozens of wolfs aholes with the payoff being a checkmark in abstergo challenges... I mean, seriously? The only decent activity of this type are the templar hunt missions, since they feel somewhat diverse, dont contain optional objectives for the love of god, dont ever waste your time chasing them, and actually provide a meaningful reward.The naval combat is extremely simplified, and as soon as you start upgrading your ship, the difficulty falls below the sea level. Yet, the sailing part is still rather atmospheric and enjoyable for what it is  a distraction from frustrating AC gameplay and a fun jukebox with sea shanties.So, why am I recommending this game, you might ask? Pirate setting, especially one with naval gameplay, is a rarity nowadays. And if the gamers show their interest in the setting, we just might get an actually good pirate sim, so that I finally can move on from playing Age of Pirates 2...
