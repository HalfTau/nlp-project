I feel vindicated after the last Assassins Creed game AC 3. This game is more of a pirate game than it is an AC game, which is awesome! You get right into the action at the beginning instead of sitting through hours of cut scenes like AC3. Sailing your ship around the open seas was so much more fun than I expected. The fluidity from land to sea and visa versa was much more smooth than I anticipated. Its beautiful, it offers lots of things to do, and the ship controls are great.Still dont like all the Abstergo, Templar, and modern day aspect to AC games because it just doesnt make sense anymore. But the pirateassassin side to this game take front and center.
