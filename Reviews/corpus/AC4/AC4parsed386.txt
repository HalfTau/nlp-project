Theres a good game in here somewhere, burried under all the tailing missions and pointless fetch quests. A weak story and characters you wont care about make the game feel more like a chore. There are great infiltration missions occasionally and the sea combat is fantastic but ultimately this game felt like a waste of time for me. A great stealth/action alternative is Metal Gear Solid V.
