I havent played much of the campaign but these are my current impressionsPros Sailing and sea combat is really fun and addicting. Ship and weapon upgrades require materials which you get from raiding other ships. Assassination missions are fun and sometimes challenging. Collectibles are kinda fun to collect. Base building is fun and makes useful buildings. Graphics and water textures are really nice.Cons A bit laggy if you have a lower end PC or laptop. Story didnt catch my interest. Kenways Fleet was fun at first but then started to feel like a chore. I wasnt interested in what I saw of the present storyline but it might get better. Multiplayer didnt have anything to do with ships.All in all, I enjoyed playing this for the time I did, I suggest getting this if you think you will like the sea battles.Kenways Fleet is a mode where you select your ships and send them on missions and have to wait in real time for them to complete. Its like a freemium app.
