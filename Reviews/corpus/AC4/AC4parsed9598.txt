Assassins Creed Black Flag is a game that brings you the awesome pirate life.The main charaters name is Edward Kenway, father of Haytham Kenway which you met in Assassins Creed 3.He leaves home for a pirate life, hoping for great fortune and riches, but it turns out to be a more bumpy ride than he first had thought.After some missions you will get your own ship, which you can upgrade by increasing the number of cannons, the armor of your ship, mortar cannons, a battering ram so you can crash into enemy ships and so on.The game encourages you to sail around and fight other ships, board them and steal their cargo in order to upgrade your ship with metal, wood, cloth and money. Rum and suger can be sold to get even more money.When you destroy enough ships you will get more wanted stars, the more stars you get the stronger pirate hunters will be spawned, and they will hunt you until you manage to remove the stars.The seas are vast and there is loads of stuff to do, be it gathering mayan secrets for something to be revealed, or following treasure maps and finding your treasure. And dont worry, after completing the main story you can still sail around and do these things.And if you are done with the main story or everything, what I love to do is to put on some epic Pirates of the Carribean music while sailing!However this is still an Assassins Creed game, so you will still be doing missions quite similar to the previous games. Like Tail the target, eavesdrop the conversation, kill target, escape area and become anonymous and so forth. But there are also missions where you sail with your ship to destroy another enemy ship.The main story is worth completing, because it is really entertaining and you will meet many interesting and cool characters, the ending was to me quite touching in different ways.If you like me doesnt like the new futuristic world where you sit in a machine, then there is both a positive and negative side.The negative side is that you are in a kind of machine.The positive side is that they have removed many of the animations inside the world where it continously remind you that you are not in the world, in the previous games you would see things manifest around you like you were in a machine, you dont see it as much in this game. And you are only drawn out of the world about 5 times.So because of this I feel that this is an improvement.I recommend this game to anyone that is interested in the pirate life, sailing around in your own ship, fighting the royal navy or pirate hunters! This is without a doubt my favorite Assassins Creed game so far!
