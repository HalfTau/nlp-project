5 out of 10This is not the best game in the seriesThis is not Assassins Creed. Its a pirate sea game. Not fun. Infuriating. Dude isnt even an Assassin or a Templar. The fleet system is terribleHistory of the game is hmm alright I got the game completedI am not going to play Assassins Creed Black Flag againHope the next assassins creed game is better
