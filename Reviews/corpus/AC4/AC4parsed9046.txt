Assassins Creed IV Black Flag combines all the good things from earlier Assissins Creed games with a whole new game mechanics and way to tell the story.And the best thing, you ask? You get to do all the piraty stuff you dreamed about when you was 5.I havent enjoyed a pirate game like this since Age of Pirates and Sid Meyers Pirates!My only wish now is that they release a DLC or sequel that removes everything but the freeroaming and the story line POHOOOYYASCALLYWAGS!
