Finally a pirate game to continue on where Sid Miers Pirates left off, i am talking about the one back in the late 80s Black Flags strength is definately the open water sailing and pirating although the combat and gameplay that has made Assassins Creed games what they are today is still there and it has even been refined slightly. Saying this there is definately a lot less of the usual combat and gameplay but I found it refeshing and cant get enough of sailing the high seas Argghhh.Graphics and Audio are excellent and set a new standard for the AC franchise.Jacko Rating7.5/10
