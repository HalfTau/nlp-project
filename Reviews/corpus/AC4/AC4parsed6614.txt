Best in the series.Remarkable story, the main character which is Edward Kenway really get the character, and he took us to explore his world of pirates and assassin. I suggested that if you buy this game, buy Assassins Creed III and Assassins Creed Rogue also, youll be taken deeper into the story.11/10
