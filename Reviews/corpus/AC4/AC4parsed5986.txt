This game was great on PS4, which is where I ended up playing it because the save feature did not work reliably when played through Steam. After Ubisoft never responded to my emails and Steam refused to continue talking to me after I admitted attempting to contact Ubisoft, I swore to never buy Ubisoft games through Steam ever again. That saved me from blowing my money on Unity.The game would be great IF it worked... and it doesnt. Not through Steam anyway. And dont expect a refund if your product doesnt work and dont expect Steam to honour local laws and regulations requiring them to provide refunds when the product doesnt work. It is all in the fine print.
