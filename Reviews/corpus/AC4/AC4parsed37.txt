Ive not play many games with open world but I will. Because of AC IV. I just loved this game. I only play Single Player, but I still had so much fun exploring the world, completing all the side activities, and also following the main story line. Definitely, this game will remain one of my favorites for the lifetime. I already got all the available AC games and want to check out the older games as well. This is a mustplay!
