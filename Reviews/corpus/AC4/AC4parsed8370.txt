This game is amazing. The only other good pirate game Ive played that has been anywhere near this is sid meiers pirates for ipoddancing is easier. i have not played any other assassins creed game and so far the story is rather simple. the gameplay is awesome and using keyboard and mouse it almost feels like batman if ya know what I mean. I had some problems and i recomend that you take great care buying it inless you have an invidia graphics card.
