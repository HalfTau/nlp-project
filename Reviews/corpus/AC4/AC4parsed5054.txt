The first AC game Ive played to the end.Stealth is a joke, if youve played Batman AA/AC etc, Thief, Mark of The Ninja, etc. But running on rooftops and killing redcoats like a parcour boss is thrilling, for a while.But Its the pirating that hooked me, you see. I loved sailing, battling with ships and stealing their booty, attacking forts, exploring sunk galleons and harpooning big mad fish. This is the core of it all, the main story is a bit all over the place. It has its moments, but none of it beats any of the battles with legendary ships.So I recommend this, especially for the pirate experience. Its fantastic as far as that is concerned. The rest is gravy.
