The game seemed fun until I lost all my save progress. Even after disabling the Uplay cloud saves, it still wouldnt reliably save and Id lose progress. This just happened in 11/2015, meaning they still havent fixed it and this is a very clear bug from when it first came out!I Uninstalled it before I had a full blown hissy fit. Fortunately I got this one on sale, but still, total waste of cash. Skip this one, and ef Ubisoft and Uplay. Never buy their games again
