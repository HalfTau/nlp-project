Best Assassins Creed in the series.Great combat,naval battles,story and environment.Story was honestly the deepest out of the franchise,some missions were sad and some funny,buy the game and find out but and the end its the best part.Combat and sound are nicely done,you can hear when your going into the bushes or the wind/weather and when you manage to kill a guard/enemy in combat,the sound of the swords on the floor is satisfying.I recommend this game for new comers to Assassins Creed.
