Amazing, very immersive. The graphics are stunning when youre maxed out, but thats not the only thing this game has. I love to ability to sneak and stealth through missions although im not that good at it and end up fighting 1 v 10s aaaaallll the time. Either way, this game is recommended when you want to spend 25 hours being a pirate and all.
