Had this game when it first came out. I played the hell out of it. It was fun, and the glitches and bugs were not enough to make me hate it. At the time I thought it was the best game of the series, but now, now I cant do anything.I have literally had to start a new game three times THREE, in the last two days because for some reason it doesnt save my game. Uplay sucks, like bad, and it only seems to get worse. The customer service is horrible, they dont reply to emails, and Uplay is always broken. I bought this game on steam because I coudlnt remeber my uplay account from like a year ago, and surly it hadnt saved my game. But I still had to get on my Uplay account to play. My fault, I didnt read that it needd this. I play pc games so I woulnt have to deal with this kind of crap, but man, console is starting to sound fun again.
