To start things I recommend this game only for diehard fans of the series or for those looking for a naval fighting game set in the Caribbeans.Second, I only recommend this game if you can get it at a discount, under 10euro, its just not worth it at its full price.The game feels more like a massmurder sim than a assassins/stealth sim, you just go and kill everything., but at this point people shouldnt go in a Assassins Creed game expecting a stealth game.The game ran well on my system  average build i3, 8GB RAM, 1GB Video, 1600x900The game is miles ahead of its predecessor AC III but overall its plagued by the same problems that appear across the franchise, the horrible fighting system, and the pointless grind for items.Finally I go back to my first statement, buy this game only if you are a fan of the series or looking for decent game with good naval combat set in the 18th century Caribbeans.
