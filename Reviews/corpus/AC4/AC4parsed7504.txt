This game is another great addition to the Assassins Creed line of games.I was concerned when I first heard about it because AC3 was so bad, but Black Flag proved to be better than its predecessor. The whole ship mechanic has been improved upon threefold, and even though a lot of time is spent on the ship instead of running around and climbing things, its still as much fun as the Ezio trilogy. Theres still plenty of enemies to assassinate with the hidden blades, and plenty of sneaking around and hiding behind things to follow targets, but the game feels much more gungho with the more regular use of pistols instead of blades.
