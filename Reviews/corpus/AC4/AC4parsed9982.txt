My favourite Assassins Creed Game Even Better than the old ones especially Assassins Creed IIBut it story doesnt push it at 9/10.Not lying this can easily be a nominee to beat Game Of The Year without any sort of conversation.This Game is really game for addiction. Assassins Creed franchise use to bring a great quality and unbelievable side missions.Assassins Creed IV BlackFlag reclaims your adventure love.Its deserve 8/10.Glorious
