A rather well done pirate game shoehorned into a crappy Assassins Creed game.The sailing and piracy aspects of the game are enjoyable and entertaining. The Assassins Creed portion is poorly done and frustrating. Every plot/story mission follows the same formula  follow some guys perhaps listen in on their conversation then you kill someone or sneak into a building...and kill someone. If you want to succeed at the missions you need to let the game force training wheels onto the sides of your controller. Each mission has a pretty strict path that you must freerun along in order not to be detected while staying. It is basically the same style of Call of Duty. If you go off the bumperbowling lane the game lays out for you there will be nothing but mission restarts and frustation. On the topic of free running the game is really hit or miss. It seems to often outsmart itself with which objects you want to grab, climb, and hang from. The enforced stealth missions and quick time events should also just no longer exist in games at this point. Enforced stealth in this game suffers from ridiculous AI and issues where your freerunning overthinks something you and end up in a dirction you did not intend.I would not recommend this game until its price drops down into the 20 range. A solid pirate game stuck in a stale intellectual property it would have not suffered if it was a standalone game free of the existing IP.
