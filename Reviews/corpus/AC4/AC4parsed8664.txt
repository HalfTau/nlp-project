I think this possibly the bestcreed game in a long time, i have been playing it on my bootcamp macbook pro 2012 and it runs smoothly in medium, slow frame rates every now and then, but its perfectly playable and looks beautifulAs for the gameplay, it has a massive open world with tons of fun things to do, whether its taking forts down, rading plantations, diving through shipwrecks or just picking fights with the spanish or the british ships it has tons of hours of gameplay, and the story is pretty good aswell if you like pirates and the caribean tales..I have played about 45hrs i think so far, i have done half the story and 1/4 of the extra activities.. If you want to reach 100 completion you have at least 100hours of gameplay, i truely recomend this game!
