This is one of the only games ever I wanted to write a semiactual review for.I love this game a lot, and this will be a kinda updated thinger for anyone who wants to buy this like 4 years after it came out like I did.First off, this is a completionists paradise, with tons of junk to do besides playing the great story Which Ill get to.Things you can doThat being said, the story is great. It made me hardly wait to play again, and thats not happened with any game for a while. Theres tons of collectibles, ship upgrades, supply gathering, character upgrades, cosmetics, etc.I give this game a 9/10Would be 10/10 but I ing hate sharks
