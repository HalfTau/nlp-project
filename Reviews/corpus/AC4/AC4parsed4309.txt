Excellent Game. The only pirate game out there. I think they should make a sequel to this one...The Good1. Own your ship2. Fight in the seas3. Capture islands  forts4. Also play as contract killer assassin.5. Graphics are good.The Bad1. When you board a ship to capture controls become really sloppy, you cannot focus on single enemy  so cannot kill quickly. But its manageable.2. Sloppy story. Gets boring in the middle.Had Fun doing1. Killing whole army from rooftop. They cannot all climb from one ladder so it was fun throwing them down once anyone climbed . Avoid gunshot from guard by putting his own man infront of me.2. Taking out legendary ships  grt white shark  whales.
