This is the best assassins creed game. Period maybe not better than brotherhood. Ive played them all. Really makes you feel like a pirate, its super fun just exploring the world and visiting islands when youre not assassinating scrubs. Plus the world is really beautiful. Played it for the first time on PS4 and was blown away by the water, it looks amazing if you have a pc that can run the highest settings.
