My favorite so far, despite Uplay. Lost about 40 hrs in one Uplay update. And also bummed that I thought Chris Hemsworth was Edward this whole time. Wrong. You need to update this with Chris Hemsworth as Edward. Big piratey ships, big watery map, big open world fun. And, you probably own this already, so nevermind what I just said.
