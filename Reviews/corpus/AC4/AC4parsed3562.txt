This... I dont know what to say... Like... The story line is like any other love story.But the way they execute it, the characters, who are all beautifully designed.And its just... Everything is unexpected. This is by far the greatest video game I have ever played. Not because of the game mechanics, but the story line and the design. The characters, the accuracy. Its art, and its beautiful. I dont know what else to say, Im speechless. I have never been so in love. This game will capture your attention. Thank you Ubisoft.
