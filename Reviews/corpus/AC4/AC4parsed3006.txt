This game is the best in the series, mostly because, its not an AC game, its a pirate game, with some AC mumbo jumbo thrown in.It excels in the pirate parts, but falls short in the assassins parts.Given the quality of searoaming and shipcombat, you just wont care, and will ask for more of it.Pro nearly openworld gameplay Great pirate gameplay engaging cast of characters with a good story decent AC storyCons repetitive and basic activities terrible AI no cloudsaving
