This will be a review of the PS4 copy since I can hardly get this game to run on my machine even though I demolish the System Reqs. This game is just poorly optimized.Assassins Creed IV Black Flag got me reinterested in this series. After forcing myself to beat Revelations and III, I had little hopes for this game. They said they vastly improved the sailing, which I was hopeful for as the sailing in III was so bad, but I can kinda excuse it as it was their first attempt. The game itself though was okay. But this review is for IV, and I love this game so much. Edward is such a great protagonist. Much better than Ezio fanboys are now triggered and vastly better than Connor.Assassins Creed IV got so much right and made me love the series again. Yes even though Unity was bad at launch the game is much more playable now. Anyway, if you have an XB1, PS4, 360 or PS3, I suggest you go buy this game on one of those as you will have a much better time and be able to actually enjoy this game. The only game I would say I had more fun with is ACRogue, but thats only because it shakes it up and has you play as an Assassin turned Templar.I would give this game a Solid 10/10Now if you will excuse me, I am going to uninstall it from my PC hard drive to make some room.
