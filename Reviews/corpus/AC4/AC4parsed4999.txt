AC Black Flag is slightly above average for me at the very least, as compare to previous franchises it did reach the level and amount of fun of AC 1 and 2 , IMO AC brotherhood tops all of them but Blackflag certainly ranks above 1 but below or equal to the 2nd installment of the franchise. As of now i wont be purchasing anymore of AC games because of the bad reputation, but i will still keep an eye out on them. Assasins creed black flag is most probably to all the AC fan the last good AC game, it adds new features and game mechanics like riding pirate ships and undersea exploration. The game seems to also go towards a different path than other Assasins creed games as it is a pirate theme game. The downside of this game for me though is that it feels boring and repetitive at the middle of it, the characters seems ok but most are just stereotypical pirate with brute voice and all that. The only 3 characters that i have given interest in is James Kidd, blackbeard and ofcourse Edward himself.
