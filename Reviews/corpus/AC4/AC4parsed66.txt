Hey, wouldnt it be cool if we made an open world pirate game, but forced the player to actually be a soulless corporate shill working in a needlessly extravagant corporate office built on greedy, crappy business practices?Yeah! How meta!Cool game if you like tedious overproduction, bad storytelling, and a LOT of handholding and meaningless tutorials to wade through before you get to any real gameplay. Oh, and there is the customeraggressive, unnecessary thirdparty DRM UPlay, which is reason enough not to buy an Ubisoft product. There are better games and better game companies to support. Overrated mediocrity, polished to a shine. Buy something else.
