A vast improvement over Assassins Creed 3 in every term imaginable, Black Flag is at least my second favorite Assassins Creed game, my favorite ocean game, and might even be up there among my favorite games. If you take the time to complete all the side missions and collectibles this game will last you well over 50 hours, but it has at least a 12 hour campaign if you want to rush straight through the story. You can also skip the credits! FINALLY.The missions tend to get a little repetitive, and so does doing everything else that is so much fun in Black Flag from whaling to boarding ships, but by the time it really starts to grind on you is when the last upgrade is gained or the final collectible collected. This game goes a little overboard with the tailing missions, something I wish games on a whole would do completely away with, but theyre manageable even if they artifiically increase the length of the game by making you follow some stupid Templar for what feels like 10 minutes.The story is a lot easier to follow than Assasins Creed 3, and doesnt have nearly as much of a dualstory as the previous Creed games did since you spend well over 90 of your time playing as a pirate instead of bounding around in the real world. Unfortunately this also means the realworld story hardly advances, and the characters we knew from the previous games get so little game time it makes you wonder why they were in it to begin with.Black Flag is also the only Assassins Creed game I could recommend playing entirely on its own with no interest in the rest of the series. It does a great job being a pirate game where you get to pirate other pirates, but still feels like Assassins Creed.
