I guess, this is the game i have some legitimacy to post an evaluation, so be it.Lets start by the single player  I havent finished it to be honnest, more due to a computer format rather than a disinterest to the story itself, but i looked at the end of the story on youtube, and to be honnest i do not regret not finishing the single player. In my opinion AC sp, are getting worse and worse since ACR, the story turned out to be a dead end.I finished AC3 sp painfully, because i couldnt stand Connors behavior, i perfered Haytham so much more, hence im not surprised of my lack of motivation to finish AC4 sp, even though i liked the Kenway character.For the multiplayer, well..., i mainly bought AC4 for the multiplayer, I used to play it a lot so i can speak about it. I was really excited at the begenning, but i realized after playing it for a long time that that the way the developpers made the game always ended to create stereotypes situations, regardless of the mode you are playing FFA or team objectivesManhunt is my main mode but i can decently play all the modes if i can say that well except wanted because it sucks so bad, more because of the players behavior than the mode itselfRemoving chase kills was a huge mistake in my opinion, there are modes where there chase killing doesnt have any sens, such as Artifact Assault or domination, but removing it for manhunt or assasinate turned out the game to disadvantage good players, for a really simple reason  New players in the past AC even though they were also chase killing a lot, had to check their approach metter a minimum, in order not to loose the chase and their contract.Stealth players were then allowed to stun them without abilities, and rewarded for being able to hide and play with their persueurs in order to make them loose the contract. The stupid smoke bomb delay increased this fact even more  Past AC if you were in a chase you could use your smoke to instantly stun your persueur, which is alsmost impossible in AC4 due to the delay, and its not helping the new player to remove the chase for the reason that they will never check their approach meter, wont be able to kill properly on the requested modes, and simply wont progress.The smoke delay also created stereotyped situations in artifact Assault where runners, facing their lack of abilities combination, ended up to knife the denfender and shield port for most of them. The time phase is in my opinion a good ability but becomes really annoying no matter the mode, because players cant mix it properly with another ability.Thats all the paradoxe about AC4 developpers wanted it to be a stealth multiplayer, but it ended up being the complete opposit. The x2/x3  approach meter, is not a bad idea at all, but it remains a unfinished concept in my opinion, for the simple reason that the multiplayer does not fit with some modes like assasinate or artifact assault. On the 1st mode, it completely ruined it even tho im not an assa player i can assure you everyone thinks the same and on the second you finish the session with a ridiculous low score, which by the way create a huge gap between AA and other players in terms of leveling up. im not saying that for no reason, when you play alone in AA when you are a manhunt players the teams becomes so unbalanced because of the gap between your level and the others player levelAbout the basic mechanics, to be honnest i prefer AC4 mechanics free running ect.. than AC3 excpet for the ridiculous mini gun/ pistol kill animation whatever you wanna call it which is completely ridiculous, and gives advatantage to people with bad internet who are able to kill you in places you have never been...I dont wanna completely trash talk about AC4 mp, there had some good ideas such as the Daze perk or putting revelation as a streak... but most of those idead are as i already said unfinished concept in my opinion.Anyway i could continiue for a long time, but im bored of writing. So my last word woud be  Enjoy AC3 multiplayer D
