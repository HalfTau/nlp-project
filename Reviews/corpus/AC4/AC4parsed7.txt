Im a little salty, just so you know... Cant play this game unless you sign into Ubisoft which annoys me outright. Cant remember my password so, Ive changed it multiple times using multiple emails and it keeps telling me the password is wrong soo.... I cant play this game, a game that I dont even like that much, but Im bored out of my mind right now and its not ideal to sit here with my thoughts. 0/10 because Im a whiny diva.
