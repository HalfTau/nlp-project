Best pirate simulator ever. Never thought Id have this much fun doing naval ship battles and upgrading my ship. Oh yeah, the Assassin bits are pretty cool too I guess. Its Assassins Creed though so dont expect major change from previous games on that front.I sure wish theyd just dump the whole Animus concept and not bother with real life aspect though. In this game youre basically a Ubisoft employee testing out this game.
