If this game was a food Unflavoured Popcorn.Equivalent game Who can hold their breath the longest.I played this game because I had nothing better to do, and rising to that challenge and finding something better to do was much more rewarding than any single hour of gameplay.Extensively recycled assets do not a fun game make. Step into the world of some pirate I felt no connection to, voiced by an actor who I vaguely recognise and must assume was the focus when budgetting this film. You will climb the same wooden tower, watch the same half dozen counter attack animations, trudge through identical missions, for 98 of your playing time. There are a handful of puzzles suitable for 5 year olds, along the lines of fitting the correct shape into the appropriate hole.The difficulty curve is nonexistent. If you understand the 3 prompts for counter attacking then you have nearly beaten the game. I say nearly in that the challenge is more a test of endurance, akin to who can hold their breath the longest. Weve all done it, probably a couple of times when we were very easily ammused. But it isnt novel, clever, or truly entertaining.
