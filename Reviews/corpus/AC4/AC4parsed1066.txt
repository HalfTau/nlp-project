This installment of Assassins Creed feels like it is only half Assassins Creed, and half something else. I have enjoyed it a lot though and I like the characters/storyline. I completely reccomend playing this game but I should warn you of two major disappointments I have.The combat, as usual, looks cool but gets repetitive and there are only about 4 different enemy types whether on the seas or on foot. Also, metal. ING METAL. It can take so ing long to upgrade your ship towards the ladder half of the game because most advanced upgrades require at least 300 metal. Each source of metal will only give you 50100 in quantity and it takes about a half hour just to hunt down two or three ships that carry some. This particular issue combined with the mundane combat really bogs down the game for me. I am not a fan of RPGs where you have to tediously grind for hours just to advance in the game and this problem irks me the same way. ESPECIALLY because it is supposed to be an action game where you are always moving around and doing different stuff. Spending hours sailing around in circles searching for metalcarrying ships is not my idea of an action game.
