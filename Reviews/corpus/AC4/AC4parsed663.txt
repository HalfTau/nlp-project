The PC controls are terrible, the camera keeps jumping around, and the bloody idiot character gets randomly defeated by foothigh walls he cant jump over, or wanders up a ladder behind him when you try to move forward. Also, the level design is lousy, not least the interminable follow quests with characters who move faster than you walk but slower than you run, and immediately fail the mission if they spot you running. Not even the interesting take on naval combat makes up for the terrible gameplay.In sum, a typical annual addition to the Assassins Creed franchise.
