One of the better games in  the AC franchise definitely. Edward Kenway is a funny and cool character, in stark contrast to the dreadfully dull Connor/Ratonhghfhfjkl. Naval combat is fun and a nice variety to the stale ground fighting. Graphics look really good tooThough it would be nice if the Jackdaw didnt turn invisible every now and then
