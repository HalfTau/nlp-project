Love it.Ive played all of the AC games except 3 at the time of writing this and have to say its overall my favorite. This is the series that prevents me from reinstalling the Prince of Persia games because I like the freerunning platforming games. Hands down the best pirate game Ive ever played and an excellent AC game as well Combat is tougher than it was in Brotherhood but is offset by having multiple flintlock pistols They came up with a good narrative for gaining money that doesnt involve just leaving the game on overnightI recommend it.
