What makes this game so much fun is the atmosphere. It doesnt feel like an Assassins Creed game, its more of a pirate simulator. Which honestly I am 100 okay with. Sailing around, plundering ships and searching for treasure. A huge step up from the previous title.ProsGreat Atmosphere/ setting.Very few bugs.Youre a mother ing pirate.Sailing and naval warfare mechanics are well done.Large open world to explore which is thankfully not empty but rather full of things to find and kill.Exploring is rewarding.Meh Story is servicable, but not that interesting. I found myself not caring that much about the main plot and spent a lot of time doing other things, finally finishing out the story around the 50 hour mark. It is a really short story had I done it all at once. Theres not much depth here to be found.Abstergo parts take you out of the immersion, at least for me.Most of the characters are very flat and boring.Assassinations are repetitive as usual. Most of the time I have logged is from doing other things rather than the activity derived from the title.Combat is as casual as it gets. No skill needed to be a badass.I did experience some framerate drops but I have an older machine.Uplay. That is all.Conclusion7/10 Its an above average game.
