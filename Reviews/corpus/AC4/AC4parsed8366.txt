Assasins Creed 4 Black Flag is a game of adventure, trial, triumph, crafting, story, and much, much more! In fact, it will have you playing the game, when you arent even playing the game. How so? Well, one of my favorite features was the mobile application that can be used to control your fleet minigame while you are on the go, or to be used while you play as an extra minimap. It interacts with the game in REAL TIME! Yet, that is the first thing Ive got to say about it.This game stepped aside from teh typical assassins creed games. It wasnt about assassins fighting the templars. This game is solely about being a pirate and doing what pirates do, whatever they want. The crafting in this game will allow you to level up Kenway and is absolutely needed for later in the game. It makes crafting necessary and enjoyable. Must I go on about the ship battles? They are great! You can choose to capture the ships for the minigame, mentioned earlier, or you can send them to the drink!At the end of the day, this is your pirate world to live with the templars or assassins alike!10 of 10.
