This is a first AC game, I choosed it because every one said it is one of the better AC games and they were right. Through my play through i enjoy every aspect of the game, the world presented itself wonderfully for me to explore each of the for corners of the caribbean, doing many of the side missions, getting the collectables and conquering each and every naval forttress. I never found my self with nothing to do or finding something to do. The hunting aspect is not huge but if your like me and likes to improve Edwards abilities you will be hunting a bit to. I was always trying to upgrade the jackdaw to better my chances against the stronger ships and stronger naval fortresses. Do u have to upgrade edward or the jackdaw no, but its not an unplseant task to do, and i found my self enjoying it. On the other hand the story was very pleasing to complete, i havent played ther other AC so i cant compare, it may not be perfect but its very good and you wont be dissapointed by it i hope.                                                                         ps hope this helps
