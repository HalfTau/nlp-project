This is the best Assassins creed game i have ever played until Assassins creed origins, although the frames in this game are terrible and i have a beast pc it still goes down pretty far like 40 in some areas. Other wise still an amazing Assassins creed game i have played in a while like Assassins creed 3 and brotherhood and 1. I love it P.S the people who made Assassins creed origins made Assassins creed 4. What i have been told so far.
