This is as far as im concerned the ONLY good Assassins Creed game. Because its not a Assassins Creed game.This is a pirate game with unfortunate Assassins Creed formula tendencies shining through the cracks, these can safely be skipped, you can close your eyes or you can pretend they werent there. You are then left with a very enjoyable pirate game.My only gripe with this pirate game is that you can only ever have one ship and it is the most pitiful of ships. The sloop. A man of my stature should have to accept nothing less than a Man O War, but here we are.The sloop is servicable, but you will at all times feel like a filthy peasant.
