Just when the Assassin Creed formula was getting stale it jolted to life just enough to make one more innovative game. Black Flag is more enjoyable less as an assassination game but more as a swashbuckling pirate adventure. You be spending most of your time on the high seas upgrading your ship, exploring islands for treasure and attacking British and Spanish ships. Such elements are the hightlight of the game. The game is let down however when it sets in that it is still an Assassins Creed game and you will occasionally be grounded do assassin like things. Still the games characters are colourful and intresting and I was kept intrested in the game for many hours.
