This game is one of the most under rated titles I have played in a long time, perhaps ever.I originally played AC 2 on Xbox because Microsoft were giving out free to gold members and I played it alot. After switching to PC I saw that AC 3 on offer and decided to buy it, it had some good parts but didnt flow in the way a good game should.After buying Black Flag when it was on sale for 5 it sat in my library for over a year until I finally got round to playing it and holy st I was missing out! This game finds the perfect balance of pirating and assassaining, when you get bored of killing people you can go for a little sail on the high seas which is surprisingly rewarding. The fact that there are the two separate sides to this game means that its very hard to get bored. The story is pretty much what one would expect and not the highlight of the game but interesting enough to keep going. The real pinacle of this game is the amazing combat and huge number of features and gimicks that keep you occupied indefinetly. The combat is addictive in its beauty and simplicity and I eventually started playing a Batmanesk style with all non lethal weapons and no armed combat giving a much better Batman experience than any of the actual Batman games. The FPS I had was not great but neither is my graphics card but I do think it could be optomised slightly better You still get these  Abstergomodern day side missions but thankfully they are few and far between Experienced only one bug but it was a major one. When going near forts the games would stop showing any movement but turning off antialiasing seems to fix this issue.Altogether a great game that I enjoyed the hell out of and would recommend to any players with quams about the AC francise or just looking to have a rip roaring time.
