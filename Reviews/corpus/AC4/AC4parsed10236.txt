Basically, this game is the best Assassins Creed game ever made.Not only that, this is also the best pirate game ever made.If you are looking for a great open world experience, with many things to do, this is the game for you. There is never a dull moment in this game. From pillaging trading ships of a lower level, to hunting massive humpback whales, or even just dropping anchor at a small island in the middle of nowhere to follow a treasure maps pursuit, the ocean experience is uncomparable. On top of that, the game has refined city exploration with many missions that actually require stealth. I found myself using the environment around me to slowly take down enemies undetected, instead of charging in like a warlord, taking down dozens of people as in the previous Assassins Creed titles. The story is great with many interesting characters to meet and kill.Do you have what it takes to be a pirate, doing anything possible for a little coin and booty?Do you have what it takes to be an assassin, fighting for a noble cause to end the powerhungry templars search for dominance over all?What? You dont? Well then you should still get this game because it is very awesome9.0/10
