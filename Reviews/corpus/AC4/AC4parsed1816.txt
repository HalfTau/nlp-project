A bit late to writing the review, but you know...yo ho yo ho, a pirates life for me!Anyway, this game is the best in the Assassins Creed series and just happens to be the best pirate game out there! Want the best AC game? Here it is! Want the best pirate game? Here it is!Gameplay Aside from one just one   glitch the Jackdaw glitch, Shiver Me Timbers!, the game runs smooth and plays very nicely and is very stable, not like Syndicate. I just wish they kept the crouch option from development. I rate 4.5/5.Music Catchy videogame soundtrack and each location has its own music to it. Memorable and charming. 5/5.Graphics This is KILLER, in a GOOD WAY. Graphics are just amazing, this game is perhaps the only one in my Steam library with the best graphics. Especially the graphics of the bushes. Everything looks so damn realistic! This is definitely a 5/5.Story A decent story with a few plot twists, makes you want to play AC3. While not the best AC story, it definitely deserves to be played. There is minimal modern day, but its still interesting to play through and has a few plot twists up its sleeve as well! I rate it a 4/5.Total 18.5/20  92.5/100  92.5 More like an A or a 95!Summary If you are looking for a great open world, Assassins Creed, or/and pirate game, then look no more! You found the TREASURE! Kudos to you, Ubisoft, you nailed it!My AC games ranking thus far in order both by number and row1. This game AC4, AC Brotherhood, AC32. AC2, AC Rogue3. AC Revelations, AC SyndicateHavent played Unity and the original and not planning to 1 is too old and repetitive, while Unity...well everyone knows about Unity....Please check out my curator page hereP.S. The multiplayer is nice too if you can find a match!P.P.S. Im so glad this games development team is working on Assassins Creed Origins 2017! Looking forward to the game and onward! Set in Ancient Egypt!
