I knew nothing about the Assassins Creed games, or anything about the storyline behind it, I bought this for the pirate sim aspect and nothing else. As a pirate sim, the game is awesome . . .the ship to ship combat is very well done, and the graphics are amazing.  As for the rest of the game, its a PC port abomination that will have your character doing anything but what you want in combat, especially onboard ships. The controls absolutely suck . . .one second a key combination will have you climbing masts, the next second the same combination will have you leaping to your death . . .and forget altogether the lamebackstory that has you decoding memories in some cybertech office somewhere.If you wat a great pirate sim with great ship to ship combat and amazing graphics, this is a fine game . . .the rest is garbage, at least on the PC ported version . . .buy accordingly . . .
