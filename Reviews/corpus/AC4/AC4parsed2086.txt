I lost my faith in the Assassins Creed series since Ubisoft decided to milk the series so i gave up on it after i finished playing the first 4 parts last one i played was revelations now those were the good ones, my friend insisted that i tried black flag and i was not sure but went for it anyway. Game turned out to be a good one with a well written story.This is one of those games that leaves you empty when you finish it  with a tear running down your cheek  Get it and play it.
