This is a really fun game, with breath taking graphics and a decent gameplay. Since Asassins Creed Brotherhood I didnt have that much fun, but... This game, as any other Ubisoft game, have some performance issues, need a Uplay account and have some expensive DLC that it should be inside the game already. Overall, it is a decent and enjoyable game, much better than ACR and AC3.
