Great game, amazing story, and incredible side missions. Its a damn shame that the PC is so awful. My PC sees a 30 fps drop when it rains and the lag is incredible. It is hilarious how it displays the nvidia logo on start up and then you find out the makers havent optimised the PC version at all. It is damn near unplayable at times, which is a shame because it is a good game.
