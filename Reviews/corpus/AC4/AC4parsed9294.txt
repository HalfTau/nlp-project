I have been around the AC series from the very first. Although I have enjoyed playing all of them, no AC game had such changes as this one. Taking it over to the seas and more into piracy was a good idea and, except for some errors, well executed. I loved to play through the mainstory and I still love to sometimes get over the seas and just destroy other ships. This one might even be the only one Im going to get 100. The multiplayer also has a major update, but I still did not fully get into there.
