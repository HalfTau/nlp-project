It would have been perfect if they focused on the pirating and naval battle aspects more, like the classic Sid Meiers Pirates!. This didnt really need to be an Assassins creed game.As it is, the naval aspects are more core to the entertainment value of the game.Still its good and should be bought ON SALE.
