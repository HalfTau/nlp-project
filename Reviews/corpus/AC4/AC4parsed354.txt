The game is great , but there are some major issues that deteriorate your experience unless you buy more DLC. Firstly you have to go through both Uplay and Steam to play this. Steam pop up shows the activation code over and over even after activation.It infuritated me to the point I just downloaded a Crack for the game , blocking me from online features which means I miss out on some of the outfits for Kenway The black outfit unlocked by opening a Social Chest and the red outfit unlocked by Kenways Fleet, so I deleted the entire game and did a clean install. I tried downloading directly from Ubisoft hoping it would get rid of the pop ups and it said I had to have Steam. Ubisoft isnt exactly the most ethical company. They probably couldve made it seamless like buying games from the Uplay Store or just simply activating a Key Code but I feel like they purposedly made it a pain in thefor people who buy their titles from Steam. YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH BOTH STEAM AND UPLAY TO LAUNCH OR DOWNLOAD THE GAME. PLUS THERE IS AN ANNOYING POP UP SHOWING MY ACTIVATION KEY EVERY TIME I LAUNCH THE GAME. If theyre going to make it this much of a pain in thefor people who buy their stuff from Steam why not just keep your games off the Steam Store ?And you need an astronomy chart to understand all the DLC and  which edition to buy for this game , as Ubisoft made it more complicated than rocket science. I tried googling the difference between all the editions and even considered taking a loss on my Steam version of this game and buying the Gold EditionWhich is not on Steam alltogether, but its just a confusing mess what contains what and how to get the full experience. One way or another youre losing out on something small like a sword , outfit , island etc... because you didnt buy a certain edition , are offline or forgot to suck off Ubisoft for some more unlockable in game item they might wanna send your way.This is one of my favorite games of all time. Too bad its made by Ubisoft.
