Well, Im giving this game a postive review based solely on gameplay Ill explain later.It is my first Assasins Creed game, and the pirate aspect got me.  Its a fun friggin game.  Great graphics, fun missions, fun exploration, funfunfun.  And then Im suddenly ported out of the game, hundreds of years into the future to show that I, the player, am really an employee that has something to do with the templars or some crap.Really?  Just let me be a pirate and lets cut the other crap.  This game would have been flawless if it werent an Assassins Creed game, I suppose.  Ironic.Anyways, UbiSoft has completly jacked up my account, and I am now unable to play either this game or Might and Magic VI, due to the fact that I had two different account from Ubisoft, and both games were purchased on Steam.  So now I have to useless games because Ubisoft is incapable of dealing with two seperate email accounts, and of course, it is impossible to play without logging on to their system, sacraficing your firstborn and providing all of your mortgage information and sexual partners for the past decade.Game good.Ubisoft bad.
