Wasnt much of a fan of Assassins Creed in the past and had only played Brotherhood and Revelations which I didnt finish but I decided to pick this game up when it was on sale for cheap. Ran at 60fps constantly at 1080p and every setting on the highest possible with an I76700k at 4.7GHz and a GTX 690 SLI seems to work pretty well.Ive really enjoyed playing the singleplayer and while the trailing missions were annoying they always are other parts such as the ship gameplay and the edgy banter had between Edward and the other characters was great, especially Stede Bonnet. The characters were memorable and really helped make the game realistic. The only thing I didnt really enjoy was the diving aspect of the game due to getting attack by every damn creature that lives down there but its not an important part of the game so it can be avoided.I found very few bugs and glitches during gameplay and nothing that impacted the game negatively causing me to have to restart a mission. The game looks beautiful and plays beautifully as well I was using an Xbox 360 controller for my playthrough.Would recommend if you want to blow up some ships and stab some spaniards.
