My first Assassins Creeds game . Loved it very much . May be the best  and only  pirateSea game ever .Plus the stealth and gameplay was so much fun .The graphics were spectacular on 4K .Even though I hated the Animus game scenes . I dont care about if it was a game from a company , just let me be play with Kenway .The Shanties are  beautiful D  I sing with them , my favourite is  The Dead Horse  the words are  beautiful .Listen to it on YouTube .Even though the fight is   sadly  too simple and easy . You just mash one button to kill the Templars and from time to time again you counter when they attack . if the fighting gameplay was a greater than this  Id rate this game a 10/10 .My rate is 9/10 . A Must Play Game .
