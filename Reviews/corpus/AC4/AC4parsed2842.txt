I mean its Assassins Creed. If you dont know what youre buying at this point, I dont think a review is gonna change anything.However, this iteration of the series adds a much bigger open world, and seafaring. Its pretty neat. Multiplayer is also kinda fun as well, but I dont know how many people play it now.
