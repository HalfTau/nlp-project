When I picked this up I wasnt a fan of how the character starts off not really being an assassin but putting on the clothes like a fraud this isnt a spoiler it happens pretty quick in the game. After how slow assassins creed 3 felt It didnt bug me too much and I can understand that getting right to gameplay was probably pretty important. Worth a mention though..I feel like this game actually is a direct reflection of AC 3. 3 Was slow to get going and here they dived straight into being an assasin and in 3 one of the highlights was the ship mission/game mechanic and here they packed the game with plenty of time at sea on a ship.Overall the game is pretty good, the attention to detail in places is what strikes me though, like the shanties being sung at sea that really stick in your head. Your pirate cohorts and enemies have real life to them, being able to dive and find treasure on sunken ships. All make the game really stick to its idea of pirates. With that said it feels too light on the actual assassins and templar story. It is there at the center of it all but feels still a little misplaced or something? That along with desmond being gone and the current day gameplay/story being a little disjointed too makes for it to be not quite as good as some of the other games. I used to actually enjoy seeing desmonds story develop but here the real world parts at abstergo i just cant be bothered to hack someones terminal or whatever I go straight into the pirate world.As far as gameplay goes, its the usual fun of assasinate templars or people in your way. I will agree that there are too many follow this person missions but the rest remains fun. Trying to gather resources to upgrade my ship to then be able to carry on with the main story became tedious at times especially when i wasnt interested in being at sea...but overall a good mix of assassins creed and pirate life.
