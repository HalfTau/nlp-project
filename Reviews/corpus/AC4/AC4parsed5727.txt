Just based on the fact that I cant play the game because it crashes right at the Press Any Key after launching, Id say dont waste ur money on this. I will never again buy Ubisoft games because this just happenes way too often with their titles.And Im not bloody cracking a game I bought so Ill just give Ubisoft the finger and suggest to everyone not to go out and buy what they sell.Okay end of rant.
