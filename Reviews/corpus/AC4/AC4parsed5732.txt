DO NOT BUY. Ubisofts Uplay is a broken piece of software. Since it implements an always online DRM, this often makes the game completely UNPLAYABLE broken ubisoft servers, buggy uplay software crashing, etc.. Steam should never have allowed something like this to be even in the store. i always crashing after launch the game.. ac4bfsp.exe has stopped working and i cant find solution for this..
