One of the most satisfying games I have ever played. The story is great. The open world IMO is amazing there is nothing like the rush of capturing a fort or boarding a ship. There are some easy parts in this game and some hard parts. The open world is nice, there are a lot of places to visit. A lot of the missions are repetitive, but the beauty of the locations and the time setting really make up for it. This game is a gem highly recommend. Would plunder and kill again.
