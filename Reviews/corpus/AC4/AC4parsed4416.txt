This game is Amazing. Without question my favorite in the Assassins series sorry Ezio, I still love ya and easily one of my favorite games of all time... Now why the hell cant I play it. Pardon the profanity, but  uplay. The most ironically named t in the industry. I spent money on this game. Twice. Once on 360 when it came out, and again when i built my PC. The Least uplay can do is let me play it. And judging by the reviews, half of you have the same problem as me, or similar uplayrelated problems. And until uplay either becomes usable or is abolished from the earth entirely, ubisoft wont be getting another penny from me not even for rayman for fear of it being wasted on a game that I cant play, thanks to you, uplay.To the crew of the Jackdaw A Yohoho and a thumbs up.to uplay Get yourtogether.
