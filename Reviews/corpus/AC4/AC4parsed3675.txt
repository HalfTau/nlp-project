I recommend this game, but at the same time I dont.1. The game is really badly  optimised, the requirements can be deceiving2. uPlay can be a big painThe problems are not with the gameplay, its performance and uPlay.If you like Assassins Creed and have a good system, buy this. Otherwise, buy it on console.
