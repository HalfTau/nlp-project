Well... if not for some of the bugbears, this game wouldve got from me 10/10, but in this case its only 10/assassins creed.Prosshipspiratesbattlesvoice acting no exceptions, everyone did outstanding workdirection, truly Hollywood stylesoundtrack to silent though, had to lower other volumesvery emotionalwhale hunting 3Edward Kenway brilliant and engaging  background, youve truly made me care for him since the very beginningConsabstergo t, seriously guys, in your next game just pretend like this have never happened and dont introduce this plot element. Its annoying, it slows games pacing, and nobody cares.powdery plotcombat system cmon guys, you can do better than that, just look at Rocksteadysomehow anticlimactic, hoped for better endingThere is not so much of Assassin in this game, though its my favorite of the whole series.Must play.9/10
