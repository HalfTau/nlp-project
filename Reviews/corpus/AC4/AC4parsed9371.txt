This is a pretty sweet game and I had a lot of fun with it. The water is gorgeous in this game and the waves are glorious to behold as you sail around the caribbean island seas.The gameplay is straight up asassins creed, so if youve played any of the past games, youll feel right at home getting into this one. If you havent,prepare yourself to murder more Englishman, Spaniards, and enemy pirates than you can shake a stick at or a sword I guess in this case.There is so much to do in Black Flag its almost overwhelming. You start with just about all of the map exposed and there are tons of things to pick up, collect and or open. That along with some whaling / spearing mini games, as well as sailing through rough seas, killer storms, and dangerous islands will keep you alert and ready for hours.The story was pretty good, and you meet many of the famous pirates and cutthroats from history and generally go out and raise hell and have a good time with them, but parts of it felt out of place or forced at times just to throw a twist in to keep it interesting.So now onto some things I didnt like. The controls felt a little floaty with an xbox controller but thats been true of all the asassins creed games Ive played in the past too. There were periods where Id hit a button and they just wouldnt work. Frustrating.Towards the end of the game, they suddenly throw a terrible platforming section into the game that to me felt really out of place.Other than those items, there really wasnt anything else to complain about, except maybe the portions of the game where you are outside the Animus, but those have never been the high point of these games. That said the hacking minigames outside were half okay, half t, but thats mostly down the the controls having a bit of lag or something.Overall if you have any interest in pirates, swashbuckling and terrorizing the high seas while murdering your way through countless europeans and nere do wells, check this game out, you will definitely have a good time.
