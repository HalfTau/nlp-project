Ive played every single AC game since the first, and this one is definitely the best since AC2 Im not sure if anything can beat AC2.The world is massive, there are various cities and towns dotted across the map rather than just a few big ones...and these cities/towns are still pretty big and cool to run around in. The real eyecandy are the islands that are literally everywhere on the world map. Even the small, miniscule islands are absolutely gorgeous and are worth exploring. The water, the weather, the day/night cycles, everything graphical in this is just amazing to look at.And the main character is finally likable in an AC game again. Connor in AC3 was just annoying to me, so Ezio was the last really likable character in the series. Edward is a bit of an antihero, but thats what makes him likable. Not only is the acting done really well, but he has no issues with doing what he pleases for whatever he wants...as you would expect a pirate to be like.So yes, great title and very worth the buy
