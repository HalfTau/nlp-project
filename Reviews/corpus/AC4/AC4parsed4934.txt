The thrill of boarding an enemy ship in the middle of a raging storm has no equal!Best Pirate game Ive ever played.Just wish the next pirate game to come my way expands on this and adds more ships to own and sail. And some decapitation wouldnt go amiss. In fact, why not just make it mod friendly.Oh, and take out the abstergo offices  not a fan of that missing fourth wall.Incomprehensible supernatural entity! I love this game.Little nit here. Way too easy. Money, combat, sailing just feel like cotton wool. Ive honestly been thinking about playing this from inside an iron maiden for that bit of extra challenge. I had a fully upgraded, story permitting, ship whilst still in the easy waters. Once you have all these things you need only be a brute to win. Granted, being a brute has helped win battles in the past, the collective bruteness of the British Iles is a force to be reckoned with, but some brain teasing would be most welcome.Still bonking love this game!
