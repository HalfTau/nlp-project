So my first playthrough was completely blind, didnt know what I was doing, and this being my first Assassins Creed game, I didnt know what paths to take and what quests to complete. Over the course of about 5 hours I was hooked and couldnt stop playing. The storyline was excellent, the combat, while being slightly buggy because of my computer, was smooth, and the sailing on a pirate ship was absolutely marvellous! Great job Ubisoft, Im expecting another game based around the Caribbean soon!
