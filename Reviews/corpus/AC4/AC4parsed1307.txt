The most fun I had with an Assassins Creed game. From the usual climbing around stuff, to the much needed sailing around like a pirate, this game was a blast. Main issue I had was that even with the best cards, placing all the graphics on max can cause performance issues, which can be rectified by toning things down. Not the best of ports but still a great time.
