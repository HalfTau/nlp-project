ACBF.... i loved the first 2 ACs, never played the nonnumbered releases, played ACIII and was slightly let down. However the best part of III was the navel missions. Now they built a whole game around that and improved upon it in every way.i love how they thought outside the box on this one.Many users will say the frame rates.. and thats true if you want to play in 60fps and use built in vsync. if you have an NVidia card that can handle the game, i run a 780 dcIIoced edition ad you use NVidias built in vsync and triple buffering and set the quality in NVidia to high quality frame rate is 98 tear free.The game is gorgeous seriously gorgeous....When ACBF is a pirate game its flawless and amazing, when its an AC game is good. Story is very good for an AC game and keeps you wanting to play even the boring parts. The modern day aspects though limited still suck and take you out of the game. Upgrading the Jackdaw by taking down other boats to gain materials is a nice touch. Hunting both at land and sea is present. The whale and shark hunting is great. Land hunting well its no hunting simply run up to and kill then animals, some like deer need to be stalked or you need to be in a tree, but is used to gather materials for upgrades to your character. There are a lot of things to do in this game. i have already mentioned the hunting, but there is also diving bell missions and hot spots, treasure hunting yes with maps!, i know sweet right sea shanties to find and chase after, that yours mates will sing to you when you travel most are even pretty good, and other collectables, assassination contracts to take you all over the map and 4 legendary ships that will test your skills. Im sure i left some things out but trust me i have over 30hours in and only  of the way though the game as I keep getting side tract doing all the cool extra things this game has to offer.My opinion 8/10 with is a buy for those that are considering
