The game of the Year 2013.There are always hidden treasures, hidden locations, hidden perspectives for viewing pleasure on how beautiful the world of black flag is.3D map exploration is kinda a dead design in the last 10 years. Remember how fun we could get from a dunguon/world map exploration like old school JRPG. For whatever the reasons I found games in the last 10 years are missing that fun factor. However, the sea/land exploration aspect in AC4 black flag is amazingly crafted. It is the best game I played in the last 10 years that can bring back the feeling of adventure from old school JRPG.
