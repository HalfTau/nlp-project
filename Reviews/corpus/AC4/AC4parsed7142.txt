Yet another Assassins Creed game... And another disappointment. I didnt come in expecting much and I got exactly what I expected. I couldnt find myself getting into the story. The whole Absturgo thing was pretty bad too. I didnt care too much for Desmond but this sucks... The missions are very repetitive as well. The missions where you have to go eavesdrop on someones conversation without being seen is getting very old. Ill give this game a few positive things. It looks very good on ultra settings and I enjoyed all of the views. The ship missions are improved a lot as well and a lot better than what they were in Assassins Creed III.  Combat is pretty impressive when the sound is actually synchronized. But most the time it isnt and you dont get to hear your final kill thats in slow motion. It is suppose to be epic but of course it isnt. Pretty much if you like all of the Assassins Creed games, you will like this. But if you didnt like Assassins Creed III or previous ones, dont bother with this game. This isnt worth the money.5/10 Ultra Graphics look amazing. Ship Missions are improved.  Absturgo story sucks. Main story is bland. Sound not synchorized in combat. Repetitve missions.
