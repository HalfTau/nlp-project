If you liked the story in AC 13, you probably wont like this one as much. The pirate mechanics are SO great, but the modern day content was so unnecessary that I just trudged through it, hoping to step back into Ed Kenways shoes. If you can bear 15 minutes of crap for every couple of hours of gold, this game is for you.
