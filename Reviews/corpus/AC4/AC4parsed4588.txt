Broken as hell.3 or so hours in I have probably spent more time fixing the game and looking for answers for all theit does rather than actually playing the game. Too bad it is late to ask for a refund. At first I could not even start the single player because the executable crashed everytime I tried. So I put admin rights on the .exe, verified the game cache and played around with different AA settings. Cool, now it starts the game. 6 or so into the game I get a black screen during loading into Nassau. Again doing all this googling around and looking up thisthat has been broken for 2 ing years without being fixed.The fighting system is average at best compared to some of the better games out there Batman games, Witcher 23, pretty much any 3rd person action game that came out during this decade.Going around in the boat is kind of cool and works, thats why I really got this.PS. I really feel sorry for everyone who bought this turd at full price. Also somehow this is not even the buggiest game in the series at least thats what Ive read. Go figure.PPS. Back to fiddling and trying to get this to work. The pirating stuff really seemed fun.4/10EDIT Just to add as a FYI verifying the game cache on Steam seemed to fix the black screen issue. The game has a way of corrupting its files it seems.
