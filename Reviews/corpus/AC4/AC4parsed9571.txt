This game was great. Ive played most of the assassins creed series and have enjoyed them. I even enjoyed three. The graphics and the aesthetic of this game are just beuatiful. The storytelling is wonderful and the combat mechanics work so well. The only small thing that i dont really like about the game is that there is not much interaction with being outside of the animus. All you do is go around hacking computers and stuff, not enternaing like in 3. And there was only a small amount of closure which could of been alot better about desmond. Overall everything clicks in this game and it is a fantastic comeback to the roots of the Assassins Creed series.
