Excellent game. Only about 30 through but very enjoyable so far. Amazingly enough it runs extremely smooth on my laptop which is fankly amazing considering how good everything looks. Minor gripes being stuck with one ship admittedly upgradeable but simply plundering all those nice ships makes you want to sail some of them too. Ubisoft service is scatttered at best which can be annoying. Ship combat control is also a bit cumbersome during a battle but enjoyable nonetheless.But overall excellent game. 96
