It is incredible how the Ubisoft Team have done such a master piece of video game. There are so many great things that I cannot point them all, but the GIANT variety of tasks to do inside a GIANT open world with a GIANT amount of activities all mixed so flawlessly that I think this game is a BIG FRACTAL. So big that the MAIN MISSIONS are a little boring. There are some stuff which is boring, and substancial, yes like the random crashes, but the game can brag about that SIMULATION thing from the Animus for sure, because it looks like one cannot wait to play Totall Recall the same way. The game grantees a lot of hours of happy exploring and fights in an tremendous big and creative simulated world.
