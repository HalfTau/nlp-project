One word.Pirates.Wait.Another Word.Frenchmen.No.Canadians.Or are they just French?Anyway, Pirates win.However, this cannot get more than an 8 because it contains French people.Also, good work Ubisoft, completely erasing the French involvement in the WestIndies related middleages conflicts. Its like they werent even there. I often find myself utterly alone, in the middle of the Seas to the South of Jamaica, thinking This area was chockfull of French warships at this exact moment in History and Im sad. Not because of the lack of French people, no, thats perfectly OK.But to kill Historical accuracy because you couldnt be bothered to animate in French flags and Uniforms is just annoying. I mean, even the Portugese Navy gets a lead role in this game, and who the  were they?
