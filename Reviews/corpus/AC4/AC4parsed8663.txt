I have to disagree with the majority of reviewers. While it is a good game, I felt it wasnt true to the Assassins Creed experience for example, you cannot call Assassin recruits and SPOILER Edward doesnt even become an Assassin until the very end. The openworld wasnt really impressive, mostly very similar locations with only a crapload of chests to open. Also, both me and my friend had terrible lag while playing this, while our PCs can handle most other games. Edwards story is good and unique, but not befitting a proper AC game in my opinion. If you are a new AC fan or if you want something different from the past games, go ahead and try it out, but if I could go back in time, I would tell myself to wait for next years Steam sale to buy it.
