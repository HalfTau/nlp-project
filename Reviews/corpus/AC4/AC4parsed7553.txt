I cant realy review this game because it crashes every two minuetes. The visuals look pretty but unfortunatly you wont be able to see it due to frame rate drop. I have gtx 680 card and I am having trouble running it. And yes you still have to log into uPlay!!   I suggest you find better games with your money, this game was released 7 mounths ago and it is still buggy. I played assassin creed 3 this year and it is still unstable, my guess is that this game wont fixed knowing that Ubisoft still has to worry about watchdogs. If they fix it then I would suggest the game.
