Super fun game. I got it because I was playing sid meiers pirates, and was like wait assassins creed has a game thats like this with better graphics and sword fights. so i picked it up and i really love you can customize your ship and go around destroying everyone in the caribean. I was having so much fun with that that the only reason i was playing the story missions was so i could unlock new things to do with my ship you dont get things liek the diving bell until late in the story. the story was good too, i didnt playcreed 3 and i only had to look up a few thigns for it to stay with it.Tldr This game is a blast, do what you want cuz a pirate is free.
