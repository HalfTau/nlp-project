Uplay is a piece of crap DRM. A bug in it will cause the save games to be deleted everytime the game is reset. Also, the game will freeze constantly for long periods when booting with Uplay/Steam overlays, as well as freeze for long periods of time when you try to close or open either overlay.Such a shame, Ubisoft utterly ruined the PC port of what was actually a pretty awesome game.
