Well tried  to play assassins creed multiplayer today. Bought 2 copies, one for me and one for my wife.. and a friend bought another copy.Must be the worst gaming experience I ever had .Why need another usesless launcher like Uplay wich is very unstable and cant handle voice chat properly ?? ?Is it so hard to use steam like other games do ? We had to make a group on steam and activate voicechat.You must configure the keys 2 times,, once in the single player and once in the multiplayer. plain stupidthe multiplayer content is very limited.Each time you leave a play in multiplay you get disconnected and have to reconnect.Menu is so idiotically complicated.I really do love assassins creed ... but this multiplayer thingy really sucked and ruined my day
