Played AC2 about 5 years ago and recently came about this one since I had heard the game is the best in the series. Oh boy, if this is the best I dont want to know anything about the rest of ACs. Only thing I really enjoyed were the naval battles in the first half of the game, and towards the end even those get really old and boring since there are not much depth to them after all. Gotta say the last story related naval fight was such a buttclench galore since I couldnt be arsed to GRIND the ridiculous amount of upgrades that were recommended for the showdown. That says something about the difficulty of the game as well, sweeped it through with almost default ship and default gear.So the mechanics are exactly the same as in the older games except added pistols. The combat is a chore and as easy as ever, even when youre surrounded the enemies just wait to die one by one by your counterattack combo. The story is dumb and childish with unbelievably monotonous recurring escort/follow/eavesdropping missions. The assassination scenarios seem to be almost carbon copies of each other as well. The present day scenes were annoying as before and the hacking minigames were just cringy as hell. The game is BLOATED with useless collectibles and boring challenges/side missions comprised of the same stuff as the story quest but of lower quality. The amount of boring useless crap is so high it makes other Ubisoft busyworkfests feel like deep, meaningful art.To be honest they shouldve just kept the base they have for naval battling, pirating and taking over ships in hand to hand combat and work it further. If they wouldve scrapped every stale assassins creedy element in the game, deepen everything related to the sea, sailing and pirating and called it only Black Flag, it would have probably been a much better game. Enjoyed 4 hours of it, speedran the rest, not recommended.
