One of the most moving and motivating games that Ubisoft has ever releasedBlack flag is unlike any  of the other Assassins Creed games that they have released, Although while they do kinda have the same combat and movement mechanics this games storyline is quite unique in its own way as you make your way as being a badpirate and assassin, and has a very good stimulator where you can control your own ship and go battle in the sea with amazing experience, the storyline is jaw dropping and if you buy the Gold Edition you get to play as Adewale, wont give any spoilers there but the storyline where he and Kenway had left is one no one should be left out of.TLDR YOU GET TO BE A PIRATE
