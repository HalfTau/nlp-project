After several hours of playing, my progress was lost. Turns out, not only does Ubisoft force the installation of their distribution platform, but they also moved the saves files to that directory, without notification. When I backed up all of my steam data, these files were lost, along with my progress.I do not intend on replaying the first few hours of the game. I consider this a 50 mistake.
