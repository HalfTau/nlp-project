Black Flag is a very fun game. More than the sum of its parts, it does everything in the good rangeStealth and assassination? Good, some of my favourite missions in the series are in this game, but none are overly complex, elaborate, or ingenius like in previous titles.Piracy? Good, I suppose... you plunder ships, dig up treasure, but you dont really care about the crew, easily replacable, no morale or use for rum other than selling. The violence has that PG feel that Pirates of the Caribbean had. As far as pirate activities go, its held back a bit.Ship battles? Very fun, but also a little arcadey, I honestly preferred the ship battles in AC3, oddly enough, more weight and reload time to the guns, more sense of power.Assassins Creed franchise trademark WTF moments? Yes, actually. Good plot twists and ideas? Sure, but I wouldnt say its groundbreaking. By the end though, it does feel more like an AC game than a pirate game, so it does bring it back around in comparison to the beginning.All in all, I still say its great, because what it does have is character, and characters. A lot of them, actually. And it does a decent job at keeping them unique, a lot of great pirates and villains, betrayal and crazy ones. They dont shy from killing off characters, as it does strive to be historically accurate with most of them. I really enjoyed it as it went on, and by the end, minor spoilers, will be vague  found it very moving, overall, particularly one scene at the end spoilerswhere Edward sees everyone thats died do you really think pirates lived very long? and remembers the old days for one last time./spoilers Similar to the ending in AC3 in a way.If you like AC at all, and want an easy, arcadelike ship battle, thats basically what this is. You dont need previous AC knowledge. Its a very long, but wellpaced and decentlywritten game, with good characters, controls, great visuals and progression, gameplay, etc. A solid title, IMO. Just sucks you need uPlay.
