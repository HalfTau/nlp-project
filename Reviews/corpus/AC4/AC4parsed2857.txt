One of the best games Ive ever played. If you have the 30, this is worth 60. GET EEEEETTTTT!Good to note that if you liked collecting all the cool weapons in AC2 and AC Brotherhood, this game has plenty of cool rapiers and sabers and other similar weapons that are nicely displayed in your hideout, along with artifacts, collectibles, guns and more.Please play through at least some of the previous Assassins Creed games before you play this game. This game lacks the exquisite tutorials of its predecessors, so you will only know how to do various assassination techniques and know how to use similar features in this game as compared to the previous games if youve played through them. This was my first AC game, now coming back to it from completing the Ezio trilogy AC2, Brotherhood, Revelations and everything makes more sense. Features in this game that I didnt pay attention to or didnt know about I do now the second time playing through because Ive played the predecessors. I cant stress this enough.
