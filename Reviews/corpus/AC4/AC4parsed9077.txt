Great open world game filled with tons and tons of hours and those hours probably will get you 15 through the game! But there are a few problems. The combat is EXACTLY the same as the past ones, its mostly a button masher and you are basically invincible so that brings it down. Also once you get your ship upgraded well enough you are also invincible on that part, though I really love the naval combat mechanic it has its flaws. So I would give this like a 6/10 but I still love this game a lot
