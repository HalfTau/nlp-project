This game almost makes the gamer become a completionist in order to complete all of the extra features that are stacked on top. Defeating Elite ships is nearly impossible unless your ship is maxed out and you use every weapon availible to you.ProsLots of gameplay timeGreat sailing mechanicsCompelling story lineConsA bit repetitiveWaiting to progress far enough to unlock all the tools/itemsGlitchy climbing mechanicsI believe this game would be much better if you were able to upgrade your ship rather than perpetually sail the Jackdaw. Its a great ship and all but piloting a Man O War on a mission makes the Jackdaw seem like a slingshot compared to an automaic rifle. The climbing mechanics are a little spazzy when trying to climb onto anything initially. After that its bliss.I know its difficult to design a single player game that isnt repetitive, and Black Flag is one of the least boring missionbased games Ive played, but once youve figured out the controls the game is almost too easy.
