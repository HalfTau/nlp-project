THIS is what Assasins Creed SHOULD be about going forward, FORGET the Animus crap, FORGET about the Assassins vs Templars, just a pure historical adventure!Unfortunately the only downsides to this game is when that DOES try to come in to play which so far is not the games main focuse but its trying to alude to it in the background.None the less, this game is a pirate simulator done right, you own a ship, have a crew, sing sea shanties as you plunder seas for riches and resources.Black Flag is well within its rights to be cited as highpoint of the franchise in a otherwise dull and redundant formula.
