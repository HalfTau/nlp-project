The worst installment of the Assassins Creed series. The story is boring, gameplay is dull, and the fighting system is unchallenging. I couldnt bother to care for any of the characters in the game. I loved every single Assassins Creed game, but this will be the first one I will not finish playing. NOT RECOMMEND.
