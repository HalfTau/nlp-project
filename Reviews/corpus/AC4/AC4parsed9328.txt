This game has the best graphics and gameplay ive ever seen so far. so many options in a total exprience of an open world exotic cities, beautiful jungles, oceans, and other surprising locations! the game has an amazing plot, who changes comletly from the rest of the games, and so if you like to start a new AC game without playing the rest, this would be a good point to start. pure fun!
