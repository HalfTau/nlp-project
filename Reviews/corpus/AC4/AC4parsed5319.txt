Quite possibly the best AC game to date, rivaling even the beloved Assassins Creed 2. Black Flag takes all of the elements of past games that you love from the stealth and parkour to the battles and story improves them, then adds to them. The combat system no longer feels like counter after counter and now flows with secondary items fitting into the mix very well.The game also stays fresh by adding a fun, and exciting new element through sailing and ship battles. Rather than becoming a tedious nuisence like one might expect, fighting on ships and upgrading ones vessel is fun and rewarding, allowing you to take on truly fearsome opponents and capture enemy ships for your own use.Some long time fans of the series critize this game for not being a true Assassins game as for much of the game the protaganist is not truly an assassin. In my opinion however the game does something far more interesting than tell the story or an assassin. It tells the story of someone who becomes one. You learn his motives and watch as he adopts the creed because he believes in it, not because he was born into it. Something I find to be more compelling.The only downside to this game are the parts that take place in modern day. You play a voiceless protaganist working in Abstergo and hacking computers to learn more about the world. All in all its very boring and adds nothing to the game itself let alone the overarching plot. Still its owrth playing and is definitely a better buy than Unity or Rogue.
