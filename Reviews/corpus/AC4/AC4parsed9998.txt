As an Age of Pirates fan, I was so amused to play this majestic game that I havent slept for 2 days. Its just that great, yes. And thats not about storyline or being an assassin and killing everyone on your way to the grand prize.  Its about being a pirate, a captain with your own ship and crew and plundering every god damn galleon filled with gold and rum, being a free man in time when that really meant what it is. So as I see this game is best caribbean pirate simulator to date and if you havent yet bought this game or still thinking about it, leave your doubts behind, go get it!Happy hunting.
