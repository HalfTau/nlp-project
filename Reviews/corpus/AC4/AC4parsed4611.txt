This in my opinion is the best AC game so far. Theres so much to do. Ive played this game twice and I love it. This game goes on sale often too, and it is definitely worth your money, on sale or not. Epic sea battles and an extremely nice story. Just buy the ing game. JUST DO IT!!! ITS ING WORTH IT!!!
