I picked this game up on steam sale for 10 a couple months ago. Once I started playing it, I couldnt put it down. However, now that its over, Im suffering from Ubisoft fatigue and cant envision playing another one of their games for a while. I had a big gap between Assassins Creeds as the last one I played was AC2 on PS3 about 5 years or so ago. I will say, that of AC1, AC2 and Black Flag, i enjoyed this one the most and actually almost 100d it. I got 100 of everything but main mission side objectives. I didnt have the patience for a lot of those. The stealth could be annoying and Id rather rush in like Galahad and kill everyone in sight.I feel like 1015 is the perfect price range for this game and would recommend fans of open world games to check it out.
