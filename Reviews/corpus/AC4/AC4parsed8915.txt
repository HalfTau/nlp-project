So, I hated AC III. Didnt like it all... really wanted to, but didnt. So I was a bit hesitant to pick up AC IV, but I did, and its great. Being a pirate is one of the most engrossing and fun experiences Ive had in a game in quite some time. Naval combat and boarding ships are so much fun, its ridiculous. And it hasnt gotten old yet.Basically, its this generations Wind Waker.
