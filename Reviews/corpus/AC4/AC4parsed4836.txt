Hands down the best Assassins Creed game in the series thus far October 2015.No video game company has yet made an open world pirate RPG...this game comes SO CLOSE...but it isnt quite there yet. I still patiently await the day that happens. A game like Skyrim or Witcher 3, but in the style of Black Flag would be HUGE...some day....some day.But in all seriousness, but this game, youll love it.
