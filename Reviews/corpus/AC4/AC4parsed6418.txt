atones for the sins of AC3 for the most part.  less b.s. tutorial.  more interesting protagonist.  better overall story.  better modern day story.  less desmond!  The sailing is super fun.pc optimization is okay.  looks beautiful but requires a decent Nvidia card to run at full 1080 with stable frame rates.  ran at 900p and had no problems with my gtx650.
