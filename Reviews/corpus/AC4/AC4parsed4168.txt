Such a different and refreshing turn from the disappointment in my opinion that was Assasins Creed 3.You play as Edward Kenway who, to be honest, is a bit of a prat. But what do you expect from a pirate? Sail the seas, meet Blackbeard, pillage, plunder, run away as fast as you can from the legendary ships. The little side quests upgrading your armor, without going into too much detail assassins quests. Its all enjoyable. Usually I find side quests in games to be a bore. Nope. And the added bonus of running around and catching song sheets for your crew to sing on your voyages!The graphics are beautiful, sailing is amazing, storyline is pretty decent too.To be honest, I loved it that much that I bought it for my PS4 as well.The only downside is that it requires a uPlay account. Other than that, the game is sound!
