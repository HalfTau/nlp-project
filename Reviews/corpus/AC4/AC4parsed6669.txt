TBH this game wouldnt be much different if it was a standalone tittle and not an AC game, but its still one of the best in the sereis. The carribean uprising of pirates provide an excellent setting for this game. With beatiful scenery and vivid colors. The naval aspect of the game is one of the most uniqe things about this series and is great at driving the game forwards. Gameplay havent changed much from the previous installment. Parkour is done with one button, mostly, you can change between all your gadgets and preffered melee weapons. Naval combat has been enhanced to be alot more enjoyable and easier than it was in Assassins Creed III. The characters are charming and lively, youll build bonds with them and care for them on a personal level. The story is massively enjoyable and shows how a true pirate life game should be. And it has one of the best like it made me feel one of the strongest loads of feelings in the series endings in the entire sereis.9/10 Would sing along to sea shanties again.
