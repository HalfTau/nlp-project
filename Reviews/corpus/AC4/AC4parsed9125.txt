I was skeptical about this game at first, then when i saw it on saw i jumped on it and do not regret it a bit. Its worth every penny.Only cons i can find thus far is it is another assassins creed and it does play that way, also the lack pirate lingo is disapointing. But the naval battles the story are what i really enjoy.Again, its worth the cash. If you dont catch it on sale i would still recommend it
