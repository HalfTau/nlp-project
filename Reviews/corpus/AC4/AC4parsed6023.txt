This has got to be one of the best games Ive played in a long time, which surprised me if Im honest from reading about Assassins Creed games, I always came away with the sense that they are good, but not as good as they could be. A least, thats how the reviewers tended to make it sound.But it turned out to be a quite incredible action/adventure game that I have really been enjoying over the past few weeks. Perhaps its the great difference between how things play out attacking and boarding ships feels a world apart from assassinating soldiers and people of import on the streets of Havana, Kingston, or on one of the many islands scattered around the Caribbean. The main story missions are generally good fun  apart from the odd infuriating one, but that might have been compounded by growing dislike for the tailing missions, which are repeated more often than I feel they are welcome.The characters I grew to like, and the cutscenes were well crafted and enjoyable, enough that I didnt want to skip through them. That is, apart from the modern world missions, which seem out of place and unenjoyable compared to the pirating you spend the majority of the game doing. That is, aside from the handful of funny lines that occasionally accompany these segments.The game itself is mostly well done, apart from a a small collection of bugs, most not game breaking. That is, apart from one I suffered midway through the game, when I tried to return to the jungle area you are shipwrecked on at the right beginning, only to find my ship is apparently to large for the cove, and so if teeteringat an impossible angle, making it an utter chore to return to the wheel so as to continuing my journeys on the seas something I only managed to do with a strange mixture of determination and sheer luck.Generally, the ship was the focus of most of the infrequent bugs, such as when it occasionally becomes seethrough, or indeed leaves the physical realm, e.g. you see its there, you just fall through it.These infrequent, yet incredibly irritable bugs are a horrible mark on an otherwise very enjoyable and highly recommendable game. There are a few other gripes some dodgy sound when it comes to some kill cameras, the cringe worthy cheering after succeeding in harpooning something it sounds like they just asked people in the office to hoot, and so sounds insincere and artificial, and the speed and ease one can upgrade their swords, pistols and ship that can decrease the difficulty of the game, especially at sea. But these gripes are far out weighed by the positives assassinating people is very satisfying, especially if you are picking of a large group bit by bit, unseen and unnoticed boarding ships and hunting the elusive ones filled to breaking with rum and sugar when you want wealth, and metal when you want upgrades, is hugely enjoyable the storyline is mostly well crafted and enjoyable. And the huge number of additional activities, ranging from Templar hunt, searching for the Mayan stones, hunting on islands and whaling at sea, to more relaxed activities like chasing after sea shanties for your crew to sing at sea The Drunken Sailor is now ingrained in my head, quite happily, searching out chests, controlling your own moneymaking fleet and playing the number of gambling games that rest next to the taverns, including checkers and I can only hope I shall find a tavern with chess.Its a game well worth checking out.
