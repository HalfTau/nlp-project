This is a great game, but the PC port is total garbage. As usual, completely unplayable with keyboard and mouse. If you dont have a controller, avoid this game for that reason alone and get it on console. Still, get it on console anyway because the usual Ubisoft Uplay broken DRM system is still here, and you will spend more time troubleshooting Ubisofts virus than you will playing the actual game.Get this game on console, because it is great there, but avoid on PC.
