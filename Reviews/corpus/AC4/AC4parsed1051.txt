Honestly one of the the best if not the best Assassins Creed games ever, playing as Edward something you are in a piratised simulation where you are a pirate that becomes an assassin.Highly recommend this game if you like parkour and pirates, also being able to assassinate your enemies with cannons cant do that in any other assassins creed game.
