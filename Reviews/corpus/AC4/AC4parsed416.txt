The game perfomes poorly on modern hardware. I have an i7 cpu, 16 gigs of ram, and a GTX 1080, and the game dips below 20 fps constantly even with vsync and physx off and all other setting set to low at 1080p resolution. The game crashed to desktop multiple times before and after a clean reinstall. between dips below 20fps the game would freeze at 1fps every now and then for a few seconds.
