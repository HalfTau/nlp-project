This game is everything I looked for in a pirate game. It has a captains cabin which is a really enjoyable feature, could have been better if the entire vessel was modeled. The fighting was common for the AC series and felt great with the variety of swords you could equip. The other weapons were also a joy and allowed you to play however you wish, wether stealthy or running around killing everyone. The adventures you could have as well as the control of your fleet makes it a constant adventure and makes you feel connected to the pirates in your crew.Overall amazing game, and an extra bonus is that you can pet the dogs you meet best part
