One of the Best AC games i have played, many hours i have spent, many chests and gold i have plundered, many ships i have taken, many templars i have slain. This game is excellent.One negative i have seen across the AC series of games, Stop changing the Control schemes. The one in Black Flag works, when your a pc player like me with KB and mouse. The past games they kept changing the way you control your character.  The way you fire the cannons in Black Flag works too... I hated the cannons on the ship in AC3Keep up the good work, now bring on the DLCs Ive no one left to kill, maim, loot, or assassinate... BRING IT ON... YA LAND LUBBERS
