High PC requirements means this game really pushes systems to the limit with absolutely stunning visuals and great physics. Theyve expanded the sailing aspects from the previous game and this becomes one of the core components with the open seas now becoming part of the main game world rather than separate missions like in AC3. Theres the usual truck load of collectibles and side quests packed alongside a good storyline as always. If youre a fan of the other AC games then youll feel right at home.
