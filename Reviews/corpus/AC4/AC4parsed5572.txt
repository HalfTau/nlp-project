Probably only assassins creed game worth picking up these days. It offers a pirate experience and does it well, unlike Risen with assassins creed old mechanics if you can tolerate that and Uplay. Sea battles with your own ship are just awesome, and even more awesome is when you damage anenemy ship and dock it to grab the booty and slay the remaining crew.
