This game is what AC3 should have been gameplaywise. Storywise, this isnt the greatest AC entry, but Edward is definitely an interesting character, and the modern day sections have been changed greatly from previous games. The true star of the show is the exploration of the Caribbean game world. Its freaking fantastic! I had the most fun in this game with the side missions that made exploring the world so fun!
