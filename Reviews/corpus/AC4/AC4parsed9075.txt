Ive not been a big fan of previous Assassins Creed games until now. But this isnt really an AC game. It is a full open world pirate simulator. There are so many activities you can do in this game and almost all of them are fun. The ship to ship combat is glorious. Ive not had this much fun in fighting ships since the original Sid Meiers Pirates!. Thoroughly recommended!
