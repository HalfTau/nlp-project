This game is great, Despite the contrary belief that this game runs poorly on PC it surely doesnt. Ive been getting 5060 frames throughout this game and it is well optimized. The story is great, and its a awesome break from the serious style of the last Assassin Creed games. This is more fun and light hearted and really is just more about enjoying the lifestyle of a pirate with small Templar quests mixed in, and the fighting styles similar to other Assassin Creed games. However im only 25 into this game with 15 hours played as ive been experience the vast depth of this game and enjoying the side missions and general exploring. Maybe later on in the game it will be more templar related and not just about pirating, Which I hope so! All in all this game is a solid 8.5/10 in my opinion. Since I have no completed the game yet I am not giving it a 10/10 or anything close because I simply cant judge it. GREAT GAME. Theres lots of 3rd party sites selling steam codes for this game at Discounted price. Do a simple google search and enjoy a great game.
