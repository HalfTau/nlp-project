I Finished this game at 94 and my impression was Should I rate this game as the best Assassins Creed ever or simply the best Game ever ?!!Loved every aspect of this game ..The world is big, the missions are diverse, The Graphics, sound, gameplay are all at the tops ..The most thing I loved was the Naval battles .. If you played Assassins Creed III then you wouldve tasted those ..If you love Action/Adventure games, then this game is a MustHave ..
