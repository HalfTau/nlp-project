Story 7/10Graphics 8/10Mechanics 7/10Really enjoying this one. After the third game I was a little worried as it was subpar in comparison to the second one but Black Flag corrects many flaws in both story telling and mechanics.So far my one real gripe is a glitch that causes me to freeze and drop to desktop, I could still hear the sound but the game had frozen. In the end I corrected this by tweaking some graphics sliders mainly AA and fog which help a lot, the last thing that finally seems to have removed it was reducing my GPU clock by 5.... as stupid as that sounds it hasnt happened since.
