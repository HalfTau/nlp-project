One of the better AC games in recent memory, Black Flag is great fun when doing all the pirate stuff and average when doing the main story missions.  Tailing someone to a spot to kill them, eavesdropping on a conversation to learn of a spot to kill them, or just killing your target directly seem to be the bread and butter of this series and its all a bit stale now.  None of it takes advantage of their really amazing open world, more freedom in mission design would really benefit the next game.I love the real world narrative in this one as well, while the story itself is thin the setup for the next game is really open ended with Abstergo Entertainment at the helm.  Really creative and man, they could do some amazing things with that in the future.  Do all the side stuff and enjoy the open world as a pirate, leave the main story missions for last as they are mainly a chore to get through.
