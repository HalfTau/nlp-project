Probably the best Assassins creed game since the first one. It takes the classic elements from the earlier games, puts them with some new characters and ties them into the Abstergo world. The sailing and pirating elements of the game are addictive and Ive actually spent more time playing these then going on land and doing the usual sneak and stab routine. The dud that the last game was IMHO with a confusing plot and muddled gameplay the one thing redeeming about it was the ship. The ocean physics/weather etc are impressive to say the least in this game. Its almost to the point where it could have been a stand alone game seperate from the other land elements. Overall Id say this game has something for everyone that liked the prior games.
