i like this game , the sailing gameplay was epic . however the only thing dissapointed me is the game is not fully optimized . which mean when i play this game . i have low frame rate that annoyed me . but no matter i still love this game despite all this. give it a try , the edward kenway story is still quite interesting to be told . I feel like he a quite a pathetic man
