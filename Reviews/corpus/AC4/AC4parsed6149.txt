Assassins creed black flag is a very beautiful game, in my opinion revelations was the best in the series but this would be number 2. the naval combat is amazing. a big step up from ac 3s. breathtaking graphics, amazing storyline. however the combat system is the same dont worry the combat system is new in unity so thats a con, but in this game the pros outrank the couple of cons this game has i give it a 9/10 if you like assassins creed buy this game,
