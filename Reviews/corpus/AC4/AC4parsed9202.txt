Only game on steam Id spend 70 on and definitely well worth it. Game is so damn gorgeous, the controls have improved a hell of alot  You dont randomly run up walls while freerunning all the time now, and Edward has got to be the best of the main characters in the series, and you get to be a god damn Pirate, that alone should make you want to buy this.
