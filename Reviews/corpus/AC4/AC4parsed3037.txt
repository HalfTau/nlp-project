the main reason i disliked this is cus pf the glitches and bugs i mean the story is fab and playing third person really shows an assassins personality and fighting style, the main bug is that when you play for awhile it tells u a problem caused the application to stop running and it jus lags there you cannot quit or even move ur mouse so u have no choice but to restart this happened to my syndicate and II , but syndicate was alot better cause10/10 would buy again and refund it.
