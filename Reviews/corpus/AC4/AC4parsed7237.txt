Seriously wondered about this for a while. I got it on sale and I love it. Of course, I watched multiple videos of gameplay to see if others enjoyed it as much, but of course, nothing but good things about this game. I love the pirate theme, the assassin theme, the open sailing theme, the crew theme.If you are wondering whether to get it or not.... just get it.Got it on sale.. I would have paid full price for it. Worth.   10/10
