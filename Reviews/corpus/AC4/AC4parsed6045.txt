The plot of AC games has become so awful over the years I honestly cant stand it.  Every second this game takes you out of the animus is pure torture.  Why the heck am I listening to a guys voice to go hack computers when Im just a regular employee?  Shouldnt I report this?  No F that the plot of this stupid game must progress so shut up and deal with it as Ubi shoves their garbage writing down your throat.The assassin missions for this game arent as eye gougingly bad as the real world missions but Ubi tried to ruin that too.  A lot of these missions are you simply following guys around towns... exciting.AC4 should be awful, but the pirate story not only saves it from being bad, it makes it a good game.  Edward Kenways journey as a pirate is amazing and without giving anything away Ill simply say its a very emotional journey.  I found if you ignore the rough edges and all of the nonsense Assassins Creed lore and just focus on being a pirate this game was great and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a game about pirates.  I wont call it amazing but it certainly had the potential to be.
