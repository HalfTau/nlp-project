This was a good game and had a good story line but the combat did get old after a while and once you upgrade your equipment and such, you are like Master Chief in Halo 1, unstoppable. The side quests are also not very captivating and get old after a while. I would have liked to see more content in the game concerning weapons and apparal as well. That being said there is no better feeling than standing on the deck of your own ship, destroying Englsih and Spanish  galleons alike, and resting control of the high seas. Consequently this is definitly a game worth buying and playing through to the end.
