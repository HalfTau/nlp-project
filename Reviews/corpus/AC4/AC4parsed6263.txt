I dont for the life of me understand the good reviews on this game. There are so many flaws in the controls the movement and missions... its absolutely aweful. Most of the missions are follow this person BORING! or chase this person and have your character grab onto and get stuck on everything in your path.Ive played all the AC games and IMO, this is the absolute worst of them. I only paid 10 for the game and still feel ripped off. Ill certainly never waste my money on another AC game again.
