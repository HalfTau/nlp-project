The fact that this game has very positive ranking is insane.This game has the worst performance issues Ive ever seen, until Origins. Even with a GTX1080 and i7, you literally cannot get 60 stable fps at 1080p  much less higher resolution, with graphics all set on ultra. If gaming at 30 fps or below is okay with  you, then yea play this on PC, otherwise you may as well play it on console where it actually works.Dont expect your game to look anything like the bullshots used here on the store, either. There is no way you will ever get that image quality even if you could pull off 8k.As for the game, Black Flag is the best AC game since AC2 . Its a pirate game, and an AC game, although they should have just made it a pirate game. The modern storyline is downright terrible, from how callously it turns the entire series into a meta joke, to the fact that its a first person walking simulator that turns the game into a database adventure more than anything to do with Absergo or the Templars.You have your groups of courtesans and soldiers and such that you can use to distract guards, and you have a variety of missions like freeing pirates, assassinations, super high level world encounters, infitrating and conquering high level world fortresses, etc. The storyline itself is also pretty good, and the combat mechanics are at their best in the series here. Id write more but at the moment Im too angry to be thorough.Id buy it if I were you.
