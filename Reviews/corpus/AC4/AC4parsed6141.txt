I have played this game only few hours and I havent finished it... yet  but I can easily say this is one of the better games I have played recently. To be fair  this isnt the type of the game I like to play but the climat and living environment is making this game very entertaining. I have to say that my experience from FPS games is very helpful when it comes to throwing objects or use of firearms but it is not necessary to have to enjoy every aspect of this game. I still have a vast world to explore in front of me but even now I can easily recommend this game to everyone who has a lot of spare time repeating some of the tasks to have them completed is a bit annoying because it will draw into its world for countless hours.
