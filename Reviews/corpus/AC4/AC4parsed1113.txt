First reviewI dont doubt the story is good, but the controls are just too terrible for me to enjoy it. The character gets stuck randomly and doesnt really do what you want. Unintuitive controls can really ruin a game.Second reviewAfter uninstalling and installing it again because I was interested to see how the game would look with reshade, I got into the game. No longer negative. More elaborate review comes when done with the game.
