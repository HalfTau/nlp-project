Really good game!!!! I am a HUGE assassin creed fan, and this is by far one of the best series ive played. Love how the story line just takes place on sea and fighting other ships to gain materials. Upgrading your own ship, weapons, suits, etc...If you love setting sail like a pirate, this game is really for you.10/10
