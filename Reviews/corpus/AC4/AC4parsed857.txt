This ones really get me into the Assassins Creed lor, pretty good game, even though look more like Pirates Creed than an Assassins one. Sailing and naval combat is pretty good, remind me of Pirates of the Caribbeanwithout octopus Davy Jones chasing me around of course. The only bad thing is Uplay though, with inconsistency loading times, sometimes even disconnect on meeven though I have pretty good connection.
