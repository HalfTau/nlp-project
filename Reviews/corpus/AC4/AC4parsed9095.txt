All I need to say is I played the first AC and was very disapointed. I played the second game and was also left wanting more. I wrote off the series after that and never really cared about any of the side games after 2. The third game sounded interesting with the Revolutionary War setting but was turned off by mediocre reviews. The comes along AC4, I heard on the GiantBombCast nothing but praise even from the guys who did not play the other games much. I am absolutley in love with AC4, it is well worth the money.
