Great AC game. I didnt want to play it for a long time because Im not into pirates all that much. When it was on sale a couple of months back I just had to get it. And it was a great decision. Still have a whole lot to discover.Theres a great variety of things to do. Sailing, hunting, scouting for treasures etc etc.Go for it, especially now that its on sale again!
