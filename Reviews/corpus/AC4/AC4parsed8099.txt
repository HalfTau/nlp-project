The setting and characters of Assassins Creed IV are the best ever in the franchise. The gameplay mechanics that AC is famous for are still there and vastly improved from AC III. The graphics are amazing, even on low settings which most computers will have to run it on due to its seemingly poorly optimized engine. Another thing this game did right was cutting most of the Abstergo / Desmond story line crap that no one really cared about, thus making it much easier to become fully immersed in sail a ship around and shooting the crap out of other people with akimbo pistols. The best Assassins Creed to date, and a mustown for gamers.
