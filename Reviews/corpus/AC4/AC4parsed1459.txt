I dont know why I even bothered finishing this rinse and repeat milk run of a game as ACs all are. Bored from running the same BS hundreds of times over and no longer give a shet about the story and just want to see the gamplay through because well, Ive made it this far so I might as well see this POS through. Its loading screens and unskippable cut scenes galore are tedious just as is the ceaselessly repetitive gameplay. Just as I was fed up and ready to uninstall the end credits made the final stroke decision for me . Thank christ. Never again AC. Meh. This series has been milked to death.
