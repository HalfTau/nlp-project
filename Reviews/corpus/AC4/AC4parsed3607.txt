This games borring as I was told it is the best of the assasins creed series. If that is true I havent missed out on much. Clunky controls. convoluted story. You are a descendant of a pirate. A company builds a special computer dookicky that allows you to relive memories from your ancestors. They are building an amusment ride based on your adventures. Whatever im ing done.
