Pirates.thats the whole reason I bought this game. There are few games where I do not care about the story and this is one. I have never played any previous assassins creed games but I can assume their story lines are all about the same.Go kill some secret order that threatens world piece because other secret order is the keeper of peace and everyone should love them. but in reality this is not how the world is and it is dangerous for people to start believing the lies these games conveyLike I said I play for Pirates.
