To me, this is the best Assassins Creed. If I didnt have so many weird performance issues with Unity or Syndicate, I might like those more for the updated gameplay elements to it, but this one still beats them out with the exploration with your ship.I really enjoy playing this. Have played through all the way and collected everything in the past, and still find myself picking it up from time to time even now.Its AC, so Im sure everyone knows what that entails. Youre in an openworld, you have a main storyline you progress to push you towards opening up the whole game, and you have so many different sidequests to distract you whilst you do it.This game in the series takes a lot of the seriousness out of it for the sake of making a more fun experience. Its not built to be funny, but its not burdened with the same heavy overtones of past ones with trying to save the world. Youre a pirate. Yes, you eventually find a code and already started with some form of one, but its secondary to you getting out there and getting all you need to be a true pirate king of the caribbean.When I play this, I actually tend to turn off the music and take in the sounds as is, or sometimes I put on some ambient music to really create a relaxing atmosphere while I run around the islands. I dont really care for the main soundtrack compared to past titles in the series, but thats a small qualm in an otherwise very solid game.It has its flaws, its own rules, but still I find that it is more freeing than limiting when playing, so ultimately Im happy with playing this game and having the options to tackle any situation in a number of ways.I have no problems with performance. The game runs well and looks beautiful. Between this one and AC II, these are the ones to have if you are into the Assassins Creed games.
