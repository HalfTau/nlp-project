Lots of trouble getting the game to work. After downloading the game, I have spent 4 hours trying to get the game to work, with the assitance of Ubisofts Support Team, and the game still does not work. Ubisoft has tried to say that it is because I built my own computer if that is true, why is this game the first to ever have an issue?TLDR Dont buy this game, it does not work... AT ALL!!!
