One of the best games ive played. Its really entertaining, you have plenty of stuff to do!! Side missions are fun and not annoying like in most other games, you gotta upgrade your ship and house, you have minigames, a fleet to manage, a fantastic story with characters taken from history books, etc... I cant think of anything bad about this game. Sadly, this is officially the last great AC game, Unity and Syndicate were crap in my opinion.Multiplayer sucks just saying. Youll find yourself spending 40 hours on the singleplayer campaign so dont even bother to try online.
