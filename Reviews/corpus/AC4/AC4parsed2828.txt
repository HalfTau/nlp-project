I Own this game on Xbox 360  Playstation 4, So dont let me hours disencourage this review.Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is by far the last good Assassins Creed game. Were put into the shoes of Connors Grandfather AC3 Protagonist Edward Kenway. The story is based during the early 18th century which was the Golden age of piracy. Edward is caught up in the ancient conflict of the Assassins  Templars and sets search of a mystical precurser artifact. On the journey well meet infamous pirates who actually roamed the oceans during this time period. This game is a must play especially if you enjoy history.Note  everyone who gave this game a negative because of Uplay Issues.
