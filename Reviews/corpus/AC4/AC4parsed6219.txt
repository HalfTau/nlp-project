Basically traditional Assassins Creed game with ship battle. Very detailed world and interesting character. Ships are a very good addition to the game, but it can get repetitive and grindy. But its interesting to  have both naval battle and land battle, which make the game more interesting.Some bugs are seldom present throughout the game, but it doesnt affect the game in general.The only major flaw in this game would be the story. Most, if not all, of the main characters are very well developed. But they just disappear during the story or somehow managed to die. So I end up with some other characters that I meet in the middle of the game and they are not properly introduced and developed.
