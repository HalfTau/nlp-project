Bought the Digital Duluxe Edition with a season pass. Total waste of money. No Freedom Cry DLC included without buying it seperately even though the page itself says the DLC is available if you already have Black Flag duluxe or season pass but the game was otherwise alright. Theres not many pirate themed games out there that dont suck, this one did it okay. Nothing GREAT but definitely above average. Although like all Asscreed games its filled with collectibles and lame pseudoachievements and other stuff that only OCD people bother with.
