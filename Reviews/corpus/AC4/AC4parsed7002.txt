This is the same Assassins Creed youve played before with pirate trappings. The ship combat is enjoyable and upgrading your ship is a fun way to get your leveling up fix.If youve never played the series before, this is a decent place to start, but Id suggest II or Brotherhood. They have better mission design and a much more engaging story.
