VERDICT 95Assassins Creed IV represents a significant and rewarding experience in its own right. It takes all the elements that the franchise has excelled at and has placed them within an open world environment which instead of the roads and cars of the GTA series, sees the use of a simplified Naval simulation. It is a compelling mix, and the game packs a significant increase in content to other games within the franchise. My only minor gripe is that some cut scenes become repetitive but that doesnt affect the overall game experience at all. It is a heady mix and a real adventure which after over 30 hours of gameplay Im pleased to say is only 50 through. Multiplayer is beautiful, a real change from the deathmatch mayhem which most games produce. Instead a thoughtful and intense game of cat and mouse replaces the gungho team death match.Pros Its still Assassins Creed Naval Combat Open World Compelling gameplayCons Cut Scences get repetitive
