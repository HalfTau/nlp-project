I enjoyed it as its a good game but it could be better for these reasons.1, The naval battles are nowhere near as good as in AC3.2, The story is not as good as the other AC games.3, They used a stock model for all the enemy soldiers all they did is changed the color of the coats so they dont truly represent there countrys uniform.4, It look to me thet they cut the french from the game judging from screenshots on the internet then added them back in the freedom cry DLC which is a joke.5 Its an arcade game of Assassins creed.
