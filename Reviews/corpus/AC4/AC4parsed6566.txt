Very poorly optimized for PC. Ubisoft is known for their bad PC ports but this one is so bad. Cutscene audio is always ahead of the cutscene so after a cutscene with talking the audio will stop and the character will still be moving and mouthing words, also this game is very hard on your pc, I cant play this game with even half decent graphics settings but I am able to play every other game I own minus Planetside 2 on Ultra everything graphics, yet somehow I cant play this on anything better than low. I have everything low and I was still playing a slideshow so I had to go as far as turning off my VSync to even get it to run normal, but even now when its storming in the game its still a slideshow. Abysmal PC port but it is a fantastic game none the less. I give the game itself a 9/10 but the PC port a 1/10.
