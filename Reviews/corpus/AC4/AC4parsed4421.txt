I pirated the game and loved it. It was beautiful, the story was great, and... you know, pirate battles. I loved it so much I decided to buy it on steam. It kept crashing and I had to go through the maze of DRM, including having my account locked out for too many wrong password attempts although thats mostly my fault.
