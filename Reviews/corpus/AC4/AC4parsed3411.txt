A great open world action pirate themed game with a ton of features. The story is alright although the biggest part of the game is up to you as a player to explore what the carribbean islands and seas has to offer. Go hunt down a royal convoy, dive for treasures in a long lost shipwreck or take on your classic role as assassin and do your thing. Go sneaky or all in guns blazing!Although its a part of the Assassins Creed franchise you are not in my opinion required to play any of the other games in order to enjoy this one. The games not especially connected and they all follow a similar plot. The game is in my opinion totaly worth the money but wouldnt hurt to wait for a sale either.
