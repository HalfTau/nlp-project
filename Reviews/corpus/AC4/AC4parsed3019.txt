It was fun for the first few hours, raiding and destroying enemy ships. But that is about where it ends, the story about Edward is extremley boring and does not intrigue me at all, it is the usual assassins creed story but made even worse. Kind of a  port suprise so that is not fun, unless you hate Antialiasing then you will have a great experience graphically. Unless you are a huge fan of the AC series, you should not buy this game.
