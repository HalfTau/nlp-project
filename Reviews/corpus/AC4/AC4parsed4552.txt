This is, by far and wide, the best Assassins Creed in the franchise. Offerring the most contest of all, plus it has a gripping story that you really want to finish. Graphics are amazing better on Nvidia cards, more on that, the gameplay is fluid and well done, albeit a few issues, and the actual content of the game makes you feel immersed in the story of Captain Kenway.About the graphics this game is obviously optimized for Nvidia cards. I use an r9 290OC Gigabyte card, FX8350 CPU and 16GB of RAM and yet I cant play on Ultra settings at 1080p without soso framerates 1840. It took a lot of tweaking to get it to be 60FPS but the game just doesnt seem to run all that well with my set up.Also, I have beaten the game and wanted to jump in to see what other things I can complete to get to 100 and it looks like Uplay deleted my save file. Like others have said, I truly hope Uplay goes away, I just dont see the point of using an additional game client when I buy my games through Steam, which validates games and protects against piracy anyway.Regardless of that, I would highly recommend anyone new or veteran to the series to pick this up and play!
