Pirates and ships in the assasins creed series, what could possible be much better then that?For the PC version it could possible be better optimized and better controls, but if you have and can you can connect and use a xbox controller and probably make your life easier playing the game, even if i personally dont use one because im a scrub and refuse to buy one
