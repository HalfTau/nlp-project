A great game. This AC is brighter and nicer to look at than ACIII, and not just because of the enahnced graphics. The bright sunlight makes you feel like a hearty pirate, not that depressing cloudy GTAIVesque lighting they had in the previous title because to me personally ACIII just looked really dreary. But now to address the real issue at hand, which happened to me and tempted me to walk away from this game and never return. Me Buys game. Plays game for like 5 hours. Leaves open overnight. Repeats for about a week. So heres me, whos put over 35 hours into this game, to one day finally close it and reopen it, just to find out that all my save data was gone. I cried inside and maybe a little outside. But I didnt give up. I didnt give in. I didnt give down. I didnt give out. I investigated, and here is my solution it worked great for me, even if it is a little inconvenient. The file with your save data in it is called 437. Open it, and if I remember correctly, there should be some suspicious files in there like somethingDELETED. Yeah those are bad, delete em. The only things left should be 1.save, 1.save.upload, 2.save, 2.save.upload, 3.save, and 3.save.upload. What I found out is, whenever you leave the game while your save is in that folder, it wipes it back to zero. So make a new folder called AC4 Saves or something, and whenever you open the game, put whatever save file you used in that folder. Ex. I used save slot 1. I would put 1.save in 437 when I open the game, and before I close it I would put 1.save in AC4 Saves. That way, the files dont get corrupted whenever you quit. I got my 40 or so percent save slot back like this, but I always move the file back to 437 when I open the game, and move it to AC4 Saves BEFORE I close the game. Hope this works for you, and good luck.
