Put simply, its the best Assassins Creed game. The locations are all interesting to explore, the combat and stealth are wellbalanced yet still good at making you feel badass, the ship combat is good enough to sell on its own, it looks fantastic especially on PC, and the story manages a wide emotional range with depth and complexity matching the West Indies Sea. Definitely worth putting up with Uplay for.
