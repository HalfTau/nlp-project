Arguably the best pirate game of all time. The exploration is something new in this game compared to previous Assassins Creed, since now youre exploring the ocean in a boat and fighting other vessels. It has the prettiest ocean Ive seen in a game.The story is quite engaging and the main character is very interesting.The combat is super solid combining the best elements from previous games and they removed the stupid notoriety in cities so you can just cut whatever NPC is nagging you without causing much trouble and frustration running away.
