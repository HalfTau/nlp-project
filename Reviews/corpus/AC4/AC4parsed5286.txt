If youre a fan of the AC series, but are also a bit bored of the AC series.. this is the perfect AC game for you. Its different enough to the other games because the cities arent the main playground you run around in killing guards and doing missions. Yes, there are cities for you to explore but I found them to be the most boring part. The game really shines when youre exploring the seas, battling other ships and randomly coming across a bit of land that you can fully explore. The landscapes are beautiful, just like other AC games but unlike the others, the best landscapes are in the wild, not in the cities and huge buildings. AC3 didnt nail either the wild or the cities, but this game does.The story is also refreshing as you dont someone from the creed, you play a pirate whose main motivation is gold. Although you are still a good guy and help the creed.Didnt fully complete this game but got close. This is the first AC that I wanted to FULLY explore and try and collect everything because its such a pleasure to roam both on land and sea.
