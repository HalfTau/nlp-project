This game is pretty awesome! Both story and gameplay are amazing!But I still have a problem, not with the game itself, but with the gamecode. The thing is, I purchased the deluxe edition and got the standard edition! Every addon that I purchased was not in my game! Maybe this is a fixed issue, I dunno, but it reallyme off! I tried everything, from reinstalling the game to contacting Ubisoft and Steam, but nothing worked...However, this didnt make the game less valuable.
