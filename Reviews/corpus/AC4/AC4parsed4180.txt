Lets keep this one simple.  Its Assassins Creed.  You guys know it, im sure everyone has tried one of the games in the series at some point.The story for this one is very interesting, Ubisoft seems to have changed gameplay up and made the game far more open world.  So you have the normal Assassins creed, parkour mixed with hack and slash fighting mechanics with a good and interesting storyline of the battle through the ages of the templars vs the assassins.The story is solid making reference to historical characters and events, you even meet the real life characters that made piracy so compelling as a storyline throughout the ages.After playing through this i feel that it was a much stronger game than every other Assassins creed game i played and i own the entire series.What did i like about it?The storyline while starting off dragging its heels a little was very interesting it almost felt like a movie to me.Characters were fantastic i loved them all, the voice actors did a fine job.The actual fighting on land was typical of any Assassins creed game here nothing new i found this average at best.Ship to ship combat and travel was immense, this was the most interesting part for me at least.  Braving a tropical storm at sea while in a battle firing cannons at an enemy ship was breathtaking.  I enjoyed the fact you could attack any ship you wanted i felt this made the game more open and enjoyable.Ship upgrades were a much needed addon and ubisoft delivered on this.  No more running from a battle with a larger more powerful ship later on in the game once you have the upgrades needed to take down such ships.The deck battles after weakening a ship i found better than the land battles as it just felt right for the the time and location and scenario of the game.The side missions as usuall were and interesting touch and i found myself constantly starying from the main story to chase these and complete them while not ruining my enjoyment of the game at all.The graphics and sound effects were excellent but you can expect the same movements and similar textures to previous titles but dont be put off ubisoft once again have done a great job makign everything and everyone look good.What i didnt like...Average land combat although the flint lock pistols added some fun it can get repetetive quite fast and i found myself itching to get back on the water to take down a man o war spanish warship everytime.The story seemed somewhat short, this is usually a case with most Assassins creed games they seem to end the story rather short.All in all i enjoyed this game.  It was a very different approach to what im used to with the Assassins creed series and what i would say if you are considering this game its a no brainer really to just buy it and play through it at least once.That rounds up my review ill give this one 8 out of 10.
