POSSIBLE SPOILERS  What can I say about this game? You play as a pirate who is looking for The Big Score. This is by far one of the best game in the series. It was a much needed change from the whole revenge plot. The ship and foot combat is still  fun and as smooth. The game is absolutely beautiful. It has is bugs here and there, but they are not game breaking and can be easily ignored. Have you stopped reading this to go buy the game? Well, you should.
