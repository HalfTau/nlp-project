I couldnt get into the Assassin Creed games. The illusion of choice masking linear gameplay and limited options. Too much running around, hiding, waiting out pursuit timers, easily obtainable goals, climbing towers, and shifting storylines that killed my suspension of disbelief.But I kept buying them causeThe attention to detail was astonishing.The userinterfaces were so well thought out.The tutorials were thoughtful.The fighting was pretty fun.The characters interactions with the world reminded me of the Prince of Persia games,The historical touches were engaging and the voice acting was excellent.But I didnt play them more than a few hours cause I got bored.So Black Flag went on sale, I scooped it up cause my brother said it was decent but I let it sit for months cause I thought it would be more of the same.I have to give Ubisoft some props. This game is more expansive. Theres more freedom. More sense of accomplishment and Im just having a good time. Its polished like all the other games but some of the island scenes are just knockout beautiful  its transportive. Im loving the sense of exploration, the pirate songs, the layers.This game is an incredible accomplishment and Im glad a gave the franchise another chance. Well worth a look for any action, adventure, or even RPG fan like me.
