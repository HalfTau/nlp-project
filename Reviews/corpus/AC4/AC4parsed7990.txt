Horrible assassins creed game aside from Jack KIdd, but an amazing pirate game, its the kind of game ive been wanting for YEARS. The visuals are also stunning and the voice acting is pretty good too. Also, for being a pirate game its pretty accurate too, though it does fall to one or two pirate tropes in the single player but otherwise an awesome game.
