Open world sailing, customize/upgrade your pirate ship, ship battles, can board other ships and have swordfights/gun fights, several islands, and a few cities to explore. Cool story, cool side missions like assassinations, checkers, bar fights, controling a fleet of ships that you can steal through ship battles, and PIRATES! This game also runs very good for me. Ive played about 40 hours so far, no crashing or glitches.The only bad thing about the game is when youre running in the streets on a mission your character tends to want to climb the side of buildings or tree, which can set you up for failure sometimes but thats very minor.. A must buy if you love pirates and assassin creed games.
