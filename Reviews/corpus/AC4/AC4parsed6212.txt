Never really was a fan of the franchise, but this game is very, very fun. My main gripes with the game, though, are The combat system  A lot of people hate it becaue they feel its insanely easy, and quite frankly I have to agree. Combat feels like a chore when you get far enough in the game. The cut scenes  Not all of them, just the ones that play after you destroy a ship. The AI  They might as well not even be there if theyre going to be this stupid.Apart from that, though, the game is very fun. Especially the sea combat. Would recommend this yo
