This is in my top 5 games of all time.Ive never been big on pirates, but this delivers a great experience none the less.From tropical storms to bracing while watching a dozen incoming iron balls, its an immersive joy.Stealth total overrun of your foes tactical engagement upgrades a trading minigame it has it all.With over 30 years of gaming Im confident this will go down as one of the forerunners of its time.
