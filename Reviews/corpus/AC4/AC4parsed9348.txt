A Amazing Game, I played all the Assassins creed games, but over all i love this one the most. I have way more freedom in this one with my ship at hand  and my crew at my side taking over the sea nothing can stop us from hunting down booty to hunting down sharks/ other sea monsters lolover all thy did a great job on this game really did not find something i did not like.
