After not enjoying the other Assassins Creed games in the past I had reservations about buying Black Flag. Man was I wrong...Black Flag takes everything awesome about Assassins Creed and combines it with some of the best pirating content I have seen in years. There arent a lot of studios that can make great pirate content simply because we want freedom to roam. This is something Black Flag delivers on big time. Since you have the option to roam all over the map it allows you the freedom to go about anywhere you want at any time. There is some limitation depending on story progression, but its not bad. With the size of the map and content that fills it I promise you will be playing for many, many hours.I also thought Ubisoft did a good job with the storyline in Black Flag. Its nice to see the usual historical facts mixed in with some fiction from their end. It allows the story to be grounded very well and adds some cool stuff to the storyline.All I can say is that if you are a Assassins Creed fan or a pirate fan you must own this game.
