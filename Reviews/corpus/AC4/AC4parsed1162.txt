Absolutaly incredible! I had an offer from Uplay of Assassins Creed III. I admit that i never payed much attention to the game to it. But, out of curiosity, i have played one of the best games so far. Assassins Creed IV is an upgrade in a way that i cannot explain. After playing the story of the III i thought that it could not be beaten. But i was wrong. I am loving the thus far. I tottaly recomend this game to RPG and Adventure lovers. Great job!
