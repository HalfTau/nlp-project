The graphics are nice, the story is mildly interesting and the pirate theme is good enough. But come on, this is the 6th major release into this series and the controls are still aweful! The number of times I had Edward wanking the wall instead of running after the guy Im chasing, or all the times I assassinated another guy from the one I was targeting. These errors should be abolished by the time this game came out.The plot around the animus is also now going a little thin and barely comes around being interesting since theres no major problem to solve now, just an ongoing cold war between the Assassins and the Templars. Any going further from this would just be milking the last few shillings from our pockets.My last ACgame, and one I really cant recommend, sorry guys! Although, an AC game set in modern times would be refreshing and more interesting. Ubisoft just needs to cut the crap theyre pulling on the Unitygame.
