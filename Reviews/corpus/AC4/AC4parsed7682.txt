This game was very fun, graphics are incredible, it used a lot of the new features that Nvidia has displayed. The story plot is good, displaying interesting characters and unexpected twist plot.And you can sail on a boat and control a fleet. That was so nice, I used my ipad to manage the fleet which was a really nice touch.You need a very good computer to play the game with full details. If you like to collect things, this game wont disappoint you. There are tons of little things to collect. So sad achievements are not handled by steam...I hate ubisoft platform, but that is the way you have to play it. I used an Xbox controller ant it works flawlessly.I suffer a couple of bugs once in a while when you use fast traveling, since the ship emerge from the bottom of the ocean, sometimes the character gets trapped. I played the game for a long time and only happened it to me like 3 times.In summary, this is the first Assassins Creed game I start playing and cannot stop until I complete it. I hate that I have 98 of the items but the map doesnt help me to know where is the missing 2.I will recommend this game even not to fans of the franchise.
