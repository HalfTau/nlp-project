i am sadly putting thumbs down for this AWESOME game, i loved this game like no other, it has everything almost everything i want in a game, and also one thing that one thing i dont want, an unfixable bug that ruined the game, at the hacking mission where you get loading screen, then it keeps loading for ages, so, i cant play the game anymore, i cant fix it i have googled it many times in months but no can do, nothing, NADA.. why didnt ubisoft fix this anyway, seeing all the threads about it everywhere, I CANT PLAY THE GAME! THE GAME IS BROKEN! HELLO! i hope someone will hear me and fix this, i still wanna play this game.
