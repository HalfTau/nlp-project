Best game ive played. I like the piracy theme alot and think ubisoft made a very good pirate game. The cons are that sometimes the fps drops without reason from 60 to 30fps. This while my gaming rig is definitly powerful enough to run this game at max settings. But despite this little con, which happens once every hour for 10 secs, I can recommend this game.
