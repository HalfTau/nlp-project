Unfortunately, all merits of this game are overshadowed by an autosave bug that will, randomly and without warning, delete your save files. People are losing anywhere from 3 to 50 hours of playtime. This bug has been present for months and renders most of the game effectively unplayable.UPDATE I was able to recover my saves by finding and renaming some files. Different people are reporting success or failure with different recovery methods and are, strangely, not seeing the same things in the file system, when they find anything at all. Some report that the problem is entirely with the uplay cloud sync, and recommend disabling it.
