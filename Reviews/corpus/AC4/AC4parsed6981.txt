Figured I would take a stab at this game once again with the oncoming release of Assassins Creed Unity. Quickly found myself being pulled into the golden age of piracy tinged by the conspiracy theories of Assassins Creed, anyway.Though the game seemed to stand alone far better as a pirate game than an Assassins Creed entry, it still managed to add a little something to the story, and like all games before it, left me scratching my head a little bit. Bravo, Ubisoft. You managed to keep me wanting to play more of your games.Assassins, Templars, the First Civilization, pirates, dubloons, this game has all you need to enjoy your time on the high seas.
