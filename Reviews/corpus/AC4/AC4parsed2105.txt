Absolutely loved this game. My main reason for purchasing this game was the gameplay of the ships. Sailing the sea, fighting and looting ships, taking over the ports and hunting down ocean game. once I was done taking over all the ports, hunting all the animals and, it left me wanting more. The songs just adds to the atmosphere.I do not like the fact i have to download U play, that is kind of annoying, I bought steam for that reason, so i dont have to download yet another stupid program just to play other games.
