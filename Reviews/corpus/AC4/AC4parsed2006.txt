I love the Assassins Creed games, and Black Flag is no exception. It is generally regarded as one of the better games in the series, and with good reason. Great gameplay, characters, and story make an experience well worth playing. While previous installments have had sea warfare, this takes it to the next level and makes it an integral part of the game. Youll spend a good portion of the game on the high seas plundering ships for booty, while trying to survive massive storms with sea twisters and rogue waves. That doesnt mean there isnt anything to do on land. There is still plenty of the gameplay youve come to know and love, but the highlight is the sea. Its good to be a pirate, and before long youll be singing sea shanties with the crew.
