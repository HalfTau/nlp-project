Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is quite... different when compared to the rest of the franchise. While most games have the protagonists being trained as an Assassin at a very young age or at least have prior knowledge of the conflict between Templars and Assassins With the exception of Ezio, Arno and possibly Shay. Edward Kenway, the protagonist of the game, was unaware of the conflict until when the prologue of the game occurs. In fact,ACIV does not feel like an AC game but it feels more like a pirate game If one ignores the lore between the whole TemplarAssassin war and I think that it is a good thing at least once in a while. Gameplay on foot is just as fun as ACIII. Watching how Kenway fights and kills anyone in his way looks brutal and feels satisfying, yet stealth can be difficult especially early on in the game where most of the good gear is still unavailable. The same way can be felt about the ship gameplay. Every weapon that can be used requires a bit of strategy and timing in order for it to be truely devastating to enemy ships and forts. The open world is massive when both the land and sea portions are combined, yet one must progress through the story in order to access every area. The voice acting is what I think one of the best that the series has ever had. The story is also great. Overall, I will rate this a 9/10. This is a must buy for those kind of people who love pirate games, games with sea shipbased combat, or for those who love a good story.
