The best of the assassins games, but thats not saying much. As always, plagued by awful controls, constant NO DONT CLIMB THAT WALL moments, you know all the samethey havent fixed from the first game.Still, at the very least, its fun. Actually fun. The first time Ive had fun playing an assassin game. Dont buy it though.
