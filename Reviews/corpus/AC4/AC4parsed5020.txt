I couldnt get into the first assasins creeds because I felt the gameplay was just to samey. Go here, follow him, kill him, update story repeat.This assasins creed, whilst having pretty much the same formula, breaks it up much better by adding in a massive world to explore, small side missions/activities and crazyship battles. I probably love the ship combat more than anything. Blast a ship to pieces and boarding your way on to kill the remaining crew.When I get bored of Ship battles, I go assasinate people. When I get bored of assasinating people, I go have ship battles.Excellent game and well recommended.
