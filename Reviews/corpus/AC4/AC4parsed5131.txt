My favorite of the Assassins Creed games. It reminds me a bit of 2 in some ways. The exploartion of the jungle areas was very fun, though I can see how it would becme tiresome after a while. Its not a perfect game, but it was still well done for being one of their yearly releases.And that ending...well...If you get yourself immersed in that story, have fun with that ending. It was designed for hardcore fans.
