I knew Ubisoft was bad, but i didnt know it was THIS bad.I havent even launched the game yet because Ubisoft doesnt recognize my password. I made several attempts to reset it, and it only finally sent the email after 45 minutes. Even after I recreated my password, twice while relaunching the game every time, it told me that I have failed to log in too many time, and my account is temporarily suspened, come back latter, not once have a recieved a time frame for these messeges or restrictions to be lifted. its like trying to get a straigth answer out of a toddler. and to top it all off, to play offline you still have to enter a password.
