DO NOT get this game, period!I bought it for xbox. xbox broke the disc in less than a month of playing.I bought it for PC, ubisoft is acting like my CD key isnt associated with my account I had to make with them to even use the game on STEAM!Now I cant play it anyway. Lots of money down the drain. Dont waste your time and money like I have.Their support is crap too, so that wont help either.
