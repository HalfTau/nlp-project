This game has changed the path of Assassins Creed. From the first game, Altair was not able to swim or be in the water, but would drown in it. Now in Black Flag, you wave your testicles into the ocean as you sail through the Carribean Sea, killing possibly anyone you want. You are going through all the trouble just for some weight in your wallet, which perfectly sums up the Franchise.
