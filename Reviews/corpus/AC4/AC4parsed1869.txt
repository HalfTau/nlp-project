tldr  The game is great for its pirate aspect and for the assassins part.If you like Pirates of the Caribbean then you will love this one.Best pirate game out thereGreat environmentNice gameplay naval combat is great,otherwise its a typically assassins creed minion kill simulatorGood graphicsMediocre to bad storyBLACKBEARDIf the title was just Black Flag and not Assassins Creed IV Black Flag then i wouldnt be able to find any flaws in this one.The only assassins creed part is the characteristic gameplay of the franchise, yet naval combat is something new and done extremelly well.The world is big , big enough to spend hours and hours to explore,you get the feeling of a real pirate and its most amusing.Yes the storyline is quite dull and onedimensional, the abstergoanimus thing has quite disappeard but theare present.The great thing about it is that it delivers the feeling of the pirate setting 100 and of course BLACKBEARD.I would rate it BLACKBEARD/10
