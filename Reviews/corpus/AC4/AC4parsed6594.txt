this is hands down one of the best games i have ever played, mesmorised by the graphics i found the open world had very little littmits to what i could do, this game is full of suprises, but instead of going into the best bit will first strart out with the negatives just to get them out of the way, i noticed a few bugs in the game like the jackjaw the main ship in the game to be rising out of the ocean, but i couldnt really say this was a neggative because it looked balls deep in  the awesome factor, so forth i found that the free running wouldnt be as accurate as i hoped it would be and i often found edward repelling off objects which was slightly annoying as well as the Animus scenes taking me away from the fun in the story line and i found that the pc version had a graphics fault by not having tripple buffering locking the game at 30fps, but this was an easy fix if anyone else has this issue i would seek advise on you tube. With this out of the way i can now explain why this is a difinate recommendation, again the graphics are amazing the huge open world looks beautiully expansive stretching right through the Caribbean and is unlike anything i have seen in games yet, the graphics on the waves are uniquely lifelike, as for the combat the fighting looks almost corriagraphed with flowing combos. i again now go to the possibilities of the open world, i found myself lost in all the side quests as they were so fun and adverturous, by taking fortresses, exploring islands and hunting for treasure, overall this is a fantastic game and i would recomend it anyone
