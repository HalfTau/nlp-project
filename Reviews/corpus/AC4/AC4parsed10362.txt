This game is a lot of fun, and way better then ACIII. And I actually enjoyed ACIII, maybe because I got it on Steam sale! Back to ACIV... The more I play it the more fun I am having. I am slowly traversing the story because there are so many side things to do. Out on the seas sailing your ship its incredible! This game is Huge! This game will keep you all sorts of busy, specifically if your a completionist. If you havent bought it yet, I suggest you do! Maybe wait for a Steam Fall Sale thanksgiving time? or Steam Holiday Sale typically Xmas time!! !As for performance issues as seen in forums and elsewhere.... I am running this game at 1080p smooth as butter, I can run this game with everything maxed except for antialising and ambient occlusion and it runs really smoothly an looks awesome! I havent tried tweaking these settings to see how I can put them and still have a playable game. I have soft shadows and god rays maxed all they way! I was having too much fun in the game to tweak settings and I think its gorgeous! I know my PC isnt cutting edge but what I can see on the screen looks way better then PS4 or Xbone.AMD 955 o.c. 4Ghz, 8Gb Ram, AMD HD 6970 stock settings
