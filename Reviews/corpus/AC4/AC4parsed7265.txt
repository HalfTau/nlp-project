Ive always been a fan of Assassins Creed and I didnt have high hopes for the Black Flag as while playing the third installment I hated all this sailing stuff. But this game just does it right. Pirating is a lot of fun, missions are ok, fighting with dual swords have become my favourite way of dealing with enemies and theres just a lot to do in between missions. I recommend this game to anyone. I actually think it might be better than a outstanding second part.On the darked side, Im dissapointed with Aveline DLC, which is 3 missions that you can complete in an hour.
