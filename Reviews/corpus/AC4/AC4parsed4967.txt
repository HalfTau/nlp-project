I bought my computer to play Dota2, that I knew from my brother. Ok. Than I met Skyrim! Oh god, all my early memories of my firsts RPG experience with paper and dices come to another level. Well brothers and sisters, I was playing MadMax, an amazing game, when I permit myself to try this... BLACK FLAG justfy itself for everything! My very thanks to Ubisoft! I love this game! I am 36! ...and BLACK FLAG made me say proudly, I am a gamer again!! !
