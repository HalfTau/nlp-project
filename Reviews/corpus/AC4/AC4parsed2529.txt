Hey Guys,this is my review about Assassins Creed IV Black Flag. Black Flag has a very good graphic and runs fluent.I just can say that i like this game much, i also have Assassins Creed III and i can say that the story is better than before, with priates in the caribic sea. I dont want to tell you much from the story but i can say that  if you want a nice story withpirates and sea fights buy Assassins Creed IV Black FLag.
