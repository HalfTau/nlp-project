If you were disappointed with  just about everything in AC3, then this game will help. You dont need to know anything about the Assassins Creed franchise or have played any of the games to understand the story. The main character will be just as ignorant/flippant as you about assassins and templars. The story mainly focuses on the pirates and their adventures. Then again if you dont feel like investing yourself in the story, the game offers an open ocean to sail about and do other piratelike activites.
