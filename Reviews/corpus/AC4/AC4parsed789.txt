I think this game is decent, however I really dislike the naval system that is applied to the game which therefore makes the game less enjoyable for me to play as it it a game where you travel from island to island. I think in my opinion rogue handled this way better as the steering feells better for me and the naval system seems more fitting in the game than black flags. Also I just like the North American style better than the Carribean because I feel like its more coller when you can fight with a polar bear,destroy icebergs and other kind of stuff which seems a bit ouf of the ordinary which makes the game cooler. Overall if think this game is worth buying on a steamsale to kill some time as it can be seen quite fun at some times but I would rather prefer rogue as you can play as a freaking templar with a freaking rocket launcher which destroys everything in its path D.
