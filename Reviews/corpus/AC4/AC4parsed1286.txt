I think this is one of the best assassins creed games out there, not only that you are assassin but a pirate too.You can swim underwaterYou can hunt sharks and whalesYou can hunt for treasures on big and small islandsTake the lead over a bigship and fight on the caribbean seasVery interesting and enjoying storyIf the game crashes when you start singleplayer, disable anti aliasing and you will be fine.
