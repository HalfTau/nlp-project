I absolutely love this game it is everything you could want from an Assasssins Creed game pirates,assassins,money,plundering,naval ship combat. It truly is one of the best experiences I have ever had playing an Assassins Creed game ever in my entire life. It is worth the price tag and much more. Get this game for an experience nothing like any other.
