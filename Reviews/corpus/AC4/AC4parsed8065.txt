this is an amazing game and i loved playing it, it was the best assassins creed yet if it wasnt for its one gigantically fatal flaw. it has a huge problem with its saves. its save data will from time to time, delete itself or render itself unreadable, or just not save at all.so as much as i would like to say everyone should get this game, i cant say it for PC because they screwed up bad, that is unless of course you like starting over fresh constantly.
