Dissapointing.I was hoping for a story in a different time like when we went from AC II to AC III counting brotherhood and Revelation as expation to AC II but in this case we went to Assassins Creed IV which takes place more or less in the same periode of history.There was no innovation in gameplay and here comes the part that annoyed me the most. The attention your ship has during the game felt like kids enjoyed sailing their ship in AC III and begged Ubisoft to extend it in the next game. Too bad Ubisoft for once listened to his consumers. Of course when you concentrate your gameplay around sailing ships then you have to add a storyline how  it may be that has a bit of cohesion.
