Phenomenal game. All around one of the best Assassinss creed games in the series. The only one close to reaching the magnitude of this one is brotherhood. Assassins Black Flag delivers a new experience to the Assassins creed games. It is not simply a game where you are told to go and kill someone like in the other ones. Black flag throws many different types of missions at you. All around the best Assassins Creed yet. Keep up the good work Ubisoft.
