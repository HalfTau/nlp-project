Originally I hesitated in purchasing this game due to the disappointment that was AC III.  It seemed like the culmination of everything I hated about the previous franchises, which was in fact, sailing ships around and a lack of grand old cities.  As a fan of the Ezio storyline, entering a world where you primarily sailed a ship around and explored small outposts on small islands seemed like a dramatic turn for the worse.  I could not have been more wrong.The ship mechanics and execution are incredible.  Whether your simply sailing around listening to your crew sing sea shanties or engaging enemy ships in combat in an effort to board them and steal their supplies for your own gain, you are never bored while on your ship.  The ocean and all weather patterns, including hurricanes, are rendered beautifully.  The combat noises and graphical effects are downright immersive.  Never before did I think ship sailing could be more fun.  If you were looking for nothing more than a fun pirate game I can whole heartedly recommend this title.The storyline and voice acting is another strong point of this game.  Not only is the animation done really well, but the tasks they have for you and characters you meet make this game top notch when it comes to single player experience.  Could some of the missions use improvement?  Of course.  Not every game is going to offer a completely perfect experience.  But those few missions with tedious exercises are made up for with the rest of the story.This game has great value and I would recommend it to anybody looking for a new, good single player story, even at the full price.  But if you see this game go on sale for less than 20 like it did in the 2014 summer sale, jump on it immediately.9/10
