Caribbean pirate simulator, enough said. In one of the more recent chapters of the Creed series you are taken to a period of time where Anglo privateers turn on queen and country for the risk and reward of plunder. Taking place in the first decades of the 18th century, the game follows history to almost a historical key of the events of Queen Annes War, and the War of Spanish Succession in the Caribbean. You meet some of the most infamous pirates of the period, and explore a well sculpted Cuba and its surrounding landmasses. The highlight of this Creed, much like the snow and physics added in Creed III, is the way the ship moves along the water and the realism of the waves as they crash on your ship. If you enjoy sailing, or the nostalgia of captaining a wooden Brig this is the game for you. My favorite memory of this Creed was the shanties sung by your saliors, adding to the realism of real shiphands during this time, the music mixed with the occasional Mano War of the port bow Captain! is enough to make anyone reminisce of Pirates of the Caribbean, or being a pirate as a child at all.
