Ive never been very compelled by the narrative, storytelling, or character of Assassins Creed games despite their impressive gameplay, but the character development of this game and the dialogue make it feel like a true epic, to me this game is just so much better than all the other Assassins Creed Games, oh and aside from it having what I believe to be the best narrative and storytelling by far, the gameplay is the most ubiquitously compelling, and Im shocked that at least for me it never found a way to become repetitive.
