Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is an Open World, Action, Adventure, Online RPG that is a lot of fun. For the first Assassins Creed game that I ever played, let alone owned, I really liked this game. And now I want to get the rest. The only downside to this is that you cant play the game without having a UPlay account.In Black Flag, you are a pirate captain by the name of Edward Kenway, who is also an assassin. You are out to find the mystrious Observitory, which is highly vauled, and very can be sold for unimaginable prices. Along the way, you pick up the ship Jackdaw, and meet some new friends to help you on your journey. It is a really fun game, and it controls well. There are two main aspects of the game naval and, i guess, land? When in naval mode, you sail your ship from place to place, taking out navy forts and spanish/english ships. in land mode, its just like any other Assassins Creed game run, kill, hide, and kill some more. but, its fun all the same.Overall, I REALLY like Assassins Creed IV Black Flag. Infact, I didnt think Id like it as much as I do. I recommend this game to anyone who is old enough to play it, because it is a bit graphic.
