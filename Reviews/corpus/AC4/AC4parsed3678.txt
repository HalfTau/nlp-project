Tried to boot up the newest Assassins Creed game but after about an hour of tutorials it somehow loaded a  knockoff of Sid Meiers Pirates! When I hit Escape to make sure I was in the correct game, it loaded one of those First Person Walking simulators where I was working in a pre dotcom blowout office with a bunch of Millennials?
