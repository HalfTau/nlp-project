Though I havent even finished it yet 40 hours in its absolutely safe to say, that this is the best AC titleI like it way better then the second, they reduced the city size, and made three smaller ones, which reduces unwanted running around for kilometers. Though overall mapsize is bigger.The best part is out on sea imho. The battles you can have there are just amazing. It all depends on the upgrade system,if youre able to take on three ManOWars or not DIn the beginning, even some smaller ships can sink you in seconds xDAnd cruising around the sea, while listening to your pirate singing shanties, is just awesome Leave her Johnny leave her...Fighting is still overpowered, but enemies can hit you easier, then in previous titles, which is a plus imho.Freerunning is as awesome as always, but can be clunky sometimes, but thats mostly yourself being to hectic with the controls DAnd the pirate theme just fits so great into this setting, honestly go buy this if you like AC titles, and if you dont liked them before, start with this!
