Very frustrating early game. Buggy  crashes. Not sure why its got such good reviews, typical ubisoft game.Ive played some 20 more hours since the above comment and I can now safely say the more I play, the more it crashes.I Googled for a solution only to find it seems a common, and unfixed problem. Its such a beautiful game it never fails to astound me how ubisoft can make such good looking games and turn them to poop. The dozen or so story missions Ive done are really not fun and you have a very linear path in what appears to be open world sandbox. It isnt.I was hoping to change my review to positive having played some more but its just reinforced me not recommending it, and it makes me sad.I learned a few years ago to not buy ubisoft products, or if I did, to only pay 5/7 or less because thats all they are worth.I have got up to 35 completion as when I get into a game like this I can be a bit of a completionist collecting all the things, but at a rate of at least one crash per 5 minutes or less that goal is no longer tenable. Im done.For the record I loved Assassins Creed 1  2, I stopped caring when they diverted from the original plan of a trilogy and just started churning them out like fifa. But AC IV always seemed to be well rated so years after release I tried it, now I wish Id spent 30 hours doing something else.
