Some countless number of insainly pad plots, missions, trainings, level designes and puzzles. I still remember the very first AC with my old xbox and I can see UBI is clearly lost its way. Had to see two youtube walkthrough out of frustration and found one comment that describe my feelings about this game what video game creators need to realize is, WE DO NOT want to be challenged, we just want to enjoy the gaming expierience, not scream at the tv or pc for for 30 minutes over one RIDICULOUS mission Well, cant complaint too much for 10 tho.
