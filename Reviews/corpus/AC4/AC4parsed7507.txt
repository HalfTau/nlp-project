Assassins Creed IV is definitely one of mys for this 2013. Mind you, I havent played any AC games before, so I was a bit skeptical of spending a full 60 on it. However, one hour into the game was all it took for me to realize I was wrong. I love the Caribbean setting and everything the developers added to immerse the player. The characters were also very lovable, and they made the storyline amazing. All the sidequests and missions were incredibly fun, but some became a little tedious. If Im on the topic of complaining, I might as well include that this was a very poor console port, being locked at 30 FPS. Dont get me wrongthe graphics are incredible and the attention to details such as foliage blew me away. However, I was dissapointed when I discovered that even my beastly rig couldnt run it at a higher framerate than a console. Overall, I recommend this to anybody as long as you dont mind the performance issue.
