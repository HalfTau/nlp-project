If you have been looking for a good pirate game with assassin work then this pretty much it all in one, well other then pirate people kill as well so the assassin part is off haha. Sailing the sea and attacking ships is really fun, the only thing i could say i dont like about this is it can get jerky with the running and grabbing walls and what have you but what Assassins Creed dosnt really. All in all a solid 8.5 from fun water play to exploring the islands with just really pretty enviroments.
