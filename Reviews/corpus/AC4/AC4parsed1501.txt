Game itself is okay, but the problem is I have changed Widows 3 times now, and progress ingame doesnt save on steam because of uplay. That means i had to play the game 3 times now, and the game didnt save at none of cases. I have never finished a game, but I probably wont play it again now, because im sick of it.Good game, but Uplay made me uneccesary problems.
