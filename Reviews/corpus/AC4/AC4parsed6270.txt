Originally played this on the Xbox 360. Now playing it on the PC.Story is very bland and almost uninteresting. But the gameplay of sailing your own ship and being a Pirate makes up for it. Not too many pirate games out there, so if you are into pirates, try to get the most out of it.The customization is pretty good. From choosing an outfit to customizing your ships sails, armor, etc.The look of the game is pretty incredible. The ocean looks amazing and the forest and jungles look adventurous.Gameplay is amazing to me. If you always wanted to climb around your own ship, jumping on to a boat, and fighting whomever is on it while making money and exploring a vast open world, then you should try this game out, even if you never played Assassins Creed games before. Dont worry, story elements really died down in the franchise.I really hope Ubisoft or another company will make an actual pirate game franchise with this idea.Graphics The looks 9/10Gameplay 9/10Story 6/10
