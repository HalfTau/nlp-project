I really enjoyed the game because it felt so vast. Obviously, its lacking in the realism department, but any more realistic and it would have detracted from the fun. I own and have played every single AC game from the beginning and I love the series. I really didnt like where this story went within the AC universe, but thats just a personal thing. I viewed it more of a pirate game than AC game and loved it. At its worst, its still better than 3.The musical score, ambiance, graphics, and gameplay options are amazing and so much to do and see, especially with all the addons. They did an excellent job of immersing the player in that time era. I do have some beef with realism, as I said, for example, rogue winds come at unrealistic times, like when theres not a cloud in the sky, and from directions that arent realistic. Also, rogue waves which are a cool idea, but you can literally have them come one direct from starboard, and then one direct from port. Doesnt work that way realistically. But still, a great game to play and satisfying at the end. Obviously, some questions left hanging at the close, but hey...  wouldnt be AC if it didnt leave unanswered questions.
