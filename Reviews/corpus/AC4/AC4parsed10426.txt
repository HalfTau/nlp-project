The BEST Assassins Creed since AC2, heavy engine modifications a long with many other changes to the gameplay. They really did go back to their roots and take the best of all their games and put them into this one.ProsAmazing graphics and visualsSmooth transitions in the open world environmentNice ship battlesCustomizationConsPC Port couldve been so much betterQuite a few bugs im sure patches will be releasedOptimization for PC isnt that good, cant get 60 fps stable in dense environments such as jungles. ON A HIGH END PCOverall its a must buy, a great comeback from AC3
