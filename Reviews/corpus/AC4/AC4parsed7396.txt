I wasnt sure about this game when it first came out. I refused to buy it since Assassins Creed III fell short in a lot of ways. I got Assassins Creed IV on the Summer Steam Sale and I am admittedly disappointed that I didnt get this game sooner. Its definitely a return to everything that makes Assassins Creed games great, without the out of Animus plot getting in the way.
