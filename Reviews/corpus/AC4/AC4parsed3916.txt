Great game!I bought this game of the steam market when it only costed 5 just thinking why the f not? its so cheap! But when i got into the game i fell in love with it, its 1 day ago since i bought this game and i already love it. even though it might be hard sometimes. I will recommend u to buy this if u have the money!
