Awesome assassins creed game. As someone who has played through every single one I can safely say that this is only second to ac2. The story isnt something to write home about but it is entertaining and honestly I had more fun just sailing around the caribean and creating my own adventures than the main story which is pretty abviously rushed and thrown together at some parts especially the ending. There are quite a few bugs wich is dis heartening because this great game couldve been a masterpeice if Uibisoft hadnt anualized the franchise and taken there time with the game to make a more cohesive story that had a decent ending instead of using blatent fan service that everyone was expecting and serviced bugs in the game. Anyways If youre an ac fan buy this game and if your a fan of pirates for sure buy this game youll have a blast, its an awesome adventure. 9/10.
