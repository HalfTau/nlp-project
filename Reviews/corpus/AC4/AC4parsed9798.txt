Story is what you expect from the Assassin games. Take it for what it is. But the game shines as one of the best pirate themed games ever made. You battle ships in the Caribbean, search for treasure and upgrade your ship and equipment to further yourself as a fearsome pirate. Wherever AC3 utterly disappointed, AC4 has corrected it and made it more fun to play. Kenway is interesting as a character and its overall more engaging to follow his quest to become rich and famous.If you enjoyed AC2 and felt AC3 fell short AC4 will once again manage to peak your interest.
