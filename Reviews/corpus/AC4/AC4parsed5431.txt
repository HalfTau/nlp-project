This game reawoke my longing for the open sea and moved me to make a boat license.The moments where you simply sail around with your crew singing shanties pirating everything in sight are the best pirate moments in any game.Unfortunately the story is forgetful and generic...Now if they would manage to finally put assassins creed to rest and focus on a pirate game with similar ship mechanics it could damn well be one of the best pirate games ever this game should not be an assassins creed game but a standalone pirate gamestill worth a buy especially for around 20
