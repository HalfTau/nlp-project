I have horrible framerate and my computer barely meets the minimum requirements.  Even playing in slow motion with spaghetti mouth cut scenes, this is still one of the coolest games Ive ever played. Its Super fun just to cruise around and play pirate, and all of the islands from the Florida Keys to Jamaica are beautiful and a joy to explore.  All in all, a nice improvement over what I thought was the best part of ACIII.
