Really lovely open world, brilliant story, and lots to do. You could never feel bored of all there is to do in the world, from useful hunting minigames to naval contracts, there is also a large array of upgrades to Edward protaganist and his ship the Jackdaw.The characters in the story really make the game though, and by mid way through the, extencive story I became very attached to the characters, causing the game to have real depth.Hope this review was helpfulF0RCE
