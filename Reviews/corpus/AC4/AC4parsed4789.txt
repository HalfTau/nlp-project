DIS GAME IS SO GOOD! The ship combat is amazing, the stealth is fantastic, great parcour and combat, and for the very first time in an Assasins Creed game, guns are useful. Some minor gripes I have though is that at times the ship controls can fell a little unresponcive, and at times unclear, but thats about it. 93.4/100
