Incredible game that I cant recommend because at the moment it suffers from one of the worst bugs I can think of a saving bug.The first time I played this game I played it for 4 hours straight. Unfortunately, when I went back to play it I discovered that it had not saved my progress since the first half hour. I went straight to the forums and found that the UPLAY Cloud Saving feature did not work correctly. At the advice of several people I turned off the Cloud Save Synchronization and backed up my saves after every session. The next day I played for several sessions without issues.Then today, it happened again. I played for 3 hours in which I did many challenges and hunted collectibles and it STOPPED SAVING AFTER AN HOUR EVEN THOUGH THE SAVING SYMBOL INGAME SAID IT WAS SAVED!!Stay away from this game until they fix this!!
