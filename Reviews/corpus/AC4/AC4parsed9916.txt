Ive played every single assassins creed, the series has been pretty similar since ac2. each game improved slightly but they werent massive leaps like the gap between ac1 and ac2. Then ac3 came up, technologically it was fantastic but for me the setting, characters and story fell very short. That said, if ac3 didnt happen then ac4 would have been looked at just as beautifully as the improvements between 1 and 2 were. The story, characters, weapons and main character were interesting and enjoyable. historical characters that show up dont seem as shoehorned in as they did in ac3, they were all multifaceted, interesting characters. The naval combat is definitely a highlight, the water physics were absolutely beautiful, I was constantly amazed at how good it looked. If you liked ac1 or ac2 or simply just want to jump into the series then ac4 would be a fantastic game for you to play. I definitely suggest it.
