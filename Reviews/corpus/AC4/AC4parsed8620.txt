Who said you couldnt teach an old dog new tricks?PROS Far cry from AC3 and Revelations. The pirate take on the game is as refreshing as it is awesome. Large open world  taking down enemy ships doesnt get old. 21 hours worth of gameplay, more if you want 100 completion.CONS Too many tail the target missions. Crappy PC port  a Ubisoft standard. Forced ending.
