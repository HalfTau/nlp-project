Best damn pirate simulator on the market.  As a precompletion review, Im giving this a thumbs up while its on the winter sale, Im that impressed. Time will tell if its as irritating as the other AC games I have.35hrs to beat the main story, with minimal exploration.  Plenty of side missions and treasure left to find too, for those who are into it.  Still has the anoyying runningandgrabanythinginyourway type of gameplay but thatscreed for ya.
