one of the best games of this generation and the best pirate game of all time.but a god awful pc port. it runs like shi. i have a gtx 970 and cant run this at 60 fps on medium. just get the console version if you can or play with everything on low.also tip if you enter the game, press Windows  L then unlock your screen it will run better for some reason
