Purchased the game and could not get it load. Game would act as if it were going to load and then screen would go black. Computer would become unresponsive. I would have to hard reset my pc to get it to go back to where I could do anything on it. Not sure if this is a common issue with the game or not. Requested a refund. Will not be buying anymore Assassins Creed titles for pc via steam.
