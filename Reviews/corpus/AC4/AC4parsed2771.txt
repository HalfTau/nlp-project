This game is the most piraty pirate game to have ever swashbukled the Spanish Main. Ive never had so much fun robbing people blind on land or sea. wonderful attention to detail when making the game. Good storyline where you gradually watch the main character go from a self centered Ahole to a respectable man. Lovable side characters that will make you laugh.On the downside The modern era portions of the game felt a little sloppy andme off half the time. Im convinced they were meant to. Sure, they tied into Kenways storyline, but it still felt like it was a loose tie. I think if they had Kenways decendant LEARNING Kenways techniques from spending so much time in the Animus and then using them in modern era portions it would have added another level of depth on the mentality aspect of the Anumis project, a factor i would have loved to see. THAT SAID. I still like the way the game played out. Seeing old faces in modern era threw me for a loop. P.S. The ending was perfect.
