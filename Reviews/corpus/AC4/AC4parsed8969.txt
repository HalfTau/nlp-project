I highly recommend this game. Granted, I am a big fan of the series, but after AC III Ubisoft needed a solid game to rebound with and this is all that and more. Beautiful locales, interesting characters and storyline, and an actual LIKEABLE protagonist are all major points in this games favor. 75 hours in and I still cant stop playing. Grab it if youre a fan of Assassins Creed or want to raid the high seas.
