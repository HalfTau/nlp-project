Amazing pirate simulator, but not really in the same vein as the Altair and Ezio type assassins. Shanties are really the only collectible I felt driven to collect probably my favorite detail in the game. Also very good at provoking a murderous rage in my heart when I find myself walking around abstergo with an Ipad for a meaningless story. Hey Ubisoft, I bought this game to avoid the office, not simulate it...ya dks. Also, please seperate running and parkour into two different buttons. K thx bye.10/10 Would call Abstergo boss a ct again while waiting to pirate harder
