This is one of my, if not my favorite, AC games made. The ships and battling are fun, the story is phenominal, and Edward is a very entertaining person. The only part I dont like about it is the stalking/eavesdrop missions, but thats in all AC games. I love the historical parts of Blackbeard and the other pirates. I highly recommend this game, and if you are just starting this series, this is a good place to start if you dont mind a few spoilers about the previous game.
