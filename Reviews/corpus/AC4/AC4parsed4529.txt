Im gonna keep this one short. Assassins Creed IV is imo better then Assassins Creed III. The sailing improved and the story is decent. Combat is still kinda the same. Otherwise you get a solid Assassins Creed game with lots of killing, capturing and climbing. If you like the series you gotta play it otherwise you might also consider giving it a try.8.5/10
