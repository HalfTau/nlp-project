This game is amazing compared to other Assassins Creed games lately! Much better than3 and much more appealing. The water looks marvelous as does the whole game and the combat is the same ol so if you like their combat you like it. The sailing is what really makes this game brilliant, sailing around with your crew and singing shanties while kicking booty PIRATE PUNS and taking names is amazingly satisfying.
