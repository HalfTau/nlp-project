Do what you want cause a pirate is free, you are a pirate!This game is absolutely amazing, and is more of a pirate adventure than an assassins creed game, which is kinda what I was hoping for, and seeing as there arent too many great pirate games coming out at the moment, its good to have this one.The combat is a bit easy, but there are some challenges to be had in the ship combat. The writing is excellent the game is fun. It does seem to be locked at about 30 fps or so and it does use uPlay, but not even those aspects could ruin the fun.The game offers plenty of content and is worth your money. It was everything I hoped for and more. I havent had this much fun with a game in a long time.
