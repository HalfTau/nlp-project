Ubisoft did well developing this game. One of the more playable pirate games out there, and there is some story about assassins, I think. The story about Edward was what it should be, killing people, destroying ships. Hell, if you dont want to fight a stationed  Man o War, you can swim over to it, kill all the crew, go back to your ship, ram it, and its yours. The story about Lucy, Shawn, and the person you play as outside of the animus, that has no name or any defining traits, is a little dull. Which as I couldnt wait to get back into the animus and shoot some more ships after hacking into a thing because reasons. The audio logs and videos you get from hacking Along with emails, poasters, ect. which I didnt read are nice little bits about the characters that develop them more and make them seem more like a person. Something tells me not much money went into the story outside of the animus, but Ive grown accustomed to that detail, shown in all the previous games where you also do little to nothing outside of the animus. Long story short, the gameplay was good, the story wasnt.
