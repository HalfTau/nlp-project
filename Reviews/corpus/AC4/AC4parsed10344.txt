Assassins Creed always had a special place in my heart, having played each of them to date theres no doubt I was very hyped for AC4. Ubisoft last two Assassins Creed games has been worse than the previous games in the series so one could always hope Ubisoft wouldnt let me down a 3rd time.And trust me, Ubisoft didnt fail to deliver. In fact they delivered a masterpiece which I may have to say Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is the best game I ever had my hands on. It combines all the great things from the previous games into one game of refined epic awesomeness with stunning graphics and at least 48 hours of gameplay just to finish the main story.Im not sure what I should compare the game to cause theres nothing else out there which offers the same legendary experience apart from maybe the Zelda games and perhaps Legacy of Kain games.You dont want to miss out on Assassins Creed IV Black Flag!My score 10/10
