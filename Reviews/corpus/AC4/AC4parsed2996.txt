Good combat system that allows you to take on massive groups of enemies feeling like a boss, but if thats not your thing, then there is also the stealth system that also makes you feel like a boss. When your done fighting you can climb and jump your way through civilization all the way to your ship, then you can hunt animals on islands hunt whales on a boat and gain treasure maps. Its all super fun
