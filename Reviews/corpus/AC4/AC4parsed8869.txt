MUST HAVE! 10/10 The storyline is fantastic, you get very attached with the characters and the events that unfold, The game is very detailed in every way and looks fabulous. If your a person who likes to 100 games this is the game for you. The campaign along with the things you do roughly add to only 5060 percent of the game and the other percent is leveling up your character and your navy, collecting all the animus fragments, chest and hidden treasures, The game overall is a must have, the ammount of things to do are endless.
