Im not going to lie, I had some issues getting this running at a stable 60fps. I had to change one setting to low, when I exceed the ultra requirements which is annoying but the game looks essentially the same. Anyway, on with the gameplay. As a starting point in the AC series, it has certainly made me want more. The ship side of travel can be quite boring, and the ship combat does get repetitive, but the storyline and the handtohand combat is what stands out. Of course, this isnt an Arkham game, but the feeling when your controller vibrates when you shove a blade in some dudes heart, its pretty satisfying. So far Ive really enjoyed the gameplay and would reccomend it to anyway looking for a game to pick up in a sail. Hah.
