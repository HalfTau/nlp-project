Id not played an Assassins Creed game since briefly trying the awful PC port of Assassins Creed 2. This game was a breath of fresh air. The best, if not most repeated analogy for this game AC4 is a Pirate game with some incidental Assassination gameplay. The eavesdropping missions are still painfully boring, and the ridiculous stealth efficacy of bushes leaves me scratching my head. These are overshadowed by the fantastic ship gameplay.
