I love this game. If your computer can handle cranking up the graphics, it is god damn gorgeous sailing the high seas. The waves and weather, everything is done purposely, Im almost upset Im only 65 through the game because Ive been playing for so long and theres still so much to do. Its hard to describe just how much there is to do. You can decide between getting certain collectibles, doing sidequests, clearing out islands or just sailing around plundering any ships you come across because why not?
