After two hours I came to the terrifying realisation that this game is more boring than regular boredom. I couldnt touch the game for months, and when I did, it was EVEN MORE BORING. I literally spent three hours just following people in this piece ofgame. If youre more interested in the pirate part than stalking the hours away, avoid this because its not worth it. I regret 5.5 of those 5.6 hours.
