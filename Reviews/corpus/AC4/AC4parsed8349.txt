The most excellent Assassins Creed of them all.I enjoyed most of the games except III blew chunks, but this one is amazing. The naval aspect is extremely well done, and the remaining core has stripped all of the nonsense added over the previous iterations, leaving the most enjoyable parts of city based scenarios. Exploration of every small island revealed an amazing attention to detail the team had.Highly recommended if you were ever a fan of a single thing in all of the Assassins Creed legacy.
