Lets get one thing straight... Forget about this being Assassins Creed!, it has very little to do with assassins apart from the story.Ok, now thats forgotten, I present to you....THE SINGLE GREATEST PIRATE GAME EVAR!!! in a whale!Shanties, Naval warfare, Sword play, Harpooning sea critters and RUM! are just some of the aspects of this game. It has a huge game world, which is like 90 ocean... which is good. The waters are filled with vessels to be plundered, using an array of weapons at your disposal from ship based motars thats right, mortars to the pirates pride... a friggin broadside! Comprised of 23 cannons at max level, which can and will tear ships apart if they are foolish enough to be in your way.See a ship with cargo you like the look of, hunt that bad boy down and weaken that pathetic excuse of a ship, then board and pluder the ships cargo for your own!I cant think of any other game where youll be using phrases like, Oh, you havnt seen me yet.... Let me just ram you from behind and then prepare to be boarded! Did I mention you can get a ram for your ship, to you know, ram other ships.Yargh!!
