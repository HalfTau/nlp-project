I decided to bought this game in summer sale, because I really likes this game.Bought this game when in summer sale Deluxe Edition, Straight to the point8/10Pro This could be not keeping how the original AC series plays, but I really likes this game because you can explore the whole world whit ship go to ship or jump out with NO LOADING SCREENS! Except transition between some islands harbour and open sea Easy to control Open world Land and sea missions Legend ship challenge seriously, this is so hard for the first time, you need to upgrade your ship several times to make your ships defense better  unique costumes challenging missions and fun side missions You need more ingame money? dont worry, you can find treasures on the whole world.Cons This is 2013 game, I have 2015 laptop with Nvidia G930M, 2GB RAM, i3 1.7 GHz. this is a midlow laptop. But in medium settings, I always get no more 50 fps in Medium/Normal settings. While my other games 20132014 games can get average 5075 fps while playing Medium. Well I though this game didnt really optimized in graphics. To keep deluxe editions content unlocked, I need to online for a short time each time I run this game Savegame cloud sync system disabled by ubisoft but you still can sync your achievements to get Uplay points This is a critical point Imao static missions model at some points Stalking, evasdrop, stalking, and again....... Uplay system still needs to be optimized
