This game i brought quiet a while ago and ive still been trying to make this game work but no luck. So that is why i dont recommend this game but if you still want to purchase it i suggest you buy it on disc NOT on uplay or steam even though it plays through uplay.So i got the game finally got the game working but i still dont recommend this game because it is the type of game you play 50 hours and you think its the best game ever then never go back. But the first few hours of the game are pretty fun.
