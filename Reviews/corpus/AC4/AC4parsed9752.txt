I highly recommend this game to any fan/non fan of the series, I have yet to finish the story and I wont include any spoilers. All in all this is a well rounded game with excellent game play and stunning visuals. Id like to shout out to anyone who may have dreamt of being a pirate, surfing the high seas in search of loot and plunder is an experience in this game that is brought to life. I have spent so many hours just causing mayhem over the deep drink of the ocean and taking 200 screenshots of the beauty that just follows.Aside from all the praise, just as any open world platformer/parkour type of game it has its downs in mobility. Where running and climbing can be a challenge in direction and controls and the combat sometimes can be a bit to Iwin in the bushes type of game. Past all this the game is just beautiful and the story very much captivating! I give this game a 9/10, 10 for graphics/scenery/sound, 9 for mobility/combat/playability, 10 for hours spent out at sea.The beauty of it all!An evening sail.Avast ye me hearties!
