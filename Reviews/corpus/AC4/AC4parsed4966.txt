For me after AC 2 this is so far the perfect AC game, I already replayed it 3 times and would definetly play it again. The story line is as simple as perfekt. The goal of Edward is not the usual Assassin goals and tasks. The grafik, view is stunning and fascinating. The mood is perfekt, on the ship your sailors sing, in the cities there is pleasant background music and also the numerous sings at the baars since this game Ubisift couldnt recreate the same great AC in game experience. The side aktivities are also ok and I even loved to fulfill all of the absterego challenges.There is only one thing what I dont like too much Absterego cutscenes.Maybe one more negativ point I am sure a bunch of people wouldnt agree with me with this the Keways fleet ships and bank account are for forever  as you start a new game you will have your previous bank account and and all your fleet ships  you will miss the feeling beating the strongest ships to send them to your fleet and you dont need to have important decisions about your developments, since there is enough money for everything.
