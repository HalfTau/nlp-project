I was skeptical at first about buying this game again since I had previously played it on Xbox One when it was released. This game hasnt lost its amazement at all and is still every bit of fun that I remember. I highly recommend picking this up while it is on sale. It looks great and runs okay. The only downside I have seen is the FPS drops a little so I had to turn the settings down a bit, i.e. the shadows, antialiasing, particles, god rays off and motion blur off since I dont like the last two anyway. Everything else is set to max and I get drops to 4550ish FPS but 90 of the time it stays at 60FPS with vSync. I have a GTX 1080, i76700K, 16 GB RAM2133MHz Dual channel. I still highly encourage anyone that is on the fence about buying this to do it, for the price right now 8 you cant beat it.
