Released in November, 13, 2013, Assassins Creed Black Flag is an exceptional pirate game which is unfortunately limited by its convoluted lore. Black Flag demonstrate both the potential and woes of the franchise. Moreover, the game provides for exhilarating narratives, characters, music, and naval combat. On the other hand, it also includes underwhelming character combat, exhausting tailing missions, and dull Abstergo portions which remove the player from the core experience. The pc optimization is satisfactory and should run stably at high settings on any system that has at least an Intel core i3, gtx 750ti, and 4gbs of ram. The Nvidia Physx, however, is terribly implemented which performs poorly even with an Intel core i7 6700, 16gbs of ram, and a gtx 1070. Overall, the games exceptional characters, soundtrack, naval combat, and narrative overshadow its missteps therefore, it receives a 9/10.
