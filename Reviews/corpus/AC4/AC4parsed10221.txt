Lots and lots to do, all the missions are fun to do. Quite different from the previous games though, this time you get to be a pirate and do sea battles and plundering, the best part? You can take it close and personal by boarding enemys ship after you damaged them enough. Sea creatures hunting is also very unique, you dont simple fish them up, you get to harpoon them. The graphics are gorgeous as well. However, the ending of the story isnt satisfying, quite a lot of loose ends.
