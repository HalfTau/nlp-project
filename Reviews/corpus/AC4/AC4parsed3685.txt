Ive been wanting this game for years, and now that i got it on the PC, even with being on a quad core terrabyte pc and capable of running it, even on low settings am lagging to hell and back and find it so difficult to engage in fights.When you say low settings its looks like ultra settings and cant do nothing more about it, guess i will have to wait even longer to play it  as a pc upgrade wont be for a long time yet so disappointed I loved the assassins creed series on the xbox and the other ones i have on pc and no issues, this one . . well, shelved to gather dust until i get a major upgrade . . i can live in hope
