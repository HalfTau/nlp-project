Game is incredibly slow, thanks to the pirate thingy that you will spend unbelievable amount of time with. After an early enjoyment of pirating and controlling your ship, it wears off and gets pretty boring. The only time the game become enjoyable by then is when you are off your ship doing normal Assassin Creeds stuff. So much for a pirate experience
