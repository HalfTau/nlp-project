Assassins Creed Four Black FlagIts a great gameThe graphics are in a good league, but still, and as I have seen in AC3, the graphics tend to do glitches, and I find that very annoying. Still the graphics are execelent, Im looking forward to the future, where there might be no glitches.The Gameplay was good I completed it on 7 days, and I must say I liked it. Though it could had been awesome if multiple ships were at you hand, so you could freely go around in a bigger ship than the JackdawI would had wished that there were a bit more of Black Beard
