This is the best pirate game of all time, at least the best that I have ever played. The game is different a little bit than the normal Assassins Creed games, but still very good! You can upgrade your ship and attack other ships to pirate them or make them join you! Although once you attack a ship, there is about three different ways to win but afterwards it becomes very repetitive. Still, I quite enjoyed pirating other ships. The game play is great and fluid. It still has the view points etc. as normal Ubisoft games. This is my favorite Assassins Creed game and well worth every cent!
