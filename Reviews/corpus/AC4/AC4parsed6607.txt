Im a grown man and this game actually made me cry at the ending sequence and song!Black Flag will take you on a roller coaster of emotions. It actually inspired me to go to Caribbeans next years and visit all of the islands you get to see in the game. I was having a lot of trouble in my personal life, job etc. at the time and playing Black Flag actually made me remember how amazing and beautiful this world can be, but you just need to follow your own dreams and be in the right places with the right people!11/10 Best game I have ever played, and I have played a lot of games in the last 20 years!
