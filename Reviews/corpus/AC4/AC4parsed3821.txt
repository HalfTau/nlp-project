The best Assassins Creed game ever. Pirates are often associated with freedom and freedom is what you have in this game. This not a restrictive storyline AC game, this has an enourmas open map and you are free to pillage and plunder as you see fit. Though the story is phenominal, it is highly emotional and I feel more connected to these characters than any other AC game. This game makes you feel. This game tears your heart out and makes you long to be a pirate. I have played this game over and over and it is still amazing. Would recommend this game to anyone. I have already made my girlfriend play this by holding myhostage...or at least I will when I get a girlfriend.
