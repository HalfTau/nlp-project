Honestly one of the best AC games yet.The naval combat is beautifully done, with bombs and cannons and different enemy ships. The story line is intricate and well done, and there are enough that youre not finished before youve started.Kenway is a very interesting character, with brief glimpses into his past throughout the game, and his allies, such as Blackbeard, add humor into the game.The sea shanties are a joy  I like them enough that Ive gotten them all on my phone, and I often sing along to a few of my favorites.As you can see from my game time, I love it. And Im only about half way through with the game, because there is just so much extra missions and gameplay.Its seriously one of the best AC out there, in my opinion.
