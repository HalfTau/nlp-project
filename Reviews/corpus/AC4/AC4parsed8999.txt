Theres so much that I could say about this game, but in short...1. The game is sopretty2. You get to play as a really jackedup assassin,3. The level of freedom in this game compared to other franchises are amazingly damn high!4. Be a pirate and plunder everything!But then again, there are bad stuff about it like not being able to have many many MANY throwing knives like the other games, the dagger is gone forever, the slight bugs on the free running, and of course, no more grenades forever T.TBut still, good game. Must try!
