This is my 3rd game from AC series. And I must that I feel like Im playing Brotherhood  drifferent story and world but this is still the same game. Plus story missions are so boring and annoying for me. Follow, follow, find, kill, follow, go there, follow and so on.My gameplay in this game  finnish main sotry as fast as can and enjoy to be a pirate.
