I bought this game upon its release despite having never played any of the previous games in the franchise because, well, to put it plainly... pirates.  I found the game to be quite excellent to a point, and that point is a precise point in the story arc itself, an unskippable mission where you have to follow 2 NPCs without getting too close or too far away.  After failing that mission a handful of times I set the game aside and never returned.  Ive always meant to give it another go, yet when I think of that mission all desire fades away.Im going to recommend this game because, well, to put it plainly... pirates.  Also I have the feeling that if I were to ever one day get past that poorly designed mission, Im sure I would thuroughly enjoy the rest of the game.
