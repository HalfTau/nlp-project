Assassins Creed 4 black flag, do i reccomend it? yes, why? well read onAssassins creed black flag continues the series, personally im not too much of an assassins creed fan, the combat is cool but not that special imho and i dont like 3d person only, the climbing of ships and buildings is cool and the entire stealth aspect i like alot, it is a bit lacking in the terms of not being able to manually crouch.What makes me like the game though is the ship combat. it is the only game in recent times that takes age of sail ship combat and only one ever in that way as far as i am aware of, and it might sound weird but that is the entire reason why i bought this.if you allready like assassins creed series this is reccomended, if you dont but like ship combat, i reccomend this, if you like neither just dont bother, i dont know why you are reading this if the last thing is the case.
