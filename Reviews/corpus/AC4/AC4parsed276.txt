UPlay is required for this game. Ive been through this dance before with this kind of garbage DRM not being able to log in, having my saves wiped, logging in every ing time I want to play the game, etc, and Im done supporting companies that do this.I dont know why Ubisoft punishes people who purchase their games, but dont worry, Ubisoft, the lesson has been learned! I will never purchase another Ubisoft game as long as I live, not even if they remove DRM from every future game and vow to never do it again. Im done with this company. I know that doesnt mean a damn thing to them or to anyone else, but how I spend my money means something to me, and they will never see another cent of it.
