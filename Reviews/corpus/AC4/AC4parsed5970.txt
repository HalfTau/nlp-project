Very beautifully done and well thought out! This game is actually extremely hard personal point of view however, it present the challenge necessary to keep one interested. I recommend this game to anyone who loves a challenge but also the gorgeous eye candy to follow! The story line is consistent and can keep the play on the edge of their seat. If you loved the rest of the series, youll love Black Flag as well as the others to follow.
