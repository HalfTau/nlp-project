My review used to be positive but now due to irritating crashes and unpredictable stutters, I simply cannot recommend buying this game. I love the assassins creed franchise and black flag was my favorite but for some obnoxious reason the game recently feels endorsed to exploit in these various crashes which mainly occur while sailing. Everything else is great. How can my rig possibly lag on a 2013 game i7 4670k 3.4ghz, 8GB DDR3 RAM, GTX 780 3GB
