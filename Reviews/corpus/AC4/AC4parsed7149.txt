Being only the second game outside of the standard AC pack 2, Brotherhood, and Revelations, I originally thought that this would be Ubisoft playing it safe and just fixing problems from AC3 and regaining some reputation for the series. I was so wrong. The writing, voice acting, cinematics, and characters were so lifelike, believable, and just real. Easygoing conversion flowed and even the smallest movements were realistc. The script was also amazing, it was the first time that a game made me laugh with what was going on both in the cinematics and ingame, bringing me to gameplay. Amazing gameplay, really refined and redesigned in some places. Stealth has been expanded and now there are many more places to hide. Eagle vision has also recieved a new update. Naval combat is in a league of its own. Copmlex, but easy to use, there are limitless oppurtunities and the constant loot needed keeps you taking over ships. Every ship behaves differently and boarding are chaotic and each is a little different. With the loot you gain you upgrade your ship, and extremely needed thing. Without upgrading, good luck. The system forces you to put time into farming materials and it is extremely satisfactory getting a hard to get upgrade. Also, stores now have been update. For the first time in a long time, there were moments were i needed to upgrade a sword or pistol to get through a hard part. Weapons are diverse and you need all you have, even those smoke bombs no one used. Outside of the animus, the story was actually entertaining and I found myself leaving the simulation many times to hack some computers. The Edward storyline was amazing, relentless, emotional, and filled with twists. An extremely vast, polished, and beautiful game, AC4 is a huge push for the series.9/10
