Having played all previous AC titles, have to say, this is one of the best Ive played. The sheer scale of the world is awesome, from cities, to jungles, to underwater exploration, to epic naval battles on a massive open sea, all while keeping impressive graphics!The combat and gameplay tends to get a bit repetitive after a while, its pretty much same old Assassins Creed there with not many differences. However, the story, setting, characters and the amount of stuff to do makes it very worthwhile for anyone who has enjoyed AC in the past. If you havent played a previous AC game before, or didnt bother about any of the recent titles as you didnt feel they offered anything new, then you definitely want to pick this up.And who doesnt love pirates?
