After playing the game for few days, I can say the game is really good. Mostly...The world is huge and full of events, different activities like assassinations, templar hunting or general combat mix with trading, treasure hunts, animal hunting and managing your own trade fleet. The graphics is pretty and detailed, the combat system is pretty much identical as in Assassins Creed 3  and I like that.Now the bad parts Uplay  one of the worst inventions in history of gaming. Artificial social network that causes only problems. I wont go on with the ranting about uplay, suffice to say I genuinely hate it. Glitches  sometimes the ships vanish. I was trying to capture a Galleon which... Dissapeared leaving only cannons and some decorations hanging in the air and few people floating in the water. Had to reload and  of course  lost the perfect score I got by avoiding combat everywhere. Your ship sometimes vanishes leaving bottomless hole in the ocean. Looks funny, but gets quite annoying when you see it nth time. MOUSE ACCELERATION! this is horrible. I really dont know why so many games come with this  and even worse  you cant disable it at all. This is the worst thing in the entire game that borders a game breaking bug for me. You want to look around quickly during naval combat? Youre out of luck. You want to look around while looking for cover quickly? Too bad. You simply want to admire the white whale event? Why dont you stare at the sail of your own ship while the wale goes away. The list goes on.The bright side  aside from the mouse acceleration and occasional graphical glitches, the game is great.
