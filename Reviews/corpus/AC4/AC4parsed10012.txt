AC4BF is absolutely stunning. It runs well, is an amazingly unique experience, has a great story, phenomonal graphics, and is very well polished. The naval combat is a fresh addition and the ambiance is incredible. This game rivals AC2 in terms of enjoyability  something I thought the franchise would never be able to accomplish. This game is a musthave.
