This game is amazing. You can spend many hours trying to find resources for upgrading the Jackdaw, and a lot of hours trying to find all of the collectibles. The story is good aswell. Its not really an assassins creed for reasons Im not going to mention because of spoilers, but still it has a good tempo to it. The missions on land are not that varied however, as most of the missions play in the open water. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who likes assassins creed games. and even if youre new to the series, its a great game to get into it.
