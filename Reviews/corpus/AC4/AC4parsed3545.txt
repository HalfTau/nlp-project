Its more of a pirate game than an assassin game, but its a damn good pirate game. If you have an itch for pirating, then this will definitely hit the spot. Gameplay is good, and varied.It falls a bit short story wise. It tries to make you feel connected to certain characters where no real relationships were ever built.It was just really bad writing it was beyond disappointing. It felt like some company bigwig stepped in during development, and said weve spent enough on this, gameplay is good, lets cut the writers even though the story isnt fully fleshed out, and tie the rest of the  story up with whatever our janitor can concoct. It has the bones of a good story, but never gets there.Dont be afriad of all the Uplay gripes. Yes you have to register the game and dlc with Uplay in order to play it, but its easy.
