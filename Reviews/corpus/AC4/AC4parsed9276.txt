8.5/10A step up from Assassins Creed 3.Combat feels a bit sluggish perhaps still adapting with the AC3 combat style which this game carried forward fromMultiplayer finally caught my interest with the addition of the Wolfpack gameplay although some players really need to learn how to synckillWithout giving too much away about the main storyline which was... somewhat... lackluster, especially towards the end making me actually prefer AC3s final sequence compared to this game
