This is the first AC game Ive played so I cant compare it to the other yet, but what I can tell you is Ive played a lot of good games in my life and this game quickly rised up to being in my top 3 favorite games of all time. The ship mechanics are pretty good and the actual use of said ship isnt just a burden, it is actually fun. As for the rest of the game, the story is engaging, The controls are good once you get used to them, the gralhics arnt exactly REALISTIC but they do still look standard for AC games, and I would recommend using a computer designed to run games like this and if you dont have one, then get a higher voltage charger, I dont care what voltage charger you have, unless you for some reason WANT to run the game at 2 frames per second, get a better one. Upgrades arent irrelevant, and in general, this is just a really good game and I would HIGHLY recommend it.
