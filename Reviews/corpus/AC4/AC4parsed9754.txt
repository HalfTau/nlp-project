A fantastic new chapter in the Assassins Creed series. If you enjoyed all the previous one which includes the contrived modernday play youll have as much, if not more, fun with this incarnation.The naval combat adds a completely new dimension to the openworld gameplay. There are loads of sidemissions, activities and collectibled to keep you playing well beyond the ending of the game. The writing is the best of the series, with interesting characters, fantastic voiceacting and great music. Edward is, in my opinion, the most interesting protagonist of the series.The multiplayer is largely the same and as captivating as before.Well worth the price of admission.
