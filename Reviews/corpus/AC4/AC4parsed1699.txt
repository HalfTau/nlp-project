I wanted to like this, but its so boring I cant keep myself playing it.Pros graphics, pretty at times pirate theme you get a shipCons everything else stealth is a joke, there is no crouch button and main character is rather context unaware combat is a joke, Batman QTE combat is 100x better AI is a joke, in combat everyone is standing in circle waiting for their turn to get killed main protagonist is a joke, so cocky and unlikable walking is no joke walking mission everywhere follow x, go to x, dont loose sight of x, ... dull open world hunting, skining, collecting, ... booooring story, if its good later so be it, but first 3 hours was like ... snooze ... music, is there some ? FPS dropsMaybe it was good in 2013, but by today standards its mediocre at best.4/10
