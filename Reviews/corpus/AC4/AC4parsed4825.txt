Ive only played about 2 hours of this game and Im liking it! After a friend recommendation I had to try it out. The controls are a bit wonky and I took a while to get used to it but it turned out fine after I got to the first major area of the game. The detail of this game is just stunning to look at with realistic graphics. I really recommend this game!
