This is me second favorite Assassins Creed game, and the reason for it is because is the less Assassins game in the franchise. Basically, I identified myself with Edward, the MC he doesnt give a s about the Order  hes not even an Assassin, simply stole the robe from a dead one. Hes simply following the footsteps in an attempt to find treasure. I identify myself with him because when this game was launched I was sick of the same old Ubisoft story, so his posture was a breath of fresh air.What I enjoyed most was NOT doing any Assassin stuf plunder ships, upgrading mine and strengthening my armada  this is the best pirate simulator ever.
