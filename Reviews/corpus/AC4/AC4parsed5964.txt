While the gameplay can be repetitite, you have several ways to go about doing the tasks, and several different weapons and tactics to use against your enemies.But the really highlight of the game for me has been the naval battles, upgrading your ship, and taking on bigger and stronger adversaries. This game is so far, the best in the Assassins Creed series for me.
