Ive owned the game for about 4 days now and can i tell you the time that I dont spent with work and gaming with my buddies I have spent playing this game. This game is probably one of the best assassins creed games i have played. I could spend hours just fighting high level ships and working on expanding my fleet. I recommend this game to anyone who loves freeroam games and taking on 20 people at once in hand to hand combat or just anyone who loves pirates. 1000000 out of 10 would recommend.
