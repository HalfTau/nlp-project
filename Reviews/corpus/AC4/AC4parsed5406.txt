Pros Naval combat Ships in general Graphics are alright Voice actorsCons Optimization. The performance is outright horrible. The game runs horrible on my computer, and I can damn near max GTA V in 1080p. Incredibly bad controls. Combat. One of the worst combat systems Ive seen. Almost worse than Skyrim. UPlayDo you like naval combat or pirating? Give it a try. Otherwise, dont bother.6/10.
