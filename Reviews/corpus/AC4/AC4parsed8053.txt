An excellent addition to the Assassins Creed series. In Black Flag you take on the role of Edward Kenway, grandfather of Assasins Creed 3s protagonist Connor and plunderer of the West Indies. The irl parts of the singleplayer game are brief but slightly entertaining and continues the modern world storyline youre a faceless, nameless and silent Abstergo employee giving you something else to do once youve explored the Caribbean. In the role Endward, you get to sail the high seas with your faithful ship The Jackdaw veteran crew, and of course your First Mate/Quartermaster Adwal star of the Freedom Cry DLC. You visit many realworld locations, including but not limited to Havana Kingston NassauJust to name a few. As for the naval combat, you can fight and plunder British, French and Spanish ships that cross your path. You can board their ship and take its cargo along with some crew members, and even salvage the ship to repair your own. Definitely one of the best Assassins Creed games to date. Cant wait to see what else they have in store! 9/10
