i wish i could give a complete review of this title, but unfortunately to start it apparently requires my xbox controller to play because it refuses to recognize my mouse input, the menus constantly go to the top option and fight me when i try to use them, and the camera flickers back and forth between two seperate views when i try to run or do anything, a total waste of money dont buy
