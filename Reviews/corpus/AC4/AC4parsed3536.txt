Horrible framerate 10 fps  and my PC is 6 month old, able to run Skyrim with Ultra settings on 25601440.Turning off shadows, vsync is not helping sufficiently...I am not famished of the game genre to the point where I would do whatever s necessary to make it work at an acceptable 30 fps framerate... I will just keep Ezios adventures as a fond memory and let it go...
