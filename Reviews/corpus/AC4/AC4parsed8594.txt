This one was a bit upsetting in that it does everything the previous games do right, and has all the same failings.The sailing portions are really the best parts, but they dont justify a 60 or 40 price tag. In the other areas, youve got the same situation combat is enjoyable and smooth, you feel like the grandmaster at work when slaughtering through villages, and there is absolutely no challenge. If you have a mind to you can massacre everyone in game with hardly a thought, and there really isnt much reason to anyway. Outside of the structured missions theres very little to do on the ground, and some of those missions can be fairly dull as well, such as the everpresent tailing missions, an unfortune standby for the series. Its got some good spectacle to it, but Im not really happy at having such an expensive paperweight just sitting in my library.
