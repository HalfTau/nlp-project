Why Im not impressed? !AC3 was broken as hell It was an ok story though, but at least the graphics was optimized.Ive finished AC3 and start up AC4, seems to be a good game... seems, because the game crashes all the time, and even though I have a PC more than twice as better than the recommended by UBIsoft, the game runs poorly.It is awfully optimized, it runs 23fps in some areas 1080p with EVGA GTX980 / Im able to run Witcher 3 on max settings 1080p56 FPS on everything on medium except physx when the game doesnt crash.UBIsoft has good franchises, but the support is the crappiest of the big companies and the games its being awfully optimized lately not just for the graphics, but for controls either.I mean it is really needed to reduce every action to just one button? Cmon...
