Assassins Creed IV Black Flag Around 7080 hours of gameplay for completionists in singleplayer. Huge amount of exploration. You can discover new islands with assassination activities and there are naval contracts to participate in, along with animus fragments and manuscripts to collect. You can also search for chests filled with gold and other items like sea shanties, which provide new songs for your crew to sing. Assassins Creed IV Black Flag gives you very good reasons to go chest looting and ship boarding, because you need a lot of resources to upgrade your pirate vessel. You never feel like your efforts are wasted, whatever you choose to do has some benefit. Interesting storyline focusing on pirating in the Caribbean during the early 1700s. You play as Edward Kenway, a man from England seeking his fortune. Likeable characters that add some nice authenticity to the game. Great graphics. The BEST interface of the games so far  easy to access pistols, smoke bombs and blow darts. Small minimap on the main screen that makes exploration a lot easier and straightforward. Much appreciated! While the plotline is fun and distinctly different from the previous games, it is less focused on the overall picture of the Assassins versus Templars and more focused on Edwards personal journey for wealth. In this respect it could have been improved. Combat animations are not as smooth as Assassins Creed 3 and lack the variety. Theres not as many weapons either, only swords of varying types can be equipped.Overall Score 9/10Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is an amazing game. Extremely enjoyable, plenty of hours to sink your teeth into. Well worth it on sale.
