Good game, bad AC.Pros PiratesCons Tearing one day with vsync on Tearing another day with vsync off Tearing another day again with vsync on and off Some fps drops for no reason Bugged missions Awful gameplay from AC3It worked better on Ps3...I was impatient to do it again on PC but I wont finish it because vsync is broken...
