Black Flag reinvents the Assassins Creed franchise, with a larger emphasis on Naval Combat and customization than assassinations. The Assassins, while an intergral part of the story, are not even the good guys for the first quarter of the game, making it a very interesting introduction for people like me who have skipped every game since ACII. Graphically stunning, and with a unique multiplayer system unrivalled by any other, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is a good choice for those with a lot of money who want a good way to waste 60 hours of their life.
