After some time spent in the game Ive came to the point that I think I can have a proper opinion of it. Black Flag is a very enjoyable game, the venture into pirating serves the franchise well and serves up on of the best Assasins Creed games for a long time. The game is, however, flawed, not deeply, but enough to be a annoyance at times.ProsThe world is beautiful in both visuals and sounds.The freedom, though limited early on, is quite impressive.Sea battles are exciting and sailing itself can be quite enjoyable and even relaxing as your crew sing a sea shanty.Submersive as the sea, easy to clock hours into the game without realising it.Characters and story are interesting enough to hold your attention.ConsAlmost every aspect of the game is buggy in one way or another, this can range from silly and funny to infuriatingly annoying. A few Ive run into are excutions not, err, executing properly, enemies spawning right next to you when trying to be stealthy and your character leaping to his death when trying to get him to simply drop down one ledge.Bogged down from time to time with the real life story. Character out of the memories is infuriatingly stupid. Trust me, youll understand when the game first drags you out of the pirating and into the officeControls can be finicky or not too well explained at times.Despite its flaws, Black Flag still comes off as well made though missing that slight bit of polish that could have turned this into a truly great game.Assassins Creed Black Flag score  84/100
