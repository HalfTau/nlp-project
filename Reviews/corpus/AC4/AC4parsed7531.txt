This game is awesome. I have played all the previous main Assassins Creed games and I really enjoy this one. It is similar to the others, but they have done enough things in this one to make it feel like a really fresh game. If you liked the others, I was a little hesitant about being on the ship a lot due to not being too fond of being on a ship in the old ones, but they did a great job with the ship game play on this game. I would definitely get this game.
