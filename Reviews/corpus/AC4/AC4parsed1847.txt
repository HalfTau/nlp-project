Following the normal Ubisoft trend, this game, which ran just fine when I first bought it a year ago, is now suffering from a mysterious bug that has apparently been plaguing it since the original launch, and Ubisoft has done absolutely nothing to fix it. The game if you can get it to work is fun, but Ubisoft ranks up there with Comcast, EA, and Games Workshop as some of the worst and most anticonsumer companies on the planet. Die in a fire Ubisoft, and let a proper developer buy the rights to your IP.
