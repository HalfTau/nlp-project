This game, wow, the game play is astounding!!!!  Now I will say that the story in my opion really dragged at times, along with the fact that Kenway will run stright up a wall 10 times and do nothing and on the 11th, he grabs exactly what hes suppose to.  The naval combat and just sailing in general is absulutely wild!!!!!  Everyone must play, you dont need to beat it, just sail the high seas and be a bloody pirate!!!!!!
