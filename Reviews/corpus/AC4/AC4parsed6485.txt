Great game, full of awesome pirating goodnessSingle player was good and is about the same length of AC2 instead of the shorter AC Brotherhood and Revelations.Majority of the game is based at sea but it is much better than in AC3The multiplayer is dead now, no one playing which is kind of a shame, it looks pretty cool
