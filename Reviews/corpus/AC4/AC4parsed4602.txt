This game is great overall. A really fun experience from the moment you get your own ship. you can pillage and roam the seas as a pirate freely until Uplay erases all your data. This happened to me like ten minutes in and I blamed my computer, but then it happened with a 30 hour savegame and has ruined this game for me now... as an addition it took me like 20 mins to start this game up, as when you launch it from steam it opens Uplay and when you launch it from Uplay it opens steam again.... overall a great experience while it lasted. FIX UPLAY! !
