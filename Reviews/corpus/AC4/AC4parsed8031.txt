Definitely one of the best AC games, next to II and Brotherhood. The land missions are very stealth focused, the formerly abominable eavesdropping missions have been polished, and the story is probably one of the best of any of the games. Kenway is the first AC character Ive actually cared about. And previously, when the out of animus missions have been a boring, the ones here are nice and short, and simply make you interested.
