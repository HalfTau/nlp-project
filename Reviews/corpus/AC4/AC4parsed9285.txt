Pretty exciting game! Admittedly 3 was a recent low point in the Assassins Creed games, and 4 borrows a lot from it but honestly I think its returning to the days of Brotherhood in terms of quality. The main aspect of this game is the naval combat feature pioneered in 3, and its been improved upon. This time youre a pirate and you can ravage and loot any ship you come across. Youre confined to a square of ocean with islands scattered about but it has plenty of side missions on those islands. You can hunt wildlife but you dont have to and you can create a fleet of pirate ships to do naval missions for you similar to the assassin missions in the prior 3 games.The story may not be as engaging as the original base games and lets be honest, thats been a problem in the past few AC games but in terms of fun, this game is quite that. My one complaint, however, is that it tends to crash on me at least once every playing session and I cannot figure out why.
