I dont really like Assassins Creed games. I played about 1/3 of the first game before I got bored of the repetitive gameplay. The Creed games are not really my cup of tea. And thats why Ilike Black Flag its as much AC as it is Sid Meiers Pirates.The sailing part is really where the heart of the game is for me. Even while being repetitive as well it never gets old  seeing the soothing crystal blue waters of the Caribbean slide past while dolphins jump out of the water across the bow and your pirate crew starts singing another shanty that you collected yourself a few moments earlier. Or seeing the water wash over the deck as you avoid water spouts and freak waves while lightning sets the horizon alight. Or finally crippling an enemy frigate and getting near its starboard side, ready to board, al the while avoiding the mortar fire of a nearby fort.And the Assassination missions? Well, they are not all bad, although many are very easy, because protagonist Edward has superhuman fighting skills. And the climbing animations are always nice to look at. And you can fire guns and a blowpipe, which are satisfyingly effective.The game is big. Much stuff to do besides sinking ships harpooning whales, finding hiden treasures, diving to shipwrecks... I didnt really care for the story or the characters that much and the metastory in the present day is equally uninspiring, but I do like that the typical pirate clichs are avoided and the dialogs at least sound appropriate to the era. The lore you collect is often nice to read as well, so props to Ubisoft for having eye for details. Now if they would only pull the plug out of Uplay...Concluding Black Flag might not be the game AC fans waited for is Unity that game? but if you want a fine pirate adventure game, beautifully rendered with high production values, then get this, you wont be disappointed.
