This game is fine and stuff, but when it comes to system requirements its rubbish. I have a HP laptop with Intelcore i7, Nvidia GEFORCE 635M, 715 Gb free harddisk space and 12 Gb RAM  all better than the recommended requirements. However, the game is still lagging like hell, and even though I havent been playing for over an hour, I can still determine, that this game is unplayable. keep this in mind, when youre looking for great game. And also, the game is totally fine, but make sure you have excellent computer.Ive made a bad purchase, even though it was on Steam summer sale.
