AC4 was my introduction to the Assassins Creed series, and Im hooked. The singleplayer mode is fun, but the multiplayer mode is even better. You play through a story in singleplayer mode, which seems pretty standard to me, and you can really benefit from being sneaky and assassinlike instead of just running in and killing everyone, which is neat. In multiplayer, you get to choose characters, level up by playing various modes both coop and adversarial, and customize abilities and appearances. Wolfpack mode lets you play through a number of sequences with different objectives, all of which involve assassinations, of course, either solo or with friends or strangers online. The other modes are PvP, some in teams and some freeforall. You can choose the game mode that is most appealing to you, and get a bunch of friends to play with you or just wait for a lobby online. The levels system is a bit misleading, since being a high level or prestige doesnt necessarily mean youre good, it just means you play too much very true in my case...I find it a great deal of fun even though I am not good, but when youre in the middle of a game thats hardly the first thing on your mind anyway.Overall, its a pretty diverse game, with game modes to appeal to many different types of gamers. The graphics are gorgeous even with everything on super low, though some of the more graphic kills may be disturbing to more squeamish folk you can always tell when a kill animation will happen though, so you can look away if need be, and blood can be turned off. Its a good option for people who tend not to have fast reactions but still like action games, because there is some subtlety involved in the gameplay. I definitely recomend this to anyone remotely interested, particularly if you can find it discounted somewhere, as it is a bit pricey but worth it!.
