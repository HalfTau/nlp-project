AC Black Flag is an outstanding game that i have sunk hours into. Would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the AC series or anyone who loves old fasion pirate/naval combat.ProsGraphically gorgeous,Outstanding character development,Great story,Sastifying ground and naval combat,Immersive,Hours of gameplay,Rich in side quests and side activities.ConsOccasionaly crashes,Frame dips may occur randomly,Feels more like a pirate game than an Assasins Creed game.Note I have only played the single player mode of this game.
