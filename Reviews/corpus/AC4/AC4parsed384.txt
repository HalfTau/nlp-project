I bought this game long ago but I just had a chance to play in 2017. At first I didnt know it came out long ago and didnt think this game is outdated. Ended up playing it everyday. Theres just so much element in the game that you could spend a month playing it. Controlling the ship is so fun. you wouldnt believe how smooth they made this ship combat machanism simple but still very challenging. Overall I would say you should buy it if you like pirates and assasin creed gameplay.
