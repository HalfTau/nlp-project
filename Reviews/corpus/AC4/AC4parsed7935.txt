In my opinion the best AC to date. The ship combat is awesome. The inanimus story is typically AC quality very good. The cut scenes as excellent as ever with microfacial expressions and humour.....and Blackbeard!Im loving this game. Well worth the purchase, even if youre not an AC fan, but love pirate / sailing games. This is the best pirate game to date in my opinion.Its just a shame it isnt an MMO.
