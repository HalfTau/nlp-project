This is by far one of the best ACS . It is one of the only games who have done ship combat so well . Although it might be a let down because edward never truly becomes an assassin . Its still fun to be a pirate in assassin clothes . The visual experience and effects are what you except from a next gen game . Complete with a very cool multiplayer . My personal fav would be wolf pack mode where 4 of your friends get to play together and assassinate various targets as a team . Also the gameplay mechanics are still based of the acs before but they are more fluid . I still prefer the combat of ac3 to this but this is no worst if not better .Overall the story is a tad bit short to me but not at all bad . The world fells lively and colourful compared to ac3 and the freerunning could not be better . Overall I give it a 9.5/10 . There are some bugs and the current time line gameplay is pretty basic .
