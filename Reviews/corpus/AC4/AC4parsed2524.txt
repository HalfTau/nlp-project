Such a great game, probably my favourite Assassins Creed game! So much fun, on one hand you have your bog standard Assassins Creed style game play, then on the other hand youve got a pirate game that lets you build up your ship and sail about the seas just blowing the crap out of everything that moves.Got this on sale as well so it was a complete bargain!
