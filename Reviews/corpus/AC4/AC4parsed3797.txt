If you have a strong gpu, you gonna need D3DOverrider to boost up your FPS from 30 lock to 60. something is wrong with their Vsync and optimization that causes this.Overall very fun game. I still prefer Assassins Creed 2 though, but this one is still one of my favorite Ascreed of all time.Multiplayer is still breathing a bit, but Its not that fun due to balancing issue.For all perfectionists, 80 hours. 80 hours is all you need to complete all achievements and all collectibles in the game. If youre not a perfectionist and only aiming for end game, you just probably need 60 hours of gameplay.
