This would be so much better without Uplay and the whole IRL abstergo mini game in the story of it. so increadibly stupid and annoying. game boy is more entertaining then some of the crap u have to go through. and if ur not experienced with tech stuff u wount enjoy this at all. its like driving a toyota or somethin.. crashes and errors and good luck reaching out to ubisoft for support.
