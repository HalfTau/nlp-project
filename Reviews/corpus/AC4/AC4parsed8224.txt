I finished this game after dicking around with it for a long time and all I have to say is...oh...my...god.This is a perfect recovery after AC3 and is one of best AC games to date. The only AC games that kept my interest long enough to actually finish were AC1, AC2, AC Brotherhood and this AC. The story is amazing and meeting infamous, halfdrunk pirates like Blackbeard, Horningold, Kidd, Rackam and etc never gets old. Their personalties make the cutscenes worth watching and the dialouge interesting.For me, the most important aspect of a game is story and characters. In AC3, Connor was very unlovable and I was always apatheic towards his situation. As for Edward Kenway, he is the epitome of a pirate character. He is charming, charismatic and extremely lovable even when hes a . You relate to him, feel sorry for him and desperately want him to outlive all his fastgoing pirate comrades. The end of this game is also heartwarming and is extremely satisfying, leaving the player wanting more Kenway.In a world run by anarchy, debauchery and betrayal, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is the epitome of a pirate experience.
