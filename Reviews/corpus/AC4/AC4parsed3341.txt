My favourite Assassins Creed game to date and none in the future will be the same without the sailing and naval aspect. The Edward Kenway role as a pirate was also very different from all the other stories from previous editions, and I found my self getting to know the other characters around me like Blackbeard Thatch and Ad, unlike in the others.Overall, great story rich game and plenty of outisde of the main story things to do like pillage and plunder. Also felt the game was rounded off much much better than any Creed game to date.Having gone off the Assassins Creed games since Assassins Creed III, this installment really got my blood pumping and well into the pirate spirit. Only a couple of downsides with a very glitchy sequence 9 and ship upgrades were too pricey and did not scale with progression through the game, forcing me to go outside of the main story and spend a while obtaining materials and funds to upgrade the hull. I give this game a 8.3/10 for a gripping story among plenty other things.
