Assassins Creed IV brings life back into a series that was starting to get stale. While the game is still glorified murder porn and lacks any sort of difficulty, the writing and characters are leaps and bounds ahead of what was found in the third installment. Even the naval combat is tolerable this time around.Dont expect to max the games graphics setting out this time around unless youre equipped with a 780/290. On a GTX670 with slightly lowered settings the game still drops down to 35FPS and maxes out at around 60 at 1920x1080. This game is a system killer, although driver updates could fix this.With a little over 15 hours logged now I havent even reached the 30 mark in completion. There is a LOT to see and do. Nothing really feels like a chore either which is nice. The modern day segments outside of the animus arent half bad either. This is one of those games that you will definitely sink 4 or 5 hours into without even noticing. Ive done it myself twice already.Multiplayer wise, it is still the same game it has been since Brotherhood. Im really loving how the PC Version is very active this time around. I have yet to have a problem getting into a match of any gametype. The only thing is, nothing is changed. All the same equipment/abilities are here. You really only have new maps and characters to play as. Thats fine with me though, the game is as fun as ever...and as frustrating with those damn contested kills every 30 seconds.Will this game get you on the Assassins Creed bandwagon if you didnt enjoy the previous games or were getting bored with them around Brotherhood/Revelations? No, not at all. However, if you have enjoyed the series up until this point but felt like the pacing and writing of 3 was off and you wanted the game to achieve the level of quality the Ezio trilogy gave, then this is definitely a worthwhile purchase. Highly reccomended.
