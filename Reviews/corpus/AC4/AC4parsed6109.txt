Ive been very pleasantly surprised. After the festering pile of dog vomit that was AC3, I held off on buying AC4 until it went on a deep discount sale.This game takes the fun stuff that worked from AC2, and basically kicks AC3 out the door, except for the ship combat aspects.No more interminable and pointless wilderness maps with no fast travel points. There are a ton of maps to explore, all of various sizes from the 200 meter maps you can sprint across in a few seconds to the 1km maps with multiple fast travel spots. The story is just ok. Most of the time it feels like theres some portion missing, but the stuff thats presented is tolerable. The gameplay is exactly the same as it has been for 5 years.Over all, is it worth the current price of 40 for the plain or 60 for deluxe then adding all the DLC for another 30...?No. It really is just another annual interpretation of the same game theyve been pushing for years. If you can get it on sale, everything for 3040, then its a great deal. But 7090 for all the content? Forget it.
