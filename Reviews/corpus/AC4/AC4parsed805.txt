I didnt have issues with the game that other reviews, especially recent ones, have been pointing out. And in all reality, uPlay isnt as terrible as people say it is. You just have to download it, make an account, and if all goes well, youll never have to worry about it again. Just dont forget to put your game keys for additional content in the uPlay menu. Took me a good long while to figure that one out.Hated the game the first time, played it a second time years later, loved it.When I got this game for console when it first came out, I despised it. But, I kept playing it hoping it would get better after a while. Eventually, I beat the game and walked away dissapointed, enjoying only the naval side of the game. These feelings towards the game actually turned me off from the series, as I had already felt the series was losing its touch since the release of Assassins Creed III. Yes, I was an Ezio fanboy and hated to see him goFast forward several years, it goes on sale on steam, and I decide to go ahead and pick it up to give the game another shot. Needless to say, I fell in love with it the second time. The story was much better than I remembered, the characters werent as dull as I originally thought they were, and I was unable to tear myself from the game this time, whereas I was forcing myself to finish it the first time. At the end of my second playthrough, with 100 completion and 55 hours logged, I found myself much more satisfied than I originally was. The game was well worth the second purchase.So, if you were like me and hated the game the first time, give it a second shot if you are thinking about it. You will more than likely find yourself satisfied with another playthrough.
