This is the first Assassins Creed game I have played and enjoyed it a lot.I completed 71 of the game in about 60 hours. Its open world and open ending game, so you could play as long as you like after completing the main story. Here are some pros and cons.Pros Fast and satisfying combat Beautiful graphics Interesting story Seamless transition between land based gameplay and sea based gameplayCons The sailing and naval combat can be too arcadish if you are into ship simulation kind of thingOverall it was a fun game.
