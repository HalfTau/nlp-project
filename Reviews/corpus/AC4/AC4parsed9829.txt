I was quite surprised at how much I liked this game. I figured this series had started to go down hill and would never climb back up, but it did in my eyes. The fun of sailing the open seas, plundering ships and being an assassin at the same time. Absolutly gorgeous game, but lacks optimization. Frame rate will drop for no reason. Still highly recomended.
