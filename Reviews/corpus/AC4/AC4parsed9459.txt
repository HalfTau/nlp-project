The dev team took the nautical aspects of Assassins Creed III and went, well, overboard. Terrific graphics, beautiful water effects far better than those on PS3 I havent seen the PS4 version  overall a slick, impressive presentation. The action is great both on land and on the seas, but I think theres too much of the latter. Im getting quite sick of boating around everywhere, and would prefer some stealthier gameplay on terra firma. Also, I thought assassins were supposed to be sneaky, as opposed to coming barreling in on a tall ship. Oh well.The combat hasnt changed much at all since Connors outing. Some things dont make sense Somehow, Edward, a pirate and former privateer, can go round after round with multiple trained assassins and come out unscathed. Didnt it take previous characters in the series years of training to reach that level of skill? Furthermore, why am I chasing sea shanties over rooftops to teach my merry crew of thugs new songs to sing while swabbing the deck?In the end, the answer to those and more questions is, Who cares? Just turn off your brain and enjoy it. If thats the kind of entertainment, go for it. Black Flag isnt as good as, say, Revelations or Brotherhood, but its still a hoot  and Edward is far more appealing a character than that whiny schoolgirl Connor.
