Read the last part. The Game si Truly a good pirat game the problem is its a assian Creed game, so you have to go thourgh those misions where you have to folow a guy and thoes misions awlwayes bugs or are boring as heel untill you get to then end of the mission. You grab the wrong tree or wall wen you try to climb stuf. its not a bad game, its just that wen your out on the oscend and rading guard forts or Navye convoey. The Game is super fun and its a big world to sail around in discower stuff in i will reacomend it for thoes that like pirat games wen you have to sail and raid and Plunder its fun to climb walls and forts and assainet pepel but wen you have to do it in missions  its boring  of coures lots of the misions is fun and good and chanling witch is good but just thoes stalker missions is boring     But i will say im gald that i bougth it and have spendt a lot of houres in it and will contino to do so
