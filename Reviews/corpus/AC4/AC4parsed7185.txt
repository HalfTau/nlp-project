!! !Warning This is not going to be a Review ALL about how Good the Graphics are or the Gameplay, this Review is focusing on aspects that i as AC fan want to talk about here.!!! There also might be some lil Spoilers aheadThis game brought light into the AC series for me again,The Gameplay is still typical AC gameplay which is just upgraded with more Ship missions which was for me the only enjoyable stuff in ACIII.But as i said before i wanna focus on Aspects of the Story, Characters and how the Year 1715 was presented in this game.Story At the beginning i thought that this Story is going to be all about pirating and basicly nothing about Assassins but i was completely wrong, the Story was full of brutal Plottwist which made this game a freakin Storybomb that wasnt dropped off since Mafia 1.Characters It was so great that it only took a year for Ubisoft to understand that your Main or Side Character not even need a good background story or a great setup, nope there needed to be more Chracter Development that was completely lost in ACIII, Edward Kenway is a great Character who doesnt actually change as much physically like Ezio, at a important Plot Point he totally changed his character and you hadnt the feeling playing a Grumpy Pirate who was only doing this entirefor Money, no you were introduced to a AC Character who regrets Actions in his life.One of my biggest Problems with ACIII beside Connor the Potato was that it realy didnt catch in the Essence of the Independence War, you didnt feel like you were changing something you were just a little helper who helped People like George Washington to get Famous.Well i cant pretty much say anything what so ever about Black Flag ...Okay of course you didnt change anything like Ezio in Rome but u realy have a connection to the Epoch in this game, the Historical characters you meet are not like Washington or Benjamin Franklin, meeting them feels like meeting the characters from AC Brotherhood again where u just felt like  Those are my buddies and they would fight with me till death.AC Blackflag was 1 out of 6 games that made me cry because of one of the most Emotional Moments in Video Game History that i have ever witnessed  OF COURSE THE ENDING OF SUPER PAPER MARIO IS THE BEST THING EVERGive this game a try and play it all through and witness the beautifull ending that shows that Ubisoft can actually create great and Emotional StoriesEventhough the game isnt perfect because it simply plays like a Regular AC it is one of the pretiest games in the Series.I give AC Black Flag  A 9.5/10
