Standard AC combat system with parries and different weapons but proven sufficient and fluidWhole open sea pirating idea is done perfectly in the atmosphereCharismatic, relatable and interesting main protagonist with hunting dilemmas, everlasting greed, lust for power and moral difficultiesBest feeling in the whole series Ive played was cruising on Jackdaw aimlesslyThere are many leisures to spend money and resources on weapons, armor, ship, mansion etcLots different type of enemies spanish, english, soldiers, ships, naval forts etcQuite long main game even without extrasLots of extras treasure maps, contracts, mayan puzzles, armors, side quests etcSome glitches here and there that really not a big deal but still existingMain protagonist still cant see the logic to use ladder instead of a unclimblable wall even though i spesifically drive him to itSwords are mostly useless after getting a good one which i bought in the first 1 hour and never changed itNot RPG game but they tried to add some little rpg elements here and there but unsuccessfulFleet mini game really feels like farmville and lacks the depthNPCs are not that rememberable and influencial in gamers mind Blackbears should be more on the front imoAll in all, I think AC4 is the best game in complete series March 2017 9/10
