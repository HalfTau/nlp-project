Ive spend more time on this title then any other in the AC franchise and its not even close to its end. What a gorgeous game ! I was unsure about it when i first saw it, then a friend told me it was good i decided to try it out, and im loving it ! You get this huge open sea and land, sail to where you want sinking everything you see, its great ! There is so much to do, its even hard to decide The only thing i noticed about this one is that the climbing  mechanics are a bit broken, it feels so automatic and very often your character will jump off the course you are trying to go for, or will not grab objects/walls that are within his reach.But for me, its been i think the best game of the AC series.
