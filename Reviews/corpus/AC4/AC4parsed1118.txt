I love piloting your ship on the high seas and boarding other boats  all very swashbuckling. The rest of the game plays much like the other ACs. Unfortunately I have constant issues with losing my saves in the AC series, its like a curse  I lost all my data around halfway through and couldnt be bothered to replay it. Still definately a good experience though, as I was playing for the pirate shenanigans rather than the plot.
