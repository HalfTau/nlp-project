Very good game, I would give it a 8/10, it has improved a lot the graphics, the new naval battle system is really interesting, the only thing that made the game deserve 8/10, is the story which was kinda ok, the fighting system which I think was a sort of downgrade because it used a smart focus and the armor and weapon uprades it needed more variety.
