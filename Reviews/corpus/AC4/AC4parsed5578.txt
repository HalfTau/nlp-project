Im an Assassins Creed fan since the first game, I played all of then.We can say that Black Flag, despite the usuals bug, is a tremendous game.I dont play multiplayer at all the  ACs because the campaign mode are more fun than any thing.I hope you all love AC Black Flag as I did.Enjoy, and most important of all, Have Fun!
