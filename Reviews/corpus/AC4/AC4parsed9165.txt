Very Good game! only a few minor problems with game play,  sometimes camera angles hide or obscure player character during larger in city town fights. Sea battles are a superb highlight albeit not realistic but fun! and stunningly gorgeous. overall lots to do with more interesting variation then past assassin titles.
