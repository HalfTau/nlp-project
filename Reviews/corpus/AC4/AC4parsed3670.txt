I used to play this game on my cousins xbox 360 for like 5 hours everytime i visit his house. it was really fun and addicting, and i really want to play this game on my own room, but i dont have any pc/laptop or console at that time. but now i have a gaming laptop and this game was on sale so i bought it.One of the best Assassins Creed game after the Assassins Creed II. I really liked the world maps, the main protagonist Edward Kenway, the ships. But its lacking in the story. Well you got to explore a lot of island and killing a lot of animal for crafting. And somehow it feels ubisoft is combining Far Cry x Assassins Creed recently with their almost similar tower and animal skill crafting. But its fun. I love it
