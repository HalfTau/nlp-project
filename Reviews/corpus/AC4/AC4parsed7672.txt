GREAT GAME.....BUT ONE PROBLEM......LOST MY SAVE FILE......I thought well its saved in the cloud no big issue, but NO its not... It turns out that Uplay stopped cloud saving support of Assassins Creed IV Black Flag.....which made me real mad.....I got more than half way through the game and I have to say it is very decent. In my opinion not the best out of the series but defenitly not the worst. I guess Ill have to replay all the mission and reugrade the jackdaw which will be a pain in the But willing to do it considering I am a HUGE fan of the series  Just remember to back up your save file!! !
