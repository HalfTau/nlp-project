Would not recommend buying. Game is plagued with save issues. Just search assassins creed black flag, lost save on google. A ton will pop up, and it is a very common issue, Same issue happened to me, and I have lost many hours of gameplay due to it. Cant be bothered to go through most of the game again just to get back to where I was.
