I have played and enjoyed Assassins Creed, III i think, on xbox, but I am by no means dedicated to the series......so I saw this game on steam on sale at the time, and was skeptical at the focus on naval combat as opposed to a single large freeroam city environment, but I gotta say this game really surprised me!ProsIf your still hooked on the freeroam city environment there are several good cities to relive your Esio/desmond or whatever days in rome, crowded streets, rooftop access everywhere, and killmove shananigans then go nuts at Kingston, Havana, Tortuga, etc etc.The Naval Combat is easy to understand, fun to master. The controls are fairly intuitive and/or explained.Beautiful! Sailing in high wind down the coastline of lush coves and sea caves in a bangin ship listening to the surf and one of many shanties sung by your sailors. Sailing into rogue wave is quite a thrill. Getting smashed by them is also a thrill.Cons Really minor cons IMO, but there are a few..... everynow and then you see a soldier climb a ladder into the sky or something goofy like that , but I could probably count on one or two hands the number of times that happened in one play through.Kenways Fleet is a fairly engaging side activity, but the minigame of launching battles is a little lame. Perhaps if it was more engaging or just omitted, sending the fleet out on just contracts would be alright by me.All in all 10/10. It was a great buy for sale easter weekend, would pay FP.
