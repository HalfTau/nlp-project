Amazing game. The world is huge, beautiful, great storyline, great voice acting, ship battles, weather, wild animals, hidden treasure, treasure maps,... Theres a lot you can do. I havent tried the multiplayer part of it yet, but thats not what I bought it for. It is beautiful the ships, the landscape, the characters, vegetation, animals, weapons, buildings... One of my all time favorites now, and I have 83 games in my Steam inventory. This game is so good, its hard to find interest in a new game. So much amazing adventure diving, harpooning, sea battles, swashbuckling, assassinating, rescuing, hunting, exploring, looting, pillage/plunder, stealth. It had me up until 5am the next day because I just couldnt stop. This game is A. Be sure you have decent hardware to appreciate the artistry of this game at full detail. I wish I were more articulate with this description so you could know what I am talking about. Trust me and just get this game if you dont have it.
