Probably the best Assassins Creed game to come out in years, imagine Assassins Creed 3 without all of the problems it had. Better story, better protagonist, less outside the Animus drama, and overall is just so much more polished and worth getting into. If you were disappointed with AC3, this game just might be the redemption you were hoping for.A huge world to explore, large bodies of water to sail, ships to sink, sunken ships to loot, people to assassinate, buildings to climb, animals to hunt, storms to push through, Assassins Creed 4 provides so much for the player and is always keeping you on your toes while not overstaying its welcome.
