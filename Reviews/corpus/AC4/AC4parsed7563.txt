Finally got around to finishing this game after having my saved game blown away during a format.  If you need closure from AC 3 like I did, this does a nice job of wrapping it up.  The graphics engine was overhauled and looks really nice.  The dialogue isnt too bad, and the voice acting is pretty solid as well.The Bad If you didnt like ship combat in AC 3, youll hate the core mechanic to this game.  The ship is how you move around the world map, how you do a ton of the story missings and overall is about 4050 of the actual game.  Edwards movement goes wonky sometimes and he jumps over targets or goes up the wrong way of a tree and can make for frustrating gameplay.  The collectibles from the start are insane.  It looks like the Animus d your screen with them, without explaining what some of them even are.The Good  You get closure to Desmonds story, and Edwards story isnt half bad.  The actual assassin missions play like AC 2, which I enjoyed.  A lot of stealth required, and the bushes make it easy to sneak around to get to your target.  The gadgets are also well done.  The dart gun is a lot of fun with berzerk darts.  The ship combat IS fun, but towards end game isnt as useful unless youre just collecting items.Overall, its just another Assassins Creed game.  If you like the series, this is definitely one to get.
