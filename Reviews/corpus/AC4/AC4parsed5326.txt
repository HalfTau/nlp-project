I have to admit, I am SO HAPPY they finally made a PROPER Pirates of The Caribbean video game. For once, you can be the swashbuckling pirate youve always wanted to be. You can drink rum, steal rum, loot and burn down ships. There is even a hunting option which is sort of cool. After a few upgrades, you can even have FOUR flintlocks and go ham and ANY guards tha try to stop you. Sometimes youre given the option to be stealthy, but why would I want to do that when I have so much weapons? Overall this game is cool and fun for a pirate game, but I still dont get this why cant you kill anyone you want as a pirate and whats with the hidden blades?
