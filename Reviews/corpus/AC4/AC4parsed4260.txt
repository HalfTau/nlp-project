The Assassinss Creed series has always taken us to different historical periods of time, with great success we have been witness of events that shaped humanitys life and course of history, this is something I always liked about these series. Meeting and talking to important characters, the combination of fiction and history make a great combo of storyline, and AC Black Flag is not the exception.Our new hero is Edward Kenway, a mere pirate with delusions of greatness and endless treasures so he and his wife wont have to work for anyone ever again. So he leaves home, country and family behind to pursue his dreams, acting out of egoism he travels to the Caribbean, heart and core of the pirates between 1714 and 1726. But this is an especial case, Edward is not an assassin, just a simple man that finds himself in the middle of this war between Assassins and Templars, he doesnt care about it, money is his final objective, though some events will change that, small yet significant ones that will make him take sides and support the assassins and finally become one.While gameplay hasnt changed that much, the stealthy kills and different ways to eliminate your targets tend to be overshadowed by the main protagonist here, naval combat. It feels so great to engage all sorts of enemy ships, the system is quite simple, while advancing further in the story, and you get to engage new and more powerful ships, like schooners, frigates and man o wars, the latest being the most powerful ships in the game, with hundreds of cannons and almost invincible hulls, for this your own ship, the Jackdaw, must be improved by buying more cannons and better hull, at the same time you can also change its appearance. While destroying and boarding enemy ships you gather resources like cloth, metal and wood that serve to improve the jackdaw, also every time you board a ship you have three options, you either repair your own ship, decrease the wanted level or you can send the ship to your own fleet. This makes the concept of boarding and attacking other vessels exciting and rich, pretty satisfying.In the case of the fleet, you can clear your way to send ships to trade and that way getting money, this is some sort of minigame where you fight enemy ships and at the same time you clear the trading routes, making it easier for your fleet to sail in peace, it is not strictly necessary to deal in this kind of activity, but it is a good way to make easy and fast money reales. Another cool characteristic related to the naval combat is the fact that sometimes enemy fleets like the Spaniard and English ships will engage in combat, you can either watch them destroy each other or attack one side weakening the ships or just attacking both, testing your luck and skills.On the other hand, the way you kill enemies, tailing them and facing multiple foes have not changed that much, though some new tools have been introduced, like the blowpipe with berserk and sleep darts, which make it even stealthier for you to get rid of enemies or just have fun by making them go crazy and fight, also using your environment has improved a bit by using trees and foliage for surprise attacks.I must say AC4 is one of the most beautiful games in the series, it is breathtaking at times, full of detail in the sea and under it, the cities look great, with a lot of vegetation around, and the jungle side of the map is awesome. The sea is the main protagonist, of course, we spend most of the time aboard the Jackdaw looking for big ships to board and resources, so the sea is mostly everywhere and it looks awesome, great waves effects, storms that affect everyone, not just us, waterspouts and wild changes in the water make it hard to maneuver at times.Also, the vessels look spectacular, every little detail put into the ships characteristics is great, you can see the passion the ships were created with, splinters, holes on the hull, the smoke every time you fire the cannons and the sails being affected by the winds, top notch graphics. As well as every little island or old ruin, everything screams details. A beautiful game.There is nothing bad to say here, the music is brilliant, every time you board an enemy ship or when you first touch ground on a new city, every song depicting the atmosphere of such activities, top notch sound and music.The voices are equally great, the acting is awesome, believable characters, great dialogues and accents, from the less important NPC to the main character such Blackbeard, Hornigold, Edward, Kidd, pure passion in the voices!While other games in this series had minor things that were annoying at times or simply atrocious, like camera angles that made it hard to play at times or NPCs popping up out of nowhere and textures loading when approach to, on AC4 there are not that many negative features, we have the usual tailing missions which are a bit boring sometimes, or the amount of fillers that are thrown into the storyline just for the sake of making the game even longer, we can collect animus shards, treasures and different shanties scattered all over this big map, the thing is that these side activities tend to be fun for a while, after 20 hours of gameplay, you just forget about them. Besides this, therere not many bad or negative things worth mentioning, I could say the game is bug free for me, some insignificant crashes, but that was all. No problems with performance either.When everyone was talking bad about the AC series, and especially after AC3, everyone fell in love with the new turn of the series, this game feels fresh, maybe not on the side of storyline and the war between Assassins and Templars, but for gameplay. From this turn of events we can see that the series has potential for more interesting historical events throw into the mix with fiction. In the beginning, you might not feel sympathy for the main character, but in time Edward builds charisma, he is a nice character, full of nice lines, humor and a personal story that shows a great potential, not just because of the piracy theme, but because he is part of a series of events of games in the series that occured after his life.It was nice to get to know more  detail the whole historical background for Nassau and the Caribbean in that time, the post war events, the new found colonies, like Havana, Kingston and other minor cities, what I mean is that we do not just play a game but we can also learn about the time and different conflicts that shaped part of our history.AC4 is full of critical and touching moments, like the ending, the dreams of gold and a free nation for free men away from the tyranny of the crown. Recommended for fan of the series and even for nonfollowers of the games.
