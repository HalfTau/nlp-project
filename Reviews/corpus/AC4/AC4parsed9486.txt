everything about the game is amazing. graphics, gameplay, optimization, story  all spot on. the story did end a little abrubtly but it was well told. the open world seemless transistions into new areas are amazing as well the near instantanous load times for bigger cities, although i am running it on raid 0 SSds so it may be that. anyways the game was worth every penny even thouh i paid the full 60 for it  which i rarely purcahse games for. not many graphic options but it definitely does not feel like a cheap console port as many other games suffer from. you will be able to put a lot of hours into it without the game getting to dull or boring unlike some of the old assassins creeds games where the side missions were stupid and pointless this game has bigger side missions which were well implemented and worth doing.  the mayan deflecting bullet armor is badass and worth collecting the mayan stones for. also the naval combat is VASTLY improved upon from Ac3 so that now it is actually more enjoyable and a lot more refined and less clunky, you are also a lot less limited in your options of combat like in Ac3. overall 10/10 would buy again.
