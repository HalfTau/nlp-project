Loved the mechanics of the piracy on AC3 and wished there was more, s much more. AC4 delivered!!!Just in the beginning but the potential for the franchise just keeps open for more and more, as long as they explore it well.Recommend this game and most of the others as well, but bias as I am a fan to any RPG/Adventure fans out there.
