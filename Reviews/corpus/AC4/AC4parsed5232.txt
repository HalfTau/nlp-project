The first time I tried to play it I reached the loading screen...not the one with edward the one after the press any key screen.I had to unistall it and downlaod it againwhich took me 6 hours.After the I was able to play but when I tried to play for a second time,when I tried to move the game glitched and everything except from the Hud was moving like it was on a car wheel but when I stopped moving everything went back to normal.I tried changing the settings so many times and I even put the on default.I closed the game and reopened it but it was the same,I even rebooted my computer.Nothing...If I have to unistall it and download it everytime I want to play,then NO THANKS.
