This is so much better than Assassins Creed III. Everything that had promise in that game has been refined to actually work this time around. The ship sections of the game feel seamless, not at all gimmicky, and its a joy to simply sail around the islands looking for treasure. Edward is a much more entertaining character so far and they seem to have fixed the movement issues I found so annoying in AC3. Theres far less getting stuck climbing what you didnt intend in most cases it seems to happen now when Im too heavyhanded on the controls.Chasing sea shanties the equivalent of chasing down book pages in AC3 is now actually fun  rewarding, partly due to the freerunning improvements, and partly because the songs are worth collecting so you can listen to your crew sing them while youre out at sea.There are still a few weird glitches e.g. a man who was supposed to be hanging from a rope was actually hovering a fair bit away from his rope and I really wish theyd given the random pirates you recruit some more varied voices, but overall I havent got any complaints. I know some people hate the moden day aspects, but I find those fascinating. It seems worth reading all the notes you find, hacking office computers and listening to conversations. Im only about 20 through the game so far though, so time will tell whether the overarching plot will remain interesting.So very glad theyve come back from Assassins Creed 3 so well. I know there are people who loved the direction it went in, but it just wasnt to my taste. This is much more of an adventure for me!
