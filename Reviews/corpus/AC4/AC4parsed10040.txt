Asscreed games are Asscreed games but mix the concept with Pirates settled in the Caribean and got yourself some flavour. Nice characters, side quest and backgrounds to follow.But the most interesting character in the whole game is the ocean.The way it behaves and throws you around is so much fun.Boat battles are awesome and you never know where the tide takes you.I played some Asscreed but it never really got to me.But now this comes allong and it might grab my interest enough to explore the universe a bit more by trying the previous installments again some day.But for now Im still enjoying this Is it worth full price? Yes!Singleplayer alone? Even singleplayer alone.Multiplayer? Cant tell yet. Im still lost at sea PHope the seasonpass is worth it. The Adewale trailer convinced me of yes it might be... Time will tell
