Honestly, one of the best games Ive ever played. They put an unreal amount of depth and exploration into it,the gameplay is solid, but not without quirks... obviously any game has them. The story is slow to pick up, but builds into its own, and a good one.. further into the game it gets great. Maybe not as good as Ezio or Connors story, but keeps the out of animus parts to a minimum, out of 30 hours in game, maybe spent 3045 mins out of animus, and the time in the animus was enjoyable as could be. If you love pirates, or love AC before it went downhill, this is a hell of a purchase to make9.3/10
