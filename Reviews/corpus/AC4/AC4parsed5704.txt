It is a fun game, naval combat adds a new twist to things, and thats about all its got going for it.The gameplay is exactly like every assassins creed before it, minus the ship to ship fightingThe story is  and doesnt seem to have any ties to the assassins creeds before it, just seems like the devs have run out ideas and are pumping out games nonethelesstook 21 hours to beat the story, the last hour on record is credits you cant skipuPlay is utter cancer, might as well skip buying this game on steam and just buy it on uPlayNo steam achievementsCombat is super easy if you have played any AC beforeId only recommend it if you either A want to play every AC ever made or B havent played AC before and the story doesnt much matter to you.
