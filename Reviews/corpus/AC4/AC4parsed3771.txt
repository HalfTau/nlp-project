Most of the reviews that are negative are usually people who have barely spent time on the game, but have bought it just to make a poor review so that they can spread the ignorance.This game is seriously awesome, in every way in fact. One of the best OPEN WORLD and ACTION  ADVENTURE games I have ever played, the game feels alive and I LOVE IT!Its 2016 and this game has been released for almost three years and it still is AWESOME!9/10, would be perfect if it wasnt for Uplay. Awesome game Ubisoft!
