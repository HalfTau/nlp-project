The best AC game to date. Very good atmosphere and storyline. Ubisoft has really outdone themselves when it comes to working the historical people into the story of the game, very well done. The only downsides to the game are the combat is still the same it works, but too easy at times and there are a little too many tail and eavesdrop missions.I wholeheartedly recommend this.
