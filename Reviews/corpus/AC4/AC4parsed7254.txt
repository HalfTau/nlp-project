A damn fine pirate game  if only they could rip out the UPlay client and patch the thingHours of fun to be had on the high seas plundering warships and singing with your crew, great little character moments with the flying gang, and a protagonist that is unlikeable but grows into something more make this game worthy of your time, the experience only brought down by the inclusion of all the usual first civilisation nonsense that bogs down every Assassins Creed game. Would recommend.
