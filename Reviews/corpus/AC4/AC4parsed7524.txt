I have almost no words.Probably the most hours Ive sunk into any game in my life except probably JK2 back in the day, but thats another story..., and even the hours that Steam shows are incorrect because a lot of the hours were only in the Ubisoft launcher.Anyway. Graphics, gameplay, vistas, mechanics, plot, NAVAL COMBAT, clothing, flora, weapons, fixes for a lot of those little annoying ACproprietary gripes that come about because of the parkour  and everything else... this offering is light years of improvement over AC3. Definitely the first serious contender for best AC since AC2, and it might just barely be my favorite of the series.10/10 would pirate again.
