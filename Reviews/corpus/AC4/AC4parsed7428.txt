This game is worth full price! I would reccomend this game to anyone a fan in the Assassins Creed series, but if your just starting out this game does not give to much backstory about the Assassins Creed universe. The game is full of content and will keep you occupied for at least 20 hours. Naval battles were brought over from Assassins Creed 3 and they did an outstanding job polishing it up! Most of the core mechanics from previous games in the series are still present and kicking. Bug wise this game does have a few bugs that I noticed while playing, one very persisting one was the Jackdaw would be in an odd position while loading a new level.
