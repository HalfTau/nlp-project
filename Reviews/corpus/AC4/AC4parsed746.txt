This is the best assassins creed game I have ever played.If you like games that you are a one man army then this game is for you.If you like pirate games then this might just be the best pirate you can buy to this day and that is just the pirate part theassassins part is just as good if not better if you are thinking abouut buying it stop thinking and just buy it alreddy you will not regret it for sure.If you do want to 100 then buy the time savers because even with the time savers it took me 123 hours.I do recomend completing it and I hopped this has helpped you want to buy the game.
