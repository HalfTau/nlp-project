I LOVE THIS GAME! Ok, so Im new to the Assassins Creed franchise, only having played AC2, AC3, and Unity before this. In my opinion, this game trumps them all! The graphics are pretty good and the audio is pleasing. Though there are some cons, such as the fighting style being able to take on 20 with your fists and some parts of the story feel rushed but what game doesnt?. I have over 50 hours on this game, still not having beat it since most of the time I was doing side quests and plundering ships. This game does not get boring, to the side quests and sailing I mean who doesnt like a good pirate simulator right? The story was great and the NPCs were awesome etc. Blackbeard, Calico Jack, Anne Bonnet, and Mary Read And Edward is the greatest assassin! With the first half of the story being about money, but when you get further into the game, he becomes an assassin for the greater good.Pros Great storyAmazing NPCs and a badass Main CharacterBecoming a Pirate and being able to sail the oceanYour crew always cheering when your come backYour crew singing Shanties, when sailingBeing able to plunder other shipsThe parkour mechanics are superbHaving 4 guns and sleeping dartsConsFightning style makes you OPstory feels rushed at timesThe stealth isnt very good Uplay, Uplay, Uplay, always messin up great gamesThat your reading this instead of buying the game, you know you want itOverall Id give this game an A, you should definitly buy this and enjoy it!
