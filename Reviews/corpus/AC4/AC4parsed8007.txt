Without a doubt... The best Assassins Creed Ive ever played, among the best games for that matter. Im a big AC fan, but hated III... This game... This game makes me feel like a little kid, swashbuckling with giddy pirate fun like it was my first time with my piratelegoset. I highly recommend this game for infinite fun, particularly in the naval combat arena.If you REALLY want to go all out, turn the ingame music off, and open up some the sountrack to pirates of the carribean on youtube maybe some monkey island too, and LIVE IT D
