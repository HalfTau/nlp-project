Ive never really been drawn into the Assassins Creed franchise. Ive played a solid ten hours of the first, dabbled in the second and spent a little more time in Assassins Creed 3. None of them reached out and grabbed my attention, demanding I play them until conclusion. Black Flag has certainly done that.While the endless tedium of tail missions and the sudden jarring jolt of the present day sections are in danger of marring this almost perfect game, its other elements more than make up for these faults. The atmosphere, music, story, setting and sheer beauty of this game are unrivaled. It feels very much like a modern take on Sid Meyers Pirates, and thats something Ive been waiting a long time for!This is my personal Game of 2013 and easily the best Assassins Creed game of all time.
