no matter how low i put the settings I cant get 60fps. and the game locks at 30fps. if I turn off vsync the game has the most horrible screen tearing I have ever seen.  it really ruins this good game to an unplayuable state. I shouldnt have any problems getting 60fps considering my computer is well above the recomended specs. UBI should think about patching this title even though it was released years ago.
