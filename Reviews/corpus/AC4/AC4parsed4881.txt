This game was definetly worth 6 i have put into it. It has long good story, a tons of side activities assassin contracts, naval contracts, templar hunts and much more and im still not counting time which u will spent on the sea upgrading your ship or simply making some money. For me it is definetly one of the best game i have ever played.However... if you are fan of previous ACs as Im i have to say, that main character in this game is much more pirate than assassin.. i mean its called assassins creed yes? not pirate creed.. this is only con that i can point out. Otherwise i still think that its the best game despite of main character being a pirate.
