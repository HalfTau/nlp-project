Great game that takes the open world concept and adds sailing then puts the Assassins Creed stamp on it. Reminded me of Zelda Wind Waker. Game is packed with lots of objectives and ways to earn and spend money. Takes a long time to improve your ship and offers a wide variety of ways to do so.Destroying enemy ships is a lot of fun but can get tiresome as you need to destroy a lot in order to obtain the resources necessary to advance your ship to its fullest potential. There are many locations to visit and many towns are huge in size and are easy to get lost in while exploring. While the map is huge, many islands and large parts of islands cannot be explored and only consist of a wall of vegetation. I understand that making the entire land portions of the map exploreable would have a been an unrealistic/daunting task for Ubisoft. I just didnt feel that same freedom that I experienced in Skyrim. Perhaps they should have reduced the size of the overall map, as much of it is water.ProsGreat graphicsWide variety of objectivesShip upgrading takes effort but is rewardingExpansive map with wide variety of locationsConsShip battles get repetitive yet are necessaryMany of the land areas cannot be exploredFelt that modernday scenes interrupted flow of game playOverall was an awesome and addicting experience especially for someone who hasnt played many of the Assassins Creed games.
