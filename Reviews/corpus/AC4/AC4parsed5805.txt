The game is Assassins Creed  no surprises there. Parkour, kill, hide, repeat.BUTYou get to steer a goddamn ship, engaging other ships in battle.Great soundtrack. Those pirate songs are reason enough to buy the game.The game is pretty much bug free. And bugs are always an issue regarding Ubisoft games. I basically stopped playing Unity because of the glitches.
