Looks like Ubisoft has no intention to fix the cloud save feature in Uplay for this game. I have lost about 6 hours of game play in 2 separate instances. Its been about 6 months since they disabled cloud save to fix it with no word that they will even bring it back. I back up my saves every session to a separate hard drive. The save folder is in C drive  program files x86  Ubisoft  Ubisoft game launcher  savegames folder... find it and copy it or you will be sorry.Great game otherwise.
