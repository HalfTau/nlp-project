By far one of the best Assassin Creeds, probably one of the best games of the last gen. Fantastic, lighthearted but still emotional story, great exploration, a beautiful art style and a fitting soundtrack. I recommend you buy it if you love open world games, however, if you dont like the previous AC games, there is still a lot of the same AC habits!9/10.
