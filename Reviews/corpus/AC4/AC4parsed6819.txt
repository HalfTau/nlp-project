While it seems to be a well thought out game with plenty to do and lots of detail, it is dificult to recommend due to constant slow downs during gameplay, at least when running on Windows 8.1. These slow downs really impacts controls, playing and the whole experince. I have gone through and optimized all settings and turned off all unneeded services and utilities.To complicate mattes, when you run and play Assasins Creed, both Steam and Uplay are running in the background utilizing resources. At times, Uplay utilizes up to 15 to 20 of the system memory. That is a considerable amount. It is clear that this setup for Assasins Creed IV Black Flag is not optimized to run with WIndows 8.1. Its a shame because of all the positive reviews the game has received for console versions.Crashes are not uncommon.
