The very first true Assassins Creed antihero.Edward Kenway takes us on a journey, from one island to the next and back again. This game does not feel like an assassins creed title, but it feels like teh Far Cry 3 of the AC series. The gameplay is beautiful, and the sailing is majestic and fluid. Once you step on the Jackdaw, youll be seldom wanting to leave. This game is truly next to A.C II in its quality and any true fan of 3rd person character action/ truly dramatic storytelling, pick it up. 10/10
