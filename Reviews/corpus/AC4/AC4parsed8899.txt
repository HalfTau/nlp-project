If you have played any Assassins Creed game, and you can stomach the rather simplistic nature of straightup fights, then this is by far the best entry in the franchise to date.  Both the multiplayer and singleplayer are in top form here, with the campaign enlivened by the very open world and wonderful Sid Meiers Pirates!esque naval combat/metagame, and the multiplayer being yet another improvement on some of the most unique competitive gameplay to be found in current AAA games.  A huge variety of things to do, and almost all of them are presented impeccably.
