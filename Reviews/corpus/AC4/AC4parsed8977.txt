A real treat.  Best since the second and in my opinion best of the series.  The pirate theme is just plain fun!  I give it a solid 9.  The only flaw is some lack of freedom.  You are stuck with the same ship even though you can customize it greatly.  It would be nice to be able to capture and sail stolen ships.  Minor flaw though.  All in all a grand performance.
