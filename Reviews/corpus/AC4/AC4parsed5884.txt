Arrr ye be ready for a pirates review. Black flag introduces fun naval combat and ship battles. The storyline wasnt too bad and revolved mostly around the main character edward kenway and his pirate alliance. In all honesty the game is heavily built around naval combat but just like before theres plenty of places to run on roofs and jump off trees.All in all buy it if you really feel like being a pirate spreading dread over the sea as your enemies are blown away by your cannon lighting everything on fire and creating chaos around them jump aboard their ship and take the plundge to take their ships and conquer their fleets.
