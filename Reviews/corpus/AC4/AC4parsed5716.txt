This game is pretty amazing. Ive not played any other AC games before this one, and I was able to get into this without an issue. The music and atmosphere is bad! Its like playing through Pirates of the Caribbean.The graphics at ultra w/4xAA are great with a 34 year old PC running a Nvid 660ti. The controls of your character when running around doing parkour can get frustrating at times when youre trying to chase something/someone down, but overall its good.Where the game shines for me is the naval gameplay. Fighting in storms and boarding of ships is very fluid and chaotically fun at the same time.When I finish this one, I plan to get ACRogue as I was told it also has a lot of naval warfare in that as well.
