Never rate a game based on the third party platform it uses.  Rate the game based off of its own merits.  This game is great, best pirate game there is.  Using Uplay is only a mild annoyance, of which I have never had any issues with.  Forsake an amazing game based off of Uplay?  Youre in for a bad time...Just buy a console.
