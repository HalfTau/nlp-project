Unstable saves and unhelpful support killed the experience for me. Was really enjoing this game and was well over 60 completed. Started to play one day and computer crashed like it did often with this game started thigs back up and nothing, no save, must start again. When researching found out that this was common and that Ubisoft has disabled cloud save some time ago and never took the time to fix it. VERY FRUSTERATING. I was well over 40 hours into the game. I thought that since I was launching from steam I was still protected.... NOPE Last time I buy a Ubisoft game.
