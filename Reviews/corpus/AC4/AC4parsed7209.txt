After getting this game through the Steam Summer Summer Sales, I was worried I could not get to run on my laptop. It barely makes minimus specs, but with some adjustments I have the game running great. I am really enjoying the game and the game setting. Naval combat is a big stand out in this game, and something I really enjoy.I expect to be playing this game for a good while longer.
