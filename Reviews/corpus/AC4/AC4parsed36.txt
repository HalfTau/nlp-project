You think you know. And that is the root of all that ails you.You think yourself safe, behind walls and ports and harbors and cannons.You think yourself protected by Her Majestys ship and their patrols.You think that there is too little here for anyone to come looking.You know nothing.The Pirate code isnt about money or glory. Its about something far more important. Its about freedom.To loot and pillage anyone weaker than themselves.To run away from any threat without having to call it a tactical retreat.To lose an entire fleets worth of treasure to women, wine and gambling.To go plundering through the savings of honest farmers and even slaves, for the barest hint of value.To hide in the shadows without being called craven.To fling yourself at the mercy of the winds and your sails to escape any threads of responsibility.To trust in no one but your ship and your crew, sometimes.The sea is vast and trechearous and things much worse than death await.But if what ye seek is freedom and a brotherhood of fellow thinkers, then yea, ye be a pirate.So leave your desk job, come down to Tortuga and well see about fitting ye out with a fine ship and a hardy crew.The unspoilt and unexplored ocean beckons to you, me boy. Will ye answer her call?
