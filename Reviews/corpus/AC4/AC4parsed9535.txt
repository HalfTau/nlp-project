This game is very good. I have played about 20 hours now, and I have enjoyed Black Flag. This game is the best in the series since AC2. I would recommend this to anyone following AC, and push anyone over if you are on the fence or not of buying this game. You could say this game is worth... ONE MILLION DOLLARS
