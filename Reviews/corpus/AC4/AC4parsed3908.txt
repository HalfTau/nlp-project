I mean overall its a great game, I have a very mixed review about this so lets list some stuffProsDecent storylinePretty good GraphicsSimplistic but sometimes annoying controlsquick level up and grindConsRandom crashing which is BSOutdated version Of Uplay on steam Plus the fact it needs Uplay in the first placeReallly bad AI, If one person is attacking you, the rest will stare at youOverall I believe with some bug fixes this game could be alright but I mean, some of them make it damn near impossible to play
