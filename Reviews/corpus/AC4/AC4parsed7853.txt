Man this was fun! AC4  Blag Flag is the best Assassins Creed game to date and also the best pirate game Ive ever seen!It has a massive open world that is full of unlockables and side missions which is also easy to navigate using the games fast travel system. They give you an upgradable pirate ship that you can use to sail around and discover locations, as well as engage in awesome ship battles complete with boarding, if you wish! Adding in the fact that you are a freaking ASSASSIN and can sneak around or fight off groups of soldiers makes it even better!I had an absolute blast playing this and unlocking everything that interested me, but I doubt future games in the AC series can top this one. I dont think any other historical setting can come close to the open world and adventure that the pirate era can provide. At least without making these features feel like they were shoehorned in.
