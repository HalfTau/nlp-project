This is the first Assassins Creed game I have ever played and I like it a lot. I enjoy the mixture of stealth, parkour, and causing mischief. The only things I dont like are the ship battles which are sort of tough until you get a handle on it and the excessive combat that takes so long especially with multiple enemies The story, graphics, and overall fun is what makes this a great game. I look forward to buying another later on.9.5/10Me
