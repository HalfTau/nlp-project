Good ThingsThis is a good addition to the AC series, although not my favorite, the sailing/pirating aspect is great as I really enjoyed those minor sailing missions in ACIII, the crafting and upgradable ship is good and has been improved upon and streamlined since the menu mayhem which was the ACIII crafting system.The story is enjoyable and a breeze to play through, not a single boring or chorelike mission in the main plot that I can remember and the underwater stuff was fantastic, avoiding sharks was actually quite a challenge! I didnt think I would like how the modern day elements of the story would be implemented since the end of ACIII but it was alright, especially as you begin to hack into various parts of Abstergo to gain more information on what theyve been doing and gain some extra knowledge about Desmond. The Abstergo/Modern Templar/First Civilisation stuff is something that has always interested me throughout the series so Im pretty happy so far with how its going and look forward to what Unity has to offer.Bad ThingsDue to the pirating/sailing nature of the game you dont really spend a lot of time in the major towns in the game, and for me thats a problem, although you get immersed in the ocean aspects of the game the town activites are severely lacking and you just dont care so much about those places In my 80 hours of gameplay I revisted Havanna just once after spending about 2030mins there in the beginning!. This is something that has genuinely been missing since ACII, in ACII you played so much in those locations that you could get around without using your map because you got to know the towns and cities so well and I really miss having that level of connection and immersion with the locations and the stories being told in them.Sadly the stealth mechanics havent changed at all, which is fine as for the most part in ACIV I found that stealth was better implemented than before, but as always moving from one piece of cover to another involves standing up and nearby guards all being alerted to your presence the ability to crouch whenever you want is /still/ baflingly absent from the series at this point something thankfully rectified for ACUnity.Ubisoft still insist on cluttering the UI with ridiculous amounts of information and options to turn those things off arent specific enough to be useful. My biggest problem with the AC series is the ridiculous collectables, whether they be chests of gold or feathers or flags, I just dont see the point other than to keep some players ingame for longer than they genuinely need to because the achievments gained are never worth it. And the same goes for the Kenways Fleet naval trading thing, its something that I just didnt care about but did it because it was there and I wanted the red Officers outfit, I just found it to be an unwanted extra to keep players racking up the hours. Finally, as with ACIII, I wasnt a fan of the hunting parts of the game but as with ACIII this can be avoided for the most part as you can buy supplies you need for crafting from stores if simulated hunting isnt something youre into regardless of the context.Overall I would give the game a solid 3.5 out of 5. It has its unique qualities in the pirating/sailing/underwater things, but the story isnt as interesting as ACIII and the game itself is nowhere near as immersive as ACII
