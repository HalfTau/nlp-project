Is the Highest Rated Assassins Creed in steam with good reason, It is a fun, exciting pirate adventure of one Edward Kenway aboard his mighty pirate ship the Jackdaw. This is a must play if you like Pirate, Assassination, Stealth and good story games. Gun Chain Killing Dual Wielding Pirate Swords Same parkour mechanics as AC 3 but with a better environment to utilize it, most especially the jungles BETTER stealth and Detection algoritms than AC 3 The Jackdaw. Your Pirate ship is better in every way than the aquila. An open World map of Islands you can explore, Black flag is one of those games where there is a Fast Travel option available but you choose not to use it. Sea Battles are Awesome! Story isnt perfect but decent enough to make you feel for all the characters especially in the Epilogue scene Side missions are as fun as the main ones, by the time i was at sequence 4 or so i had already finished about 50 of all side missions Your Pirate crew sings jolly Pirate songs as you sail optional, As i sail as i sail! Edwards Robes IMO are the best robes next to Ezios AC 2 robes like in AC2 you arent really accepted as an assassin yet for most of the story, it is more of a personal journey for Edward in search of pirate booty as it was in AC 2 where it was a journey of revenge and eventual understanding of the creed for Ezio Obligatory Underwater Levels This is only personal preference, if you like underwater stages then by all means make it a  MY HOOD DOESNT HAVE THE TRADITIONAL BEAKED HOOD DESIGN The removal of the brotherhood system we all loved from brotherhood to kinda 3, You do however have a fleet to worry about now and in place of brotherhood assassins you can recruit crewmen in a number of ways.I honestly think this game and every other Assassins creed game in steam should be rated at least slightly higher because a lot of the negative reviews pertain to Ubisofts Uplay system rather than the Quality of the Game itself, that being said Reviews warning about Uplays screw ups are very helpful.11/10Would board Brits and Spaniards ships for their Booty again
