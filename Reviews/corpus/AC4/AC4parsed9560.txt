Black Flag is an excellent openworld adventure with a likeable protagonist. It is a comprehensive improvement over its lacklustre predecessor  Assassins Creed 3.  There are plenty of interesting side tasks to keep you busy for dozens of hours. The ship combat remains satisfying for just as long and ship upgrades feel worthwhile. While the campaign has a few poor eavesdropping missions, they are offset by quality, varied content. You can spend your time finding buried treasure, whale hunting, shipwreck diving, plundering convoys or basic assassinations. The Caribbean setting is the perfect change for the franchise and the engine produces a sublime atmosphere. AC4 is a truly impressive Pirate experience without the unpleasantness of Scurvy or Dysentery.
