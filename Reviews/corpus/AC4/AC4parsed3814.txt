I like the new pistols, outfits and the caribbean pirate theme and the story inside animus is quite interesting. The ship  sailing bring a new element to the game but they do take a bit to get used to and they dominate the game.Its still AC game, youll be doing the same generic tasks over and over again and the constant need to upgrade your ship and boy does it take some work to get those upgrade materials might turn you away from the game. Rope dart weapon felt very unnecessary as you unlock it only later on in the game and the diving bell missions were even worse. Sharks, really? This time around i really struggled to keep my interest for the real world plot as i was controlling some abstergo droid.While the dislike list is longer, i definitely recommend for the guaranteed AC experience but if you dont like ships, stay away from this one.
