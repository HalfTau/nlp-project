I love this game so much. After giving up mostly on the Assassins Creed series, I heard good things about this and picked it up on sale. Id been wanting a good pirate game for a long time and this absolutely delivered. First game since Red Dead Redemption that I got 100 completion on, I easily dumped at least 80 hours into the single player. It takes some minor tweaking with D3DOverrider to get running smoothly without screen tearing though, just a warning. It is for sure worth a pick up if its on sale.
