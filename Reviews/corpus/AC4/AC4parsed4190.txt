As an Assassins Creed game, Black Flag doesnt bring much new to the series. As a game on its own, however, I found it to be one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I have had in a long time. The gameplay is essentially the same as any other Creed game, with the addition of sailing and advanced naval combat, which is marvelously streamlined and satisfying. The star, Edward Kenway, is a far more interesting character than in previous installments, and I found a lot of enjoyment in meeting and reading about the various pirates of history in the carribean.Honestly, when I started this game, I cared very little for the simultaneous modern timeline story in which you play as an Abstergo Employee sifting through memories. Ive always found Creeds ongoing story to be a little tedious. The more I advanced in the game, though, the more attached and interested I became which is great, because thats how a game should be.My only complaint is in regard to combat, and its a small complaint. Occasionally when fighting larger groups of enemies, it can be very difficult to see the parry warning pop up, particularly when the enemy in question is out of your camera range. It was annoying at worst, but rarely an issue. Otherwise, combat was very smooth, almost on the level of the Arkham seriess freeflow engine.The music is absolutely fantastic, and features collectible shanties for your crew to sing while you sail.I really cant recommend this game enough. Even if you dislike Assassins Creed, but you like pirates, buy this game. If you like Assassins Creed, you simply HAVE to own this game.
