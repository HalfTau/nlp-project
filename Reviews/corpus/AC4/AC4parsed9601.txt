This is the best assassins creed game out and the way you can find and unlock items to add to your avatar is great.So the game has good fetchers in it the only problem I find is that the speech of the avatars in the video some before the actions of the avatars. this my by just me though but I think that needs to be fixed and also I have got the season pass but have not got to play as Adewale yet so I dont no if I have to complete the game are what or maybe this has to be fixed.
