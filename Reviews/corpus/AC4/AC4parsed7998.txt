Fun game,  kinda the same oldthough. Graphics have not improved since  3. Although the water is the most amazing water I have ever seen in a game. It is a good story and edward kenway is by far one of the best protagonist BUT the game is lacking in customization. You can only buy two handed swords and no axes or knives or nothing like that. The ship is not really that customizable besides a few things that you can do with it. All and all I would give this game a solid 8 out of 10 if you like the series go ahead and get it and you will not be bored within at least the first 60 hours.
