No, I cant recommend this game for the following reasons Optimization is nonexistant. I run newer games R6 Siege, Rise of the Tomb Raider, MiddleEarth Shadows of Mordor with more fps than this game. Sure it doesnt drop much below 30fps but it also doesnt rise much above it. IntelR CoreTM i54590 CPU  3.30GHz, AMD Radeon R9 270, 16 GB RAM, Windows 8, 64bit. Climbing mechanics HAVE NOT been improved since the first Assasins Creed game. Then it was allowed to have some issues with it because of the newness. But 4 games in, the issues shouldnt be existing anymore. So what am I talking about? The character not knowing which side is up, climbing on everything thats solid except the things that need to be climbed, clipping through walls and switching back and forth because theres a ing ledge. Combat isnt impressive, just counter theout of them with the occasional guard break, boohoo. 100 used to be difficult, because youd either need a map from the internet or like AC 2 and Brotherhood get yourself enough money to buy the treasure maps. Now, you enter a new city, find a viewpoint and go off to fetch everything. Im 3 hours in this game and havent even bothered with the story yet because of my 100 neurosis.Will I continue to play the game, I guess, but that only means the list can grow on.
