I lost interest in Assassins Creed as soon as it became a yearly installment. I loved AC1 and AC2, but when Brotherhood was released a year after AC2, I said  this series. Eventually I bought Brotherhood and Black Flag when they were on sale, because Ive heard good things about both.As far as Black Flag is concerned, the praise is well deserved. This game is like a cross between GTA and AC. Want to do your typical assassin stuff? Go right ahead. Want to sail the seas, pirating anything that comes in your path? Have at it. The naval combat is so much fun, that I barely play the story parts. Sailing around, exploring, upgrading your ship, and attacking the unfortunate souls that cross your path is exhilarating. This is a fantastic game, and worth playing for the unique experience alone.
