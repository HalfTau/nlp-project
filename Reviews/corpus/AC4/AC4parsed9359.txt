Black Flag is a step forward for the Assassins Creed series, I didnt warm to the ship segments of the previous assassins creed offering, as it seemed tacked on and not very assassin like however my opinion has swayed greatly. I was originally worried that the strong focus on ships would be the downfall of this offering in the series, however i find my self getting lost in scouring the oceans for battles completely forgetting the main story line. The storyline itself is entertaining, but personally not as strong as say assassins creed and assassins creed 2, but it does well to drive you forward to find out what happens. I can see myself playing this game for quite some time, the introduction of Initiates promises to offer endless replay value. All in all this is a fantastic game, if you like the series you will definately like this game.As a side note i love what Ubisoft are doing in ways of integrating the mobile platform into the actual game rather than it just being some crappy mobile game offering. Being able to view the map in real time on my phone as well as treasure maps and perform kenways fleet actions enhances the experience greatly.
