Very good storyline and gameplay. But its a shame that steam sells it. UPlay Ubisoft is in my opinion so bad that steam should not even deal with them to keep their own dignity. You buy the game and the problems with Uplay begin. First the wrong version is installed, You download the correct one and then the servers are down. Or there login does not work...Overall game Uplay
