The game itself may be good.But dependelig the launching on untrustwothy uplay, i coludnt play it at all.Selling the game which is unlaunchable via steam client alone is a shameless act, i think.i requested the refund.But never compensated the time i spend struggling to solve the problem in vain.PLEASE DONT SELL THE UNLAUNCHABLE GARBAGE!
