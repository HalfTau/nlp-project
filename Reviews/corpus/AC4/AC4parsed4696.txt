so by far one of my top AC games im wrighitng this review after finishing 100 of the game whitch was really fun btw but here we go, the game play and story where really well thoughtout, i liked the carictor building and the Jackdaw whitch im now going to build a modle of for my memrabilia collection i like the fact that there is so much to do and the best thing is you dont need to run around needeslee looking for colectables as there all marked on the map for you, i dowish that they had incoparated a coop mode as i would love to run around the seas plundering ships with my GF but there we go hopefully in a later game there will be that.over all 8/10 it loses points because the fleet is tediaus, the mini games are a waist of time and no coop, i would recormend this game to anyone wanting to be a pirate as its the best simulater so far that i have seen.
