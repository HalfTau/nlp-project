Incredible and beautiful game with some of the most stunning and epic sea battles. Unfortunately when it comes to the Assassins Creed part, this is not the best. You dont really feel truly emerged into the franchise and there is a huge lack of breathtaking close combat scenarios. The beauty of this game almost feels lost, when you get annoyed and frustrated of trivial naval battles, with no feeling towards the story telling. The plot itself is lacking content and is average. Shame, for what could have been a really great game. As an Assassins Creed game it is not amongs the best. As a Pirate game, its brilliant!
