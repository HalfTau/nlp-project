A billion times YES!This is one of my favorite games, not only in the series, but of all time.The story is well thought out, fighting along side some of the most feared pirates during the Age of Sail  Golden Age of Piracy. You go along and see Nassau built up and destroyed, you live the charles town run, the history involved is pretty near to accurate.The only downfall of the entire game is the inability to change your ship. Youre stuck with a Brig, but in the end.... Shes much stronger than a ManOWar. So, it kinda works out.If youve not played this game in the series because its Not the same without Desmond, then youre highly missing out. The game may not be an Assassins Creed game You know what I mean., but it is FUN. And you will find yourself coming back to the open seas just to sink or board a couple ships in years time after beating the game.
