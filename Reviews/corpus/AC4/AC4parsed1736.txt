The story is really ing bad, even the missions are like 80 stalking people. But  that, you didnt buy this for the story or anything like that, NO! You bought this game because you get to sail on a open world as a mother ing pirate!!! Board ships, take over island forts, fight Brittbong, Spain and many others, dive to collect treasures, go on treasures hunt from maps, fire big cannons on other ships and so much more!!!
