I havent got to the end of this game yet through the main missions, but Im already racking up the hours. Unlike AC3, I find myself constantly distracted by everything else this game has to offer. Thankfully, you do not have to spend much time in the realworld in this game, and it doesnt pull you out of the sequences as frequently as its predecessor  which is a great improvement. I am absolutely obsessed with it! Naval combat is thrilling and stragetic and I can connect better to Edward than Connor, and therefore the story too. No spoilers, but at the end of my latest mission, I was litteraly openmouthed IRL at what happened at the end of the cinematic. It really got me emotionally  and thats when you know youve found a good game.
