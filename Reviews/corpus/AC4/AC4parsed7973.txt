This is a great game.  Imagine if they turned Sid Miers Pirates! into an Assassins Creed game and youll get a bit of an idea of what to expect.  You become captain of your ship, free to sail where ever the wind may take you.  Obviously the map has its limits, but there is still plenty to do and see.  The sea battles take a little bit to get used to, but once you master this the game only gets better.  I can recommend this game to anyone who like Assassins, Pirates and plundering treasure.
