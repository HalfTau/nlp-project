AC4 is just as good as AC2, it literally brought the whole series back on track.The cities are not as beautiful as in Italy, but the storyline is amazing and touching. The naval battles are awesome.As a loyal fan of AC since the first game, this is just what I expect Ubisoft to bring out.I would totally recommend this game
