This is the first time since AC2 that I wanted to play an assassins creed game... and it does not dissapoint. It still has issues when your character doesnt listen to your commands and randomly scales a wall while you only wanted to run. And for some reason they kept the terrible follow your target while listening to conversations that dont matter missions. BUT by god the ship sections and the atmosphere this game creates is more than enough to keep my attention.
