A broken unplayable mess that does not save your progress.Ive now lost 25 hours of playtime on this... Every time i exit the game, it reverts my progress back to 2 completion.Apart from that, the control are absolutely horrible  combining the climbing and running buttons will, for example, result in a lot of chases ending with you dead because Kenway decided he wanted to run up and down that doorway for a few minutes instead of continuing down the street.
