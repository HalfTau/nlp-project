After my experiance with this game, or rather lack of experience because of Ubisoft, I will never  again purchase any Ubisoft products again. I tried for over an hour to even get the game to load. I searched all over the internet for a solution. I was getting posts from back in 2011 that had the same problem I was having. Some error with the Uplay, that you have to use, was not letting the game even start. It was then that I decided to get a refund and vow to never again buy thier products. If they cant fix software that you have to use to load thier games. An issue thats been happening for years. Well then I cant be bothered to buy thier products.
