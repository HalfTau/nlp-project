Interesting story line and playing the pirates life with the Assassins weapons and tactics is just brilliant. The new redesigned naval combat is outstanding and the weapon system of having two swords and like 4 guns is just great. I do miss some things they left out though from AC3 which is the bow and arrow. I miss that but there isnt much use of a bow and arrow for a pirate. You will always have a memorable moment when you board a damaged ship swing in and just clear a deck full of enemies. This story is mainly about Edward Kennaway pirate adventures than an assassins story/Desmonds story it has a few modern day interruptions but its very short. A few things I found wrong in this game was just that 1. Edward Kennaway main character I feel like he is slower than any other main characters from previous games like climbing up a building takes a longer time and it just gets annoying because you always have that feeling that you can climb super quick. 2. The game doesnt really feel like an Assassins Creed game because you work as a pirate than an assassin. And 3. Not a lot of stealthy ways to approach as there is no stealthy range except for a blowpipe that does not kill it just rages enemies or makes them go to sleep for awhile. Overall the game is great I recommend it!
