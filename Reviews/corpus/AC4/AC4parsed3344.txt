Literally the very first assassins creed game i liked and could bear to play. I bought Brotherhood as my first and it was awful in  my opinion. I decided to try black flag because my friend let me borrow it. I had nothing to lose, so i played it. Years later i own 3 copies of the game one for xbox 360, one for xbox one, and now steam. The game is very unique, and absolutely love the fact you can get a ship and customize it to become the scourge of the seas. I just like to sail on my ship and destroy everything in my way, while harpooning animals for my armor
