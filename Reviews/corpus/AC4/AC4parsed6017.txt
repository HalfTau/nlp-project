YAAARRRRRR!!! Shiver me timbers! This be the best Assassins Creed game this old sea dog has ever played!In all seriousness though, this game is awesome. The best part is sailing the Carribean and getting into ship battles, you get to listen to your crew sing pirate songs sea shanties, the islands look beautiful and the graphics are good, except for on the character models. You get to assassinate/kill Spaniards and the British redcoats. Being a pirate is awesome, upgrading your ship is awesome, sword fights are cool and can be challenging if youre not careful. You can hunt animals and skin their hides to craft upgrades, like pistol holsters or increase your health bar... what more can I say? If theres any Assassins Creed game you should have in your library its this one. Sail the high seas on a swashbuckling pirate adventure!Fifteen men on the dead mans chest...Yohoho, and a bottle of rum!Drink and the devil had done for the rest...Yohoho, and a bottle of rum!
