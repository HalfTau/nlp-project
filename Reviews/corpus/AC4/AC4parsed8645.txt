Literally one of the best Assasins Creed Game i have played. The ship and sea just adds that extra little touch so that it does not have a repetitive gameplay like the others. Also the Kenways Fleet has a smart phone app so you can manage wherever you are and if you have friends they/you can assist them in the journeys.Overall, if you are a fan of Assasins Creed Its worth the investment.
