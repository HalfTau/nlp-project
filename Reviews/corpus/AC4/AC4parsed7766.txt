OK, I admit that although I enjoyed all the other AC games a lot of them were almost the same in quite a few ways, just different story and enviroment and a few more mechanics. THIS one however is amazing. The ship combat is amazing, there is so much ocean to explore, and you actualy have something to spend cash on now that matters more. AND the game can now actually be called a stealth game  something that SHOULD be important for something called assassins creed... right? oh yeah and its one of the only stories in the game that isnt about vengeance. so thats nice. Anyway, great buy even if you havent played the others, and an amazing one if you have
