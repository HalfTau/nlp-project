This might be the best pirate game ever made. Its a soso Assassins Creed titleAt the time of writing, Ive played 59.4 hrs. Id say 30 hours of that is sailing the open sea.I absolutely loved this game and the fact that Ubisoft actually tried something different.Prepare to literally set sail across the open sea looking for plunder be it sunken treasure, Spanish/British Treasure Galleons, or release hell from your broadside cannons on enemies forts.All the while listening to crew singing sea shanties and your praises capn!The gunplay and swordplay are very good and satisfying.You sail from island to island playing the singleplayer gathering crewmates. After a while you can capture ships and add them to your fleet. Basically other assassins like you had in AC Brotherhood. These ships can go off and do cargo missions and give ya more booty.So if youre looking for a Pirate game you have to pick this up.For fans of the in my opinion weakening Assassins Creed narrative, this game is somewhat lacking. Its still leaps and bounds better than Assassins Creed III.
