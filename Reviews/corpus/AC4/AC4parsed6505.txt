Loved the game, HOWEVER one thing annoyed me so much was the fact that I lost my 80 progression due to the issue with uplay servers and their save mechanic.This fact annoyed me so much because I did not finish the story and went for almost all the collectives in the game!! I invested so much time as a hardcore fan in the series to try and complete the game 100, and after spending atleast more than 100 hours in game, uplay decides to screw me over with removing all of my saves out of nowehre.I will still recommend the game, since they added some new mechanics to the series. But to be honest the uplay server forcing had a huge impact on me for the worse.
