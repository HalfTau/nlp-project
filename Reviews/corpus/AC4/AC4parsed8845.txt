I really enjoyed this game ... it still has some of the usual tropes of an ACV game following npcs, eavesdropping and a couple chase sequences but they are toned down a bit and those annoyances are overshadowed by the pirate theme of the game, the shantys while at sea and the ship combat/exploration.  Very much recommend this game.
