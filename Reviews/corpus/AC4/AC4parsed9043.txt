Do not, I repeat not take bad reviews into account. This game is fantastic. The combat is great with many new adaptions and the seafaring concept of the game is impeccable. If you were a fan of Assassins creed III, you will love this game. It is actually a better and more fun game then III. The only fault would be if you dont have a computer/laptop with enough RAM to run this game is may be a bit choppy but you can fix that by turning the graphics down. It was worth the money paid 10 times over and it is one of the most fun games I have every played. If I were to tell you to buy two games on Steam I would say ,  Buy Assassinss Creed 4 Black Flag, and The Elder Scrolls Skyrim.
