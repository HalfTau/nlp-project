For all of yall who are making NO reviews because the game isnt working, please dont. Reviews are meant for the gameplay. So, In my opinion this has got to be the best assassin creed game ever. The story for both the animus and irl. I played this game all the time until i beat it. There is so much to do in this game, i collected 100 in the game too. And if you want to do that a tip is, dont finish the main quest before you do everything else. I can promise most of you guys will get bored. So do most of the side stuff like contracts, hunting, exploring ect...Even when i finished the game i got another assassin creed game simular to it, but it wasnt the same, story was good though. But yea, would defo advise you guys to play this amazing game that I love so much. was so sad when i finished it.1010 bmfs
