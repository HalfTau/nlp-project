In this game you play as captain pirate of the caribbean and you upgrade your boat to kill a lot of other boats. A really good game, and im not just saying that because i am some sort of pirate and i dont mean the type that copies copyrighted material  . However the segments where you play as futureboy are utterly useless, and i real wish the AC series would quit that sheet.
