For a very long time, I have considered Assassins Creed Brotherhood to be my favorite game in the entire Assassins Creed franchise. When Assassins Creed 3 was initially announced, I was very excited, seeing a brand new game engine and character. However, like many others who played the game, I became very disappointed. Because of this, I was not excited about Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag. I decided to try the game out when it was on sale during the holiday sale, and I regret nothing. This game is everything I wanted in an Assassins Creed game. My problems with other games in the series tends to be that eventually, I feel like I have run out of things to do. I have yet to approach such a wall in this game. From the naval combat to the hunting, there is always more to do. Because of this, I feel like my favorite game in the Assassins Creed franchise is now Black Flag. It is worth every penny that it costs. The only downside to this game is the Uplay interface. Anyone who has purchased other games from Ubisoft for the PC know how the games require Uplay to be launched, so it tends to be just more crap to deal with. However, it does not negatively affect the actual gameplay.
