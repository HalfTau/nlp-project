Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is by far the best Assassins Creed I have played to date!Lets start off with the pros The visuals are absolutely stunning, though I question how optimized it is since some objects in the game seem to make me       stutter, whereas large views dont. The ship battles are by far the most defining moment of the beauty of this game, the giant waves in a massive storm whilst your men yell and run around desperately trying to man the cannons as some 100 gun Spanish Ship of the line chases you! The map is absolutely huge. I was expecting a lot of sea and not very big islands and cities, however I was proved wrong within the first 20 minutes of seeing Havana and the scale of the first island Cities have a lot, and I mean a lot to do. I think I wont put this down for a while!Cons The same ol same ol land combat. Eavesdropping missions, following missions, kill the one dude from this position, collect this item without being seen, but on their defense, what else is there to do? Stuttering visuals due to some possibly unoptimized object/texture? Not sure. Running a higher than average rig. i5, gtx 670, 8gb, etcOverall, definitely buy this game. The story has started over and its a breath of fresh air to finally see an amazing pirate game since Sid Meiers Pirates and Cutthroats in the 90s!
