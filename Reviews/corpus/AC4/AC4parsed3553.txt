All these collectibles. When i started out i was determined to collect all of them. But very soon i realized its not really worth my time climbing, jumping and sailing around the world for these ridiculus items.I have played Assassins Creed since the start, and i always found the main story interesting. However i have always thought that the game is way to easy, and the whole fightingsystem looks good but is not at all challenging. I still play them all through, but halfways through the game i always get so bored and end up powergaming until done.This game is no different. Even though i had some expectation about the whole shipthing. But its still quite easy, and just like the previous games i ended up powergaming.The good Storyline is good. Simular to all other games of the series, but those were good as well. Graphics are nice The scenery is beautiful, as always Fighting is always fun on Assassins Creed, up until you get the hang of it and it is way too easy. Naval combat was nice, but too simple when you start to understand to use the mortar.The bad Way too easy, and the collectibles are stupid. The sidemissions are so frustrating. Always the same, and always so far to travel. Overall there is no interesting storytelling besides the main plot. And of course the whole open world that still is not very open since the only interesting part of the game is the main mission. Not to forget that there are no choices to make, everything in linear and on autopilot on that part.I will not reccomend this unless its on sale for a cheap price or if you are a die hard fan.
