Really wanted an openworld pirate game, but couldnt stand the gameplay.  The game looked great though.  Very scenic.This is coming from someone with no previous experience with the franchise and, apart from the pirate angle, little interest. I am looking for a great openworld pirate game, but this game does not rise to the challenge due to the wierd Assassins Creed game mechanics.If you are not familiar with and like the Assassin Creed games, this may not be the game you are looking for.
