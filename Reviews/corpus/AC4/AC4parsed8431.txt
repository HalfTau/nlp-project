A solid and compelling story, stunning graphics and visuals, and amazing gameplay naval and land. A new chapter in the infamous Assassins Creed series has been written, and it is great. Overall, few bugs and few reasons too hate it. However.....it has a hard time balancing the No rules lifestyle of piracy and the strict discipline of the Assassin Order, also I am a little disappointed in the games ending, it seems rether abrupt. Overall, its great, like anything it has its flaws, but it does a great job of keeping you entertained. 9/10.
