Let me start off by saying I was never interested in the Assassins Creed series when they started to come out. I saw friends playing the early games and thought Eh not for me. And I felt the same way when Black Flag came out. Ah, just another Assassins Creed I thought. Then I went to a friends house and saw him playing around on his ship. He explained to me how his crew could sing sea shanties, collected treasure, and you could customize your ship. He let me play the game a bit, and I instantly got hooked.I purchased the game, played all the way through it, got nearly every achievement, upgraded everything to the max, and Im thrilled and happy that I did.What I love about this game more than anything, is that a player who has NO IDEA whats going on with Assassins Creed, like the different factions and what they stand for, and basically everything leading up to it, is completely fine to play this game because the main character is just like you. He doesnt know whats going on, and he finds out as YOU find out.If this game was filled with Oh you shouldve played the second game to understand what they are talking about here or This wont make any sense unless you played the sequel to this other game in the franchise  I wouldve hated it. Instead, you follow along and discover what the game is about as the main character does. Its fantastic, absolutely.I found myself sailing in my ship at the slowest speed in calm waters at night with a full moon on the horizon as the crew sings a song, mourning over a lover whos died and was seen in their dreams. Its peaceful, its beautiful, and the enviornment is stunning.I often tell myself, I wish I could forget everything this game ever was so I could replay it and experience it for the first time all over again. If you have any doubts, set them all aside and just play this game. If you love pirates, a wonderful story, and an escape from reality at home, this is the perfect game for you.
