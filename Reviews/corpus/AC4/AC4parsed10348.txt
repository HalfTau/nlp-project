Best iteration of the series since ACBro. Ive loved all the games in the AC series, and I love this one too. Purely as a pirate game it is probably the best pirate game ever with its only competition being Sid Meiers Pirates! 2004. With the globetrotting Assassins Creed storyline, and a ton of sidequests, this game is one of the most satisfying Ive played in recent memory. Also, lots of character, ship, and hideout customization, which is nice.
