Black Flag does three monitors right. Menus are kept on the central screen, exactly how they should be. Far too many PC games arent optimized for this at all. Crysis 3, for example, puts your minimap and ammo indicators on the far left and far right corners of the side monitors, making them nearly useless. Titanfall just gets rid of the entire UI completely. Even during menus where nothing is really going on, the side screens are made to just show an animus animation thats continuous with the background animation going on behind the normal menu.During cutscenes and such, the view cuts down to the single central monitor I guess thats just how they designed the cutscene. But whenever this happens, the view on the side monitors is replaced by black screens that slide in, from the left and right, narrowing the view with an animation. When the cutscene is over, the larger view expands back into existence almost seamlessly. The side screens dont just pop in and out of existence. Its strange I wouldnt have thought that would make such a difference, but it really does.Going back to playing the game at 1080p feels weird during the onfoot segments, just because of the significantly decreased view of whats around you, but it plays well enough. However, playing the ship segments at 1080p feels incredibly constrained, now. I feel like I can barely see whats going on around me.This is probably my best experience with triple monitor gaming so far. I highly recommend this game.
