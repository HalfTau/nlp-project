The game shows a great open world and a good gameplay. The fighting system is a bit too easy i think but other than that it is great fun to explore the big world and many missions. In terms of story i found this one not as catching as AC 3, and of course not even close to part 2. The grafic looks good nothing to fancy but also far away from bad looking.All in all i give the game a 8/10A good game
