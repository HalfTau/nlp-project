Ok so let me preface this by saying something that fans of the franchise wont like, the Assassins Creed series is just stupid.I played the first and didnt think much of it , the second was alright but then I lost complete interest after that with their convoluted storylines and recycled game mechanics. Ubi continued to march out their yearly cash machine and I was amazed at how they seemed content to just keep making the same game over and over again.Then........Black Flag happened.Now up to that point Sid Meyers Pirates had come pretty close to being the perfect pirate game and people always had that to fall back on if they felt the sudden urge to scream Arrgh Matey while gaming . With the release of Black Flag the perfect pirate game had been accomplished, and what was infinetly more important was that the ridiculous Assassins storyline had been abandoned for a classic pirate tale albeit one where Edward Kenway just didnt give a sh!t about the Assassins or Templars and just wanted to do some proper piracy.As far as having to give the game a score to reflect my feelings about it, I would say half point deducted just for being an Assassins game it should have just been a new IP called Black Flag and it could have been the new yearly milking machine on its own, and another half point deducted just for that stupid immersion breaking lets go back to the game developers office for the most galactically stupid side story ever sequences, leaving it with a solid 9/10.The naval warfare and ship boarding alone could have been its own game, but with everything else it was the magnus opus of the Assassins Creed series.Then they went back to being stupid again for the following 4 games.Life is weird eh?
