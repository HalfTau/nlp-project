I havent played many Assassins Creed games since the 1st one. I got this because a decent free roaming pirate game had been on my mind for a long time and it didnt just deliver it blew my mind. I personally havent had any problem with saves or bugs but be cautious because i know some people have. I definately recommend this and if you want to play it safe grab it on console so you dont have to worry about the issues alot of people have had. This might be my favorite game this year.
