One of the best if not the best Assassins Creed games I have played. Everything about this game is amazing!Graphics are amazing!Gameplay is marvelous with all those ships battles , discovering islands , side missions all of it!Story dindt feel as great as Ezios story but still you can be invested in it!Edward Kenway is a great Assasin!Overrall this game was a blast from start to finish! I enjoyed every aspect of the game maybe only the story could have been better!I give this game a 9/10 .
