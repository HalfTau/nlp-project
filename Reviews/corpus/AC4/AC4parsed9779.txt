As a longtime fan of the Assassins Creed series, I found myself thoroughly enjoying this game from start to finish. It features a beautiful, expansive, seamless openworld to explore and the story is very entertaining. Theres plenty to do here, with a plethora of collectibles and sidemissions/activites in single player, plus the great multiplayer, youre looking at easily 50 hours of gameplay. After sessions on multiple platforms, the PC version is unquestionably the definitive experience.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend anyone purchase this game. This is as a result of the Uplay client youre forced to use, due to Ubisofts greedy DRM, being poorly designed garbage.Among many other issues, the way it handles save files is just patheticly outdated. The cloud save system doesnt work for many games, despite being advertised as a feature, and reinstalling the client deletes ALL local save files. Ive lost hundreds of hours in multiple games, including Watch Dogs and Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag, because of this terrible oversight.TLDR, the Uplay client and Ubisoft DRM is despicable and, much like EAs Origin service, being forced to use it severely devalues any associated game. Give your money to a more deserving developer.
