What can I say? This is a marvellous game. Pirates! Boarding enemy ships! I think this could be the best Assassins Creed game in the series.We play as Edward Kenway, a man who wants to see his pockets full of coins and will stop at nothing to acheive that goal. Coming from England, he wants to try his luck as a privateer. Yes... a privateer, of course...One day, an unexpected event changes his life forever. He is now aware that something called The Observatory exists and if he can find it before any other, hell be the richest man of the seven seas.Where do Templars and Assassins fit in this plot?
