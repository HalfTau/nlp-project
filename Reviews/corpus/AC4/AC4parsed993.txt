Pretty good game, the sailing is fantastic and the exploration is fun. The map is huge but it occasionally suffers from Skyrim syndrome where you have to go around massive things to get to your destination. The missions can get tedious and frustrating, but incredibly satisfying when you sneak past those 500 guards using only bushes. So far 8.5/10 , definitely worth the money.
