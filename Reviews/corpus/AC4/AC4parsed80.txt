By far one of the best ACs. The ending struck me out. I actually didnt expect it.More of a Pirate game than a AC game though, but still well executed,Although, the games performance was a real big down side drops to 2030fps at times, but i guess it could be worse. Running GTX 1060, 16GB Ram, all the settings where on high, apart from motion blur, because  motion blur I do recommend this game however, it wasnt that frequent. Only really happened to me when I was out sailing.I wouldnt wait for a sale, I mean, its only 22, youd be having atleast 30 hours of story line to do and thats if you rush it like I did. Not to mention the side quests and other objectives.
