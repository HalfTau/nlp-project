I looked long and hard at this game, watched a friend play it for 3 weeks before I just couldnt take it any more. This has to be the best all around game out there right now. taking nothing away from GTA 9.5/10 the .5 is because Uplay is a bit funky? It plays great on my HP laptop and I having a blast. More to follow but yea Worth every penny if you can get it now. Oh and I do recomend the gold Package. That way you get the season pass. I bet there is more on the horizon for this game and Ill be right there.
