Best AC that I played since Brotherhood.The ship battles really sucked me in.Storywise its typical AC  You go from Plotpoint to plotpoint without ever knowing whats really going on.Fighting system is again very counter heavy but OK.All in all the carribean City and all the shiprelated things are what makes this game very enjoyable.
