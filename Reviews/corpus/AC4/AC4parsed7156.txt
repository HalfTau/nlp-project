Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is a breath of fresh air into the AC series. AC3 was a fairly dry game and AC4BF definitely was the comeback! Whether youre sticking with the classic upgrade your assassins weapons or want to upgrade your vessel youll be having a blast with this game. If you did not like the sea battles and sea missions in AC3 I encourage you to still give this game a shot. Even though a great portion of your time is out on the water with your crew, the mechanics of sailing in this game compared to the former are two different stories. For me it was simple, once I got to the mission where you assembled your crew and got your boat I fell in love with the game. In no time youll be singing the sea shanties and scavenging sunken vessels for treasure. Great game to play, Sad game to finish it will only leave you wanting more. So weigh anchor lad/lass, a grand adventure awaits!P.S. The water in this game is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!
