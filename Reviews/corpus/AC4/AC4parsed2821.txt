One of the beat AC games. I feel it has quite a lot of filler content, but all of it is optional and shouldnt hamper the experience of rushy players. Ships are fun, and upgrades and challenges will keep you sailing, though it can get repetitive. Storywise, I felt compelled to finish it, for it gives you a fresh new take on ACs universe. Combat was fun, but felt bland in comparison with previous games.
