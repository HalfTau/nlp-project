I have never liked Assasins Creed games, they just were not my style of gameplay. However, this is by far one of the best pirate/ship combat simulators that has come out to date. In addition the Assasins creed movement style has added a sense of fluidity to games that I have not experienced yet.That being said, the sea combat is still somewhat limited and after awhile it will grow stale. It gives you a taste of what could be, without being it. You cant change ships, the upgrades are few, and you cant trade between ports.That being said this is still an incredible game and I found when I got bored of one aspect, there was another aspect I could throw myself into.
