What can I say... i have always loved the PoP series and this franchise is just like it.This time you get pirates and wonderful gameplay.Some say its full of glitches, but from my experience I have never encountered any during my full gameplay not even with the uPlay launcher. Everything run smoothly.The history is not as interesting as the previous ones maybe because im a desmond fan and hate how the get rid of that part, it was like my reward after completing the game to get to know a little more about those who came before.Hate the modern world part in this game, the hacking.. ugh I wanted to crank my balls when I couldnt get an extra, but its an obsession to get it all of the history.I still hope forAC Those who came before or AC the rise of Juno or AC the first assassin or some setting from the long lost first civilization.
