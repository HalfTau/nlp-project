Id grown a little tired of the AC series and really hadnt seen anything worthwile since AC 2. That changed with the naval combat in AC3. AC4 took this concept and ran with it! Naval battles, assasination contracts and setting has made me get lost in this world. Still havent touched the MP section. For all its pros, there are some cons. The stealth following/instant fail missions can get very infuriating in some cases. Otherwise its a solid story and game that I highly recommend.
