I want to like this game a lot because it does some things really well, but the movement is absolutely atrocious. Running also enables climbing so if you board a ship and want to move around fast, you might also start climbing boxes and get stuck for a splitsecond until you jump off. Navigating streets and rooftops pose the same problem, if you get too close to something, you get latched onto it. If running and climbing were bound to different keys, Id play this game way more than I have, but as it stands, its insufferably unplayable.
