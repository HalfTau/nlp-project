DO NOT BUY. UPLAY makes the game unplayableThese days I have very little time for myself, so i really do not want to spend one hour trying to start a game.While starting it stated that uplay detected an unusual pattern in my signins ?? or something. My password was not working. Spend an hour trying to recover and get online cause otherwise the game crashes at startup. Got banned for trying to access my game. Had to wait 10 mins again and again.I quit for now and will check how can i get a refund. Totaly not worth it.Do not buy due to uplay being terrible. No idea how the game is, dont really care anymore.
