Refreshingly better then the last few Assassins Creed games but I cant help but think this series is in decline.Black Flag is definately better then Assassins Creed 3 and Revelations, but imo the series peaked at Assassins Creed 2 and theyve been doing little more then stamping out sequals for cash since.The navel combat introduced in Assassins Creed 3 has been polished and is now a main focus in this installment of the series if you are a fan of the Assassins Creed series then this one wont dissapoint you, however the epic feel this series used to have is just gone and probably wont ever come back.
