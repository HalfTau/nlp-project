I have not played a single game for 10 years because i didnt have a system to support it. I used COMPLETE assassins creed 2 series. This game doesnt feel like an upgrade since AC2, the hidden blades have nothing special, there are so little weapons to unlock and buy, the battle system is so easy. AC2 used to have heavys that you cannot shoot or anything, you had to go in and break them down. This game just seems so easy and incomplete, i feel like id have to buy more DLCs to unlock more content. Its really my fault thou, haven being in the gaming world for 10 over years, most games now come incomplete, having to buy more DLC or content.Game overall runs fine, its fun at times but there seems to lack that AC vibe to it. Id say 3 out of 5 stars, too little content like weapons/guns basically thats it you can only buy a sword or gun.... too little upgrades, the combat system is really easy for me.....
