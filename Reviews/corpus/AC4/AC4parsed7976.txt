Assassins Creed IV Black Flag has the same assy gameplay as Assassins Creed II, cept now there are pirate battles as well. Only buy this game if youre a dumbass who enjoys lapping up the same crap every year.You might then be asking, Why are you giving it a thumbs up then? Well, because Im a dumbass, and even with the crappy fighting mechanics, the boring and sometimes frustrating repetitive missions, the myriad of glitches, and the poor AI, I still end up enjoying the AssCreed games somehow. Its that damn modern day storyline. Thankfully, this one was stupider than the last games. This game is an improvement over III, so there is that. The pirate gameplay and storyline are actually pretty okay at times. Its a shame that the regular, onfoot gameplay hasnt advanced in nearly half a decade.6/10, its okay.
