Take this review with a grain of salt Im coming at this game never playing an AC game before and more wanting to play it because I wanted to play a cool Pirate game.That all being said, Im absolutely loving this game. Every side activity is fun and hasnt gotten old. This ship battles and boarding enemy ships are the clear highlight of AC4. Ive probably boarded 30 ships and its still fun. Taking forts is equally as fun. Traveling to new islands and looking for buried treasure is super interesting.The story is kind of whatever. Thankfully the real world abstergo stuff is held to a minimum. Very unabtrusive. The character dialogue is funny though. I love listening to Kenway and other Pirates just crack wise with one another.Overall, totally worth buying. Im loving it and cant wait to play more.
