This game blew me away. There was so much to do in this game and the world is huge. It does not beat AC 2 yet, but definitely the second best game in the series so far.Naval combat, contrary to popular belief, is extremely fun. The game was well laid out, an amazing story, amazing graphics and gameplay. 10/10 would play another 60 hours of this game again.
