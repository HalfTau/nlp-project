This was my most favourite Assassins Creed Game. A lot of side quests are available and can be easy achieved without having to progress a lot in the main story. Sidequests including fishing, hunting prey, looking for secrets, chests and treasure maps including lots of treasures.The app me using Android Tablet worked fine with the game. Kenways fleet can be managed while climbing, assassinating and hunting ships.This review does not rate multiplayer because I hate competitive mp, and the Freedom Cry DLC, which I havent play by now
