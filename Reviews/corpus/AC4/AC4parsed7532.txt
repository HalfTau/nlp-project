This game has its flaws. The controls are sometimes confusing and esoteric, the enemy AI is both incurably stupid, and doggedly persistent, and one does not know the meaning of the word frustrating until one sees protagonist, Kenway, get stuck trying to run up a wall over and over again when trying to pass through an adjacent doorway. All of those flaws, however, fall away when you get behind the wheel of your ship. There is something deeply moving and thrilling about having the wind at your sails, watching your ship rocket over rogue waves or cruse the blue waters of the Caribbean. And there are few gaming experiences more satisfying than watching a full broadside of cannons cut an enemy ship to splinters. For the part of the game spent captaining the Jackdaw alone, I would highly recommend this game.
