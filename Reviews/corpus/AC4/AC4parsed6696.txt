Gonna keep this really short.Pros.The map is incredible. So many cities, so many islands...PARKOUR PARKOUR PARKOURStoryline is really engaging, nothing compared to AC2 but if your an AC fan, youll love it.Heaps of collectables!Cons.The fighting animations are EXACTLY the same as AC3, apart from the new dual swords and a couple of hidden blade moves. I was really disappointed seeing the exact same handtohand animations and cinematic double kills. Not to mention the cinemetic double kills no longer have the awesome handheld camera feel.Fighting is too easy Sorrounded by 20 guys.Attack Counterattack Attack Counterattack Attack Counterattack Attack CounterattackSorrounded by a bruteDisarm Attack AttackThe game is around 50 ship based. Not going to say this is a con but this lies inbetween as some missions were quite fun.Overall, 8/10. Would highly recommend for all fans/gamers/players.
