AC4 stands out from previous AC installments from its nearperfect execution of naval warfare and exploration. However, AC4s heavy use of naval warfare/exploration detracted from the traditional AC yourinahistoricaltime/placehavefun feeling. AC4 is an important game in the franchise as it serves as epilogue for the series lead protagonist Desmond Miles. Although AC4 showed that it can make a character feel real through hidden messages, it severely lacked the depth previous AC games had involving the lead protagonist outside of the animus. Inside of the animus AC4 showed it had some ideas on developing a more compelling character then it ever had before. Which it did by breaking the traditional AC linear character progression by adding an internal character development not solely based on impersonal events.For a veteran of the AC franchise the feeling of a halfbaked AC game will be ever present in its externalanimus storyline culminating in a somber and anticlimactic ending. But its still aof fun
