Bought this game from the Summer Sale knowing little about it, other than some positive reviews.I can say with some confidence that it has been well worth the purchase.... had I known the scale of the game I would have bought it presale as I believe it to be worth every cent.The game throws you into it from the start giving you control of a ship under attack and the learning curve isnt too difficult which provides for some seemless play. It does take a little time into the campain before you can really spread you wings and explore the open world but once you can... the game takes on a whole other dimension.10/10 from me so far.
