Amazing game and personally my favourite assassins creed, never got into ezios story because the setting didnt appeal to me, good story but everything about Assassins Creed 4 rubs me in a good way. Played several hours on consoles, with 80 completion so decided to buy on PC as well, better graphics but optimization is a bit poor, not game breakng but it can be annoying.... might want to play with shadows but ive got everything else on max. PS i can run games like battlefield 4, GTA V and Redout Max settingsStory  9/10Combat  !0/10Content  10/10Difficulty  2/10, this game is so not hard, unless were talking about ship battles then 8/10,  not super hard but mad pleasing leveling up your ship to take on the big guns!!!Bonus points for THAT ENDING SCENE THO, TEARSBLACKBEARD!!!!!!!!!
