Before I say anything else... this game is better than AC III and is a must own from the AC series. Okay, I kind of have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love the time period, all the famous pirates encountered, the naval combat is so much fun, perhaps the best AI ever in series, crafting from the sister game Far Cry 3, great acting, superb graphics, and then the story sigh. The writers did a wonderful job rewriting history but... it was a bit awkward at points. Like how did this result from that or why do I have to kill this guy... just because hes in relation to this guy? I mean come on. A little harsh on the Creed in this one. But for the sake of History, it all fell into place perfectly so I cant be too harsh apon that. I would have to give this game an 8.5/10. If the story was better, then easily a 9 minimum! If you love the AC series and/or pirates, this is a must own game and you will enjoy it
