You want my honest opinion on this game? It is Seriously, this game is just bad.The moment I started playing, I was thrust onto a ship under siege and my first task is to get to the ships wheel. I noticed a lot of the npcs were just lying on the floor and constantly shifting about, an obvious glitch. When I got to the wheel, I interacted with it and my character was stuck. I could look around but the game did not seem to progress to let me control the ship. I died due to this. Worked the second time and I managed to get as far as chasing the assassin before I noticed huge frame rate drops. I decided to mess around with the graphics, and after exiting, the game crashed. So far this has been 30 minutes of annoying game glitches.I finally carry on while struggling with the horrible frame rate. When I am let loose in the city, I need to chase some thief with my new buddys loot. Free run in this game is disgusting, Seriously! I could not chase him well as my character was just latching onto walls and buildings everywhere, and this also vastly slowed me down as I had to wait for a long animation of my character climbing a wall before I could fall. I decided to completly stop playing this mess when I had to infiltrate a keep by climbing a side wall. I just could not complete this task with the bad climbing and insanely clunky controls. Moving your character in this game is just painful.This game uses Uplay, has horrible frame rate issues, more glitches then you could imagine and is horrible to control. This was a waste of the 7.99 I spent on this title. I would not recommend this disgusting game to anyway. Shame that it is another pirate game ruined by horrible gameplay.
