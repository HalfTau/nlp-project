A definate stand out in the series, possibly the best.  AC4 strips away the what was clunky about the previous title.  By pullling the camera back again giving a wider range with the big open environments we can finally fully appreciate what a next gen Assassins Creed game can bring.The world is huge giving more than enough to exlpore after completion and ofter has you wondering far off the main storyline to persue your own interest.  As a pirate you can truly go anywhere or go at whatever you want.  Side tasks and optional missions are no longer a grind and instead have you going on just to persue them.Another cool thing is the AC4 Black Flag Companion App which syncs with your game.  While playing you can use your Andriod device for World Map and Treasure Maps.  Youre also able to run your naval fleet remotely for shipping runs or look through the animus database.
