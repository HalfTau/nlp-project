Its by no means perfect, framerates are still iffy, and has a few mission bugs here and there. But it is a full blast to play, and there is quite a bit to do and explore.What this game did is took the naval battles of 3, made them a focal point, and expanded on it. And Ive got to say it is the most fun in a naval game I have had in a long long time. So many hours have already been lost just sailing around and fighting everyone I see, and Im willing to bet countless more will fall into the fun whirlpool of a game known as Assassins Creed 4.
