Very good departure from the tired AC formula. Leaving the stealth elements to a bare minimum and focusing on naval combat and exploration of the caribbean makes this a worthwhile standalone game if not very assassins creedy one. The present time storyline manages to be little more than an anchor hindering your progress through the game and its passable actual story and characters. To quote Deadpool Hes not here ten seconds before he starts boring us with his dire warningfromthefuture crap! Seriously Ubisoft, just drop it and pretend it never existed and everyone will be happy. Other than the story, combat is entertaining enough for the duration of an average playthrough but is a bit on the easy side again, an issue that seems to haunt AC games for all eternity. It looks very cool and the finishers feel satisfyingly brutal, but it really needs some challenge to it. Best point of the game is definetly the naval combat, which feels pretty epic and took the majority of my playtime. Boarding the ships is okay, what with the occasional, no wait, constant crew members hacking you in the back and generally being in the way of cleaning the deck effectively. But despite its many flaws I had fun with this title, more so than previous ACs. Maybe not worth the launch price which I paid but good game overall.
