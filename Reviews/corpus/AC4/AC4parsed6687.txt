This is by far the best Assasins Creed game in the series so far IMO. I originally played the first one, and just couldnt get into it, but this one has a great story, and its even partially historically accurate. I also like the fact that I can max out the graphics settings looks great!. This is a classic, if you want a really good pirate simulator, then get this game, you wont regret it.
