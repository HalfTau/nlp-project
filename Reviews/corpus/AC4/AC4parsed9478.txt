The game didnt start off bad and the ideas it had were pretty epic except it dislikes saving the game in any aspect of the idea.Though the saving game icon appears, it actually doesnt save a thing. If you use the online it will backtrack the save file and remove the old save causing hours of lost progression. When looking for solutions, there apparently is no problem and the game is working fine according to the company though Ive spotted so many that have the issue.There are several bugs and glitches and the amount of optimization is actually limited, not to mention you run out of things to buy pretty fast.Overall the game was a good idea but the customer support, tech issues and lack of love for the PC community make this game flop shy of greatness.
