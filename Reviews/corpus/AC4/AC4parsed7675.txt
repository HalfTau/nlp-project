1 The Steam bit is really only a link to Uplay.2 Uplay is just about the most terrable peice of software short of something actually malicious.3 Its frozen and crashed SO many times!4 When it manages to not crash it chugs like all balls  1080p/medhigh graphics on a i7  760 and isnt pretty enough to justify it.5 For my first AC on PC the controls are clunky and clearly meant for a controller.The gameplay is fun but way too much hastle to actually get to any.Im just glad I didnt pay full price for it.
