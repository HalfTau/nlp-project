This is a very good game. The story isnt too cliche, and the game is packed to the brim with content. Even though there are a lot of the same types of side missions, they dont feel repetitive. I would recommend this game, and would consider playing to 100 completion. It is, however, a hard to love port. My 970 Gaming and i56500 could only play at 30fps with Vsync on. If you can play without it, the gameplay manages to overcome its inefficiencies.
