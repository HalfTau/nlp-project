This is basically the best AC since II, bringing a relatable and charismatic character, that at first does not interest himself at the whole assassins deal, new mechanics Naval Combat and Exploration as the foundation of the game, a great soundtrack the sea shanties touch me deep down, mostly Spanish Ladies, an heartfelt ending, a great rooster of characters, Fort combat. There are a few issues, here and there, like enemies role narrowing down the fluidity of combat, or Ubisoft trying to spread collectables all over the map to make it feel alive. Other than that, this is a great title with endorsement of the community on this purchase. JUST DO IT.
