Recommended.I decided to pick this up after finishing Rise of the Tomb Raider, given this game seem to be somewhat similar in the basic concepts. It differs in the enviroment and the approach, goals and so forth though,  but naturally I didnt expect anything else. Still, somewhat odd setup for controllers mess it up a bit for me, interaction f.x. is B wich usually in other games means cancel or back out with an Xbox controller. For those used to Assassins Creed I doubt its much of an issue though.If you have the GPU for it, this game can really look beatiful though, and sounds complement it to give you a very good experience and feeling of the caribbean, it really does. Graphics and sound considered Im almost expecting to smell the salty air and sweating spaniards. For a Nvidia GPU with downscaling it can actually look really smashing, depending on your settings I suppose.Drawbacks though is the sandbox style, wich isnt that much sandbox, its merely different areas with different icons to explore and youll probably explore all of the icons within one area before moving on. Ship combat are somewhat arcadish as well, wich not necessarily is a bad thing, but personally for me I wish for more. This one is sort of like a thirdperson version of Sid Meiers Pirates, but of course with insanely better graphics.A final note that annoys me is the setup with the presentday underlying story, where you jump in and out of memories. For the avid AC player I doubt this is an issue, but it somewhat bugs me at least.Overall though, this is a good game, and not knowing what previous Assassins Creed games are like, Im guessing alot of old AC players where satisfied with this one. For anyone new to the series this is as good as any other game in the series, since nothing in the story requires you to know anything about what has happend in the earlier games.This game is in my opinion worth the money at least.
