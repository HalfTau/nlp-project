Its 1715, Edward Kenway sails his ship to uncover the secrets of the Observatory. He is looking for a man called Bartholomew Roberts. The Templars are also looking for this sage, who could be the only man capable of knowing what and where this Obervatory is. Meanwhile a band of notorious pirates are trying to establish a pirate state where each and every man is free to live beyong the reach of kings and rulers. However because of a lack of governance, disunity and a disease outbreak, the Templars within British and Spanish terrotory take control of this opportunity and exploit the situation for their own ends. Kenway then attemps to resolve the dispute by taking action and says  Youre movin with your auntie and uncle in bel Air. I whistled for a cab, and when it came near, The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, But I thought Nah forget it, Yo home to Bel Air. I pulled up to the house about seven or eight, and I yelled to the cabby Yo holmes, smell ya later. Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there, To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.
