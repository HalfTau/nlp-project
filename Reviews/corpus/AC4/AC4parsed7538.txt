I played this game after long anticipation. It was the first game I had played of this series. The first 15 hours of gameplay were AMAZING. I loved going through all of Havanna the starting city and collecting all the goodies. But then I got the best swords and guns in the game when I was only like a quarter through the story line. The side quests started feeling repetitive, easy, and unrewarding. The storyline was decent, but a bit slow paced. This game is only fun and challenging for about 20 hours of gameplay, so I wouldnt recommend buying it unless its on a huge sale.
