Farcry 3 Pirate simulator 2013 i mean Assaassins creed black flag is an amazing game the dynamic water and lighting are incredible the best ship to ship combat ever, Be warned its as addictive as hell. Massive open world to explore still has the annoying follow / stealth missions from all the AC games but not as many as past games thank god.
