Normally I get bored of the incessant repetition inherent in the Assassins Creed formula, but theres something about sailing around, sinking ships, singing songs, finding buried treasure, and meeting famous pirates that helps Black Flag blow the other AC games out of the water. Warning the first time you go hunting for a Great White Shark, you will jump out of your skin. I grew up playing Sid Meiers Pirates! the original and subsequently played the reboot which felt more than a little cheesy at times... but Black Flag feels like a true spiritual successor and its a bloody good time. I was a little disappointed with the ending feeling tacked on and rushed, but the journey there was fantastic.
