Best friggin pirate game of all time. Like a full live action version of Sid Meiers Pirates based on an Assassins Creed engine. I honestly didnt care for the AC series that much, but this one is a level of insane awesomeness I can sink my teeth into. Lots of lush jungle and city environments in the Caribbean from desert islands to full cities like Havana and Nassau. Fleet management, taking ships, boarding ships, sinking ships, sending them on trade convoys and intense nautical combat. Great gameplay for using chain shots, mortars, broadsiding with round shot and you could even just leap off the masts and kill the enemy vessels crew manually with your assassin skills. Like any AC game, it has the annoying modern subplot of the real world where you work in a gaming company with some underhanded crap going on where you walk around the office staring at french lady coworkers butts in miniskirts, but it really doesnt force you to play that sub plot much. I just stay logged into the pirate simulation 24/7. Screw John from IT, Im a pirate! The awesome collectable pirate shanties that your crew sings as you sail are stuck in my head now. Coworkers are confused why I know so many sailing songs. Literally a full hour of pirate shanties.
