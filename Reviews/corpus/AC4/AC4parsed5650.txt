well very dissapointed with this purchase! had about 15 into game and now soo much graphics flickering its totally unplayable! seems in forums to be an ongoing problem of ubisoft!!! to date have tried uninstall and re install no help! so far tried many different graphics card settings but did not fix!! was fun while it lasted but total junk!
