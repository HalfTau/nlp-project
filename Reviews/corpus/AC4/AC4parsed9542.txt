A fabulous step up for the AC series. I do recommend. Stunning visuals for a starter. The game HAS its stutters in framerate though, as the Assassins Creed series has always had on the PC. The oceans in particular are mindbendingly realistic during storms, and the weight of the ships you captain can be felt with each turn.Naval battles were spot on. The sweet suspense before yelling FIRE! is amazing, and the orchestra of guns, near and far sound great.I wasnt particularly impressed with the soundtrack, or the story elements. The series is obviously at a turning point, and Ubisoft Montreal has made an odd change from their previous storylines. I wont spoil anything, but it can be a little overwhelming at first, and a little less satisfying as it goes along.The gameplay is where this game waves its flag. It all just feels like an AC game still despite the technical obstacles of climbing around a moving entity, especially when the moving entity is floating on a turbulent ocean. The lower framerates I experienced on my higherend computer were a bummer, and probably the only complaint I have, accessability and gameplaywise. There hasnt been much built on the assassining mechanics, so there isnt much to talk about if youve played AC3.I recommend this game, not as a member of the AC series, but as a game in itself. Its wonderful, even if you think pirates dont belong in the series, you just cant deny its a fantastic game.This review does not cover Multiplayer. I havent got a chance to play it.
