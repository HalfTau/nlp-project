Above average for your AC game, still made from gimmicks only this time the gimmick is fun. Need more work on the ingame economy still no purpose for money after the upgrades. Need to abandon the modern scifi conspiracy theme, just not workingwell at all.Graphics are poorly optimised resulting in lower framerates than expected. Probably not worth buying full price, wait until 25 before purchasing.
