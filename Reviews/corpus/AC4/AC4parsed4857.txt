The game is alot of fun, when you dont have issues with the game. I purchased this for the PC with a high end laptop and the FPS was so low it was unplayable. Thankfully, Steam reimbursed me with their great refund policy. So understanding this to be an issue with the PC version I thought I would try the Xbox One version. At least there I could play the game, but when I tried to use the companion app for the map, etc I could not get it to work after many hours of frustration. I googled the issue and found the same issue from other people from over a year ago with the only response from Ubisoft to the gamer with directions to open a support ticket on their support site. So, I tried the same thing. After almost a week of waitting I am told the issue was sent to the development team for review. Since no solution is available today I will assume the gamer from a year ago is also still waitting for a solution and I shouldnt hold my breath. Yes, when the game works, it is fun but Ubisofts support is so poor al these issues are well known with a google search with no resolutions I find it impossiable to recommend any of their games. A company that doesnt stand behind their products is doomed to failer. I will consider all of these issues before buying another one of their games.
