Its been a while since I completed this, looking at it today I realised I hadnt wrote a review, so here goes!Black Flag is definitely my favourite Assassins Creed title to date I havent played Rogue or Unity so I cant comment on them the different combinations of side quests and missions kept me interested through most of the story. It is strange to think how long it has taken for there tobe a great pirate game! And I really do emphasise on the word great. Sea exploration, battles and challenges are a wonderful addition to what I considered a pretty flat series. Assassins Creed looked destined to drag out the series with pretty much the sameasnormal routines that you would expect in most of Ubisofts titles, but Black Flag truly surprised me. I was immediately drawn to it when I first heard the inclusion of ships  battle. In fact this reminded me of when Total War finally brought naval battles into the game, I would spend hours enjoying it  just like Black Flag, it brought all those great memories back.Very refreshing and nice to be able to come back to first had this on PS4 Im looking forward to getting round to playing Rogue and Unity to see if Ubisoft has been able to keep up with this excellent title.PS As a side note, Uplay is horrendous as we all know many times the game did crash, or Uplay decided to Notplay. It definitely became frustrating but overall didnt dampen my Black Flag experience too much.
