This game is pretty good. I will say that I found the combat system lacking compared to AC3, but the naval combat by far exceeds that of its predecessor. The graphics are very good and I have really enjoyed the story here. Sadly, I find that this game just feels like a repeat of the earlier games with little to nothing new to offer the player. Id give this a 7/10.
