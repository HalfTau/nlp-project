YEAH HI THIS IS A REVIEW FORCREED 4 BUT THIS WILL ALSO BE A REVIEW FOR LE HANG REGATTA 2014 CAUSE I WAS REQUESTERD BY AFRIENDD TO DO THIS REVIEW. SO I THINK THE GAME SIMUKLATES VERY MUCH BEING A PIRATE IN THE FINNISH ARCHIPELAGIO. THE SHIPS ARE VERY MUCH LIKE THEONES THSAT WHERE ACTUALLYU THERE TOO SO BONUS CREDIT POINTS FO THAT BRO. THE GAEM HOVEVEER DOS NOT CAUSE THAT MUCH HEADACHE WHICH IS A DEFINITIVE TRAIT TO THE GAME.SO IF I SHOULD GIVE THIS GAME/ADVENTURE A RAITING LIKE IGN, ID SAY 8/10 M8 NOT ENOUGHT SIMULATED CARBAGE ON THE STREETS AND FOG. ALL AROUND BOTH THE SIMULATION AND IRL WAS PLEASENT BUT THE LACK OF PILLOWS KIND OF GAVE MINUS POINTS ALSO. THE MAIN CHARACTERS WERE HOWEVER WERY GOOOD IN BOTH, SPECIULL MENTIONS TO EDWARD KENWAY FOR BEING GOOD CANONFAUGHTER AND SIMMPARI FOR BEING A TOTALL ST8 BALLR.yEA I DONT REALLY KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY, NEVER DO ALCOHOL.
