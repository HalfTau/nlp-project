Compared to III, this was much much better game.I cant really find much to complain, the need to swim was annoying but meh. Oh and there seems to be problems with AntiAliasing. If I turned it up on too high settings, I got no picture before I dropped it down to FXAA. Googled that I am not the only one with this issue but all in all, looks pretty, plays well and sailing around listening shanties is... relaxing. The gearing wasnt brilliant though, I bought a set of swords and guns on the first place I landed into, and used them through out the game wihtout anything better showing up.All in all, a very nice Assassins Creed game, two thumbs up.
