First time playing AC series, and I must say its impressive from the very beginning. In addition to assassinating, theres also pirating on a ship, and trading materials. However, I did stop playing at about 65 because it was too easy unlocking upgrades for the Jackdaw the ship and buying weapons and such. But I will continue playing some day.BTW, the menu and overlay is quite annoying, wastes alot of time.Overall its a A for me.
