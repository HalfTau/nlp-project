As someone who has played through most of the AC titles for PC except for AC III, which didnt excite me too much, I have to say that this is by far the most entertaining.Although the main elements of the franchise climbing, fighting, stealthing are still all there in their core, its the new parts that are just so much fun. The setting of the West Indies is refreshingly different, the places you visit are hugely diverse and range from small islands and hidden smuggler coves to bustling cities. And most important of all the naval gameplay. Never have I been so anxious to explore an open world by ship, look into every nook and cranny for collectibles and battle other ships for cargo and crew. It all handles very well and the atmosphere just sucks you right into.On the downside are the occasional occurences during climbing where Edward just wont do what I want him to and the story set in the real world as an employee at Abstergo Industries just isnt that exciting overall.The multiplayer seems fine however, Im not there very often and it seems like there is tons of content to explore and exciting modes to play that only fit the AC franchise.Ive put in about 25 hours now and there is still so much I havent seen, so Im going to lift the anchor and gladly get on with it
