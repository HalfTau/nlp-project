Will update this review if I can get the game to work.PS To be clear Im not saying that you shouldnt buy it, just that you shouldnt necessarily expect to be able to login to Ubisofts servers in order to start playing this game as of now. And I truly wish the situation was different. All my hours in game were spent trying to login, which is currently not possible for me, no matter what I try.PPS Ubisoft even acknowledges it
