I have only played this game for about 8 hours, but boy am I happy with it. I was on the fence between this and syndicate and was afraid that the sailing would get boring real fast. But I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the sailing is fun after while. My recommendation if you are bored is put on the pirates of the Caribbean theme and start a battle.
