Tried a while back to get into the Assassins Creed games but, because of the control scheme was kind of hard to get into a bit frustrating.However coming back and giving it another try  primarily with this game first  I got better and more used to the controls and have been having a blast with this game.I love the openworld exploring, sailing, and ship combat. The land based missions and such arent too bad either.I have put in over 100 hours into the game and still having fun exploring and shipfighting. And I tend to explore a whole lot when there is a big open world. Tends to cause me to take a while to finish games though lol.The only major complaint I have with the game is that you cant do any ship battles in multiplayer. Strictly landbased missions/fights. Which to me feels like they missed out on a big opportunity, seeing as the ship combat, sailing, and exploring was a big part of the single player aspect.
