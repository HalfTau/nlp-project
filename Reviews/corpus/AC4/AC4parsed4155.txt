Black Flag is not a good Assassins creed game. However, it is a wonderful pirate game. When youre raiding merchant ships for profit, boarding the ships with your crew and taking what you please, the game is at its best. The open world is very special, and the ship controls are much tighter in this game compared to the minigame in AC3. However, once you get to the hub towns you find yourself sucked into the usual Assassins Creed mundanity. Mostly tailing missions and poorly implimented stealth concepts. I would recommend this game on its gameplay alone, just keep in mind that the story is weak and the missions are weaker.
