AC Black Flag is so good i bought it twice pc and PS3its a really nice looking game with awesome graphics and sound effects, for example your crew is singing and you hear their echo if are near a cliff. Thats some big detail other games overlook. the story in this game is partially based on the story of real pirates, like Jack Rackam for example. It holds quite some playtime in the main story but you can extend your adventure if you decide to unlock more thing ingame.If you like openworld and sandbox games i highly recommend this game for you! it has a big realworld based map of Caribbean and all the cities back then. Im not gonna spoil any further thus the adventure is up to you .also i recommend that you have a proper gaming device for this game because the game is so high detailed it takes some high gpu force to render it all.My laptop was just able to run it 30 fps all the time,Here are some of my laptop specsIntel Core i74712MQ CPU  2.30GHz 2.30 GHz16,00GB RAMNVIDIA GeForce GT 745M 2GB
