Lack of support from the devs.In more detail, 100 sync is not possible to obtain due to bugs that have been present since the release as nassau 6/7 checkpoints bug is still present, despite the fact it has been reported since the game release.Reported via ticket to uplay, was promissed a response within 48hrs, guess what, its 12 days later and still no reply from them.I wanted to get 100 of the game done, but i am unable to due to bugs and no more community events which are apparently no longer hosted, despite the fact it wasnt clearly stated in the purchasing screen. I was sold an INCOMPLETE product.If you want to play piratethemed game with open world rpg the game is one of better ones out there. But if youre also a completionist that likes to hunt 100 completion with games bypass this one as its not possible.
