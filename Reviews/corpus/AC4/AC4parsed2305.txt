Possibly the best pirate game of the current gen and one weird Assassins Creed setting ever. But hey, it works. Whats great about this game is almost purely from its pirate element. Be a pirate captain, upgrading your ship, shooting ships and looting stuffs. As Ubisoft knows one weird good thing they made in AC III was the ship battle system. In term of gameplay, its a very good actionadventure pirate game. Graphics may not be as good looking as their newer titles but the sea looks just fantastic. Also, it should run pretty decent on any modern PCs now. Only downside of the game is its medicore storyline that hardly related to previous games. Although good news is you dont have to play any of the those to play this. Its just another war between assassins and templars at Caribbean sea.
