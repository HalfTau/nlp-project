All I was doing one day was collecting treasure chests I left them alone till later in the game when i had most of the islands discovered and it just felt like that was my purpose in life...to go out into the world as man only after a little coin and the fortitude and determination to try to decipher as many poorly drawn obscure maps as possible. It was great. Probably one of the more enjoyable collectibles to complete.
