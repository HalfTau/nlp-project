Hated this game more than any other AC title Ive played. Theyve continued to depart from everything that made the first few great. What about the success of any of the games before this made the developer think a poorly made naval combat simulator was the next logical step? I cant even enjoy the continuation of the story because of how painful this is to play through. I wont bother finishing this, I regret the purchase and Im done with the franchise. This one had such great reviews I made a stretch and gave it an honest try. I wont make that mistake again with Assassins Creed.
