 Its Assassins Creed Story is halfdecent and makes you think Historical sites and people Beautiful Each island is unique Takes ages to get to anywhere  takes you like 10min of sailing into nothing to get to a place of course you have to discover it/take it over before using fast travel. Hopefully you dont have to destroy/avoid ships in the meantime, because that can stretch out up to/over 30min. A bunch of little things to pick up on little islands, which additionally stretches the game into oblivion. You park the ship right next to the island hopefully not crashing it and swim at least 2 min to the island, pick up the thing, and swim 2 min back. I guess its a good excuse if you want to spend more time in that world  would it be a historical time more up my alley, I would probably enjoy it. Tedious tedious fighting, tedious sailing, tedious running around, tedious picking up stuff, tedious getting resources ... I forgot what the story is even about anymore before I get to the next section. When you give up and log up again half a year later, you can pray that your fingers still know the right buttons, because the keyboard settings will confuse the hell out of you. Cliches everywhere. Uplay sometimes decides to erase your savegame as Uplay does do yourself a favour and download Savegame manager for backups.Overall  the game is good for people who dont have a limited amount of time to spend on it. Me, having about 1day a week to spend on games, rarely decide that this is the game Im going to spend it on. Simply for the fact, that I can spend 12 hours in the game, and not get anywhere with it.
