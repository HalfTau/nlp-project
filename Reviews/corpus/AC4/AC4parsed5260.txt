Nowhere near as good as AC1 or AC2. Subpar plot, lots of graphical bugs that NEVER got fixed. Better than AC3. This game has made me give up on the AC series, which is a shame. They had something innovative and fun with AC1 and AC2, then just beat it to death. Weak plots, buggy code, and a more of the same feeling. Being a pirate was the best part of the game.Rating 3/5
