Uplay ruins this game. I played it for countess hours on my ps, but lo and behold I go to my gaming computer and buy it on a sale. Uplay you say? Well, fine. Drm crap, Im used to it. Unavailable? O... K.... well, play offline. You need to play online at least once.I purchased this game expecting an awesome time. Now, Im going to request my money back for having to deal with Ubisofts crap. Steam, please remove the drm crap from the game, or your site. Choose. Dont tempt us loyal users with a great game only to have it infallibly unplayable because of a third party drm. Talk with Ubisoft, if you please. Just dont waste my time. Apologies for the harsh tone, but as you can imagine, this frustrated me  and it looks like others as well  to no end.
