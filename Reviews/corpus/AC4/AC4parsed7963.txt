9/10 fantastic presentation, some breathtaking sceneries, especially at sea, graphics in tropical places are always more impressive interesting story, different from the previous games in the series, likable main character although a pirate, meaning greedy, open world game with tons of things to do ubisoft seems to have mastered the open world gameplay mechanics, thats why im sure watch dogs is gonna be the best game of the year i really liked the dispay of statistics by pressing the middle mouse button, it gives you a sense of completion, my worry in ac games always was that i didnt do everything i could, now you can track this much easier i also liked the chance to rate each mission after it ends multiplayer looks nice, although i dont really care in this kind of game for mp it seems this time ati cards are better optimised, since it runs identically in both my nvidia and ati pc they have to improve fighting, it looks impressive but it doesnt feel like it when actually playing, they have to make it less automatic, counter is all you have to do to kill enemies easily or sometimes break their guard, but it needs more than thati dont have to play more to review the game, i know its after ac2 my favorite ac game, endless opportunities for this franchise, i hope ubisoft will make the best out of it.
