I rolled my eyes when I saw a new Assassins Creed wondering what ludicrous plot theyre going to conjure up to milk a little more out of the franchise. After a friend enthusiastically told me how different it was against my better judgement I did buy it. My assumption was. If Assassins Creed 3 left a bitter taste in your mouth then Black Flag will sweeten the Assassins Creed franchise for you.Brand new places to explore, new characters to meet and assassinate, weapons to use, mini games, and killer finishing combos all brought to life with great graphics and sound effects.Travelling from city to city and island to island as a borntobefree pirate taking valuable loot from helpless and not so helpless ships and sometimes taking those ships for yourself to build your own pirate fleet along with hunting sharks and whales with your harpoon, and exploring shipwrecks it doesnt feel like any of the other Assassins Creed games at all.Theyve also managed to make a modern side story that works, but unfortunately still feels like the mandatory boring bits that have interrupted our gaming lives for years.Other than those short boring bits of modern storyline and the occasional amusing glitch I cant fault this game  one glitch I experienced was when fast travelling to my pirate cove my ship would disappear from the quay leaving a huge ship shaped void in the water, prompting my entire crew to fall from midair into the water. At which point they would all swim to the shore.Overall they did a great job with this one.
