While I was getting a bit fatigued by the Assassins Creed part, the Black Flag part was highly engaging.This game takes what was unquestionably the best addition to AC3, focuses in, and really delivers on a satisfying pirate experience. The main character is a true pirate, brutal and selfserving. But the arc he takes to become something more is both believable and gratifying.There are nits to pick, but if I had one major complaint Id say that I was disappointed there wasnt more Blackbeard.
