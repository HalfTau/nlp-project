Alirght on topic, its my favourtie AC game ever! Before you go,  BRO AC 2WAS BETTER YOU RETARD i am a gamer who loves looting and raiding. So this is a prefect game for me. I also love the franchise, i love how this franchise has helped me at school. A lot of the games take place at a historical event. And i love history so its pretty amazing. Hop on board the Jackdaw as the feard pirate Edward Kenway and raid, loot and make your way to the most feared pirate ever. But on the way you stumble upon a twist. You got infromated about a tressure worth so much. And thats what the main story is all about. But if are like me and love raiding/looting you will sit on your chair at least 200 hours looting and raiding. But the main quest is a lot of fun. You are working for Abstergo Entertainmenta subsidiary of Abstergo Industries. Its kinda a hacking group where you go in to the past historical moments and play them. Awsome game it smy 2nd best game ever played. Totally recommended. While watch out for bugs. D
