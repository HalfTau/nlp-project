For me, this was the best single player game I probably have ever played! It helps on because I have always loved playing games where I can be a pirate. The game itself is just amazing, it goes from upgrade your own ship to upgrading your own island to taking over fortresses to attacking legendary ship. I have owned this game for a week, and I have played it 30 hours... I go to school, I hang out with friends, but the only thing i have been doing when I actually was home, was playing this amazing game. So buy this game and enjoy it!
