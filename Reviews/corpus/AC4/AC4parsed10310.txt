The graphics are good but not what I expected as next gen graphics its more current gen graphics which you will notice with the textures.The gameplay is excellent although it can be repetitive apart from the main quest and templar assassination missions.The plot is what youd expect from an assassins creed game only this time youre a pirate whose only alligence is to money.
