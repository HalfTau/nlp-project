Best Assassins Creed ever... Also one of the best games ever. The sailing is particularly enjoyable, especially when you unlock sea shanties that your crew sings! Kinda magical. Combat mechanics are like ever other assassins creed. Newer ones fixed some combat issues but overall the same. Story is a little convoluted and over the top but the other aspects are great like THE GODDAMN SAILING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also, THE SAILING IS AMAZING!!! BETTER THAN WIND WAKER SAILING!!!! Oh did I mention the sailing? its really awesome.
