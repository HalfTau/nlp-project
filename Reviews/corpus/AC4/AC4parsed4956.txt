First 15 hours of this game is new adventures and features that Assassins Creed three did not get right. The upgrading of your ship and weapons as well as adding more guns and bombs to your arsenal keeps you in the game. My main problems with this game is that it does not challenge me. By hour 25 I was the god of all combat and entire armies can be killed off by the main characters combination of guns, bombs, and blades. If you have played other Assassin Creed games you already know what to expect with the added bonus of the naval battles which early in the game are challenging and fun. By late game you have so much armor and cannons you can defeat several large ships at once. Also sea shanties are fantastic. Love the game but by the time I was near the end I was sick of it and did not feel challenged. Some people like that but I do not.
