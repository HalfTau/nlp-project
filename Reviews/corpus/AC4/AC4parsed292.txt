Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is by far the best AC game I have played yet.The story isnt so much about the assasins as it is about piratesprotagonist Edward mostly, but there are other as Black Beard but thats the brilliance of it.Gameplay on foot isnt anythig knew compared to the rest of the series but it is improved a bit compared to ACIII, but ship battlesship in general are most entertaining part of the game, not just battles but sailing with the ship around the huge map listening to the shantis from the lads on the deck is just mesmerizing, even tho u have the fast travel option you will rearly us it becaus of it.
