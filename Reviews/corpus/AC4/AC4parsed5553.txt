As one who played Black Flag as the first AC game, I was really impressed by the game. The game machanics are smooth, the graphics are good and the open world is offering alot. Also the simulation aspect around the actual game as a virtual reality was also an interesting concept. The only disappointed thing for me was the ending that wasnt that spectacular and pretty sudden. After that you do not really feel like continuing all the side quest since it seems irrelevant now.
