be a pirate. sail the sea boarding ships and raiding plantations for fun and profit!. sneak around or charge into open swordplay, run away from the odds and hide even. lots of fun me hearties!assassins creeds with ship combat, and more deadly things than you can shake a stick at. and he could probably grab the stick and kill you with it so dont do that actually.the downside? uplay. dont buy the game anywhere except on steam or from ubisoft shop or the code likely wont work. the uplay has to run at same time as steam, and since 4 updates back i have to turn off the uplay overlay or it crashes the game at the ubisoft logo video. the game plays fine without it despite the dire warnings from uplay about losing things if you dont enable overlay again. when the game installs it may install an old non working version of uplay so best bet is download uplay and install it first and make your account THEN buy and download the game, that way uplay is up to date and will work. mostly.
