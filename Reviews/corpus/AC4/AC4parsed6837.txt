Ive planned the first Assassins Creed on the consoles so I know what this game is about... well thats what I thoughts anyway! I purchased this games after noticing that it was on sale plus all the positive reviews so I thought why not.All I can say is I am so happy I got it, the ship element of this game breathes an new life into what I thought was an already set style of game. Id be happy to say that this will probably be one of my all time favourites so far based what Ive played so far and I still have more to unlock.Go buy it, you wont be disappointed!
