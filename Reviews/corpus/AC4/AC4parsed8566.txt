I didnt think they would ever beat AC2, but this is now my favourite in the series. The new story arc is a nice jumping on point for those new to the series, but still offers some nice tie ins to previous games for series veterans.I found the side missions a lot more engaging than in the previous games too, and often found myself distracted by them on my way to a main mission.On another positive note this runs a lot better on my machine than AC3 did on my AMD card something to do with AMD being in the new consoles perhaps? and manages pretty close to a stable 50 fps with everything maxed.The only negative thing I have to say is that the awful follow missions are in the game again and there a quite a lot of them. If there were less of these boring missions then this would be close to perfect.
