The story in this game is good. The combat when your at sea with your ship attacking other ships is great. The upgrade system for your character and your ship is cool. However, combat with swords against other npcs is not so good. I have to NOT play this game because the melee combat with swords just makes me to mad. The movement is also sometimes a bit wonky since the character you control jumps up something or climbs up somewhere or something and its not what I intended for him to do. I really did try to do my best to control the character and sneak my way through the enemies but to many mistakes just happen too often that I cant deal with. If you like piracy as I do then go ahead and buy the game and see how you feel. But I caution the combat on foot.
