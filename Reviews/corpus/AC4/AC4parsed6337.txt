You like creeping up on people and stabbing them? Jumping on their heads and stabbing them? General stabbing? If you also like ships, sea shanties and pirates, this game is for you. It takes little getting used to and from there on is heaps of fun. Downside, as per usual, is the inherent uPlay thing.
