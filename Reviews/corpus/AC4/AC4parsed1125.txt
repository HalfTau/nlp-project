So I start the game, and I can play abut the first 5 minutes of the game, and then it goes to a loading screen and loads... and loads... and loads a little more... and loads some more... and finally I killed the game and restarted the game to see if it would fix it. And I cant ficure out what to do. I love the others I have played, but I wont recommend this one until this is fixed.
