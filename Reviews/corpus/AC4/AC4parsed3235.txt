Great game. There are a few bugs every now and then, but most of the time theyre harmless. On one occasion, however, I was stuck inside of a tree and could not get out at all it was also a part of one the memories main story, so I had to reset the memory and start all over. Other than that though, the game behaves rather well and has very appealing graphics and combat mechanics, just like the other ACs. The story is quite engaging too.Now, I would like to point out a couple of things I noticed that could have been improved upon as well as others that I was impressed aboutFirst I should add that I am from Cuba, so the Caribbean as a whole is a very familiar area for me. A lot of Caribbean islands are not mountainous at all, unlike what this game seems to suggest. Havana, for example, does not have any mountains anywhere near it apart from some gentle hills, of course. Waterspouts do happen in the Caribbean Okay, not as often as they do here, but they do happen The Juventud Island is also called Pine Island, which is historically accurate The weather could turn rainy in a matter of minutes when talking about the Caribbean though not as quick as it does in this game The Taino people seemed to be accurately portrayed in this game A lot of buldings in Havana were accurately designed and talked about as Im sure is the case with Nassau and Kingston Howler monkeys and the red ones were included in the game, which is hitorically correct, as they went extinct shortly after. I would have liked to see Sloths and the Cuban Macaw maybe they were in it, not sure too though, as they also went extinct.And I could just keep finding plus and minuses here, but that would take a while. I just wanted to point out a few things.Anyhow, I do recommend this game it is fun and story rich. It is a great game in general!
