Let me ask you a question. Have you ever wanted to be a pirate? if yes then let me ask you this did you decide not to be a pirate for one of the following reasons 1. the finale of your internal struggle of chaos vs morally correct choices left you with the realization that you couldnt possibly kill another living being 2. you dont want no smexually transmogrofied disease 3. once coming to the realization that you are in fact a human who makes morally correct choices, you have also decided to uphold the law. Even going as far as following the rules of the road in GTA. if you felt one or more of these applied to you, then this game is right for you! Not only will you not have to deal with the crushing feeling of having killed another sentient being, but you wont die of dysentery! oh and Kenway is easily the second greatest character in this entire franchise. Have fun!
