Does anyone have a solution to my problem? Im stuck on 30 and below FPS and I dont know how to fix it. I tried changing my graphics to the lowest settings , but its still stuck on 30 and below FPS. Please help. My specs   Processor   AMD A105745M APU with Radeon HD graphics              2.10 GHz                                                                                         Installed Memory RAM  6.00GB     5.21 usable    Quick question , can I change the amount it uses? System Type  64bit operating system , x64based processor                                                                                                              Otherwise , its a really good , fun , and atmospheric game. In my opinion , I think they could have worked on the gold texture a bit more , but its a really small mistake. I just get all OCD on things like that. If you can help , please post.
