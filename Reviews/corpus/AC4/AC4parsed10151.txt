Uplay makes even saving in single player DRM, if you loose at any given point during you playing , connection to the uplay servers , your progression will go unsaved.  Also Black flag is horribly optimized for PC, some bits they even didnt care to be workable on PC.  Its a good game but these kinds of tricks by Ubisoft ruin the game for me completly .  My advice dont buy it on PC. If you have to then on a console .
