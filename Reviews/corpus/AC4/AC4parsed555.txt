The AC franchise hit a peak with this game. Its less of an AC game and more of a pirate simulator with Assassins Creed elements, but nonetheless  a masterpiece.At some points, it does feel patronizing, as in some missions getting spotted for a split second is a failure whereas others you must stand in the open for extended periods of time. Ubisoft is also incredibly triggerhappy with waypoints. Even when you travel in a straight line and its a ravine that is unclimable on both sides, they give you way points.
