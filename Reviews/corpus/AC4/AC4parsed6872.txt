This is undoubtedly the best Assasins Creed game yet, and Ive played and beat them all. Assasins Creed IV Black Flag feels like a revitalization of the franchise. It is truly a remarkable experience set in a caribbean atmosphere and centered around pirate lore. The game has numerous addictive qualities that keep pulling me back for more. Sailing the high seas in conquest and search for treasures never gets boring. Upgrading your ship and battling ever increasingly difficult numberrs of foes keeps you on the egde of your seat.The graphics and sound here are truly spectacular, and without taxing your computer hardware. I really cant recommend this game enough. If you enjoyed any of the previous Assasins Creed games or havent played them but have an interest in pirate lore, this game is an easy no brainer. Get it now and enjoy the adventure, because games this good only come along once every few years. Id give it a 10 out of 10.
