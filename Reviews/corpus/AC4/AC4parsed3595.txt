I like the game, but  UBISOFT, mostly because I cant get the Altiar, Ezio, or Conner outfits, I have two of the previous games ac2 and acb and I should have gotten something, but no, nothing, and Ubisoft just ignores me about the situation, would I recomend this game? Yes, its great, but because of Ubisofts unreliabillaty, I say NO!
