Years later and neither Steam nor Ubisoft care to rectify the blatant disregard of not selling the product some people paid for with the Season Pass? Im sorry, but when you openly state something as being included in the Season Pass and then refuse to add it to the Season Pass DLC, you are commiting a crime of false advertisement.
