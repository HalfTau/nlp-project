Somehow Ive played for 14 minutes and have never seen the title screen.   Uplay.  Uplay shows and is willing to let me purchase new games, but wont activate the key code for AC4.  Try again later.  Kiss my im not waiting a week to play a single player game i purchased and dowloaded tonight.Dear steam, STOP SELLING GAMES WITH EXTRA DRM, YOUR DRM IS ENOUGH.  Cheers!So after reading forums from several websites, which should never have been needed.  The steam download of Uplay isnt up to date, the current Uplay version should be downloaded directly from the Uplay website, then the activation will work.I could very well blame steam, but Ill gladly stick to my previous complaint.  THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED IF UPLAY WASNT REQUIRED.All that being said.  This game is amazing from top to bottom.
