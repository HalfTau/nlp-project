Excellent easily the best of the franchise. Commanding your own ship, sailing anywhere pillaging and looting as you like all in the most immersive experience theyve ever delivered. Whether youre battling a Bull Shark with a harpoon, leading a boarding assault on an enemy frigate, or skulking through the jungle looking for a target to assassinate, the game is beautifully done in game looks as amazing as the cinematics you see in the trailers, and control is intuitive. The voice acting is top notch, the characters are distinct and engaging, and most of all its a fun game. The various side missions dont feel repetitve and chorelike as some of the previous games did. Ultimately, this is a definate buy. Enjoy the high seas!
