W4C Rating 9/10Everything you love about AC, with PIRATES!I am a recent newcomer to the world of Assassins Creed  I tried AC1 and couldnt deal with the controls, AC2 fixed that, but I couldnt stay in it. AC3 is sitting on my shelf, unused. I have a problem.I thought to myself, I havent thrown enough money into the franchise, lets get another one!, so I purchased Black Flag. BOOM! The love of AC was ignited, to the extent that I am now going through all the other games, as I have a newfound love and appreciation for the Assassins and the wonderful story woven within.Black Flag has a very smooth play mechanic, combining close combat with the wild, open seas of the Caribbean. As if it wasnt awesome enough to be a badass assassin, you now have you VERY. OWN. PIRATE. SHIP. One that you control, customize, and send to a watery grave after a quick row with the Legendary Vessels in the area.I highly recommend this game to anyone whos ever enjoyed a good sea shanty, whilst stabbing someone in the face.
