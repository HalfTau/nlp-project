Best game in the series. They just did everything right. The setting is right, having a pirate ship really gives freedom to do whatever you want which keeps te game fun to play. Sure, its not really a classic Assassins Creed game in the sense of the Assassins vs Templars way, but its incredibly fun to play.9/10
