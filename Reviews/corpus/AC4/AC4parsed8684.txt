UPlay has ruined this game for me. I constantly lost my game progress even though UPlay says it saving. I have contacted UBsoft more then once and NEVER got a reply. AC was my favorite game series but Every morning I am back to where I was the day before.... I have probably lost total 3540 hours of game play. Wont be buying the next AC game.
