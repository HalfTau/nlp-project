The free running aspect to this game is very frustrating after experiencing something as fluid as the Batman Arkham series. The story also isnt very engaging and having every enemy every where you go instantly alerted to your actions can be tiresome when trying to experiment with taking out individual enemies. I can say confidently that this will be my last Assassians Creed purchase and that I regret buying it. I would not recommend it at any price.
