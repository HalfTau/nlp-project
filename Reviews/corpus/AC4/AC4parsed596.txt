one of my favriote games altogh it pisses me off sometimes its still fun boght  it a few days ago the only reason i only have 9.1 hours right now is because i already playd most of it on my xbox altough i dont like playing games again, i just had to buy this game for pc! has a nice big ocean to explore and alot of islands my fav pass time in this game is capturing enemy ships.... like a BOSS..... i will show myself out... anyways i easaly get stasfied by open world games just exploring can keep me entertained for hours so being able to explore a big ocean full with islands and enemy ships to destroy whats not to love! the story is nice too  love the outfits altough it pisses me off sometimes i can still play... and im a rage quiter and since when running you also climb stuff and do other parkour stuff it can get you into some trouble and sometimes make you fail a mission.long story shortexploration 10/10story 8/10weapons 9/10graphics 10/10execution 10/10overall score  9.4/10Mr.Rainbow857 pm11/19/2017
