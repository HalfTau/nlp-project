I didnt believe when I heard that this game would be focused on ship battles, something that I hated in Assassins Creed III. Luckily, I was wrong. Ubisoft delivered an amazing game, not just by its story, but all of it. I always thought that any other game could be better than the second one, but they made it. Its not just entertaining, it has amazing scenarios and many, many places to explore. Another thing that impressed me was the weather system. I risk saying that its the best Ive ever seen in a game. The only complain I have is about the PC version. Its graphically amazing, but not well optimized. Nothing compared to ACIII, of course. Anyway, thank you, Ubisoft, for making me believe in Assassins Creed again.
