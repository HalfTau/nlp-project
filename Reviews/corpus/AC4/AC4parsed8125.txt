This is the best Assassins Creed game I have ever played! The transition between fighting enemy ships from and distance and then getting up close to board the ship is amazing. The open world with all its activitys and discoverys help the immersion as a traveling pirate. This is a great game to have in anyones collection of titles.My only con about the game is the menu for multiplayer could be better with more options for hosting and connecting with people. But that hasnt stopped me from enjoying some coop matches and some dathmatch to get back stabbed by my friends. P
