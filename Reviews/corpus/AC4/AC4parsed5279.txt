Alright, where to start.First thing forward, I realy liked the idea that in a pirate AC, you do not play as a assassin, but as a pirate, thank you for that. This gives the game much more in depth and raises more questions that in there turn makes you want to keep playing the game to get answers. with that said.....Black Flag is such a exiting game, it contain everything you could ask for in a pirate game. Alot of plundering, killing and tressures. Its story is a vast improvment from AC3 even though my expectations werent too high, I was suprised by the deepness of the game. In the end you almost shed a tear. The outside the Animus story was fun aswell, something that has been lacking in several off the games. This has most deffenetly set a high bar for AC Unity too come and im looking forward to more AC games!Aye maty! Its time to ro up the ankar and set sail towards the next AC game, Unity!Great story linegood grafficsGood openworld sailing the seven seas, ayeI loved the story.Good ending Thank you, something noone seems to be able to doYou are kind off have to play outside the main quests alot of times to earn enough plunder to upgrade your ship, this annoyed me cause it took several ours to get sufficent lvls on my ship to complete certain quests.Alot of assassination quests were to easy due to the fact that pistols are just to god damn Over PowerdTo many stalking quests, these quests annoyed me cause of the lack off info you gained and the time they took.I give this game 8.5/10Its well worth its price!
