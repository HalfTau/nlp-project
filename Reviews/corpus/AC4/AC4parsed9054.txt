This is the Pirate game I didnt know I wanted. Not really a big fan of pirates really, but I am a fan of this series. The fluidity and scope of this game is amazing. From stearing your vessell in a huge naval battle to boarding the enemy boat. It all feels fluid...without the need for a big cinematic or loading screen.The story lacks a bit mostly because we just came off of the HUGE events of AC3 the setting and the events are a bit more lowkey than the Revolutionary War, but it still holds its own. Im also very impressed with how they handle the outofAnimus experience. I wont spoil anything there.To sum it up I didnt know I wanted a pirate game. AC4 fills a slot that no other game has to this point. Anything you can think of that is pirate related, is addressed in this game. As a pirate game goes, its nearly flawless. as an Assassins Creed game goes, it may just fall short of the AC3 storyline.
