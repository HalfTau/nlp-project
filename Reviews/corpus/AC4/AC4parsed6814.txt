The game mechanics in Black Flag are pretty spectacular, and theres a TON of fun content that will keep you busy for quite a while. I was unimpressed by the story and didnt find that the developers really made me care much about any of the characters... but this was still a heck of a lot of fun to play. Usually a weak story and subpar caharcter development are enough for me to give a game a big thumbsdown. That fact that I can still wholeheartedly recommend this game despite its drawbacks says something, I think.
