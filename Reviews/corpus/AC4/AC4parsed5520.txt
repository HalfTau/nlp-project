Black Flag is a true wonder of a game. Set during the Golden Age of Piracy, this game delivered on its potential combining a good story, with great gameplay and bringing the new refreshing setting of the West Indies to the series.The story itself is well written with interesting characters, emotional and engaging missions and cutscenes. The portrayal of real historical pirates in the AC universe was movielike material.But where the game succeeds the most is in its gameplay, combining the usual AC combat with AC3 naval combat and expanding on the navigation and exploration aspect, it delivers a unique experience and innovative twist in the series. The map of the West Indies is huge and full of content to explore you can roam through the seas, fighting epic naval battles, taking over forts, whaling and treasure hunting, and also assassin contracts from the previous games are back, along with naval ones.You can even develop you ship into a true terror of the seas, from its appearance to its weapons. There are dozens of hours in side quests and world exploration alone, the games soundtrack and sea shanties really add to the immersion.The graphics are also fantastic, from the ports to the islands, jungles or the open seas, the weather events are also well designed. However the game was not that well optimized, since it crashed several times, delivered random black screens on the Uplay start up and a few framerate issues regardless of my hardware being superior to the recommended specs.Aside from these problems, this mix of AC gameplay and naval gameplay was a fantastic experience it became one of my favorite gameplay styles on pc and worth every cent.
