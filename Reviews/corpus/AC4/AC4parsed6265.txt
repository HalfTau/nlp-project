Ok  . The game itself is great . A pirate assassin isnt a bad idea.But , seriously ,  you Ubisoft and your  Uplay .I brought this game without FreedomCry DLC . And when I downloading , Im unticked Freedom Cry  because I didnt purchased it . The download finished .I started the game , then it ing crashed at the menu screen .Later . I found out myself that I have to download the Freedom Cry DLC too in oder to play . The point is I didnt purchase Freedom Cry so of course I couldnt play it but I still have to download it .The thing thatme off is when I contacted Ubisoft support team , they asked my PCs spec , what kind of crash , ... ect ... then they came up with the answer   Please try to redownload the game ?NO ! NO ING WAY !!! Im already took a whole ing week with the  internet connection to complete the download  and now they ask me to redownload it !!Well. They treat their customers likeso they dont deserve our respect .If you want to play this game , just pirate the pirate game .
