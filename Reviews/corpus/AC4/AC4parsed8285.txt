Hands down one of the best games I have played in the past few years. Assassins Creed 4 takes the whole franchise to a new level by adding an exciting naval combat system. You never get bored of playing as there is such a varity of things to do. Combat is a little glitchy at times especially while boarding. The story admittedly falls short and is lackluster compared to Assassins Creed 2 or even Revalations. Graphics provided you have a decent graphics card are stunning. Community challenges allow you to compete with the community in certain objectives which adds a nice competative element to the singleplayer. The naval combat and the many side quests and explorable areas more than make up for the games shortcomings. Overall amazing game that will keep you hooked for quite some time.9.5/10
