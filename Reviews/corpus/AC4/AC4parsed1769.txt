Pros Optimized well Pretty graphics Within the top 2 Assassins Creed games Good story ArrCons The game is not very friendly to 4k resolutions I settled for 1920x1080 and had black bars on the top and bottom of screen the whole time Encountered a few sound issues at some points, firing weapons had no sound.Overall 8/10
