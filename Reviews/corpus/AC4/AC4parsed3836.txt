i climbed a castle and there were 2 guardsi stayed on the edge hanging and one of them jumped off trying to get to me,i then fully climbed and stabbed the other one that was oblivious at what was happeningthis one other time i had to tail 2 dudes and i was hiding in a bush,i kill a guy in front of them and they just stare at the bush for a bit and then keep walking,after that i air assassinate them both,guess karma s a so much realism in only 1 game,how could i not recommend it?in all seriousness,this game rocks,buy it
