I am very happy with his game, its awesome! The ending is the best one in the series so far. After getting used to the controls of ground and naval combat, it sadly gets very easy, unless you dont upgrade the Jackdaw of course, I also didnt like the fact that the Hidden blades didnt go back to the one counter kills with all enemy archetypes like 1, 2, Brotherhood and Revelations. The story as a whole can get dull, but this is a worthwhile game. 9/10 for sure!
