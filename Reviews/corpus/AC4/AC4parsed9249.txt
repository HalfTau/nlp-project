Assasins Creed IV Black Flag is the best game of the Assasins Creed series. It has a good plot line. Much lesser glitches than Assasins Creed 3. Much BETTER naval combat than Assasins Creed 3. Better multiplayer and combat. The environment is also much more realistic than Assasins Creed 3. The 59.99 dollars I had to spend, It was all worth it!
