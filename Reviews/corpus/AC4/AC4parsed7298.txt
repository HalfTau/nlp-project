The absolute best pirate simulator game I have ever played. I would say the only thing that this doesnt have that others might is the ability to change ships from a sloop to a ship of the line/man o war. Youre stuck with one ship, but you can upgrade it extensively. You still have to deal with the outofbody real world that Assassins Creed makes you do but its not often.Definitely a game for the completionist. 10/10 Would recommend.
