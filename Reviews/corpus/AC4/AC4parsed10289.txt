If you liked the naval missions in AC III, youll be pleased to know that somewhere between half and two thirds of the missions in this one are something like Sink or board this ship. I didnt have FRAPS running through the entire game, but every time I did, the framerate was between fortyfive and sixty. I havent played any other AC games on the PC, but once I got used to the controls, they felt just as natural as an XBox controller.I found Edward to be a much more relatable character than Ratonhnhakton. Its pretty obvious Ubisoft was going for more of an antihero model than with previous protagonists, and it worked.In the modern segments, it was nice to see the daily lives behind the people who work for Abstergo. I want you to hunt down as many of the hackable computers and sticky notes as you can, so without giving anything away, go look through all the Subject Zero files you can find. I dont think Ive ever seen a video game team put that much effort into something so major, then put it into a minor side quest that the game doesnt even point you towards.My biggest complaint is that, while the open world is nearly five times bigger than the Frontier in AC III, there isnt much to do there. Its beautiful, but thats about it. On the way from one thingthatIcareabout to another, there are treasure chests and fishing spots, which take time and dont give much reward, there are templar hunt quests, but only five of them, and each of those take forever and doesnt give you anything useful until you get all five, and there are Mayan Stelae, which dont take much time but also dont give you anything useful until you get all sixteen. My favorite of the collectables, though, is the music sheets you can chase down to teach your crew a new shanty to sing to relieve the boredom as you sail from one tiny island to another. That is artistry right there.Overall, eight out of ten.
