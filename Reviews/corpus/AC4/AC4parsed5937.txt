I dont get it. This game is barely worth its price. Lots of content  yes, but that content is mostly just copypasted. Old engine, boring story no wonder only 80K people could finish it, stupid side quests like, find ALL CHESTS in the archipelago and... and...  and what? what can you possibly gain in this game? a new outfit?, stupid mechanics bonus for stealthiness if you just shoot pray in the head from cover or kill everyone before they reach the bell, such a lot of fun. This game does offer lots of gameplay time 30 hrs for the story and probably unlimited for stupid side quests, but it does not offer any emotions. Seriously, my greatest impression from this game is the bug with ship, it was funny and kinda awesome, unlike ALL the other game.One can say not fails but AC series features you listed. Well then, actually I did know about stupid gameplay and was only playing for the story, but they failed it! OK, pirates were cool. But what about the guy using Animus? Who is he? Where is he? What happened after ACIII? What the hell happened during ACIV actually? I dont get it. Im done.
