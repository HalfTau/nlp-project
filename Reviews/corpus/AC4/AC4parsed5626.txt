This review comes from someone who doesnt like pirate stories at all. I havent even seen a single Pirates of the caribean movies  So I was a bit sceptical about this game but I wanted to try at least one of the installments of the Assassins Creed series and I read that Black Flag was the best of the recent releases. I guess AC2 is considered the best of the series overall but I wanted one a bit more modern that would take advantage of my recently bought NVidia GTX 970.And Im enjoying it so much! Im a big GTA fan and this gets really really close to the entrentertainment value of GTA. Thirdperson in an amazing open world, some great sword fighting and the naval battles are just awesome. Lots and lots of stuff to explore, find and collect. The graphics are beautiful and great triple monitor support.I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes openworld thirdperson games.
