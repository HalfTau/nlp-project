As a fan of the Assassins Creed series, I had a fun time playing this installment. The pirateassassin theme was played out pretty well, but things that could have been improved were the game mechanics. The game play is very similar to previous games save the naval aspect, but even naval fights can get repetitive from a lack of variety. As well, Uplay sucks and I couldnt even get online with it.
