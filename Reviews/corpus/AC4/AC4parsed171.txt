One of the best games ive ever played and the best Assassins Creed Game ever. Not anywhere else have I seen a company nail the pirate theme so well. I actually dont know why more companies dont try the idea. Moral of the story, If you like naval pirate combat, only to then dock your boat and still hold the badstigma of an Assassins Creed assassin, this game is for you.
