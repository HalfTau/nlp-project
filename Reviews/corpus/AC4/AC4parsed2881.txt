An awesome adventure, and though i want to give it a 9 for its pirateness, i just cant.I was not invested or cared for any of the characters except for Edward himself.Yet its still so good in all other areas that i manages to get a very secure 8.You have probably already played this game or heard a lot about it so there is no point in writing more
