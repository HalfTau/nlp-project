Surprisingly good for an Assassins Creed game I dont paritcularly like AC games to begin with. While combat is still very much similiar to the previous games, the whole ship part of the game is well made and theres a whole lot of minigames and extra activities. Nice graphics as well. The story is probably the most meta gamestory Ive ever seen.
