The Black Flag portion of this game is way better than the Assassins Creed part. Awesome naval battles and sailing mechanics, and the sea shanties are just the best. The economy feels like it wants to be real simulation, but wasnt allowed to veer too far from the actionadventure do stuff, get reward linear path, which is a shame. And some of the missions are frustrating in their linearity. Worth playing, even though I never actually finished the story.
