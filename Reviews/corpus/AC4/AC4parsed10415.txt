This is the most beautiful AC game i have experienced, it is huge with heaps of exploration both on land at sea and beneath it.  Clearly they have taken some FC 3 here and shoved it into AC but it does work.  I havnt finished it so i cant say much about story but having being a little bit dissapointed by the ending of AC 3 i hope this will redeem the series.  A superb addition and a great return to form for AC.So having played thru a fair chunk of the game i can safely say that this is the best AC game since brotherhood.
