Alright to start it off this game was a much needed change from the typical City Assassins Creed games when it came out that is, while some people may dislike the whole pirate theme I quite enjoyed playing this one because it was fresh.The few issues I had with this game are1. The protagonist, yes hes a badass but he has not earned the title of a true Assassin and didnt change his selfish ways until the end of the game.2. The Assassins here werent interesting except for Mary Kidd.They all felt rather doll and hate their jobs, unlike Yusuf in AC Revelations who was enthusiastic and passionate.3. The fighting mechanics couldve been better. This doesnt include the ship mechanics which were good.I would recommend this game for the strong story and the amazing enviornment.
