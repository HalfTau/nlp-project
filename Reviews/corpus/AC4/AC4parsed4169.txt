Workinprogress reviewMerely 3 complete and I already know this is going to be the best AC game Ive played to date not counting Rogue, Unity and Syndicate.Black Flag takes everything awesome and fun about AC II and bring them to the next level.PROS Drop dead gorgeous graphics! Typical awesome, epic pirate tracks! Fluid and entertaining parkour system! Satisfying and responsive combat system Charismatic protagonist AC III SUCKS Finally, some female! AC III SUCKS Assasination missions are back! AC III SUCKS Courtesans are back! AC III SUCKS Colletibles hunting no longer feels like a chore AC III SUCKSCONS Understandbly more demanding on hardware.  With 3770K  970  16GB, I couldnt run the game at 60 fps with everything maxed out at 2560 x 1440. Even at maximum mouse sensitivity, camera moves rather slowly, forcing me to drag my palm across the mousepad instead of simply moving my wrist.GOLDEN AGE OF PIRACY.  If you are getting one AC game, Black Flag is it!
