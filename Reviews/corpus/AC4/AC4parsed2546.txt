Hands down my favorite game in the AC series, even if AC2 is arguably better as a whole. Being a pirate is just far more fun than being an assassin. Who knew?Game looks great, plays well, and fighting ships and upgrading your ship to fight bigger ships never gets old.One caveat The game has some crap performance. Even after upgrading to a GTX 980 Ti, I was still only getting 40 FPS.  UNTIL! I found a crazy fix that works. First, let NVIDIA control panel handle the VSync. The games VSync is crap. Second, and its really weird After loading into the game, lock your computer. Then reopen the game window. This takes my perf from 40 to 60 every time. Dont know why. Doesnt make sense. Its some kinda weird bug, but by god it works.
