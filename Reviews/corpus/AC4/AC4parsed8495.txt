If theres anything Ubi can do reliably, its screw up a franchise. Ever blind to the faults of their game, generic assassin name again suffers from interacting with all 16000 objects around him.  Controls are loose, sloppy and very floaty, which is, to date, an Ubisoft calling card.  The UI fails to bring important information to the attention of the player, the combat is unresponsive, often leading to getting attacked from an enemy you cannot defend yourself from couple with your player being inexplainably unable to target an enemy 2 feet in front of you.Regurgitated garbage that needs to be put out of its misery like a 1legged dog.  I simply couldnt recommend a series any less than I do Assassins Creed.  Like Ubi earning a reputation as a halfPC developer, this game has earned a merit of repetition, boredom and lackluster game mechanics.
