The only negative in this game is the vsync does not allow for triple buffering. Having said that the graphics are mind blowing and the story is easier to follow than in previous games but not as deep. The conbat is still basic on foot but does a decent job of providing a fluid system with which to cut dowm your foes. The naval combat however is a different story. It is amazing. Its fast,fluid,tactical,controls like a dream and provides an amazing spectacle too. Overall the game dos feel over familiar to sereies veterans but brings enough to the table to be a worthy nextgen debut for the series.
