Assassins Creed IV is another AC game with a pirate simulator smashed into it. And its the pirate part that actually makes it a ton of fun! Give the game a try if the notion of roaming the seas as a pirate sounds like a good time. Just, like the other AC games before it, dont expect anything new from the Assassins part. Its primarily old hat.
