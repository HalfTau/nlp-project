Assassins Creed Black Flag is a slightly unorthodox game for the Assassins Creed series, however it is my personal favorite. It seamlessly combines hand to hand combat, exloration, and ship battles will still maintaining the sense of being a lawless pirate. It more clearly shows the BrotherhoodTemplar dynamic for the outside perspective of the pirate who only cares about money. Overall this game is a good way to get started in the Assassins Creed series, as it is focuses less on the BrotherhoodTemplar dynamic and more on the lawless pirates of the caribbean.
