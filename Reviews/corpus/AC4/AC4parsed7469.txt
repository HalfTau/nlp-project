ive always been a huge fan of the AC series ever since i tried assassins creed.My first thought of the assassins creed was meh,this game looks boring but after i tried the first one,i loved it,and i played every single AC that have ever been released but this one is one of the best AC games ive ever played.If you play AC 3 and love the naval combat,Youre going to love this one.They even improved the naval combat to make it even better.The combat here is great imo,although its too easy tbh.The graphics is really good but because of the poor optimization issue,my gtx 780 cant handle it with TXAA 4X ,had to turned it down to FXAA to get a stable 60 fps,kinda sucks,because i was hoping to get a high fps on everything maxed out with my new pc.Therere A LOT of things to do in the game,assassination contract,naval contract,diving to loot treasures,and even harpooning.They also add Kenways fleet feature in the game,so you basically battle with a ship,and after you boarded the ship,you can send it to your fleet and send the ship to a quest to get money.in AC brotherhood,you capture tower to unlock shops around theAC 4,you destroy fort so the area near it is not restricted again.and yeah for the ending,prepare tissue just in case,because its really sad.Overall10/10
