if the outsidetheanimus, presentday story is important to you like it is to me, know that ac4 is much less satisfying there than any of its predecessors. on the other hand the insidetheanimus part is the best so far. while it gets annoying sometimes especially getting off and on your ship to open chests or grab animus fragments on tiny uncharted islands youre still a pirate with a crew that sings shanties while you sail and thats pretty great. captain kenway is less aligned with the assassins than i prefer, to the point where i often wished hed choose differently during cutscenes. maybe i dont have the greedy black heart of a true pirate. it has the usual series downsides with instantfail parkour or tailing missions that annoyingly take a long time to reload for the next attempt, repetitive side activities that are necessary if you want to reach your full potential, the occasional slower than id like travel, and requiring uplay. i was disappointed that the ships i captured and added to my fleet didnt show up in game or level up like the recruits from brotherhood, but it was nice using the companion app to earn more money than i could spend and also to have a second screen with a map.i encountered two serious bugs. the first was the video freezing when i sailed within range of a fort, which i was able to work around by changing a video setting. the second is that they have apparently turned off cloud saving for this game, so after reformatting my computer and starting up ac4 again i found my 40 hours of progress had vanished without warning. great, that was the only useful feature of uplay, and theyve turned it off for this game! if you know about both of those bugs you can do a little extra work and avoid them.for me this is about the same level overall as the ezio and connor assassins creeds, which means i wish they could be better but theyre still pretty good.
