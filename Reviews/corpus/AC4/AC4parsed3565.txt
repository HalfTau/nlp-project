This game was an amazing experience,minor sound bugs in combat and few minor glitches but overall 9/10.So much things to do in/at ocean.Story is very cool and ending is touching and happyi didnt have problems with uplay though i know that people hate it and thats why this game doesnt have 90 positive for me it turned out better than any ac i played,and i played 14Its a ship not a boat...
