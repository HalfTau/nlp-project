Ive never been that much of an Assassins Creed fan, but this time Ubisoft managed to put together a fantastic title.They seemed to have picked up the ground combat, stealth and complexity of their cities from their previous games and combined it in a land and sea open world along with exploration and hunting elements clearly borrowed from Farcry 3.And of course they elevated the naval combat from Assassins Creed 3 to a whole new level in Black Flag.You can engage in countless activities such as whaling, boarding poor unsuspecting merchant barges, assassination contracts or simply... exploration. Theres just so much to do, though by far the activities done at sea are the most fun.For those who played or still remember Sea Dogs and later Pirates of the Caribean, this title is definetely reminiscent of those and is definetely worth it.For those who have never experienced the joys of looting and pludering this is also a must play at some point.
