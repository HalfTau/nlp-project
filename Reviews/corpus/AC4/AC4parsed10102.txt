If you have the problem of it lagging and crashing regularly limit it to a maximum of 4 of your CPU cores.Dont buy Pirates Creed IV go play Assassins Creed II Or Revelation or Brotherhood.Honestly, if you disliked the boat missions in III stay THE HELL away from this, its only getting worse.For me this is the worst parts of III distilled into a sludge of nope.Controls are worse than I, you lost movies you had in Revelations, the temples from II/Brotherhood/Revelations are gone and I have no idea what this has to do with being an Assassin.I had my doubts before buying this and I regret doing it. You still have the chance. Do not pick this game up before its in Winter Sales 2014 and/or under 5 bucks.
