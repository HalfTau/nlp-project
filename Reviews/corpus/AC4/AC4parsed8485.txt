while a fun game, this thing is so filled with bugs and glitches that its not even funny. examples would include missions you cant fulfill due to their being no start point, your ship spawning in the air with all your crew members falling out and dying, the whole screen glitching and none of the images appearing properly usually in maps, important enemies or enemy ships not spawning, guards spawning on top of you, citizens despawning in front of you, in cutscenes the speach, action sounds, and lips are all off, Anne using Adowales voice,weapon choices being stuck, and the load screen getting stuck thus loading for all eternity unless you restart the memory.Wish the game would have been debugged before being sold, but aside from that, its an excellent game.
