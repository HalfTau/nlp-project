Black Flag was the first game purchased from the AC Series by me. Although I watched a lot of You Tube Videos to learn strategy use of the controls and gameplay for the mouse and keyboard  player, it was worth it. This game kept me spellbound. It is full of action and adventure, justice and revenge, educational and historical references, love and romance, happiness and extremely sad at times and much more. I found myself drawn into the story so much so that I never relized how much time I spent playing. I only wish the writers would have prolonged the storys ending, although it still ended well. I highly recommend this game especially for beginners.
