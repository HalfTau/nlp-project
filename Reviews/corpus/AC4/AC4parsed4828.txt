Starts up slow. At first I thought it doesnt have more then just killing people and plunduring with your ship.There is so much more, but it is slowly fed over the main story line. Dedicate some time and be pationt and you will reveal all the amazing side features of the games.The sailing and plundering can be annoying at first, but once you get used to it it gets really fun. The small features like singing pirates can really make you stop using the quick travel.The open world is very big and there is always something you can do. The quick travel is very accessable and there are a lot of points you can go to. No limitations on where you are, whenever you are aside inside missions that is disabled but that is normal.A lot of collectables, crafting, upgrades  offers so much for everyone.My favorite AC game so far.
