starts new game aaaw yiiis, time to try this.few hours later omg this is awesome, i can just walk on my deck and stop sailing at almost any time not storm obviously or mid combat.few days later sings Bully in the Alley while sailing on speed 2Strongly recommend this for the pirate fans, people who love pirate lore, series, books, movies or anything about pirates. The mix with AC makes it differently unique and special due to its climbing system, jump and climb places, reach the top of enemy ship and kill stuff either on top or FROM top. The game contents has land and sea exploration with ability to stop sails and walk freely on deck. This has occasional conflicts between other ships, not only you, you can simply sit on top of your ships flag and observe as 2 Man O War are tearing down each other, british and spanish ships clearing small ads aside as they take over the battlefield. Did a few times myself, priceless, the EVERYTHING while the battle lasts is amazing. Sail and enjoy, but when you get caught by a monster beast ship you know you cant take down, run away as fast as you can or it WILL sink you, unless ofc weather is on your side and will send a storm over to help you out with a few hurricanes over the enemy P Enjoy those planning to buy it. Very much worth it.
