The game is stunning but in the first gameplay city, you are in Revelations without any doubt. A few changes here and there but its Ezios Assassins Creed city across form Constantinople where his Guild is headquartered.Game play is smooth and action is on the money. The first city does seem lacking in some fine detail work and that isunfortunate with a price tag this high at 60 for the Gold Edition. But these are first impressions at the beginning of my game play. Having played all of them and I hope they can keep coming up with ideas for it. I would go on playing Assassins Creed for many years to come. In truth I didnt think Ezios story was over. They could have run 2 more games with him.Climbing in this and AC3 is far too effortless, you dont have to think, just push a button and he goes. I dont care for that.I also miss going into caverns to do secret missions and gather this or that. They completely missed in AC3.I hope they can get a grip and make the game we have come to enjoy and DO NOT sacrifice the game for putting extra money in their pockets. Cheating us of a great game experience but charging us more for less game. I am still a fan of it but they are getting close to the edge.
