The game is pretty good.  A lot of ship battles and less assassination/city.  It is a good idea that I hope leads into other time periods that are interesting like Samurai/Feudal Japan hopefully no ship combat this time.Worth it if you like AC storytelling style I think.  If ship to ship combat is not your thing it gets repetitive then i would way for a sale, but it does not have to be dirt cheap to be worth it.  Recommend 20 off for those that want more of a traditional AC game.  Way better than AC3 imo, but not as good as AC, AC2 All of Ezios release except Brotherhood.
