Wow.Much PirateSuch Arrggh!Onto more serious stuff, Ive only played 4 hours of this game and to me, its already my Game of The Year. Seriously, its THAT good. Youll feel immersed into this beautiful world, youll feel really connected to Captain Edward Kenway and youll have tremendous fun sailing the sea, plundering and exploring. These are the best 50 bucks youll ever spend!So grab the wheel and get ready for the time of your lives mateys!
