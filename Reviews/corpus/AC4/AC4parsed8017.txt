Wow. Just wow. This game is amazing!!! The graphics are beautiful and gameplay is smooth as it has ever been. The story is great and you dont have to play half the game to play the main character cough AC3. Although AC3 was my first game to play through all the way I must say AC4 is way better. New items weapons and just more badass stuff goes on in the game. And did i mention the map? Take AC3s map and times it by 10. I have so much more to do in the game and I cant wait!! Totally worth the the 35 bucks I spent on it and would absolutely spend 60 on it!
