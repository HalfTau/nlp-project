Yes, it took me more than 30 hours of playtime to write a review.Ill start with the fact that I usually hate big name devs like Ubisoft, Treyarch, etc. They rush and tend to overdo their games.AC4 is a bit different. In other recent Ubisoft games like WatchDogs, the HUD was intrusive and confusing as hell. In Black Flag, its pretty minimal and you can actually tell what is what. Naval combat is great, shooting is great, but melee combat is a little wonky, the game forces you to switch targets and its annoying. WatchDogs being the only other Ubisoft game I own, this is a big step up. In WatchDogs, the only interesting thing to do was the main mission, which was bland and mostly consisted of Aiden Pearce talking on the phone and shoving his hands in his pockets like a thug, then sneaking into an abandoned warehouse full of armed hackers and killing everyone. Which was impossible, even on easy the combat was insanely weighted toward your opponent. My favorite side mission in AC4 is climbing insanely high buildings and looking out over the beautiful Carribean landscape.Things I dont likeUplay. Crappy Steam wannabe.The whole thing where the game is just a simulation and nothing is actually real. Great marketing ploy Abstergo.Lazy animating. A lot of recycled and crappy animations.Voice quality meh.Last but definitely not least LEGENDARY SHIPS MAKE ME WANNA FOJAHIFBWYUONVOWINAIUVDHIUNWOUNFVOWNOverall, AC4 Black Flag gets a 7.5/10
