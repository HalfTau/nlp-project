All I can say is that Im glad we are nearing the end of this gens time. Its been rather shaky, similar and it deviated too much from the original assassins creed in the name of so called progress. Since the combat changed in AC3 fights were not as fluid and at the same time you had to rely on a red triangle that wouldnt always appear hence you getting hit when it wasnt your fault. Plus AC4 was just annoying in the amount of gunmen who would  out and just shoot you from a distance forever... its the pirate era guys they dont have a Mary Poppins bag for their ammo. Another thing in comparison is that execution of assassination went 1 of 2 ways, stealth where you basically follow one stealth route because there is only one way to not get caught or to just plough through. The AC3/4/FC and now Rogue have proven to be more of an action man running a linear path where it was harder to give yourself credit as the true master behind the assassination. Not taking anyis cool and all but its missing the point of the assassins creed franchise from before. Combatwise in Brotherhood if you wanted to up you could do so as long as you had the skill to do so whereas the faulty combat system of the next ones were.... well easy yet didnt work all the time. Plus Unitys getting that blackbox repeat from AC1 and the combat will be an improved version of AC1 so yeah going back to the roots is going to be a hell of a lot more fun than these games.As a standalone game do purchase it but if youre expecting a triumph in AC Franchise progression you will be disappointed.
