If you looking for stealthopen world games I glad you to try this game because Im a fan of ac I played this game for 40 hours I know a bad and good thing of this game and this game the ac4 this is the stealth game that like action game and this ac4 is not my best ac games but It such a great game too. The best ac game is ac 3 I think so because about control in ac 3 I love it and about outfits connor suit it was very cool. Now It score times 9/10 because 1 point is bug I know every games had a little bug of it. But It was in mission bug I very disappointed beause when I was playing a add mission I wouldnt finish because it bug
