Thats a lie, thats a lie, better than No Mans Sky!Not just a great AC game this and AC2 are my favourites but also a truly amazing pirate game, I think that might have even been accidental but Ubisoft actually did really well with this one.Although its a bit odd that a lastgen game only just runs at a solid 60fps at 1440p on a GTX 1080 with everything turned up.Yes Id recommend this game but no I would definitely not recommend turning on PhysX, it pretty much always has and probably always will be absolutely pointless.
