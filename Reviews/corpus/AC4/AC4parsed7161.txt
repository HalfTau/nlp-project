Probably the greatest AC game thus far. My pirates sing. Then they board ships. Then they sing. Then we rescue people. Then I kill an ocelot by air striking it from a coconut tree. Dopeness. Having some glitching issues that freezes it at random, unexpected times but the gameplay is golden. Also I shot an alligator.
