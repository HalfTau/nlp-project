One of my favorite games ever. A fabulous historical romp. I would recommend this to any gamer, even if you have no love for the AC franchise, this is just a great game. My only complaint is the painfully slow first hour or so, but youll soon forget about that once you are engaging in thrilling naval battles, palling around with Blackbeard, upgrading your ship, and seeing an awesome fictional spin put on all those old pirates you probably never read about in the history books.
