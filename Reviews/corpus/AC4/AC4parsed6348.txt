Awesome game! No problems with bad perfomance, the history flows nicely, INCREDIBLE NAVAL COMBAT, great customization and integration with an iOS/Android minigame app, which keeps track of your ingame progress and allows you to use the map and fleet in real time. Get this game if you love the AC series and the good ol piracy.Cons For some people, I dont know why, Uplay is a no go.
