The game is broken. I got about 2 hours in and now all it does is crashes. Nothing I try helps. Google searching found that many others are having the same problem. This is unacceptable for a game thats been out for a year. With all the issues that Unity has had, and now the issues Im having with Black Flag, Im done with Ubisoft games. They wont get a penny from me until they prove that they care about their customers again.
