Extremly fun and a massive amount of things to do and improves on the disappointment that was AC3. Sailing around in a boat while your crew sings sea shanties is one of the common but enjoyable experiences in the AC series so far. Definitely reccomend this game if you felt dissapointed with AC3, or if you are a newcomer to the AC series.
