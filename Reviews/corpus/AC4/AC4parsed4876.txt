This game is perfect to destress over. Work/school week sucked? Take it out on Spanish guards!The graphics are spot on, and Edward is one likable assassin to play as. Need another reason to play this game?.. PIRATES! And you can make them sing for you.. for hours on end. Even if you play through the story there is still so much to explore, loot and plunder.
