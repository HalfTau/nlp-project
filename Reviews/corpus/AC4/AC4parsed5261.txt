Even if you havent played Assassins Creed series before , THIS is one mega immersive pirate game.Its well made in all aspects. It doesnt really matter if you havent, this is my first Assassins Creed game i bought for the pirate world and it was one of the best buys i have had for ages.I overlooked it when it was released in 2013, as i didnt like the look of Assassins Creed in general, my loss until recently.Pity this game wasnt restructured and sold as a pirate game in its own right on release, it would have sold far more imo.
