Black Flag is easily my favorite Assassins Creed there is so much to do and explore in the game! The game maintains the Assassins Creed story while also being extremely entertaining with awesome gameplay.But above all,! I mean, thats obviouisly the idea of Black Flag, but being a pirate in the game is much more entertaining than you would expect. From singing shanties with your crew to roaming the seas for plunder, it is truly a great gaming experience!
