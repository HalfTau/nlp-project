As always awesome Assassins Creed game. The open sea gameplay really adds to the immersion, and freedom of the game. However assassinations does not seem to be the primary central theme in this game since Edward is a pirate and not an assassin, but nonetheless it is a great addition to the Assassins Creed lineage. Highly recommended to play this one
