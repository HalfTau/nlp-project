Assassins Creed 4 is probably the best game of the series. Mostly because its not really an Assassins Creed game anymore, but thats good. Assassins Creed games werent very good to begin with. Its like if Ubisoft took Assassins Creed, added a bunch of Far Cry 3, and then added tons of rum. So yeah, pretty good.
