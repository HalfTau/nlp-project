This is a lot of fun, you upgrade your ship and have a blast building your empire up in this one. you get the AC feel too with a return to classy assassin missions and not being detected junk is just a 50 cash reward bonus in themstory does still demand it sometimes though. I LOVE THIS! If you like space games as well where you build up your ship this isnt a far cry from that also. I love how you really feel like a pirate because the money has a place to go for a long time. your scraping up everything you can for good reason! I rarely lunge at DLC but im likely to buy it once I finally run out of gameplay on this.p.s. the crew shantys!
