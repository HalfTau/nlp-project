There are few games that truly capture my imagination, and this is indeed one of them.I have play almost all the AC games since their inception. Due to brand fatigue I did skip AC 3, so I went right from revelations to BF.I was not prepared for the increase in quaility.Dont get me wrong, AC2/BH/Rev were all excellent games in thier own right, but the sheer jump in scope and quality I was simply not prepared for when I started BF. I am a huge Sid Myers pirates fan, and Pirates The Legend of Black Kat on ps2, so you could say my love of the pirate genre runs deep. However, all we pirate fans have gotten over the years are some mediocre IOS games and the like that I wouldnt pay a cent for much less invest my time. I digress however as for the game...Once you unlock the ship the game because both undeniably enchanting and breathtakingly beautiful. The map feels huge and it is insanely fun to just zip around pillaging ship after ship of its resources. This was so true for me that for several day I forgot I was even playing an AC game. I just went around pillagng ships and upgrading the Jackdaw to become the most fearsome pirate ever. Quite often I would just sail around and admire the beauty of the islands and oceans while listening to my crew sing shanties. After awhile I even caught myself singing along! The setting is very refresshing finally taking us out of a colonial/eurocentric setting and placing us sqarely in a tropical paradise. As for the game mechanics. Beyond the ship sailing and combat it is exactly what you would expect from an AC game.
