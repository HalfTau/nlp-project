Best Assassins Creed game. And the thing is, the least interesting parts are the Assassins Creed parts. Its like someone who loved Wind Waker was allowed to make an Assassins Creed game. I was upset at Ubisoft for how they were handling the Assassins Creed franchise, but this game deserves your attention.
