Easily the most enjoyable game in the series, naval combat doesnt dissapoint and is reminiscent of pirates , naval combat is improved but similar to Assasin creed 3 but more varied the only dissapointment is that you cant upgrade to a frigate but have to upgrade a brig, but there is a good variety of upgrades and brig is fast enough to maneuver around man o war should you have to fight one. And luckily Desmond is finally gone and you explore the memories in Abstergo Entertainment Industries.The game looks way prettier than Assasin Creed 3 and the Character is somewhat more interesting Although he looks like a blatant ripp off OF Hunnam from Sons Of Anarchy.
