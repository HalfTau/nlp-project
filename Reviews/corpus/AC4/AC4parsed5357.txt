A fun game, but the controls while on foot are TERRIBLE.   The controls were good at the time of AC2, but needed tweaking then.  As long as youre not an angry gamer its a fine game, but if you tend to be serious youre going to get annoyed as hell playing this game.Most common issue is related to the contextual controls  youll be running in a straight line, and if you pass withing about 2 arms lengths of an object you can interact with, you have a very high chance of deviating from that line and performing that context specific action.Lots of running and randomly jumping out of your way into a bush, or stopping to climb a tree thats off to the side.If the people at ubisoft would fix this, the game would be just mind blowing.
