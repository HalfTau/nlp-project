Having not played 3 after hearing bad things about it I was skepitcal and waited until it was on offer and however bad 3 must have been they have more than made up for. This is probably one of the few games in which you would get your money worth for something priced at 39.99, certainly at 25 off and upwards.One positive thing is that you dont really need to have played any of the previous games to understamd whats going on, and im not so sure if this is a positive thing or a small flaw but at some points I forgot I was playing the assasins creed franchise and felt I was playing an awesome pirate game. So its safe to say the whole pirates theme is amazing, if I was to be picky perhaps a little too cluttered in areas. The controls can be quirky at times, such as just simply wanted to drop down onto a ledge in which you end up jumping off in the other direction to your death but as long as you take your time and try not rush things it shouldnt really be an issue....most of the time.Theres many things in the game to keep you playing, such as discovering all locations, doing all activities in said locations, controling and taking ports and parts of the map, upgrading your ship, controlling your fleet, plundering etc.The sea battles are well designed and easy to work with and many adventures at sea to discover such as whale harpooning to crafting and upgrading your own gear. Im begining to see a potential for an mmo here. I havent played around with the multiplayer yet so nothing I can really say about it as I didnt buy the game for its multiplayer content but it should be interesting to see when i when around to it.
