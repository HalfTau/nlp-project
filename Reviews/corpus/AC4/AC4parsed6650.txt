So, after obsessing with this game, here is what I can sayIf youre the type of person who captured every fort in Far Cry 3, this is your game. This game is indeed ADHD paradise and gives you about a billion things to do while not insisting that you do any of it if you dont feel like it. The main story line is pretty boring after sidequesting all over the place. Im blasting my way through everything but the legendary ships, and Im having more of a blast pillaging the seas and upgrading my ship than anything the storyline really offers me. Ive taken down convoys, taken over fortresses, moved frigates to my personal fleet for naval contract missions, and my ship is really badass.All in all, its kind of like a highseas Skrim kind of experience. Tons of stuff to do, and its easy to ignore the main storyline to do it!
