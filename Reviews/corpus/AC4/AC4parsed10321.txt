Possibly the best story in the Assassins Creed franchise. There isnt much bad to say about the game.The graphics are superb, the story and gameplay have only improved over the years.Sadly, the game is poorly optimized, i would only recommend playing this with a powerful computer, unless you enjoy low resolution gaming.
