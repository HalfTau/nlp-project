From the perspective of someone that doesnt really care for the AoC franchise I dont really understand the hype around this gameits better than a normal assassins creed game but only by a small margin.The first two hours are trailing on foot. Seriouslythis game starts overloading you with the worst part about the franchise just two or three trailing missions for like two hours.  The next few are pretty much halfhalf of either 1. decently fun stealth assassination and headtohead ship/onfoot combat or 2. more trailing, either on foot or on water. 2 kills the game for me.  Just because Im now on a boat doesnt make trailing more fun it actually makes it worse, which is saying something.Personally I wasnt a huge fan of the ship stuff. It was novel for a bit but got boring after a while and started to feel a bit tedious.Get this on sale if you dont mind trailing missions or want to experience ship combat, otherwise just give it a pass. I dont think its really worth picking up if you arent invested in the franchise already.
