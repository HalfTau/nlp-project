Beautiful Physx engine, intriguing storyline, great voice acting. Environment details and quality is top knotch, and free roam is unrestricted to a certain extent. Player movement is somewhat sluggish. Gameplay has changed a lot. Players can hide in brushes and be invisible, and assassinating someone would not alert everyone else from around the map. Players can now pick up weapons from dead soldiers/pirates such as muskets, and use it. Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is somewhat like Brotherhood, where one can recruit Assassins, but in Black Flag, the Captain you can recruit both pirates and ships. Recruiting pirates adds to the Jackdaws strength, but adding ships to Kenways Fleet gives the player the ability to get extra money, after a certain amount of time. Definitely one of the best open world pirate games.  9.5/10
