Any shortcomings that AC3 had were absolutely made up for in AC4. There is a seemingly endless amount of things to do this in this game, so dont find yourself surprised if you end up wasting a good ten to twelve hours just exploring and doing sidequests before you ever tackle the main story. Definitely recommend this for anyone that is a fan of not only the AC series, but action/adventure games in general.
