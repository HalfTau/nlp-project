Now the Assassins Creed series for me has been good. The stories have been stellar and the optimization has been good for the most part. Unity had optimization problems but the story was Amazing. However Black Flack is the preadcessor to Unity and it is an amazing game with stunning scenery, great character building, and as a bonus there lots of ship battles that make you feel like Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. 10/10
