Ive played the Assassins Creed franchise since the beginning and I can say, without a doubt, that this is the best pirate genre game Ive played. But wait, I hear you cry, What about the assassinations? The aerial takedowns? The...Yea, yea, yea, all of thats there, but honestly the pirating is where its at in this gem. Youll find yourself grinning while youre riding the gale winds of a massive storm while you surf walls of water that seem as high as mounts up to the crest, only to need to dodge both the artillery fire from the fort youre attacking as well as the waterspout that seems to have a strange, personal malice towards your ship in particular. Its exhilarating.Theres still the assassinations while youre on land just like the other titles in the series, but the very things that set the bar for the Assassins Creed series rooftop running, parkour acrobatics and amazing assassinations end up being less fun than sailing your increasingly powerful ship of doom across the seas, daring to attack larger and larger ships and fleets of ships as your Cruiseliner of Death  becomes ever deadlier with each upgrade.I know Im understating this, but the story arc is fun and compelling as well. Blackbeard especially is an amazing character. I was certainly drawnin, but as I said earlier, the pirating is where its at.So, to bring it home, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is easily THE BEST pirate game Ive played to date. Its what I hope a future Sid Meiers Pirates remake how hard do I need to beg for this? aspires to surpass. Its by far the best installment in the Assassins Creed series.11/10 would pirate the seas again and again.
