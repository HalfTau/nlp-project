I think its fair to say I recommend this game as not only has it entered my top 5 games ever, it has a good claim on being the best game Ive ever played!  Its a phenomenally rich and detailed pirate sandbox which takes the typical Assassins Creed formula of which I am a fan but adds a twist.Edward is a different kind of protagonist for this series.  Hes instantly likable as a rogue looking to further his own ends.  But there is depth to the man.  He has a conscience and watching him grow as a character makes for a compelling story.Technically Im amazed by what the developers have managed to do.  The seamless transition between captaining a ship to the traditional Assassins Creed freerunning is incredible.  The simulation of the sea is a marvel as the rolling waves, the wind and storms look and feel amazing.  Make no mistake, if you have the rig to run it this game looks absolutely beautiful.There is so much to see and do in this game its almost impossible to get bored, there is such a vast area to explore.  As of right now I think Ive clocked 30 hours and Im just under a third the way through the game.
