I really wanted to love this game, I really did, but unfortunately I played it and felt incredibly let down.Having been a fan since the first game, and adoring the second, I was one of the fans who felt let down by the third game, but still enjoyed it for what it was, although I cannot forgive the ending, which is where I feel my dislike for this game comes from.The game mechanics themselves are the best theyve ever been, its the most fluid and easy to control Assassins Creed so far, BUT the overall story arc no longer interests me anymore, I found Edwards story to jump and skip all over the place, I really didnt feel like I was experiencing his character grow in significant ways like with previous games. And the real world story while an interesting idea really didnt feel fleshed out enough for me, the only bits I really enjoyed were the memos Desmond had recorded for his father.Overall Ill keep playing it, as from what Ive read Im only a few hours from the ending, but I shall be more patient when thinking about buying the next installment, and it will probably be the first Assassins Creed I dont preorder.
