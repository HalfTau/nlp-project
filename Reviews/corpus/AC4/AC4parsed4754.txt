The game is very nice, has good graphics and gameplay. I cannot say anything about the story because my savegames always disappears.I gave up trying to finish it. I do not know what happen to it when you dont play for more than a week. The save game simply disappears as I said before. And the best is that you cannot restore a backed up savegame.
