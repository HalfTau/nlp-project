First off I have never played a AC game until this one. A friend sent me a message on steam during the summersale and told me I would like it...Pros Game looks great, and the story/voice acting is well done... the novelty of jumping around and climbing onis entertaining.Cons Everything else, lol. Combat system is a joke. I ran into a group of enemies 6 or 7 of them and smashed my keys and won. The sneaky sneak in this game is hide in bushes and in closets and hay... which is all fine if there were more to sneaking around than that, but maybe I am missing something.From my experience with the game which I very little is run around rush enemies, mash keys and win. Did not even have to think about what weapons the enemies had, if other enemies were close, ifgoes bad how do I get out? Nothing of the sort and you win. So if you are terrible at video games, like playing just for story, or like falling asleep while playing a game that is not very challenging then pick it up. But if you are like me who likes playing games on expert, thinking before you attack, then this game franchise isnt for you.
