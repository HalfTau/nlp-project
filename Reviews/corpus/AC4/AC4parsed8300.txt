Ok theres a legitimate way to fix  frames if you have a rig that can run this game, the first thing you do is go to NVIDIA Control Panel or AMD Catalyst, manage 3D setting and then go to program settings, from there select Assassins Creed IV Black Flag and change the Vertical sync setting to Use the 3D application setting after you do that enter the game turn off its vertical sync setting and you should be getting a smooth 60fps.
