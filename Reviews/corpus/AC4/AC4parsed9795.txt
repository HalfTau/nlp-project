 Entertaining story with quirky plot twists. Blackbeard is beyond awesome. ARRR! Vast open world of inconceivable beauty. Significantly improved naval battles gameplay which I really enjoyed. Very unusual soundtrack comprised of the pirates singing. These songs always got stuck in my head for quite a while. Quite challenging underwater missions. Harpooning. Fast travel points in every location. Blonde protagonist. Brotherhood was the only chapter in which I replayed memories to get 100 synchronization. It was interesting and challenging. And here its all like stay out of combat. I think its not polite to impose stealth in a game with no crouch binding  In most cases, I would grow tired of sitting in shrubs, stand up and just kill all loitering guards hindering me from looting chests and getting my preecious collectibles The whole Kenways Fleet minigame is ridiculous. If only puzzles were a bit more challenging...Annnd still, the Brotherhood is the best.Im eager to see the Assassins in Russia
