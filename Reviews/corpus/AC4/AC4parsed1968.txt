This is a great game...prehaps the last great game in the Assassins Creed series...with the noteworthy exception of Rogue...where I got stuck at doing the bandit nests...without cheat codesYes,I have them all ...all the 14 games in the series1,2,Brotherhood,Revelation,Liberation,3,4,Unity or 5,6 or Syndicate,the 3 mini games,Rogue...Most Assassins Creed games have very difficult missions where you have to prouve that you are a true Assassin or...die trying hundreds of timesThis title is mostly free of these issues unline 3 where towards the end I had to slow time to a crawl to be able to finish it...
