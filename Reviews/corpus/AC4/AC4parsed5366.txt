Couldnt play this on the PC wasnt good enough but I picked it up later on the xbox. I did everything, got everything 100 sync. I got nothing for it.This isnt really an assassins creed game. I enjoyed it up until the final conclusion where the game ended and I realised it hasnt actually had ANY story out of the animus. It had just enough to justify the title but literally NOTHING happened. I have played and 100 synced all of the games to date, This one will be my last. I have no interest in the later games anymore. Its just become a cash cow.
