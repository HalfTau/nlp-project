The game itself is fantastic if you like pirates and the age of sail theme but unfortunately the game is poorly optimized and the save system is broken. Not being able to progress in a game really defeats playing in my opinion and Ubisofts attitude towards this problem is poor as they dont believe its a game breaking issue, which it is.Once these problems are fixed I would defiantly recommend this game.
