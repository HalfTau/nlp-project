A little problematic here and there, mechanics have been altered and classic controls have been removed. On the upside, it feels like youre playing AC1 and 2 all over again. Feels nice be pirate, in control of your own ship and still having the assassination mechanics included in it all makes this game very appealing to the AC franchise.Quite a few improvements over the ACIII architecture and engine, handles better and looks less cartoonish the ACIII characters looked like they were ported straight from Mount  Blade Napoleonic Wars. I quite like it, its classic Assassins Creed. The sense of wonderment exploring the new islands and the open sea, and even the presentday first person mode whilst outside the animus is intriguing.Would I recommend? Yes, for the moment. It all depends on if the story is well written and if the game expands into something huge.
