great game i would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the pirate type gameplay assassins creedhas been one of my favorite games since the very first one and i can say they have only gotten betterthis game not only has a great story line but the multiplayer can be very fun when you wanna steer your shipaway from the story.10/10 easy.
