I feel this is a large improvement over III, the focus on ship combat/exploration works well. Ive personally experienced a few glitches but mostly humourous and nothing game breaking and it feels really solid for a game that came out exactly one year after III which caused me to have doubts but so far Im enjoying it a lot and its reminding me of Sid Meiers pirates at times which is another great pirate game from 2004.Though as an Assassin game ie when youre not on your ship the game does feel like a bit of the same old song and dance, kill this guy, tail that guy and so forth. I hope you like tailing missions because there are at a least a dozen or so which can make the story and some side missions drag on longer than desired and the free running can have some issues at times not going where you want it to, leading to you running up walls you dont want to and if youre unlucky ruining your stealth.Outside the animus this time around you play in the first person as a silent  faceless protagonist who just does what hes told, theres very little freedom here until later on where you get to interact with other computers and collect sticky notes and in my playthrough I collected all these to no reward as far as I know.I didnt play the multiplayer but I did check out the menus and such which enable you to buy just about any upgrade, weapon, cosmetic etc for real money as well as in game currency which can lead to a sort of pay to win attitude since you can just buy anything you need with microtransactions.Overall the game is pretty fun as long as you stay on your boat as on land there is not a lot in the way of new content if anything different at all gameplay wise. The world itself is fairly pretty though after a while you may notice some copy pasted structures and landmasses. In closing I do recommend this but as a pirate adventure game and not an Assassins Creed game.
