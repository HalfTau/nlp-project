All I can say is that this game is pure love. Not just for the characters but the whole Caribbean setting is just awesome and soo comfy. Now I know this game is developed by Ubishi... soft like all the other Creeds but its marvellous. There are some bugs and problems but they arent gamebraking. This game got me into the Assassins Creed series and was the first of them I played and honestly I doubt any of the other Assassins Creed games will be as good as this.Anyway, from me its a certain recommendation, without a doubt. Optimizing could be better and some bugs that youd think Ubisoft wouldve noticed and fixed by now arent but overall its an amazing game with awesome characters and Id say its one of the few game where you actually care about your character and want to know more about him. I even got the Freedom Cry DLC because I wanted more.I can recommend the DLC too, but only if its on sale. It was a good DLC with some extra gameplay to let you know what happened to Adwal after he left Kenway but it was very short fo the pricetag.Wait for a sale and go get it  one of the few Ubishit titles worth the money! steamhappy quid
