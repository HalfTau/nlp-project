I was initially rather skeptical with AC4, especially after playing AC3 which I did not particularly like. Well, AC4 Black Flag changes all that. From the first moment of the game, players are immersed in a wide open area the sea basically. Several notable things are the vastness of the areas to explore, the cities, the oceans, the forts, the missions, etc. I spent about 60 hours completing the main storyline, plus accumulating the Mayan and Templar outfit, and also upgrading the Jackdaw.What differentiates AC4 from its predecessor is that players need to upgrade Jackdaw as much as the main character sometimes more of Jackdaw than the main character. However, just a minus for me is that, there are too many distractions between main missions, although.... all those are pretty rewarding as well.Storyline is also rather interesting. Players get to see Edward develop, in both character and personality so I think thats interesting. Control is smooth and easy to understand.Overall, Ubisoft has done a great job in building the details of this game. For both the universe of Edward Kenway as well as the real life character we are playing. The details are just stunning and rather interesting, especially when players get to see Assassins Creed stuff on the work table. Lastly, while sailing or exploring large open areas can be boring/ monotonous at times, the pirates songs are pretty nice and keep players company on those long voyage. After some time, you may find youselves singing along to the tunes.
