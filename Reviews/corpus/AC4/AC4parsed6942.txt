I am new to the AC community, but this game is really cool. The graphics to me are a 10/10, movement is very fluent between jumps, grabs, and swinging. The fighting mechanics are those that I can get used to very quickly. I think the storyline is great and the fact that you can freeroam and do what you want in between missions is prodigious. Graphics on the sea and on land are amazing and the pirate ship controls are fairly well, Id give it a 7/10. To sum it up, Assassins Creed Black Flag was a great first game for me to start on, and Id recommend it to lots. Cant wait to see Unity...
