So maybe the storyline is a bit cruddy, and by this i mean theres not much assassin and not much BTS behind the scenes gameplay, but that is made up for by massive exploration, endless weapon and cool fighting abilities. And all in all, its not too bad. I had expected something entirely different, but the game is great and all is well, so buy that sht D
