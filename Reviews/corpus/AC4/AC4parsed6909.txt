Pirates.An assassins creed game but with pirates. Youll spend most of your time at sea but you can also explore various landmarks and islands to your enjoyment. Like any other AC game, you can parkour, steal, and assassinate your targets besides innocents. Single player multiplayer search and hunt gameplay is available too is solid and will take you on an adventure that is free and unobligated to the rules of society. The main character will mature and grow from a naive pirate to an understanding assassin. Is this a pirate game or a AC game? This game disappoints because it acts too much like a pirate game instead of a true AC game.Frame rate drops during massive ship battles, mundane missions, and bland pirate buddies who just sings all day. These are a few of the issues present in the game and there are others as well not detailing them at the moment.However, as a pirate game this game is probably the best one so far despite its disapointments.
