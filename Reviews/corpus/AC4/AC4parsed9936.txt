A fantastic romp through the life of a pirate, this edition of Assassins Creed diminishes the realworld Abstergo story in favor or Animus storyline immersion.  Its an absolute treat to play the typical roof jumping portion, but when you add in the ocean battles it truly makes this a game for the ages.  Heavily recommend.
