If you enjoy frame drops, gamebreaking bugs, and poor optimization, this is the game for you. After being out for over 3 years, the PC version of this game is by far one of the worst ports I have ever seen. The game runs poorly even though I have a 980m and an i7 processor. Regardless of the settings I still get frame drops and the game bugged out so badly once that I was forced to remove the battery from my laptop because the game locked up my entire computer, even though I just got the thing. Ubisoft should be ashamed that they sell a game in this state, and there is no excuse for leaving a game in a broken state for multiple years. In spite of the horrendous performance, this is still my favorite Assasins Creed games. When it works, it is a beautiful game with mechanics and gameplay unique from all of the other games in the series. Buy this game on console if you want a working version.
