I feel like a lot of AC games start to feel really repetitive after a while. The sea combat in Black Flag really helps break that up and the pirate theme is pretty awesome. This may be one of the top 5 pirate games ever made.So if you like AC games but get bored of the same missions over and over or if you just really like pirates, definitely give this game a try.Also check out Black Sails on the Starz channel!
