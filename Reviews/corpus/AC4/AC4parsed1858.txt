I started my assassins creed playing with this game.And this game is a quintessence of that I wanted from this games series.Pirates.Sea.Ocean.Boarding ships.Plantations.Your own brig and rum masters.This game is appealing to books Ive read in my life. Stories of Jack London, White Jaguar of Arkady Fiedler, Captain Blood His Odyssey of Rafael Sabatini and other.Thanks for this, Ubisoft!
