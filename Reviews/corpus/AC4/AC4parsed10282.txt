Im having an incredible amount of fun with this game. Aside from the lastgenlooking skin shaders, the game is visually glorious. The lighting is amazing. TXAA is incredible goodbye temporal aliasing. Variable penumbra shadows are always awesome as thats how shadows work in real life. And, of course, the ocean looks completely beautiful. I spend half of my time just staring in awe at how pretty it all is. They even managed to implement blurry screenspace reflections here and there which BF4 doesnt even have. When sneaking around in foliage, I love the way the leaves shift around. The game reminds me a lot of Far Cry 3 which I also loved. The naval combat is great. I love the upgrades. Its safe to say that Im hooked. Best game Ive played in a while. Get it!
