From what Ive heard, this game is fantastic and one of the best of the Assassins Creed series. Unfortunately, my PC which is a highend gaming laptop at the time of writing cannot run this game without horrible graphical tearing. When I get a new PC or they fix this issue Ill write a new review, but until then I cannot recommend the PC port.
