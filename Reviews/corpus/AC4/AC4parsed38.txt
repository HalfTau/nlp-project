This is my first experience with the franchise and I am terribly disappointed. I wanted to be a pirate but the controls are too clunky and unresponsive. There is no continuity between where you can and cant go, what you can and cant climb. No NPC interaction beyond shopping or hiding by walking next to them. Every mission is a hand holding walkthrough where you literally cant lose or have no idea what you are supposed to do. Combat is a joke, nothing but button mashing and randomness. The story line is uninteresting and nonsensical. Theres some random bits in the future and it appears the entire game is a simulation or something. Honestly the worst part is the sailing and exploring, you know the pirate stuff. You cant openly explore the world, as every time you go somewhere a fog appears and says you cant access that area. Utterly disgusting.
