Amazing game, r8 8/8 m8, definitely appreci8, dont h8.Well I actually havent played it yet. You see, I suffer from a rare medical condition called having a Macbook. Its very expensive to treat, as most medicine is incompatible no matter how much Wine I wash it down with. Other side effects include being allergic to windows, and inability to run sometimes.But if you can run it, definitely get this game. Especially now that Ubisoft done ed up with Unity, I expect a lot of people to be buying Black Flag although I dont know what kind of retard withholds buying a game to wait for a sequel when its a storydriven series, but that seems to be happening. And with Unity being the last Assassins Creed game, if they end up not fixing the bugs, Black Flag could be all we have.until Ubisoft listens to the advice of 10 year old me and releases Lego Assassins Creed
