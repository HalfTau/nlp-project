First AC titled Ive played and I am not disappointed, incredibly addictive and 100s of hours of gameplay are available.  The open world is what really makes this game for me, a lot of other open world games lack direction and you feel lost in the middle of this.  While AC4 is far from linear it does have some direction as to what area you should go to next.
