Similar to others, Im going to split this review into two sectionsAs an entry in the Assassins Creed franchiseFollowing the somewhat lukewarm III, Black Flag is a solid title within the AC story. It doesnt quite reach the same lorerich and plot development points of II but its enjoyable nevertheless. Edward is a likeable protagonist, with clear goals. Its a refreshing take on the formula, with him coming into the Assassins vs. Templars conflict as an outsider. The modern day plot is also different, and it all leads to a good change of pace for the franchise. Its an overall story that motivated me to keep playing, keep reading all the additional database entries and just generally kept me well engaged.As a PirateyAction Adventure gameBlack Flag is one of the greatest actionadventure games I have ever played. Its that simple. The developers took the most enjoyable part of III  the sailing  and made it the main game mechanic. Sailing around the Caribbean is a fantastic experience, ranging from beautiful desert beaches to howling gales, always with your crew singing sea shanties. Naval combat is seamless and well designed, and I cant think of a bad point against it. Having a mammoth shootout with a Man o War then swinging aboard on a rope, pistols blazing, in a boarding action  all set to a Pirates of the Caribbean esque soundtrack  is one of the all time great gaming experiences.Way hay and up she rises, early in the morning!
