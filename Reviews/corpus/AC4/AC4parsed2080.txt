Black Flag is a great pirate game. It doesnt really feel like an Assassins Creed game yet somehow does at the same time. Edward Kenway is one of the better AC protagonists and is a fun character to portray.One of the best parts of the game is the sea. Whether you decide to go exploring the vast ocean, trying to find buried treasure, harpoon some sea creatures in order to craft yourself better gear or just go pirating and destroy every other vessel in sight, theres a ton of things to do.The missions are quite fun although they suffer from the same issue that most AC games have which is they can get repetitive.Its a beautiful looking game and a world you can easily get sucked into for long periods of time.
