Pretty good, though the story both in and out of the animus is a departure from the previous games.  The naval combat is a lot more fun than I expected, and you can spend a lot of time just doing that.  There are a few annoying parts, and I didnt like the end of the storyline much.  Overall Id say its about as innovative and original as AC2, which was a vast improvement over AC1.  If you like these games at all you should definitely pick it up.
