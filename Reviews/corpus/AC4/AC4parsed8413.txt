Game finally works, Just uninstall and redownload AC4 and Uplay, then log in after that you can change your settings to  Always start up in offline mode . Now Assassins Creed IV Black Flag works all the time , It sucks that it took so long to fix. It was worth the wait though. The game is fun and complex and full of action and pirates. Good game.
