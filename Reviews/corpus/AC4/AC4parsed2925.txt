Ill be honest although I liked Black Flag I found many a time when I just gave up on the games many flaws. Lets jump straight into the immesurable pile of corpses in the haystack, Usbisoft have yet to fix many graphical and gameplay bugs three years after its releace The movement system is as simple as ever, who knew that holding SHIFT and W could make you go on a three mile parkour run? I dont give for graphics neither does my computer so I set all the settings to low after finding my way through the Abstergo menu system  which is frankly confusing  and obtained a briliant FPS of around 25 after switching graphics cards I had around 35, lo behold, two hours into the game ten minutes of which are running through  a forest holding SHIFT and W the screen froze but the minimap and visual markers continued moving, after some digging google it turns out that the game requires you to turn volumetric fog on for it not to freeze, so yeah graphical errors may be my falt but still at one point Eds hood gliched and dissapeared leaving me looking like Sam Worthington with a pirate fetish lastly but not least in the corpse pile is me feeling that Ubisoft could have done a lot better with Black Flag if was a standalone game not involving all this Assassin and Templar rubbish, without it I would have actually connected emotionaly with the charicter, but no every time you feel yourself getting piraty it chucks you out of the game into a ten minute walking simulator constantly pressing E and talking to people with creepier faces than Captain Thatch himself. Despite this i found the sailing responsive and smooth with an actual hardness factor in both the fighing styles not just pressing E to kill everyone and the movement system drifting ect, the weapon switching was a little unexplaned but you get the hang of it. My only problems were that the storms were a little short and randomised and that you could pick up an entire crew of shipwreck survivors in five minutes. All most considered this is one of Ubisofts best games minus the Assassin storyline, but im not reccomending it unless you can get it for under 5.
