OK for me the thing that actually made AC3 enjoyable was the sea conflicts. So how are the sea conflicts in AC4?? More of the same and yet much much better at the same time. If the sea battle were all that the game consisted of I would have put it down many hours ago. However the rest of the game is actually pretty good. The only thing that I really do not care for is the eavsdrop missions. Other than that this has to be the best Assassins Creed yet. I Also realy like the kenways fleet minigame. Althogh it seems that the fleet missions are just reappearing missions. As much as some people may complain about Uplay I do like the social aspect built into the game. But it is not really needed unless you are heavily vested into the kenway fleet missions. That is really were the social aspect comes into play. Having friends on Uplay  that are active fleet players can really increase the money making aspect of the game by decreasing the time required to complete the fleet missions. Assassins Creed 4 as a complete package is well worth the price of admission.
