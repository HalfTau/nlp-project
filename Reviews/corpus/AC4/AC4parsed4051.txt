Its the best of the Creed series for me personally. I think this is because of the setting, the better mechanics, the sailing of course and the fact I find fake Italian accents really annoying, which were thankfully absent this time.I enjoyed the story, but the feeling of the game felt somewhat disjointed with switching between the animus and the memory world. That part of it just felt tacked on. I didnt play through the dozens of side missions as they are mainly quite pointless other than the ones that enable you to upgrade your ship, those are pretty important.The only thing that really annoyed me was the bugs with the ship, very often on loading into docking the ship would literally rise up out of the bottom of the sea and kill my entire crew, once I was even stuck inside the ship. Another time I was piloting the ship under water. This happened a lot and actually ruined the final ship scene with my spoiler. The ship killed my whole crew and lay on the deck for the whole scene making it seem like I was dead on a ghost ship.
