Great Addition to the AC series.I have been playing assassins creed since number one and these games have a special place in my cold shriveled gamer heart. In Black Flag you play as Edward Kenway, a pirate. As a pirate game, Black Flag is near perfect. The naval combat, huge map and nice graphics make it second to none. The only problem I have with the game is that it doesnt FEEL like an Assassins Creed game. You dont get that overwhelming feeling of badassness you would get with Ezio or Altair. but dont let that discourage you from buying this game. It is plenty of fun and definetly an improvement over the last installment. For me, I am going back to good ol AC2 on Xbox. Looking forward to Unity. Good job Ubisoft!7.99/10
