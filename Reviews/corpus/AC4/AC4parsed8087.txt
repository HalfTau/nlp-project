so far this is leaps and bounds 10000000 miles better then AC3 edward is a likeable character unlike connor. no matter what ive done in this game ive enjoyed it wether it be hunting animals to craft new gear or exploring the briny depths in search of treasure. ive only experienced about 20 hours but so far id give this a good 7.5/10
