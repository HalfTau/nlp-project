Being a rather expensive game when I got it, Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag was a risk I decided to take in terms of money. As it turns out, I made the right decision! Amazing graphics coupled with intense story, this newest installment of the AC franchise has thrown out some interesting new mechanics. I would like to start with my first and favorite part of the game being a pirate!Thats right. With the vast lay of the caribbean sea and its thousands of tropical islands to explore, one does get the feel of a real matey, especially when you play at the helm. Yep, you have a ship and a crew that you control. Buy upgrades and crewmembers for your ship. Combat other vessels and loot their holds for treasure to sell, allowing you to further upgrade your ship! I love this mechanic of the game. It has been well thought out and fits in with the story very well.In addition to the piratey nature of the game, I loved the freerunning ability to further explore environments on a whole new level! I also love the silent assassin techniques, like silently slipping your extension knife into a Spanish commandantes back or firing a Zerk Dart at a soldier, making them kill their comrades. All very satisfying aspects of the gameplay. I think my only criticism of AC4BF is guided to the notability of the rather uncanny way in which waterspouts follow your ship or seem to way after a storm has blown out. Otherwise, I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game and look forward to future DLCs if there are any planned!I rate this a 9.5/10 for simply managing a great storyline and openworld explorability both at the same time! To get a 10/10, they need to make a DLC that allows multiplayer pirate ship battles!
