Worst game i have ever played.. Best pirate game i have played..But hey if you like hair that acts like spagettie and watter that reacts like jello Ubisoft games are for you!!Even the side games in game are ridiculus! you stand a 65 chance of losing just because you go first..The controols are sometines non responsive, missions that require you to do something only one way or lose.Their is no reall freedom to do as you choose..Great story thoGot this game on sale, is till more dissapointing than half life 2 which wont work at allI would not recomend this game to an enimy
