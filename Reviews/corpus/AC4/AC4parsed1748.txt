This Assassins Creed title allows alot more flexibility in the gameplay, meaning you can play it how you want. If you want to take the route and be an assassin then do so, or a pirate and plunder ships and a more headon approach this is also an option. From what i have seen, there are also alot more side quests and things to do other than the main story line, like taking on massive legendary ships in the far reaches of the world, or hunting for the mysterious mayan key stones to unlock a rare and extraordanary armor set, along with loads of other things. A great game all around, a total reccomendation.
