Assassins Creed 4 is so very close to being the Pirate game Ive always wanted. The variation of activities to do kept the game moving along, pacing isnt an issue when the game gives me the freedom to choose. Often times Id spend a few hours sailing the seas, harpooning, stopping to pick up some lost treasure, or liberating ships from their captains to add to my own fleet... all between doing the story missions.Environments have been given plenty of detail and character of their own. Havana, Nassau, Kingston, and the island ports all have a unique ambience. The ocean, where you will likely spend a good amount of time, also keeps things interesting with changing weather and wave conditions. The water even has a correct appearance when you see the light shining through the wave.Combat can still have some odd stumbles, but the majority of the time it felt smooth. Weapon variation seems to have taken a backseat in this incarnation. Dual swords, pistols, hidden daggers, and fists are what youll use the most, with rope darts making a very late entry. I didnt use the heavy weapons much in the previous games, but I had hoped to see some one handed fencing to round out the swashbuckling experience.The Good Player character has personality, something AC3 lacked. Large open world is fun to explore. Controls feel improved.The Bad Storyline feels disjointed at a few steps along the way. The ending wasnt very satisfying. Lack of weapon variation.
