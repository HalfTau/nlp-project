one the best assassins creeds this game is beautiful chalk full of content with a great story almost everything in this game is done perfectly but there are a few problems that i found ruined some of the gameplay for me.pros the map is huge and full of environments the antagonist is awesome i love playing an anti hero the naval combat is done amazingly though simple the character cuztomization makes the game your ownconsthe game is very poorly optimized so it requires a lot more graphicaly than neededthere is a lot of lag not in framerate but in minor delays whenever i try to do somethinghand to hand combat system was dumbed down even moreoverall great game would give it 9/10
