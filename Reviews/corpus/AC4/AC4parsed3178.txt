Caution! SPOILER ahead! One of the best games I have ever played. Is it a good Assassins Creed game? No. I dont think so. Despite a lot of people I liked the story in the present time period with desmond and Black Flag doesnt continue this story properly. Also the focus on killing people a sneaky way isnt as present as in the prequels. So why did I like Black flag? Although it isnt a very good Assassins Creed game the atmosphere, the setting and the characters were awesome. For me it isnt a very good Assassins Creed game but it is an awesome Open World Game.
