I will rate this game as negative.This game has a lot of login issues,crashes,bug.When on a mission there is always a bug that causes crashes,which make the experience so badly and make you dont want to play it anymore.It was fine and as i go a long,i recieve a lots of crashes,bug for examplesMissing minimaps,No AI for the missions,and it will crash whenever that things happen.I was stuck in the loading screen for so long because of that bug.....Come on AAA game you cannot do dis to me.Ive been a big fan of ASSASINS CREED series,i even have the booksCool storyWinky face.Overall i didnt get any satisfaction at all in this game.SMH but thats mean you dont have to buy it,maybe you will get a diffrent perspective than what i have.BECAUSE MY GOOD WILL,I WILL RATE IT
