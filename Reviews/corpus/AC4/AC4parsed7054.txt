This game is the game that Sid Meiers Pirates wishes it was. The graphics are gorgeous Ive been asked I f a screenshot I had made was a real fotograph of the caribbean, the game world is shock full of fun things to do and wonders to see, the plot is servicable and at times interesting, the characters, especially the main one, are most interesting the Assassins Creed series has ever come up with, but most importantl, it does not get in the way of the fun of being a pirate in the golden age of piracy. As pirate games go, I cant see how it can get any better than this.
