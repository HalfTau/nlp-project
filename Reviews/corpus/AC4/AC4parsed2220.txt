I like the game. I liked all of them in the series, actually.. but this one is different... in AC3, I felt like the ships were just an annoying side story... in this, they are way entrenched in the game... so much so that this doesnt even feel like part of the AC series... its a pirate game with some assasination... and thats not a bad thing... its just less focused on being the best assassin... its a great game, and lot of replayability... 8/10
