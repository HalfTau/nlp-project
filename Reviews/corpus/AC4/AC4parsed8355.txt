For me this was the best game in the Assassins Creed series, Best Pirate game and Best game of 2013.Great Graphics, immersion and story with likable characters, the gameplay is top notch as well especially with the inclusion of the open world naval combat. I pretty much played this game to its completion, collecting every little trinket and doing every sidequest. The DLC Freedom Cry was also very good and well made despite it being somewhat on the short side. However the base game is very long and has tons of content.
