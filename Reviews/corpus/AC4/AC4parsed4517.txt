Im not going to review this game for the gameplay, as it has been done a dozen times already. The game itself is the best in the franchise. This review is strictly covering the PC port.As it is, this game is completely unplayable, without making serious graphical sacrifices. Even on a top of the line rig, areas in the game such as Havana experience serious drops in framerate, and stuttering performance. Attempting to play through them is pointless, especially considering the amount of time you spend in Havana. The PC port is an utter disappoint, even though I bought this title at a significant discount. I have an i7, with a GTX980 Ti graphics card, and this game was still unplayable. The optimization settings listed by Geforce did not solve the issues, either. The problem isnt a consistant drop in FPS, thats viewable, but its the constant chop from 100 frames, down  to the 2030 range, and right back up again. The experience is sickening. As it stands, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, despite how great the game is, otherwise.VERDICT Buy this on console. Deal with the reduced graphical quality, because on PC, this game is simply horrible. Gamestop has this game on console pretty cheap now, anyway.
