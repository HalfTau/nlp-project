Some fondly remembered game designs have aged poorly, but if I didnt know that The Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker came out 10 years ago on GameCube, it would be easy to believe that this HD rerelease was a brandnew PC game. Thats how well this classic action adventure game holds up. Its admirable longevity stems from excellent combat, charming characters, fun sidequests, inventive dungeons, one of the series best stories, and a celshaded art style that, while divisive, still looks great. For the rerelease, Nintendo made very smart decisions about what to update and what to leave alone.
