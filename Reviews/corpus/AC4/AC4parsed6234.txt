Unlike otherCreed titles that I own but do not play, I find myself coming back to this title again and again because of how beautiful the game is. Is itCreed? Yes. Do you have to do semiannoyingCreed things in it from time to time? Oh yeah, you do. I can overlook these issues, though, because of how new all the other features are. I love sailing the Carribean. I love how the ship rocks on the waves. I enjoy the boat on boat action. I enjoy some of the crazy minigames. This game has the benefit of having the most beautiful backdrop you can adventure in, so even mundane nonsense goes down much smoother if your brain is happy with the way it all looks. May your system be strong enough to process all of this glorious detail!
