So far I enjoy the game, only about 5 hours in but I wanted to write a review not so much about the game but about how big of a piece ofuplay is. I cant progress further in the game because  uplay servers are down. The game is good the combat feels nice and also the ship combat is fun. Uplay is a giant piece of if you can live through it though I recommend it.
