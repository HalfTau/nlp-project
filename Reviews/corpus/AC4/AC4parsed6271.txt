10/10 Recommend. Story was interesting, although some of the missions might have been a bit repetative. Ive put in close to 70 hours in this game and i think my completion is only around 70. Theres a lot of side activities to indulge in that will keep you occupied. I often found myself ignoring main quests just because of the side activities Naval contracts, Assassination contracts, etc. 10/10 would play again.
