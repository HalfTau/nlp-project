The pirate business was entertaining, the art was clearly updated, but the game play, story and characters were just soooo weak. As much as I enjoyed finally something different the ship/ pirate business, this game convinced me that the Assassins Creed franchise will just continue plummeting down the hill. As a huge fan, Im just disappointed. Still better than AC3, worth a play if youre a fan.
