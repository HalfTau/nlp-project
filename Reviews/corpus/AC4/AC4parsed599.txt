The sea shanties alone are worth the price of admission! The Dead Horse, Leave her Johnny!, Randy DandyO and others made me long to be on a ship, setting a jib, or furling a sail. I could imagine the ocean breeze and the sea spray. One of the few times I was really pulled into the atmosphere of a game.The gameplay is fun and theres enough variety capturing forts and other ships, a sea trade minigame, ship outfitting, collectibleharvesting, etc in addition to the main story to keep you playing a long time. The story is typical, decent AC fare. Seen as a whole, this was probably the AC game that Ive enjoyed the most to date, and probably in my top 20 games of all time.
