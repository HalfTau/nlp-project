The game before Assassins Creed went down, however, I suggest if you enjoy this experience which you will. It has fun gameplay, nice visuals, and a nice story, kinda stupid enemy and friendly AI though. then play Assassins Creed Rogue, its like this but combined with Assassins Creed 3s environment.
