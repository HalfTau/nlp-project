I am the REAL PIRATE. Why? I have played this game for only few hours and I played it to the end. Lets talk no more about this.What do I need to say about this game? It was GREAT. For me, It was not as good as the Ezio trilogy and I think I will not come back to it but anyways, give it a try and you will not regret buying it./ PROS vast open world ship combat the story main character atmosphere shanties environment/ CONS none
