As the new Assassins Creed game is about to be released I just finished through my first full playthrough of Black Flag.The GoodPirates Assassins Creed has always been great with its history and it doesnt fail here. It shows a vibrant pirate world to boot.The Sea and Sailing I loved the ship mechanics and being able to jump in whenever you wanted.The BadThe story made you hate Edward sometimes and its missions were not always the bestRandom treasure boxes everywhere Sometimes you had to jump off just to get to one treasure box with no encounterSome people liked the Abstergo offices part of the game. I eventually got into it but it wasnt as connected as other Assassin games. Who are you?Overall 7.5
