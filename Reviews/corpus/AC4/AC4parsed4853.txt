Best. Game. Ever. Amazing gameplay, amazing story, amazing charachters, amazing animation, amazing. I loved this game. 10/10. Only downside getting stuck on that one mission. If you have played the game, youll know which one i mean. Other than that, epic in every sence. Thank you Ubisoft, for the best Assassins Creed game yet.
