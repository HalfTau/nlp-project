Beautiful visuals if you have a good GPU, great story line that has intense moments and will make you miss certain characters. The only thing is ending was sort of cheesy, but not dissapointing. As usual endless amounts of collectibles like every other Ubisoft game, but they are even easier to acquire than watchdogs collectibles.
