Please read the ending!This game was incredibly fun on PS3 and then on PS4. The setting of the game breaths new life into the franchise making it the best Assassins Creed in my opinion. The current day sections are far less annoying than last installments, which still not amazing, they are at least kind of humorous.Overall a really fun story, great characters, the general gameplay is improved over its predecessors and the new ship gameplay is amazing. So fun to spend endless hours at sea with my crew singing and pirating.HOWEVER!I praise the game itself, but I will not recommend you purchase the PC version of it. It is a horribly optimized pain in the butt. I am never one to point out FPS honestly, but this game drops FPS so dramatically it hurt my eyes. I found several people finding round about ways to kind of fix the issue, but ultimately the game still hurt my eyes. The fixes made it more stable, but didnt actually address the problem fully. To me at least, it just isnt playable. I also find it unacceptable that people have to go AROUND the game to fix it themselves instead of the game being properly optimized in the first place.If you wanna experience the game in a well made way I sadly recommend you purchase the PS4 or Xbox One versions of it if possible otherwise you might have to just pass on this one.
