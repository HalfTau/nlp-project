The best Spiritual Successor to Sid Miers Pirates!Not a bad Assassins Creed game either. The series tends to seem like its dragging on and on now, I lost most interest after they realized people liked Ezio and decided he needed 3 games. But this one isnt bad. And Edward isnt NEARLY as annoying as Connor. But seriously, the best bits of this are the shipbased bits. Also, as a side note, this game officially has the BEST realtime water simulation of any game I have ever played.
