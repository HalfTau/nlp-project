This review will be SPOILER FREE.You need UPLAY to play this game, which is not a big deal, you just have to create an account if you dont have one, and achievement and friends will pass through that account and not steam.This was my first encounter with the saga, so i cant compare it with previous entries.In this game you impersonate Edward Kenway, a man whos a pirate, but what he most want is the freedom, not the money, not the power, but the freedom to be what he wants to be.I found the gameplay pretty charming. You can travel with your ship all along the maps, which is located in the Caribbean, and you can explore everything, from the desert islands to the big cities. Exploration outside the story, is not just a pleasure, but is rewarded in many ways, including money in the treasury chests, and above all projects to improve your ship the Jackdaw. The fights in the sea are, in my opinion, one of the better parts of the game. You can choose to completely destroy the opponent ships, which  will give you half of their transported goods, or you can board the opponent ships, and fight is crew with swords and guns, getting the full loot. The combat on foot is not complex, but highly spectacular. You can even choose and you have to many times the stealth aprroach.The story is really good and will need many hours to complete. You will find many hystorical figures, even the great Blackbeard, and each of them has his own aims and ambitions. Arguably the best charachter is the protagonist himself.I didnt test enough the multiplayer part of the game, but it seems well done.Finally, i would reccomend this game, especially if you would like to explore a beautiful location with your ship, and like the pirate setting.
