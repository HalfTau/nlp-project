I could play this game for hours, and I have. The sailing and pirate lifestyle was such a fresh take on the series. The islands and backdrops are so beautiful and crisp. However, the repeative AC branding, mechanics and core are still heavily there. The game does a better job of balancing the repetitiveness of the tasking and collecting but at the end of the day its still the same follow, tail, cover, hide, kill missions. Be ready for some ocean water bugs and some high seas.
