Epic Masterpiece!its kinda like far cry 3 except youre a pirate.its also not like the other assassins creed games that came before it, its way better.10/10TIP! If you want to gett rid of the 30 fps and and lag, just ctrlaltdelete out of the game and then alttab at your desktop back into the game and it will run at a super smooth 60 fps!
