First time i bought this game, cant play it, the game just crash at the main menu for no reason.After 2 months i try to reinstall it again and poop.... Magic D I can play it now.I play near 50 hours and get a 95 syncronization in the singleplayer, 0 minutes at multiplayer, i think isXDBut yeah, after those hours i ing love it.The graphics are really good i think, good performance, y have 5060 fps all the time.Good history and they made the ship things insane, really funny, little bit hard at the first but then is too easy to defeat any ship, the collectables are reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally boring, i play a lot of time to get those  animus fragments XDI reccomend the purchase if the game is on sale, because the prices of the triple a games are always really expensive.
