Got this for 7.50 on the summer sale. I was skeptical of this game when it came out due to how much I disliked AC3, specifically how the running and climbing had been consolidated to one button. It is the same in Black Flag. I really enjoy the sailing and ship combat, but wow coming from playing games like MGSV, The Witcher 3 and Dark Souls 3 everything on foot feels terrible. Those are all much newer games but I still enjoy the movement of AC2, Brotherhood and Revelations.I just cant get over how bad everything on foot is. If Im trying to chase a target I get stuck climbing every object on the left or right of the path. If Im trying to climb the mast of a ship to cut down a flag I will either jump off to my death or get stuck running back and forth on the crossbeam of the main mast.Stealth is hit or miss, enemies can see me from very far away but take five or more seconds to actually react. Enemies also seem to be deaf considering I can sprint up behind them without them hearing me. The combat feels like a step down from AC3, there is a counter much like in AC3, but no double counter. There is also a guard break that is required to beat some enemies.I really wanted to like this game, the story and characters are much better then AC3, the present day/animus stuff is minimal and sailing around is a lot of fun, but everytime I desyncronize from Ed It feels more like a fault of the controls and movement mechanics and not because I made a mistake. In contrast to that when the Jackdaw is destroyed I do feel like it was my fault and I can learn from my sailing mistakes.I am playing the game on an MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X at 3840x2160 and get 40 to 60fps, but when I start the game it locks at 30 and I have to alttab out then alttab back in to remove the lock. This game has so much potential but its downfall is in little details that have a much bigger impact on gameplay that one would expect.
