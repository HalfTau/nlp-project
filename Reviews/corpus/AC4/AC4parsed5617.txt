Ok so after having the same issue that a lot of people seem to be having and most of the reviews not really having anything useful to say, heres what to do ifyou have all that DLC and its not showing up in game Go into Uplay, click unlock a product, and enter the season pass/DLC/whatever CD key in the dialogue box that opens up. Open up you game and BAM its death vessel time. Enjoy
