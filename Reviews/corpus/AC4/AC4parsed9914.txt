This is the most enjoyable piratethemed video game I have ever played. Id also go out on a limb and say its the best entry in this series so far  definitely a HUGE improvement from ACIII. Any issues Ive had with this game fall on deaf ears the second I start to sail across the sea, swing onto enemy ships, and start a huge sword fight. This game is the total package.
