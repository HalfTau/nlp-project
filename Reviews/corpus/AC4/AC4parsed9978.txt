This game might be the best of the franchise. It combines the elements of Assassins Creed 3s ship battles and the classic Assassin mechanics. The RPG elements of the ship are good since you have to go attack other ships in order to find your required materials.There is a lot of content in this game, missions, assassin contracts and a lot of collectibles scattered throughout cities and uncharted locations such as islands or jungles.The true pirate experience, and maybe this isnt too true to the assassins creed series, but who gives a bottle of rum? Its awesome.If you wait for a sale to come up for this game get it immediately, if not, get it anyway.10/10
