An Assassins Creed game where you are a pirate. Do I need to say anything else? Probably the best pirate game ever. 15 hours and only 25, this game is massive. You can play it the Assassin way, use your hidden blades and hide in bushes, or the savage, pirate way, using your swords as your main weapon, attacking without thinking.Pros Massive world 50 major locations with over 70 minor locations and islands to explore Great story and TONS of sideactivities will keep you busy for at least 50 hours, and if you want to explore everything, it would take you at least twice that time Freedom Cry DLC, where you play as Adewhale youll meet him in the main game, no spoilers, around 510 more hours of gameplay Amazing graphics  Even today the graphics are amazing Hidden locations You can take over templar bases Abstergo missions and sideactivitiesCons Really poor optimization, at least GTX 950/960 recommended Glitches  there are only a few of them and none of them are game breaking, but in really adrenalinepumping missions, killing a templar and watching them fly across the sky kinda ruins the atmosphere Grinding  you have to constantly grind and upgrade your ship if you want to complete the game which, in my opinion, can get really annoying when you travel 30km just to realize that you have to upgrade your ship and dont have enough money to do it Somewhat repetitive  Tail, Eavesdrop, Kill, RepeatThats all I have to say about this game. Dont worry about the cons too much because I can guarantee that you will enjoy the game if you like Assassins Creed and open world games.
