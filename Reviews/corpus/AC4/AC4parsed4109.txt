I consider myself a casual fan of the AC series Ive played most of the games but I could care less about the weird lore. Black Flag is easily my favorite AC title because not only is it a solid AC game but its also the best pirate game Ive ever played. Heres to hoping Ubisoft releases a Black Flag 2.
