It shakes things up by trying new stuff, which is needed in a series inundated with a new game every year. The ship stuff is all topnotch, and it bridges the last AC trilogy quite well into what will most likely be The Kenway Trilogy. The real world parts are neat and they progress the main story along nicely, with many hints at AC4.5 or AC5.Best cast of the entire series. I felt like it was a High Seas Breakfast Club.Blackbeard was totally Bender.
