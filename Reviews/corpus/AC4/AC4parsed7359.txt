This is a real stand out in the series. It takes on a very liked piece of time and does a excellent job with it. There is plenty of collectibles for you to find, tons of areas to explore and a vast amount of weaponry. You can buy or craft your way in progression. Your ship which is the most valueable thing has a massive amount of upgrades and decorations. The story is great. This game deserves a try even if you dont like the series. This game deserves a 10/10.Shiver me timbers.
