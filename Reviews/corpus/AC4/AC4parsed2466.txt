Oddly enough the best Assassins Creed game is the best because it tried harder to be Pirate Simulator 2013 than an Assassins Creed game. Are you a person weary of yearly AC releases and instead wanna play a jaunty pirate adventure where you chuckle about with Blackbeard? This is possibly the best you got.I dont think I need to explain anything more.
