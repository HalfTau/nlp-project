If you like the Assassins Creed mechanics, youd love it.Also, if you like Pirates, this is probably the best pirates game you can find.The Caribbean map is huge, you have plenty of stuff to do, from assaulting forts to harpoon different fish and mammals to explore underwater wrecks, plus exploring islands, and the most important of it, naval battles, with cannons and boardings, all very well done and very fun to play it.As most of the Assassins Creed games, it may get a bit repetitive at the end, but it is still worth it.The main story is not bad, has some good missions and keep you entertain, which is the ultimate point.
