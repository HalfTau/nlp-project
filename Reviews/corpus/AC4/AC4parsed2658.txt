Dont get me wrong here I HATE UPLAY and i Hate UBISOFT but this is in my openion the last good assassins creed game... AC2 was best but hey this one was really fun and i did enjoy it so it was good for me.UPLAY LAUNCHER MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY THIS GAME BECAUSE OF DUMB DELTA ERRORS AND UPLAY NEEDS TO UPDATE SHT. RECOMENDED FOR CONSOLES FOR SURE AS MOST OF THESE PROBLEMS DONT EXIST BUT HEY IF ALL YOU AFTER IS FLASHY WAVES AND NARWALES THEN HAVE AT THE PC VERSION 8/10 GAME EITHER WAY
