A strong comeback to the prequel Assassins Creed III.  While combat remains somewhat static and predictable, the storyline is rich enough and filled with entertaining cutscenes that youll find yourself powering towards your next storyline mission to find out what happens next.  The mystery of Templars and Assassins grows deeper as the game progresses.  At the end, youll feel satisfied, yet still yearning for more.  Not so much more gameplay in this game, but more games to explore other time periods, dynasties, and family trees.8/10  Would definitely recommend.
