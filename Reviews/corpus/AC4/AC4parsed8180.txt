15 hour reviewThe positiveSo to start 15 hours in and this game is hands down amazing.There seems to be so much to do, and plenty of time to do it.I like how the creators made the collectables not insane to gatheras they have in the older versions of the game.The negitiveI have encountered many game breaking bugs thus far, but I believethat they are only on my system setup.  Some of them include a bug whereeverything suddenly turns to triangles and the game is totally unplayable.Another bug is when the games map turns into a kaleidoscope and I amunable to play  the game. Other than those the game seems pretty stable.As for the gameplay, Im not a big fan of the way the camera gets in theway of the combat, but that is merely a minor problem.Overall I cant recommend this game enough
