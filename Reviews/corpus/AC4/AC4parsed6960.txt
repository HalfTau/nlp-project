I Love AC4BF cuz i love that u Arrr a pirate and i love sailing the ships but the fighting is to easy u can go into the fort in havana and just kill everyone with ur fist cuz the combat is to ez just press e when there attacking then mouse click and then there dead thats the only bad thing about ac series the combat sucks if anyone thinks the combat is hard then go try dark souls pl0x but everything else is great the story is awesome most people saying all AC are just reskins basically of the last ones they are but i dont play ac for the combat or the new gameplay i play em cuz i love the story this is the first ac i got on pc and im glad i did its really fun playing i love robbing plantations with the stealth outfit cuz u can basically just walk up to the places as its pretty hard to get spotted with that outfit anyways its a good game with a great story
