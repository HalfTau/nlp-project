A fun game that is shrouded by a bad story andpoor pc optimization with PhysX this feature was added in after months of the games release only for the devs to NEVER actually patch the game again just another lazy ac pc game from ubisoftaside from the lazy dev support which is normal for this team it is a fun game just turn physX off sadly and it will run like a charm mostly or just buy it on console for a better experience
