First, imagine Assassins Creed 3s engine and all of its available mechanics or gameplay tools, including naval missions. Then take a step back into the feel of Assassins Creed 2, where notoriety was much less annoying and easier to step around  and your enemies were all bumbling idiots that were frankly just as easily killed as escaped. Bam, you have Black Flag  a rich 80 hour adventure with loot, plundering, and pirate booty from sinking every boat you encounter on the wideopen sea. I didnt bother to pick up most of the uncharted collectables, but 100ing every named location was boss  and if youre done with all that and want more, Freedom Cry will keep you going. A great deal in a sale nowadays, and the best throwback to classic Assassins Creed.
