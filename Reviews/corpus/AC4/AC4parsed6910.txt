Ive played the AC games since the first one appeared on XBox and I must say, this is probably the best Animus endings in the whole series. It actually gives you closure to this mans life. I gave up on events outside the Animus because its obvious that UbiSoft wont get anywhere with the main story anytime soon. So I try to enjoy the ride whenever a good one comes along. I had so much fun with this game that this is the only game I put in the effort to finish all the side stuff. I do agree with what someone else posted before, that it shouldnt be called Assassins Creed. It was just a really really really good pirate game. After I beat it I felt so damn tired but the effort you put into doing the side activities was well worth it. The templar outfit to be more resistant to attacks, the Mayan outfit to repel all bullets, and a fully upgraded boat to take on all the legendary ships these were well worth the time and sleep I lost fully completely this game. Well done Ubisoft for making a pirate game enjoyable. Probably should have named it Pirates of Nightmare instead of Assassins Creed though. Just like the trailer in the game lelz.
