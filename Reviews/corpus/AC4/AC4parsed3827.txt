It is common knowledge that after Revelations, the franchise sort of went down hill. However, Black Flag may be the exception as it offers a completely unique perspective of pirating. This game is absolutely amazing, sailing the crystal clear waters of the Carribean and plundering English and Spanish ships. Upgrade the Jackdaw to take down bigger ships with better loot. I must admit though, I purely enjoy this game for the gameplay. As a seperate game from the Assassins Creed franchise I might have rated it higher, but as it is an AC game I must admit, in terms of story it was judt lacking compared to the Ezio/altair story and there is far more emphasis on pirating around than being an assassin saving the world. As I said though, the gameplay is great and you are guaranteed to have a lot of fun and a lot of retrys on the Legendary ships.I would recommend this game but not for those who want the story and architectural richness of other assassins creed games but as a pirates of the Carribean type game.7/10
