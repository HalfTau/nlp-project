 Bought game Chase guy through jungle Try to find way to zoom the camera out There isnt one Climb vines, forced to focus on close up Get to first port, game crashes. Google the problem, lots of people have it. Try EVERY SINGLE FIX. New drivers, new install, new nvidia experience booster, new files, renames, moved, added, taken away, manipulate EVERYTHING that all the solutions tell me to. Relaunch game, crashes at the same part, while walking through the first town.Requested refund. Im sure this game is fun if you can actually play it.
