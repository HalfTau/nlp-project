Extremely solid game! Story is a bit repetitive though, many follow and eavesdrop missions which arent fun and very tedious. This may sound like a major complaint saying the story is boring. Well youre wrong, im usually one to complete the whole story before attempting any side missions but i cant help myself do all the side missions, they are so amazingly fun. Also if you didnt like the ship combat in AC3 it is so much better and went from by far my least favourite part of 3 to my favourite part of the game. The ship combat is so fun that i did it a bit too quickly compared to the storyline that i became extremely OP on the sea, but hey i didnt mind!BUY BUY BUY this game! You wont regret it, also its a huge game!
