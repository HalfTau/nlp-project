So I know that the Assassins Creed series get some serious hate, especially for the last 2 or so. But this one gave me the most fun since AC II. So much in fact that I decided to put over 50 hours in to 100 the damn thing. Which took some serious grinding but I honestly felt satisfied with the end result. Combine that with great graphics, music, and voice acting and you got yourself a hell of a game.
