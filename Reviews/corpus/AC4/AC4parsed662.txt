Im 5050 on this one, as am I on most Assassins Creed titles. Its a good game, lots of content, and the story is wonderful. But if you want more than that, I would do some serious thinking.The game gets a bit grindy, and is shallow in some mechanics. The ship is easy to max out, and ship combat is not customizable at all.The story, however, is amazing. As with every Assassins Creed game weve seen in the past, the focus is the story and its beautiful. Not going to spoil anything, but there are some WONDERFUL storylines in this one, my personal favourite being Blackbeards. If you like Assassins Creed storylines, then its a good buy.Finally, the multiplayer. The provided multiplayer is the only AC has been working with for a while, and its... well, its not AC at all and it isnt my style.There is the Fleet which has multiplayer but its just a minigame it generate money, it isnt really fun. You can help your friends speed up their moneyfarming minigame. I enjoy the minigame, but it gets old after a while, and it isnt something you can constantly do. Its not something you should consider when buying the game.Oh, and theres social chests and White Whales You can share the spawn coordinates, cant fight it with friends or anything Thats neat. Not a big thing though.All in all, Id give this one a go. Its worth it.Give it a go if you like Assassins Creed.
