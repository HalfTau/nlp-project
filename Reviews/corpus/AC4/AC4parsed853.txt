One of the best games that truly captures the thought of being a pirate, as it basically play out as a pirate simulator with the classic contracts. Feels vey good to sail for new islands, and do raids. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Pirates of The Carribean, and all Assassians Creed fans.
