This game is by far the best assasins creed game ive ever played, because of the piaraty theme and the way you own your own boat that you sink other ships with, a boat that can travel anywhere in the huge open world map. It just gave me the piraty feel, and because I like to see my ship evolve and become a big beast, this game may just be the 4th best game ive played whole of 2015. The multiplayer in this game is not much, but I think wolfpack is quite fun. I know their is rogue where you have your own ship an upgrade it, but this in my opinion was just so much better. You may think that this game involves nothing assasin creed original content before youve played it. Another fun thing in this game that you can do is hunt, not only for creatures on land, but for aqatic animals as well as animals on land, in the water you can hunt a large variety of different speices of shark and whale in your rowboat with an harpoon. Amazing game.NOTE As all games it has some glitches and other technical issues, and like this game and a few other assasins creed games things vibrate, ALOT. And there are many cool facts about other assasin creed game you get acces to by hacking things outside the animus.10/10
