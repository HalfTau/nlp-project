This game is awesome, but IDK what happen as I launch the game. But it says that It cant find the Ubisoft Launcher!! Does it mean to go to theor something or you have to purchase this ubisoft launcher, or I should reinstall this game. Can someone tell me please!! I do recommend this game! It has a nice gameplay storyline and I do like this Assassins Creed series, but please someone tell me  what I should do with it!! I really want to play this game!
