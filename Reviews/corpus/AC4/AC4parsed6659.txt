Embraced what AC3 did with the ship, Black Flag has good characters despite a mellow protagonist, a fun openworld structure, and a side mission progression that feels less like checking things off a shopping list and more like slowly taking over the ocean. Modern day story line is shoehorned and feels irrelevant, but otherwise an extremely awesome experience to get lost in.
