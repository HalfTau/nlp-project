Awesome game. Best pirate game I have ever played. Sid Meier did a good shot at it, but this is pure awesome.Great gameplay and story. Open world where you can explore, fight other ships, raid plantations, capture forts, assassainate Templars, and just have a great time.Definitly the best AC game since 1 and 2.
