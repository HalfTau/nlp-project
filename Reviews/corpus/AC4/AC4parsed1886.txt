I absolutely love this game, yes Unity has better controls, but the content... THE CONTENT. Missions are loads of fun, and even after the storyline is complete, there are still so many side missions to do. On top of all this, it is just a beautiful game. It is definetly worth its price, but it often goes on sale, so if you are a cheapskate like me, just keep an eye out for sales.Id give it a solid 10/10.
