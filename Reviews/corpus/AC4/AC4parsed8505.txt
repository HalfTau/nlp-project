Assasins Creed flag. Another installment of the assasins creed franchies and what do i think ? One of the best yet !. I have to admit i didnt like it at first, it got of to a slow start. But as the game goes on in ties you in to the point were i couldnt come of it !. The ending like all assasins creed is superb and it left me pouring out of what could become of this franchies. A Heartwarming installment to an amazing franchies i hope they will produce the same in the next few games ! DEATH TO THE TEMPLARS !
