Over all this was a great game to play. I wasnt too sure about the first person camera when you first started out, but later I felt it really helped draw me into the storyline outside of the Animus. I loved the ability to explore the seas and islands, and taking down ships along the way was fun too. Im already going back and replaying the entire game again I enjoyed it so much.
