Assassins Creed IV Black Flag continues the overarching Assassins vs Templars story by placing you in the early 1700s in the Age of Pirates, taking the role of Edward Kenway, a fortuneseeking pirate.Storywise, this is the first game without Desmond Miles, where you play as a nonspeaking Abstergo Entertainment employee, exploring memories to create a new feature video game. Like other AC games, these modernday segments dont really accomplish much, as Edwards story is much more interesting, dealing with the consequences of his lust for riches.Visually, this game is very impressive. Character design is great, locations are styled well, and no visual bugs were noticed. Smooth performace all around.Gameplay is the greatest strength in this game, letting the player basically do whatever he/she wants to do. Find treasure? Pull out those maps and get hunting. Explore the Carribbean? Planty of explorable and unique locations. Blow up everything in sight? Blast away with a fully upgradeable ship. The gameplay mechanics are slightly improved from AC III, including better sailing, freeaim, and combat.The only real negative here is the overall story. You spend an extended amount of time not playing as an Assassin, which is strange given the title, Assassins Creed, but does well in exploring the ideology of both the Assassins and the Templars from a thirdperson perspective.
