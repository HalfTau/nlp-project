Great fun. One of the best, if not THE best, pirate themed games of all time. A big downside is that you are pulled out from this wonderful world of pirates regularly to be..... an office clerk in a modern office building...doing crappy hacking minigames and listening to endless boring and totally irrelevant dialogues. And that is horribly boring. You just want to get back out on the high seas and try to forget the wet blanket that is the boring office building. That problem with thecreed games aside killing the mood with these interruptions, this game is great. As long as you get to be a pirate!
