While i am a fan of previous titles os Assassins Creed I can say I was plesantly surprised by this game. While most of the games have you hunting down Templars as the main story line Assassins Creed 4 tends to put them to the back of the story and seems to focus on the priate side of Edwards character. It seems weird to be fighting the british navy to plunder ships then for one or two missions remember that the Templars are out to get you and focus on them for a mission. I feel that the story drops  away in that regard and is a sad sign seeing as Assassins Creed 3 had a more linear story.With that being said the gameplay is amazing. While sailing a ship just seemed to be something tacked on the end of Assassins Creed 3, any problems I had with it have been fixed and improved in Assassins Creed 4. Sailing into a storm over large waves and firing at multiple ships then swinging on board to mop up any survivors. The controls seemed a bit buggy for me sometimes and I found my self constantly snapping to a corner or running up a wall instead of around it but with a decent combat system, great music and an imersive world the pros of this game greatly outway the cons. A must buy for any Assassins Creed fan.
