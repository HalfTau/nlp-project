Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is a mix of Assassins Creed II and III on Steroids. I have played Assassins Creed II and the story was amazing and so was the combat but here its amazingly expanded upon. Adding your own crew and ship to sail is what makes Aassassins Creed IV huge! The Sandbox style to this is something special, as a AC fan I think it brings a new taste and adventure to the table.Edward has many new tricks up his sleeve, you are taken on an amazing quest of adventure in the Caribbean, the year is 1715. You will encounter many Spanish and English along the way as you explore the Caribbean. Secrets and ruins of the Mayans. The combat is fluid and a real enjoy to watch as you take part in it. This game is a must own. If you are new then it does not hurt to try or if you are a veteran then you will look forward to this!
