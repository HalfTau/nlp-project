This game is good, it is easily my favourite in the franchise. Thats really all I have to say. pick it up on sale for nothing and play it, I guarantee youll enjoy it more than than the majority of the garbage ubisoft comes out with. The ship combat and sailing is incredible. The environments are stunning. The combat is satisfying. The story is good if a little convoluted at times. its just a great game.
