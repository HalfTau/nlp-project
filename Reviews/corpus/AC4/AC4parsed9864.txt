Assassins Creed Franchise can never stop suprising us, from the time I started the game I was so shocked of the gameplay lt really changed the look of the franchise. Always Ubisoft will never disappoint us. The gameplay really fulfiled my expectaion of joy. Multiplayer has really changed from shooting a weapon to new skills, The new man hunt is amazing from my point of view. and LOVING this new setting the caribbeans, really amazed me.Last thing I want to say is that Ubisoft I am a fan of your work.Steam Consumers I really recommend this game, no matter what.
