Used to work before it was updated, now crashes before the first unskippable branding/logo video plays. Ubisoft claims it must be a hardware problem. All other games work fine. Many people are having the same issue. The multiplayer version of this game works fine  but apparently thats not significant it must, Ubisoft insists, be a hardware problem.... and thats the last Ubisoft game Im ever buying on PC.
