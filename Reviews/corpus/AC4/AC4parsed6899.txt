ACIV is a excellent game with alot of polish.Oddly enough I consider this game to have the best Naval combat of any game I have ever played just because of how ALIVE and REALISTIC they feel at least in my mind.Often well playing the game I found myself saying Arr Matey and Yo ho ho to my wife as this open world game is so inviting and I consider it to be one of the best game I play in 2014.As far the the usual AC gameplay it is exactly as expected, with the annual 10 polish increase....The Naval part of the gameplay is what makes this worth buying full price but with the upcoming release of AC5 that may change.Huge world to explore. Dramatically larger then any previous AC game, and not with too much cut and paste material.Never beat the game but got quite close, the Story is alot better then previous in the series as in all of them. In the end once I explored most the world I put the controller done as I had my fill.Recommend this game to fans of the series or fans of pirates.
