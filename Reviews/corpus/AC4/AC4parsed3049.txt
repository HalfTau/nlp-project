Already got near 100 compleation on the PS4 version, had enough money lying around in my steam wallet and decided I wanted to replay it on PC. Totally worth the money. Seriously this is in my opinion one of the best AC games out there. The story line is long, but not repetative at all. And the game itself is beautiful. The ONLY issue I ran into is performance. My rig is more than capable of running this game on highest settings, but for some reason VSync messes things up. With it off there is no noticable tearing and the game runs smooth. Totally recommend.
