 Played Campaign.  9/10  Played Multiplayer.  Ubisoft/10 Why? Because for me I never got to play the Multiplayer because it keeps crashing, I looked online to figure out why it kept crashing, using the search words Why cant I play Multiplayer in AC4 on PC Absolutely no Results, Well for PC Multiplayer crashes there were. I read some Forums about other people experience with AC4 MP on Console, Seems like they have issues too. 0/10 MULTIPLAYER DOESNT WORK.
