In my opinion, this is by far the best Assassins Creed game to date. Yes, the first two Ezio games were great, but this game is entirely different the openworld is incredibly expansive but not so much so you get overwhelmed, and the diversity of gameplay options is phenomenal. The multitude of ways to deal with situations and enemies is quite refreshing from the monotony of AC3, as there are dozens or more ways to kill an enemy or get to your objective. A HUGE aspect to the game is the muchimproved open sea gameplay and combat. It is quite easy to get caught up in and distracted by upgrading your ship, plundering resources from ships, taking down the legendaries, capturing all the garrisons, etc. This game is the breath of fresh air the franchise needed after the farfromstellar previous game. I would even venture to say that this didnt really feel like an Assassins Creed game at all! It just felt like an awesome pirate game that was kind of similar to Assassins Creed except for a few plot points here and there. It would still be just as wonderful of a game if there werent any futurey Abstergo or Animus or Minerva/Juno or whoever those women are elements in it and it was completely its own standalone pirate game! A high quality game that has my recommendation!
