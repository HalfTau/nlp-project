This game is alright. It places a lot of stress on boat exploration. Which is good considering it is the best part of this game. However, running across the rooftops of Rome or Venice is more fun than riding a boat. Naval battles are where your computer will be put to the test. If you have anything lower than the recommended equipment, youd might as well buy Revalations.BoatsNaval battles provide hours of entertainment. There is nothing more fun in an AC game to date. Riding around in the Jackdaw will keep you hooked on this game for a long time. If you like the running across rooftops of older games, however, this game wont suit your fancy. Like Assassins Creed 3, there are very few giant cities for Edward to run around. But honestly, the boats alone are great enough to merit a purchase.GameplayTheres still no sneak machanic, however, this game doesnt need one. You spend so little time assassinating people that a sneak feature wouldnt really help you. Instead, you get tailing missions Yeaaaaaah. I never really noticed how many tailing missions you could fit into a game. Now I know enough to make the story not worth following.StoryEhh... I didnt finish the story, it isnt really that interesting. For me, the game ended when my ship was as overpowered as I felt like making it. Edward is a fine main character, I guess, but Ezio is still better. Heck, you could even argue that Connor is a better main character. Edward is the first assassin in the series whose goals involve money, rather than furthering the assassins and providing order. Which is fine, but that makes him really unrelatable. Overall, the story and main character are both a hitormiss.There are other features to this game, but if youre buying this game for those, youre wasting your money. I give this game an 7.5/10. Its fun, but the tailing missions and lack of things to do and climb on solid ground are dissapointing.
