Yar! So I heard you would like to become a pirate? Well look no further, because this game is a FANTASTIC pirate game! Coming from someone that has never played an AC game, I thought this game was incredible. I, however got frustrated at some of the stealth missions during the game, however I think that comes down to my lack of knowledge of the game mechanics for the AC stealth, so I wouldnt let that destroy my thoughts on the game! The ship fights are fantastic, and you could just go on a constant fight cycle for possibly hours on end, it never ends! So many places to explore, so much booty to loot, and the missions are fantastic, and would highly recommend doing it all if you want to enjoy yourself in this game!Also, the graphics in the game are STUNNING! I cant get over how good just little things looked, like rocks etc, to the vast forests and oceans!The soundtrack in the game is also fantastic. That plus the shanties that you get for your crew to sing is amazing.Overall this is a brilliantly thought out game, and a must have for all players that have either any love for the AC franchise or, like me, just want a good pirate simulator!HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended!
