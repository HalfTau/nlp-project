SPOILER ALERTAssassians creed IV...how do i rate this? firstly i would like to say with 2800 hours on the ps4 version i have expereienced the full game and may i just say the amount of s i have had in this game is too much. i recently brought this game on steam and it is once again my favourite game already. Ive played 10 hours in one sitting so far and have had an absurd amount of fun. Those onion cutting ninjas when blackbeard dies... ive had way too many fun ties with this game for it to not have a special place in my heart would be unlikely of me. This game will definetly go down as one of the greatest releases of all time in my opinion as the sheer vastness of the game is so amazing. Sinking your first legendary ship is one of the best part of the games and the dlcs are just outstanding, i have no negative things to think about this game besides the fact that they tricked us into believing mary read was james kidd which i guess is a part of the story. If i had to recommend anyone of the assassians creed games it would efinetly be black flag as the sheer amount of fun a first time player can have is too good not to be mentioned. everytime i come back to this game i am never dissapointed and reminds me of a time when ubisoft never ceased to fail with game production and i am still wondering how they could go from this glory of a game to the massive cluster that was unity. Overall i would give this game a 10/10 and definetly reccommend this to a person new to the ac saga.
