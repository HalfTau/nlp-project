This game has too many problems to recommend. Uplay  be advised that the launcher which comes with the Steam version doesnt work at all, it wont connect. Ubisoft is too lazy or incompetent to patch this, so you have to download standalone Uplay from their website and run that to get the game registered to your account. After that you can play. This isnt clearly documented, so players could easily get stuck there. Audio  in some cutscenes, the audio doesnt work and you completely lose track of the plot. Completely immersion shattering. Controls  They are just terrible. Your character does the opposite of what you desire most of the time and chasing someone is an utter chore, rather than a freerunning joy as it SHOULD be. So many other games get this right, its ridiculous that Ubisoft still havent cracked this one.Never mind stealthswimming. Keep Circle pressed and press X to assassinate at the same time. With what kind of alien hand would you accomplish this?? Stealth  What stealth? There are no real stealth mechanics, and sneaking involves finding bushes or haystacks. Its not very immersive and half the time its utter frustration as the camera doesnt move in the angles you require. Camera  Ocassionally infuriating, completely hiding the combat action and making it virtually impossible to dodge at times. Combat  Boring and uninspiring when compared to the Warner Bross games. It feels clunky and dated, and the controls are often not very intuitive.Long story short, I really wanted to like this game as the setting is awesome and exactly what I was in the mood for. But its completely let down by Ubisofts uninspired gameplay and outofanimus sequences which completely shatter any immersion you may have had. Ive spend 5 hours frustrated for 1 hour of fun. And that these days, just isnt good enough.
