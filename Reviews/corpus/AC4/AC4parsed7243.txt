Great game! Best in the series thus far. HOWEVER, this is a ubisoft title and as such, the PC port WILL be clunky and buggy for a lot of players. I for one have to underclock my GTX 770 card just to keep the game from crashing. Just keep in mind you may have to deal with a few headaches if you buy this on Steam. If you get it working perfectly then it is in fact a perfect game!
