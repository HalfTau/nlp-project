it made my day as a game reviewer, the entire game is fun and more or less it need to bug fix sameless to unity and blackflag issue run to wall and stuck at wall and when chase sence it hard to chase so if possible you guys need a gaming keyboard it just fun to explore but you sure need some good keyboard to finsh the gamemy rating  8.4/10and p.s i had bought it on sale
