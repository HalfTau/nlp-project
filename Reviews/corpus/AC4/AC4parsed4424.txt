SIKE you thought boyeeee, yeah it still doesnt work, funny thing is though is i started up MP.exe and it actually loads up! It appears to run smoothly although theres.... no sound.... the struggle to play this game is still real.... Other people have this problem.... and it appears Ubisoft still doesnt give 2  about it. Or Uplay. Although it appears that the average person that buys this game doesnt have these problems so maybe you shouldnt listen to me. But just know its a possiblity that you could be living this ING NIGHTMARE trying to run the game
