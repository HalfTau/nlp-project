Its okay but ...The controls are near impossible to fully operate. Being a 3rd person game its very difficult to actulally aim for anthing. You may think your about to climb up a cliff and then jump backwards because your slightly misaligned. Yo think your attacking one fellow, and end up facing the other way!There is no real saving your progress beside specific points, so when you get to the near impossible parts you simply replay again, and agian, and again and again. That get tiring!Its a real pity they dont allow a 1st person perspective!The other problems with control is, they dont allow sneeking as such and so many time you can run for cover and be slightly off, but end u simply standing there for the world to see.The missions get a little monotonous, and the ship sailing and associated events seem like an after thought.On the plus side the graphics and general running is good. Storyline is okay and plenty of side quests. even though they do become a little monotonous.Personally i think it loses something from the previous games and tries to focus too much on the ship  andpirating aspect that is very ordinary in its implimintation.Overall its an okay game but unfortunately the hype beats the reality, again. I dont regret buying it, and have a bit of fun playing it but I expected better.I recommend it, BUT .........
