Its the best AC game that Ive played so far.Pros Does an excellent job of transforming an assasin game into a pirate game. It goes further than Sid Meyers in terms of what you can do as a pirate. The ship upgrade system was well done, and had good progression. The gameplay at sea is completely new to AC, and done very well. Its not like a minigame thrown together. The map is vast, but not needlessly so. Huge, where everything still feels like it belongs and has a purpose.Cons I didnt like the real world pieces outside of the 18th century that all AC games tend to throw you into. It felt like busy work and the story was not interesting enough to make me want to do any of these things. The underwater exploration parts of the game felt tedious, and unfortunetly all the major ship upgrades require you to do some of these. The least fun part of the game in my opinion. I would have liked to see harder ship battles beyond the highlevel man o war war gallions. The legendary ships were decent, but when you destroy those youre basically the king of the sea, and nothing feels threatening anymore.
