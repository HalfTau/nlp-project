I will describe Assassins Creed IV Black Flag and Uplay as two brothers you used to play with as a kid. AC IV is a fun guy, you and him were often running around, climbing, sailing on your little boats, and yes it was a little repetitive but entertaining non the less. Uplay was his little dumb bother who had some extra chromosomes, alwaysyou off because every time you wanted to play with ACIV, Uplay tagged along for no reason. You stopped playing with them after that one time Uplay borrowed your save games and lost them all with no way to retrieve them. that little  SOB.
