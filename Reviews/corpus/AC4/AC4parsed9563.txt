A fantastic pirate expeirence. One of the best if not THE best AC game to date. You can tell ubi put in the effort on the graphics and animation quality. Some of the animations are a little sketchy, especially during  boardings, but the rest of the game makes up for it. In AC4 you no longer play as Desmond Miles which is a breath of fresh air. Instead you are an abstergo employee building the next great video game experience working for abstergo entertainment. Ubisoft integrated this great story line where ubisoft and abstergo entertainment are teaming up to bring you these assassins creed games. Its a little confusing unless you play the game. I didnt like the way the plot was going at first but after some time with it, it started to grow on me. Multiplayer is the standard fare of deathmatch and wolfpack from the last AC game. I dont see a point in leveling your character because the next AC title will just start you over from lvl 1.
