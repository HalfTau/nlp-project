An absolute pleasure. Outside of the slightly linear and traditional Assassins Creed gameplay there is a great sense of adventure while sailing the seas with your crew, attacking and looting anyone who crosses your path. Multiplayer servers are a complete blunder but the actual gameplay is very similar to that of ACR. Best Open world pirate game I have ever played and probobly ever will play. Well done Ubisoft. 8.5/10
