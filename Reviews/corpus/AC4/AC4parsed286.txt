At first I was a little put off about having to upgrade and battle with a ship but after I got the necessary upgrades and got used to it, it became really fun! This is one of my favorite assassins creed games. I really enoyed the storyline and gameplay. The main characters are very likable. A must play for assassins creed fans!
