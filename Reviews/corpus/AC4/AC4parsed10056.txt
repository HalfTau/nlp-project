Best game of the year. After you beat the story there is just so much to do!ProsGraphics are amazingOpen world so much detailsTOO MUCH STUFF TO DOGreat customizationOnline is also loads of funConsIn general I love AC story plots but this game kinda lacked in it. Long version Youre a privateer turned pirate who gets involved in the Templars VS Assassin conflict and try to make money off it. Short version Sneaking and Stabbing with Ships and Sit. There arer so many tailing missions youll feel forced to finish them. I also felt that there lacked detail in general.EDIT Freedom Cry story is pretty kick Nice way they touched on such a sensative isssue without being called racistsVERDICT 8.5 out of 10 It would be a perfect 10 if the story was a little better but I have to say all the characters were very realistic and at times you felt really into it. Howver, most of the game is like a never cuming organsm pardon the pun. Your waiting, waiting, waiting, and the games over. The open world neverending side quests and activities makes up for that tough .
