I was just listening to the ending song The Parting Glass.. well damn.. despite finishing the game so long ago.. still that feeling.. indescribable.. just wanted to leave that as a note for someone whos still thinking of buying this game.. Well do it but prepare for an emotional rollercoaster.. peace and out..
