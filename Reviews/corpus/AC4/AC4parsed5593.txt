I started playing this game twice. I wanted just a quick refresher since I hadnt gotten far in my first attempt before being pulled away for a few days. I picked back up on my second playthrough getting a couple hours in. Now whenever I try to play the game, my camera glitches all over the place, but only when I move my character. Im not the kind to be affected by motion sickness, and this makes me nauseous. I tried to start a new game, but the problem still persisted. Now Ive completely uninstalled and reinstalled the whole game, and started new yet again, but the problem still persists. What am I supposed to do to fix this. I picked the game up on a Ubisoft sale, so its not like Im out the whole retail price of the game, but I still paid for it, and would like to be able to play it. Has anyone else experienced this bug, and if so, do you have any fixes that have worked. Maybe Im not searching for the correct words, but I cant find anything.
