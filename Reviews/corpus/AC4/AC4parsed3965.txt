This game is real beauty for me,The nature in this game is amazing even the seas and the story is great in my opinion.This game is something different unlike all the other Asasssins Creed games,Theres nothing wrong with the gameplay but there are some bugs here and there but they dont appear often,Buy the game its totally worth it.
