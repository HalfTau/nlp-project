PositivesI loved being a pirate.Epic ship battles.Visually pleasing.Can break up some of the repeativiness with doing other tasks.Upgrading stuff.NegativesUplay.It crashed a few timesI spawned in the sky a few times and fell to my death.Running around I got stuck in the slightest gaps.Game took about 50 hours to complete the story, side objectives and collecting/upgrading everything.Most of the islands with the single treasure chest were the same.The frogger hacking game was just annoying.There is very little point of leaving the simulation, just a bunch of nods to the previous gamesAll and all I enjoyed being a pirate so much for once I was willing to look over the many flaws.I am ticking the recommending this game but I can see the problems if someone wasnt that into being a pirate
