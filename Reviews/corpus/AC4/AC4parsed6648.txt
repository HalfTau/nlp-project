A new and interesting setting as well as a great naval battle system make this game an exceptional derivation from the Assassins Creed Franchise. Sure, the land combat system is simple and boring, and gameplay in general on the islands consists of the same elements as its predecessors, but the nice looking large open world and entertaining writing could make up for it.If you liked previous Assassins Creed games, you will probably enjoy this game as well.If youre interested in the setting, you may enjoy this if you have no greater problem with Assassins Creed.If you neither like pirates nor Assassins Creed, I honestly could not think of a reason for you to even read this.
