assassins creed 4 black flag is in my opinion the best assassins creed since the second game and delivers on almost all the promises that ubisoft made but can fall short in certain aspects such as with so many things to clime i have had trouble with enclosed spaces and running up walls in the middle of a fight the story isnt really inspiring though the future day moments are somewhat interesting even if they break the flow and spoiler once they kill off most of the interesting characters like black beard the story falters and becomes dull and i wish you could get more weapon variety and things become too easy when you get the blow pipe and can disable a guard within seconds and while it is an open world most of the islands look much bigger than what you can actually access and missions are too structured and to point a to point b the game is beutiful and runs well on a variety of systems but nvidia will offer the highest quality models and textures are beutiful but faces are stilted and arent believable to me all in all assassins creed 4 is just fun and thats a good thing with a wide variety of options but a weak main story 8.5 out of 10
