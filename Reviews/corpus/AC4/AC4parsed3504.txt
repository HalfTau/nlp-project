AC4 Black Flag has been referred to as the Pirates of the Caribbean game Disney failed to make.I would agree with this. Ive played the previous entries in the series and honestly never got into them. This one I gave a try simply because it had pirates, and that has ended up being my favorite part of the game. Ship battles, sword fights, the game within a game management of Kenways fleet from my tablet no less and even just sailing and exploring so I can listen to the crew sing the shanties that Ive painstakingly collected from around the map.The story is well told, the characters are interesting, and except for the ever present Assassins Creed staples of the character jumping instead of ledge grabbing or grabbing the wrong ledge, resulting in my fourth failed attempt at sneaking in, so now everybody has to die, its a solid title.
