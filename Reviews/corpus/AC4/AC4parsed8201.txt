Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag is a remarkable piece of work and represents something of a return to form for the series. Its sure to delight fans and it should prompt anyone who was put off by Connor Kenway to give the series another try. Its the best entry in this series for the last three years and easily one of 2013s essential titles  on whichever gaming platform you own.
