Ive played Assassins Creed since the first one came out.  I absolutely loved Assassins Creed 2 and never thought any future games in the series could beat it.  Assassins Creed 4 is, without a doubt, my new personal favorite.  Its beautiful, immersive, well written, and most importantly, super fun.  I would recommend this game over all the others.
