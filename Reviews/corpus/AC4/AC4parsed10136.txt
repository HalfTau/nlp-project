Great game. Amazing graphics, a huge open world, best assassins creed, a pirate twist, and theres tons of exploring and tressure to do aswell, not just story quests and killing things. Another huge feature is also the ship combat, there are dozens of upgrades, you can go hunting, exploring, crafting, get upgrades for your character, buy new weapons, and battle against the sea. The game also features dangerous storms with tornadoes, lightning, and rogue waves. The controls are easy to understand and easy to do. Combat is extremely fluent and very good. There is tons more of the game than I mentioned. I would give this game a 9/10. The story and plot is also great. Cons May have FPS issues on some PCs due to it being a console port, I believe there might be a patch though, and it may get a tiny bit repetitive, but the amount of content and activities being Repetitive. wont be found too often. There are so many ways to earn money in this game as well, I recommend running around cities and pickpocketing, its slow but most proficient and safest way. Anyway, check out the trailer and screenshots. I would also like to thank WorldEater/Ravenss/Insidris/Mad Larkin He always has different usernames for buying me this game, thanks buddy!   My recommendation, thumbs up. I greatly recommend this game, and its worth your money. Oh yea, and the world is huge, there are dozens of islands there are quite a few small ones but there are about 20 big ones and probaly a dozen huge ones. Every part of this game is detailed.
