Assassins Creed Black Flag is my favourite game in the series, but the gameplay typical for this series is in my opinion the least enjoyable part of the game.The game has great graphics, beautiful locations and a map that feels huge. The naval gameplay is fun and unique, the on foot gameplay is less interesting and basically the same as in every other AC game.The story and most dialogues are quite wellwritten and the characters are interesting. It is an AC game, so I wont have to talk about historical accuracy.While gameplay and story are great, the performance isnt. The game runs on 60 FPS most of the time, but there are frameratedrops every 23 minutes. Ive encountered one game braking bug, which was resolved by reloading a save.It was impossible for me to activate games on UPlay a few years ago because it crashed every time Ive tried to open it. Its better now but it still sucks.All in all I can only recommend this game.
