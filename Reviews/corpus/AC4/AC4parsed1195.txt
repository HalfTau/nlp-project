Many people have described Black Flag as the worst Assassins Creed game ever made while still being the best pirate game theyve ever played. Thats not entirely false but I bet most of those people never tried assassinating their target with a cannon!My favorite aspect of the game by far is the music, from the main theme and the battle music to the diegetic tunes of sea shanties and tavern singers. I believe this game does music better than any other Assassins Creed so far and thats no small accomplishment. The tailing missions however drag this games prestige down considerably. There are far too many of them here and not enough reasons to justify their existence. In the second game they were sparse, to the point and served a purpose in the plot. But here they seem like nothing more than an excuse to move the plot forward. Its therefore ironic that my favorite mission in the game is in fact a tailing mission. The Siege of CharlesTowne mission in the swamp was quite fun to play, and I thoroughly enjoyed its dynamic nature.Assassins Creed is a series that can lend itself to a multitude of scenarios and as sad as it makes me to say this I believe they captured lightning in a bottle with Black Flag. That impression is only made stronger by Unity which wasnt nearly as fun to play as this one. And the announcement of Skull  Bones drives this point home for me because of course they were going to make that game. You dont make a game as successful and loved as Black Flag, with such a reproducible formula and not capitalize on it. Going forward with a pirate game franchise based on the sailing aspect of Black Flag would be the equivalent of printing money.
