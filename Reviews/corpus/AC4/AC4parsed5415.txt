Just purchased this game and wasted my money. I have downloaded this game twice, but it wont open as the game requires a ubisoft game launcher, which is already downloaded and installed on my computer. The game cannot recognise the game launcher on my PC for some reason. Therefore, I dont recommend this game until steam sorts this problem out. Im not buying another game on steam again, as this is a second time this has happened from buying two different games.
