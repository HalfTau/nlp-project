ARGGGH, PIRATES!I love the Assassins Creed series, Ive played them all. But in this one I didnt care about the Assassin story, at all. Hell, I still havent even finished the story. Ive got 37 hours played about 30 of those were just sailing. If youre familiar with Sid Meiers Pirates, its very obvious it influenced the sailing here. Its a modern version of that, with the same great elements. Its a blast to sail around battling and capturing ships, hunting beasts of the sea with Harpoons, and just living the pirate life.The Assassin story is good, so far, but the real love for me is the sailing. So rare you get to enjoy that pirate style of game play.
