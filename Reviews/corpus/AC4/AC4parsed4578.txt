They took the only good part of Assassins Creed III and fully fleshed it out into an incredible game. The naval combat is reason enough to buy this game. And theres nothing like anchoring the ship and going for a deep sea swim to look for collectibles. But be careful venturing too close to any of the 4 corners of the map. Better bring some serious sea shanties for those adventures.
