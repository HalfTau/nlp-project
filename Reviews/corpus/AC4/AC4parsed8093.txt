Youre a mighty pirate!!! Surely thats enough to hook you in. Play as a pirate, do pirate stuff, board and loot massive ships, sing shanties and rob people blind. At the same time, kill folk and climb tall buildings like a pirate. Its ace.The world is huge, youve got an upgradeable boat, and your character is fun. Much better than AC3, more like Grand Theft Auto with pirates. Did I mention pirates?Best pirate game since Monkey Island, best openworld game for PC right now. And it looks gorgeous. Go on, treat yourself! OK, its forty quid but itll take you over 60 hours to plunder the whole Caribbean so that is value.
