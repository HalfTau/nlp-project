Capitalizing on the interest in all things pirates, AC4 moves us to the early 1700s.  What is different is your character isnt actually an Assassin, but rather you kill one in the early moments of the game and take his uniform.  Motivated by money instead of the Creed, this gives Edward a unique and fresh personality to the AC lore.Those that played Far Cry 3 will see the same sanbox style progression.   While in FC3 you had bases that youd take to increase control in an area, AC4 gives you forts that function the same.  Capture a fort not only gives you a quick travel location but reveals nearby points of interest on the map.  The hunting side missions in FC3 are replaced with harpooning here.  This harpooning is more tense, as youre up close and person with Great White Sharks and Whales.The biggest draw for me is the open world sailing.  You can simply hop on your ship and sail the seas plundering as you see fit.  Weather is dynamic, so its not always sunny and calm.  It was quite the sight when you see a water spout barreling down on you.  You can choose to capture instead of sink boats for greater rewards.While many games tend to get stale or downright fail as the sequels pile up, AC4 is not only a great sequel but probably the best in the series.
