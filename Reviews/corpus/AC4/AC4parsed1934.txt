Same mistakes were made again like AC3. Soulness and Nonsense game story is boring. I didnt enjoy the naval system, especially in the beginning when your ship is without upgrades. On the other hand, I did enjoy the melee combat system though, while its simple and does get repetitive after awhile it is satisfying and fun. Still dont recommended.
