Its awesome Fun. I played all Assassins Creed titles, and this is definitely THE BEST for me. It loosened the personal Story elements for more extended, varied gameplay while still keeping the historical Aspect. The ship combat is gorgeous and wellexecuted. Everytime a Broadside rips through a Man o War you can breathe in the virtual gunpowder smoke and feel like a true Thirdperson Pirate.The only grief I have with it  and why I personally cant play it that often  are the System Requirements. This Masterpiece requires a ton of PC in order to run correctly. And so, I take my Steam Account to a friend to play the game there. If you dont have such an Option and a low/medium End PC, you might wanna step by the Console versions or leave this game Entirely.Recommended? Yes. Definitely.
