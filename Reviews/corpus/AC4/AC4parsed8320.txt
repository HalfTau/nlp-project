After getting AC 3 for free, I played it, and thought it was ok, but got dull.This on the other hand is simply awesome 53hrs compared to 28hrs speaks for itself. I could just do whatever I liked on a ship discovering things, diving underwater.Attempting to take on the huge ships at the start of the game and getting owned. Just gave me the incentive to think I am going sink you!.... eventually. after soo many tries it worked. I was stupid and didnt have the tools but managed it.I guess thats what i like in game just exploring and not stuck to corridors. cough Bioshock cough.
