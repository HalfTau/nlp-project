Well, I decided to review this game after not playing it in quite a long while, so bear with me...For the sake of sparing everybody another longwinded, potentially makesnotalotofsense/scatterbrained review...Ill keep it short and sweet.As usual, you play as some guy, who uses some superadvanced computer to become some other guy from hundreds of years ago, and the dude is an Assassin...or, will become one.  So...whats new with this one?  Well, full scale naval combat, for starters...sure, in Assassins Creed 3 you get to pilot a ship for some small sea battles, but this one centers on it.  Boarding, plundering, making a generalout of yourself in the eyes of officials, real piratey stuff.  Oh wait, you PLAY as a pirate...who becomes an Assassin!...So, long story short, plug into superduper virtualreality thingy, become pirate from 15th16th century, blow stuff up, shoot baddies with flintlock pistols, stab people, hide bodies, captain a ship, blow up other ships, board them and steal stuff, or ram into them like a madman...etc, etc....Short story even SHORTER...its a good game.  Buy it.nuff said....Oh and it has a multiplayer thing too....So, yeah, buy it.
