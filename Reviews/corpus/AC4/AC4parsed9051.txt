This is the Mona Lisa of games.I was never really interested in the series until I watched a video of someone play this.This game is just plain incredible.I feel the cutting edge of this game is graphics and gameplay.first offThe graphics.The singleplayerNot multipayerGraphics are just beautiful.No matter what setting of graphics you have on,the graphics will blow your mind.Gameplay will be mediocre at the start.Its just a ton of boring stuff until you get a ship.Then you can just sink a ton of ships.What will you do at the end of the story?Thats an easy answer!Do the Templar Hunts,do the mayan Stela,find buried chests,Explore underwater shipwrecks,or just roam around the seas!Its ALL up to you!Get this game.Just get it.
