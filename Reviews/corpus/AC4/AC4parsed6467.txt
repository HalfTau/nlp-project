If you ever dreamed of tropical life as a pirate look no longer. AC4 is close to perfect in terms of immersiveness, graphics, ambience, gameplay. I even made an album of facebook with AC4 screenshots!! P   Baseline  singleplayer 10/10. Multiplayer 3/10 . HIGHly recommendable nonetheless. On my all time top 5 of games ever.
