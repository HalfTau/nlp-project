I love the Assassins Creed series. Black Flag is good. Thats about all I can say about it, because I got so frustrated with sailing that I couldnt bring myself to even finish the game. I hope Unity focuses more on the story than sailing, because I miss that. Black Flag is an awesome pirate game, but it should have never been an Assassins Creed title.
