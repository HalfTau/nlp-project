A refreshing take on Assassins Creed. I enjoyed every minute of gameplay with a total of 70 hrs played.The characters are great, the dialogue is perfect, and the story is good. The game has the same difficulty problems as the rest of the series, but can be quite challenging at some points. Attacking fortresses and manowars, and doing the bonus objectives, require focus and a good understanding of how your character/ship is controlled. There are also 4 legendary ships that require a pretty skilled captain to defeat.In short, a very entertaining, goodlooking game that is worth buying if you can afford a couple of titles every month. If youre not sure about the AC series or have a low income, you might want to wait until the next special sale. Right now, AC2 and 3 are being sold quite cheaply on Steam. Check it out!
