Worth buying. However and this is a big however uPlay sucks so badly I cant even explain it. Its INCREDIBLY terrible. I cant even stress this enough. You hate Origin? Well, Origin is a CAKEWALK. In fact, I actually like Origin. Not neccesarily EAs buisiness model, but still, Origin is usable. uPlay isnt. Its not. It sucks. Its awful. The plus side is, if you can actually find Ubisofts support phone number, the people are really nice. Ive called them several times. Because of uPlay.Game gets a thumbs up. uPlay gets 50000000 thumbs down.Disclaimer I own this game on uPlay not Steam, so my time logged isnt exactly representative.
