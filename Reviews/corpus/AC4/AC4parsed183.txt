This is the second Assasins Creed game Ive played, but the only one with any real interest. The story line is a blast, so long as its in the Animus. I absolutely loved this game, but ONLY the part of being a pirate. I dont know if every game in the assasins creed line deals with an outofstory component, Im assuming so? If so, I truly hope they arent as horribly, blatently, PAINFULLY, obviously written as this is.I know very little about the Assasins creed story line, but it was miserably obvious what was going on within the first few minutes of dealing with the IT guy. The outofstory experience with the company the character work for very nearly ruined this game for me. Every time I left the Animus it didnt feel like part of the story, it felt like some chore to be done to get back to being a pirate, I just wanted to rush through whatever simple mindless task was being asked. I cant describe well enough how painful the experience out of the Animus was, Ive played mobile games that had more depth than this garbage experience. It felt to me as though someone with a basic concept of game storyboarding, but literally nothing else, managed to push their way into managing that part of the game. Every part of being a pirate was absolutely awesome, and I loved every second of that.If the concept of being a pirate is exciting for you, please get this game. The historic characters are tied in so well, and the atmosphere is excellent! I enjoyed everything about this game except for the outofAnimus experience, and although that part made me feel as though I died slightly inside, I need to recommend this for the excellent piratical experience!
