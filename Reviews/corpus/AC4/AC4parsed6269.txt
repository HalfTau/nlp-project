The pirate portion of this game is awesome.   The Assassin Creed part is more of the same, and the missions far too frequently rely on the follow this person without being caught which, in my opinion, is the weakest part of being an assassin, and the least incharacter for a pirate.That said, the piracy side of this game is amazing fun.
