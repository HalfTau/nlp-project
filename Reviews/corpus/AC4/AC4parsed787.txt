I have Assassin 2, Brotherhood, 3 and Black Flag for me game play control mechanics whatever it is for me that frustrates me with these games Black Flag was the most enjoyable 1 to play out of what I have.Enjoyed the shark and whale hunting, treasure hunting and side stuff was a break from ship battles which u could constantly battle always fleets of ships to battle. There is plenty to do so worth the game playI finnished Assassin 2 out of determination. For my gaming level Black Flag is the 1 to get on sale with DLCs. I did enjoy 2 a few years ago.
