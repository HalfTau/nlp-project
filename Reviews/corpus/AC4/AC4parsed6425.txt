Gosh, the only reason I purchased this was because it was over 70 off. Now I know why. I have a midlevel rig running on an i5 4690K and a GTX 970 overclocked on a 1080p HDTV 240Hz. This game is a screen tearing mess. Even with vsync on or off or dumbing down all the settings to normal or low, youll get screen tear and it gets worse around the Abstergo office sections where the LEAST amount of action occurs! Huh?!. If you can get used to the screen tearing, the game really isnt all that bad. But once again, Ubisoft releases yet another less than stellar PC port.
