230 hours, still love playing the game. that speaks for itself. but anyway.first off for a game of 2013 the graphics are beautiful !!!the landscape is very enjoyable for exploring on the ground and on the rooftops of houses, wherever you are you feel like you are on vacation at the caribbean. the games lighting helps achieve that.the sailing is the easily the best part of the game, it nakes the game feels so much bigger and with the ability to attack any ship, it pretty much leaves you with something to do all the time.the story, well, its assassins creed, you know the story, and its not that diferent, except for the fact that when out of the animus, you play an abstergo employee in first person... thatme off a bit, but then the whole hacking computers from other peoples computers did get a bit fun. plus some missions are really boring and they take the tailing objective to the next level. you tail ships, on your ship, in daylight, about 200 meters away... yeah that was a bit weird.in conclusion it was the best ac game in my opinion and i think that everyone should own it.8/10 because of some bad choices as for the outside the animus story and the boring tailing missions.have a nice day plundering and raiding.
