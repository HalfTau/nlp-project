How to stir a good tasty cocktail cause everyone enjoys booze?! Pour the best gameplay elements of the assassins creed and far cry series into a shaker and shake lightly to mix. Add pirates of the Caribbean hype for garnish and serve. Yummmmy? But for me Sweeeeet with a bitter aftertaste and probably not enough kick!
