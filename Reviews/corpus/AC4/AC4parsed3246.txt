The assassins creed series is very well made.This story takes a step back down the ancestral chain to explore the story of Edward Kenway  father to Haytham Kenway and grandfather to Ratonhnhakton both from Assassins Creed III.The ship battles in the game are really enjoyable and well worth the effort.Collect all the Sea shanty songs or you will be hitting the skip button ALOT!
