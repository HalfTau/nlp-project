Im not a great AC fan to be honest but this is a little hidden gem , the only grime on its badge of greatness is a silly jarring jump to the Future and the game dev levels which are flat and utterly pointless, bar that this is a rip roaring yarn .It is Free roam to an extent with sections of the map locked until you attain a certain story mission progression, usually when a game tries to do naval combat with sails it ends badly , but the naval combat and general sailing about is actually not just easy but fun..wow new concept to games .fun!You have the usual AC underlining story , but the pirate world is top notch with a few hostroical and non histroical figures flung into  boot and the sense of immersion is top notch for a open world game . you can capure strongholds and make traveling about easier , like most games there is also a fast travel option which i rarely used the only other game that manages to stop me hiting the transporter button is the GTA Series, again this says  much about the atmosphere of just sailing ,the weather, the sea shanties...... which you can find a ton of in gameYou have the usual jumping about and stealth but you can also go full tilt postal and still have fun. I wont go much further and spoil anything if you have missed this please try it it will surprise you.To me this is a game I felt comfortable playing and enjoyed messing about in as much as playing , where as most games these days feel like I am ethier grinding out exprience or constantly focusing on the next objective never enjoying the journey.4.5/5  0.5  for the stupid Game Dev slap in the face every now and then
