Ive played them all either on PS3, Xbox 360 and the last few on pc. Black Flag is the best one of the series.The new Naval Combat is amazing. It adds an entirely new aspect to the game.  It kept me entertained for hours. I found myself sailing around pillaging and plundering. Without theof course. So much so that I had to keep reminding myself to go back to the main questline. If you are a Hardcore  Assassins Creed fan and have the entire series or maybe you just picked up one or two games from the series and enyoyed them. Or maybe you never even played AC before. I would definitely reccomend this game. 5 out of 5 Stars.
