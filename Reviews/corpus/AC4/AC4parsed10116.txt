By far the most fun game I have ever played, the graphics are amazing, the story is well written, the gameplay is the best Ive ever played. I would honestly rank this game above any Half Life game in the series. The amount of stuff to do in this game is just beyound crazy. I highely recommend buying this game, you wont regret it!!!!! !
