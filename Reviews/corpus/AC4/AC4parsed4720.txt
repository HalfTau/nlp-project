9.1/10 Outstanding game.Normally I would have a more strungout intro than that, but as a digest, I stand by it. This was my first encounter of Assassins Creed as I wasnt overly impressed with the series so far, it didnt seem something I would like so I didnt bother. However pirates. Yeah, pirates. In a nostalgic haze reminiscing of the title Galleon, I jumped at the chance to buy this when it came on sale.Now, I dabbled with the 1st Assassins Creed with the whole Italy rooftop malarkey and it wasnt for me exciting or compelling at all. There is still the rooftop shenanigans and walking around all stealthy aspect, but it balances that out by giving the player an opensea adventure too. The transition from land to sea is flawless, and it provides an alternate game style to delve into. Its GTA meets Pirates of the Caribbean.There is so much to do in terms of sidequests that you could spend weeks alone collecting the collectables, pillaging the loot boxes and digging sort of for buried treasure. Yet the main story is also immersive and long enough to invest in, without getting too strung out.My only qualm if any is the 1st person breakaway sections that occur at certain points that take you out of the body of the main protagonist and plop you into the office. I felt this section was somewhat lacking and completely disassociates you from the pirate world when you dont want to be. I get it though, its a story telling device used to understand and progress the AC world rather than the Black Flag world.I picked up a couple of other AC titles to try since finishing Black Flag and Im not exactly liking the experience, so perhaps if you are like me then you are not in eager anticipation of AC Syndicate. Having said that, this title is a promising advance on the series and I hope the future iterations provide this much depth and experience in a fantastic location and period of time.
