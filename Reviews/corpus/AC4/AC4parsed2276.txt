Definitely one of the best Assassins Creed games, Black Flag sticks out to people like me who have played all of the Assassins Creed games and even to those that have only played this one. The most unique of all these games it has the best story and gameplay and the graphics even seem preferable to the new Assassins Creed games. Even without the Assassins Creed part this is probably one of the best naval and pirate themed game.
