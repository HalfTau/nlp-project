When its hard to enjoy AC series without completing AC Altairs story and AC Legacy Ezios tale, almost everyone can enjoy AC4 Black Flag without playing previous installment. It almost looks like new entire installment, even I wondered why theres no separate installment Black Flag instead AC4 Black Flag. Either way, AC4 Black Flag is good in its own way different from previous installment.For some people who wants to enjoy Assassins Creed story but too lazy or didnt want spend time completing previous installment, AC4 is a good start. But of course, itll be more enjoyable if one has completing AC and AC Legacy.Final Verdict w/o DLC8.2/10
