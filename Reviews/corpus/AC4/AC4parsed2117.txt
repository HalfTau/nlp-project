Too busy playing this damn game to write a long review so Ill make it short and sweet.Basically takes everything that was wrong with assassins creed III Hunting weirdness, notoriety weridness, hiding in tall grass weirdness, etc , Fixes it, Expands the naval gameplay a ton and refines many other aspects of the assassins creed experience, most notable refinement is making eagle vision useful outside of searching missions.Story is good but it doesnt feel much like a story for an assassins creed game, but so far Im only on sequence 3 out of i dunno how much.Either way worth grabbing if you like pirate stuff and enjoyed Assassins creed III, but if youre looking for a more traditional Assassins creed game may be best to skip this one and go to Unity.Also sea shanties.ON UPLAYIts annoying but at least they give you free game content for getting achievements with their u points or whatever. COULD BE AS BAD AS ORIGIN.
