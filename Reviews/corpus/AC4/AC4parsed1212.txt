This is a Chads ChoiceThis is the best pirate game out there and this guy would know. This game is as good as No Mans Sky is S.h.i.t.Even told yeahboy and cookin to get this game and they got it but on there crappy consoles, this guy got it on pc which looks much better and more fps. Its not as good as Triss from the Witcher but its still bloody good.
