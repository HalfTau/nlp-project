I dont know whats up with this game  but it will not allow me to use my mouse or keyboard. The only thing I can do is hit ESC to exit the game. Ive contacted their technical support team.. but as usual, they were absolutely not helpful one bit. They told me to install the latest drivers for my mouse and keyboard to ensure they work with my system. Hmmm... Wonder how I got to the page to type the question to them in the first place?! ?Checked settings, the game is not set for gamepad/controller/joystick. Its set for mouse and keyboard, and still no luck. Very disappointing especially considering I paid money to play this dang game, and was very excited to play.
