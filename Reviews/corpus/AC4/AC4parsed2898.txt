Keep in mind, this is technically my first Assassins Creed game when I say that I thought the actual Assassin stuff was just ok. The things that involved being a Pirate captain and fighting Man O War was leagues more fun no pun intended. Granted, watching guards go berserk is amusing, but it feels weird sneaking around guards who are incredibly myopic one moment and then hunting me down with a vengeance the next. Maybe not my cup of tea, but the sailing stuff is what redeems it in my eyes. Much like any video game, the underwater levels were frustrating.8/10
