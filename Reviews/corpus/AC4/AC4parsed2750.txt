This is so far the best Assassins Creed game, besides III and Rogue. For everyone who didnt buy this game, should do it now! To be honest I wasnt a fan of sailing with ships in AC III but AC BF did it so well, that I cant stop exploring the huge world with my Jackdaw. But be aware, if youre about to play this masterpiece, you better say goodbye to your social life, cause you wont be able to stop anymore.IGN  9/11
