The game is pretty good, and the ship fights are fun ! The controls on land are a bit  compared to the AC 2 serie.But most infuriating is that that game keeps freezing for random reasons NOT a cooling, performance or else reason.This is consitently happening with all my Ubisoft games and NEVER and other devs.UBISOFT GET YOURTOGETHER !! QA your stuff before selling it to me ! Please !
