I want to clear out the fort in Nassau and decide to do it sneakily. I climb up to the battlements, and ledge kill a guard. The screams as he falls do not seem to bother the guard in front of him. I then kick him over the wall on top of two more guards, who find this mildly interesting, but quickly dismiss it. I double air assassinate those two guards and tackle another. A sniper notices me, so I run over to some tall grass, and he quickly forgets. There are three guards standing next to a powder keg, so I shoot it. They are beginning to suspect that there may be a problem and are searching for me. three guards walk into my grass patch, so I kill one. by some miracle, the other two catch me. my cover is blown, so I make a break for it. i exit the fortress, turn a corner, and hide in a crowd. My stark white outfit blends in perfectly, and the guards quickly forget i ever existed. I go back to try again.11/10 best ai
