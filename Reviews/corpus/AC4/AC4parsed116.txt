Do you like getting shot 5 times in the face and somehow not dying? What about getting stabbed enough to make you bleed out 5 times? Do you like getting your ship blown to splinters, and yet have no physical damage visible?WELL THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!The story is great, and extremely interesting. Really good gameplay and combat, although you are almost invincible when you get a bunch of upgrades. But thats what makes it fun, right? Being able to take down a fort all by yourself without having to be all stealthy about it just makes you feel ing great. What I love about this is after youve completed the main story, you still have aload of things to do. Sink ships, sink LEGENDARY ships, dive underwater looking for treasure, raid warehouses, kill literally everything in sight, getting yourself gear with interesting mechanics, such as the Mayan outfit, which deflects bullets that are shot at you.But theres one major problem... Once you start killing a bunch of people in a city no one else comes, and if you just wanted to be involved in a bloodbath, you really cant ing do that.
