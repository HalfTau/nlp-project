Note I Havent completed the game yet.Ive been a long time fan of the Assassins Creed franchise for many years, and Black Flag seems to be my favorite of the series to play. However I would have to say that Edward isnt my favorite, as it has to go to Ezio in AC2. Anyway, This game has a ton of places to explore side missions to complete and its just damn fun. As of now my only complaints are, the endless amount of grinding to upgrade your ship, and the annoying tailing missions.  Graphically the game is beautiful at max settings.  Overall this game is great and I cant recommend it enough.  Go buy it!
