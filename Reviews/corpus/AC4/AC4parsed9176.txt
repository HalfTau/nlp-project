This game, my god this game. The missions are varied and perfect difficulty, the free roam is loaded with a dizzying amount of extra timewasters, and the story is interesting while not interfering with the story. The combat is a bit of a step in a new direction, with many staples like daggers and axes seeing extremely reduced action, but the fun added by pistols and dual swords is undeniable. Painted atop all of the aformentioned is some of the most beautiful video game visuals out there. Its a true nextgeneration game that improves on the previous title in almost every way.Be warned, though, this means that unless your machine has the processing and graphical chops to run a nextgen title, your game will play like a slideshow. Even the lowest settings killed my 3.2 Ghz i3, 12 gb ram, 512 mb video card computer.
