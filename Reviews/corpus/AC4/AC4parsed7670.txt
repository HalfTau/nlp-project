Fantasic game all around. I was getting burnt out on the Assassins Creed francise after playing the third one, but decided to give this one a try after I saw all the good reviews, and Im glad I did. The amount of things to do, and places to go is astounding. Honestly my favorite thing in this game is to just sail the open sea and listen to my crew sing their shanties. Highly recommended 9/10!
