Great game! Ive enjoyed most Assasin Creed games but was a worried this one would not live up to the hype and would be more of same old or new new gimicks that would be unintersting but to my suprize i love every aspect of the new game! Im also extermely impressed how such a large game company and continue to release high quality titles with absolutely no bugs that i have ever seen and great preformance... expecially for a game made on multple plaforms. I recommend for those with Nvidia cards to use Nvidias recommended ingame settings based on the card you have, works great for my GTX680 and game runs flawlessly. I love the ship battles, fort battles, exploring all islands, the stories, and some of the side quests are pretty intense as well. I hope to get into multplayer aspects too soon but i havent put anytime into multplayer yet.
