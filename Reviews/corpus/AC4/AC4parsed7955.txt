SPOILERSThis has got to be one of the worst AC games. Ive been playing the AC series since the first game and Im REALLY disappointed in this one. First the story is just off to a bad start. Youre a pirate who kills an Assassin with like such ease. You chase him down and like stab him dead in 2 seconds. Some assassin... THEN, you take his clothes to look like an assassin and suddenly, YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING AN ASSASSIN DOES!!! Some pirate who wasnt even a captain or some He was like a deckhand. They might explain it later on but I couldnt even get that far...The gameplay is awful. I mean, the freerunning is worse than the first game, which I dont know how they could do that. I guess whoever did the work for the earlier ones arent there anymore and now just redid it with some intern. Theres even a new small piece that bugs me that they intentionally added. everytime you restart your guy is like frozen for 4 seconds scratching his arm. Very frusterating especially since your character keeps jumping into plain view due to the freerunning and you just wanna get back into it. No, now you have you stand there 4 seconds scratching your arm every. single. time.Jesus save me from his itchy arm....
