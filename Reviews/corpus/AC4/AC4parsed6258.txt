Overall one of the best games in the series, very nearly as good as AC2 in my opinion. The open sea is beautiful and a joy to explore, and the protaginist Edward Kenway is likeable and feels more like a real person than some of the other characters in the series. While the story can feel a bit vague at times and there are WAAAY too many eavesdropping missions for my liking, the supporting characters are likeable and the gameplay feels polished and fluid. Black Flag probably has the most content out of all the AC games the open world is vast and looks absolutely gorgeous on PC and I never felt like I had nothing to do. The naval combat is really what brings this game to life and feels very authentic. Another thing that adds to the immersion is the lack of loading screens once youre done the main story, you need never look at a loading screen again! The whole game is just one big open world, allowing you to dive straight off your ship and swim to a deserted island in search of treasure or scour hidden shipwrecks for treasure. I think this is the most fun game to play out of the whole AC series half a pirate game, half an Assassins Creed game, and a hell of a lot of fun!
