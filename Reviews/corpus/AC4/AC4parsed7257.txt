As someone who has played and enjoyed the other Assassins Creed games, I have to say I am very disappointed with Black Flag. The game is full of glitches and I need to continually revert to last checkpoint because the screen freezes during ship battles sometimes. By freezing I dont mean the game crashes, just the picture Im looking at. The HUD updates realtime and you can still attack/be attacked by the AI. Maneuvering around the environment is stressful because my FPS drops significantly and the visuals are anything but smooth despite meeting and exceeding the specs required. The syncronization of voices in cutscenes is horrendous and gives the feel of a 90s Jackie Chan foreign film. The strange thing is sometimes it is synced and sometimes the dialogue is over 5 seconds before the words are mouthed by the animation. This game has the classic feel of Assassins Creed as far as mechanics are concerned, but the story doesnt feel well thought out. Definitely a step backwards for this franchise.
