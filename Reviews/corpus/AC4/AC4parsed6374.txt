This review comes from one who has not played any of the AC games before.Im loving this game, theres so much to do like in TES games including a variety of hidden collectables etc. which makes for enjoyable exploration. The way the AI operates really fits the game and works well. The grphics are beautiful and the naval combat is very intricate and detailed. Simple touches such as the sound of your crew singing shanties as you said the rough seas give the game a whole new level of immersion. Overall, a fabulous game that has quickly made it into my Steam favourites.Note I have played 7 hours of the game in less than a day already... that might show just how good it is
