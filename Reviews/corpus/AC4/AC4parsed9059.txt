This is totally Amazing, it did not disappointed my expectations!Ubisoft with NVidia did an incredible work of optimization for PC platform.. Im so lucky to run it on fullultra graphics!The experience is absolutely immersive, you can feel like a pirate walking down the streets of a caribbean town.Also you sense the difference between this one and the old Assassins Creed games..Captain Kenway is a total Prick the positive way!! He doesont give a  of others, you feel like I just want to kill someone, I do it, no matter the way!.Naval combat and exploring is also fantastic! !Must have for ACs fans! And nonfan either
