I have played this game for a stupid number of hours now, for an AC game anyway, it is a superb return to form for the franchise, and cleans up MOST of the mistakes made in AC3, there are still some buggy elements and combat could definitely evolve in these games to make it more interesting/fun/challenging/unique. But overall on pc with a decent GPU you are getting very pretty next gen experience, if you havnt taken the plunge yet i highly suggest it.20/10 would crash into rocks on the shore again!
