Hmm... I dont know where to start.Let me just say this is one of the two best games I have ever played. Two being Assassins Creed III. It has incredible graphics, but nearly impossible to play on a low end PC. I have a high end PC, so it runs pretty smoothly, but even then, it is much more lag compared to Assassins Creed III.Graphics 7/10.The storyline is one of the most well crafted I have ever seen. It is incredible how they made nearly everything related to Assassins Creed III. For example This game takes place before Connor even existed, which gives Ubisoft an opportunity to make Captain Kidd one of the main characters. Who was mentioned multiple times in AC3 So, yes, the story line was very well put together and very accurate.Storyline 10/10Here we are, now. On to Gameplay. First, let me say that I love the idea of double swords and four firearms at once. I just wish they had added more combat finish opportunities. It makes the game a bit unrealistic, but I have a feeling Ubisoft will fix that in Assassins creed Unity. The parkour expirence is incredible! I just love being able to leap, roll, and dive in the world of endless possibilities!Gameplay 9/10The sound is good... thats all I have to say.Sound 10/10So yes, I do reccomend this game for anyone with a good PC.Overall 8/10
