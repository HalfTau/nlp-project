This is an awesome Pirate game one where you can sail the sail seas, plunder and loot to your hearts content! Amazing graphically, with plenty of content to keep you going for hours upon end. The story is quite different to the other Assassins Creed games, but the gameplay is the finest in the series yet! Would highly recommend this to anyone who likes the Assassins Creed gameplay formula and wants to explore a beautiful and living environment!
