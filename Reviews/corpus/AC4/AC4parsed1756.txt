This game is far better than any of their new games. Unity sucked bad and syndicate was a joke. This is a must play for assassins creed fans or if you like just being a pirate.  I have two playthroughs on my xbox one, and one on here and im not one to replay games much.  5 stars in my book story and gameplay.  LOVE itTake no quarter, and give none either!
