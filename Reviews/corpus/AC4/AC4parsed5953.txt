Id recommend theout of this!! Sure, it has that tness that comes with every AC game, but my God, It is fantastic. The last AC game I played was revelations to which you are constrained to a fairly big map, but constrained non the less. As soon as I got a chance i looked straight at the map... and holy  its big. Not only do you get to charter most of the islands AC style you get to do awesome battles in a ing ship. A ING SHIP. And to top it all off it has, in my opinion, the best protagonist in all of the AC saga and one of the greatest storys to accompany it. After my first playthrough 21.1 hrs of game time, to which I plan on going 100 and then start all over, I can comfortably say that this truly is one of the most memorable gaming experiences I have had! !My only complaint was that it was released too early. If this game had VR headset crap I would jzz myself until my balls were dry!
