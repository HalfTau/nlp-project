The best assasins creed game I have played and own. There is nothing like having a giant ship to deal with issues like, giant man of wars, or the need for a bit of metal. The best way to describe this game would be the story of AC2 with the graphics of AC3. Then add the ability to sail around and you have AC4. GOTY for me, I have never spent so much money on any other game in my library, and this was 100 worth it!
