Original review Im leaving a negative review, simply because the game wont start for me at all, after hours of trying. I think this is a problem some people have but most dont. Ill probably just play it when I replace my laptop. Just a heads up.New review Okay, now my laptop can handle it, Ill leave my actual opinion on the game. It really is excellent and Im going to recommend it. Even after all the hassles I had with it Im really glad I bought it.
