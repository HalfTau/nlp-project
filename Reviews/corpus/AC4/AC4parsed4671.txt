Might as well be called pirate simulator,plunder your way through an extensive map with your upgradeable and trusty ship plenty of islands to explore, plenty of ships and galleons and the likes to plunder and destroy or send to your fleet to bring you riches from the world over.At its core its still an AC game with all the templars and assassins and all that boring stuff,but it is the best one imo.Gameplay is solid,you will still jump to or from places that you dont want to and the combat is really easy,when underwater,the sharks are really annoying,but you will fight and jump and climb your way through the world with relative ease.I really loved the protagonist,voiced and mocapped by Matt Ryan aka John Constantine,great performance.The graphics are really good,game is very pretty,has amazing sunsets,the underwater parts are gorgeous,definitely good looking.The music is stellar,from the sea shanties singed by your crew to the amazing ost composed by Brian Tyler,I listen to it all the time.TLDR Forget Unity and Syndicate,this is the AC you should be playing
