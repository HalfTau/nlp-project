This, to me, is the best Assassins Creed game from the entire series. People may rav on 2, and hate on 3, but this brings in the best parts of both.It has gripping story, fun and intresting people, the combat is fast and powerful, you can hunt, kit out Edward in armor and extra pistols, give him new clothing although this is sadly limited, change out your swords and pistol sets again, sadly limited...The voice acting is well done, the ship controls well and the sea combat is fast, fun, tence and makes you feel like a real powerful pirate to be feared. The explration can get boring, but so can exploring in most games...I beg anyone who loves Assassins Creed, anyone who is even thinking of buying this game, that they buy it...the singleplayer is so much fun, sailing around and being a Assassin pirate is the best...
