I have a mental list of my top five favorite games. Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is number three in my list.Black Flag was released in 2013, but it easily compares to modern titles. It has aged remarkably well for being four years old. The West Indies has never been better realised. The plot is lacking, and isnt really that interesting, but the familiar historical figures that interact with Edward during his life definitely make the story much more entertaining. Where Black Flag REALLY shines, however, is the gameplay. Taking the naval gameplay from its predecessor and refining it, Black Flag places you at the helm of the Jackdaw, and gives you the entire West Indies to explore. The world is enormous, and promises hours of activities and missions for the player. Returning fans of the series might not enjoy this game as much as other titles purely because the game focuses on putting the player in the shoes of a pirate rather than a melodramatic assassin following a creed, which is a breath of fresh air for the series and makes the game much more friendly to players new to the franchise 9/10, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is remarkable and by far the definitive singleplayer pirate experience. Bringing the naval gameplay to the forefront of the games focus, the only time Black Flag drags is in its story, and the Assassins Creed side of the game is totally lacking in quality and quantity.
