Pirate simulator. Ship battles are great, but get boring after doing it 50 times. You get 4 pistols eventually, and 2 swords. Everything looks great. This takes place before Rogue, which takes place before 3.Combat can get boring. Some missions are too simple yet frustrating. You got good after a while at playing in the games before 3, but now you kinda dont.
