Hooked immedieatly. If you love pirates and pirate themed games , this will blow you away. Ship combat is a bit arcade like , but the graphics make up for it , I forget about fast travel and manually sail across the caribbean myself. The combat is assassins creed alright , more or less far fetched as far as hiding in bushes to escape 5 redcoats.... but the fighting is fun as hell. I fully recommend this game. Just wish the multiplayer included a coop campaign , and ship combat. I could see the main character and his ships first mate being a good avenue for coop.
