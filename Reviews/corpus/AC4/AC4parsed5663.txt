Very good game. Side missions are actually enjoyable esp. templar hunts. Pirate theme does get old after a while.Could be more customisation options but I guess Ubisoft fixed that in Unity overkill. Both this and Unity are very good. Would reccommend buying Unity from CDKeys cos its v.expensive from Steam.
