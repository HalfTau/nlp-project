Its a shame Ubisoft tarnishes decent games just to try and control them with their absolute garbage DRM. I didnt buy this game on release because of uplay and the inevitable issues that 99 of their games have when theyre lazy halfports, with some always online DRM that doesnt function properly half the time.But dont let the reputation of Uplay or even crappy Assassins creed games tarnish this one. This is a pretty damn fun iteration of an AC game. Best game I can compare it to right now is Mad Max. The combat is pretty meh, the story/development is decent, but the best part is roaming the open world collecting things and destroying everything in your path. Basically mad max the game on the ocean.I cant name any other game where ive gotten to control my own ship in an open world setting, at least none that were memorable. This game lets you have your own ship with a lot of weapons/upgrades/customization, and you can take it just about anywhere and do anything. The whole pirate theme really makes this game.I still probably wont be buying any ubisoft games, but I will recommend this one just because I genuinely enjoy it.
