I think the running around parts got, if anything, slightly worse... tailing people is less interesting since blonde pirates have XRay vision, and aside from that theres not much new to it other than grenades and more hiding spots. However, the game also introduces the whole sailing thingamabob, which is the most actiony rendition of sailing a big hulking ship Ive ever seen.Storywise, the pirate main character is quite different from the previous protagonists, which is refreshing and fun, but the presentday parts do a bad job at convincing me to be interested in the new impending apocalypse that Desmond replaced the old one with at the end of the last game. Perhaps thats why they stopped numbering them after this one because they too couldnt be bothered to care about the modernday plot any more.
