i get around 1925 fps on normal low settings i get more fps on tomb raider 2013 on high 762 res i get 4060 fps i get more fps on rust on medium res762at 30 fps  and rust is demanding af. im using a amd 7800 and r7 intergrated graphics.but yet i can run bf4 at med to low at 2430 fps. i dont mind 25 fps at all as long the graphiccs are good im okay but i might as well just get ac for the ps4 instead since my pc cant run it that well for some reason even thoo i can run games that are 10x more demanding then it.
