This is not the best AC game, but it is still very entertaining. The naval fights are enjoyable for many hours but at some point the become a boring grinding for ressources.The side missions are not much fun, but the story missions are quite good.The gameplay is not as fluently as in ACB or ACR and can be frustrating some times.
