There is no surprise as to what to expect here. The Assassins Creed Franchise has been around a while. Is this game as good or better than the other AC releases?  The answer ... Quite good! Maybe even better, especially if you love the pirate motif.Get this game and start having fun. Or wait for a sale and get it then. Just buy the game eventually  its great!
