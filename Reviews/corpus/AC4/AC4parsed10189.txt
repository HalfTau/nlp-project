The Assassins Creed series continues to amaze me! The graphics in this game are simply outstanding. Im not really a fan of the boat crap thats somewhat irritating! I really like the other gameplay. I like how the recent release of certain games COD Ghosts, and Battlefield 4 are calling themselves Next Gen. I dont really consider them next gen, more like suedo next gen. But the gameplay on Assassins Creed IV is just like the others with albiet some new stuff. Im not a big multiplayer, So I cant review that portion of the game. There is a big open world in the game giving you the ability to roam anywhere on the map. Treasure Hunting is fun, along with the scenery. It doesnt have that annoying AI that blocks every attack you do crap either. In the first Assassins Creed game the AI blocked 90 of the time making it not really fun and not really realistic. The storyline is also compelling.
