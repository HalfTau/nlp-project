If you were on the fence about this game like i was,because  it being an assassins creed game. you can rest assure that this is much more of a great pirate game than an assassins creed game. The naval combat in this game is excellent, and the environment is beautiful. I would often find my self sailing around the ocean, taking on ships and running from storms more that i playing the acual story. The ground combat is much more assassins creed press X to win and when you in towns it turns into you standered assassins creed game. All in all, if you are looking to satisfy your thirst for a pirate game, get it. it wont dissapoint
