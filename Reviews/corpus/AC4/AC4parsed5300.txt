I dont understand the nearunanymouspraise in the reviews for this game. I thought this game was really bad. Maybe if youre super into Assassins Creed games, or are really hungry for shipcombat, this could be enjoyable but theres a lot the developers did to get in the way of players enjoying the best parts of the game.For one, everything involving Abstergo, a sort of neocorporate video game company thats projecting you back into time, is a completely unwanted distraction and tries hard to lay on a plot thats actually pretty bad.And the mainmissions are just plain notfun and feel like an intermission from the good parts of the game, rather than the other way around.At best this game would be a good rental, if that were still a thing.
