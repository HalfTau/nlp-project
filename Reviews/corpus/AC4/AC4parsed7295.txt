AC3 bored me to tears. The monotone nature of the main characters voice and lack of personality really killed it for me. AC4 however....is Awesome! I find myself actually trying to get 100 completion in this game. I have never done this in previous AC titles. The ship sailing/battles are great. Mix those with traditional AC gameplay and even some underwater sequences and you have a winner! I would have like to have seen more ship customizations, character customizations, and more upgradable environments such as forts and your island hideout. This does not effect gameplay at all. The game is really long and if you do side missions and item finding along the way...the length of the game more than justifies the price. Good buy! Would recommend!
