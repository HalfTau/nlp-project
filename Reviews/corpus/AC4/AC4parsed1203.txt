Putting the hate of this video game series has apart, I really enjoyed playing it. If you like pirates, this is your game, plus you are a badass assassin. Its really enjoyable assaulting ships with your crew and sailing while you hear the sea shantys. Some levels are poor designed, but on the whole is quite solid. I didnt like that much the Abstergo visits part, it cuts the continuity of the game. Maybe it hasnt the best story of the AC saga, but it works.
