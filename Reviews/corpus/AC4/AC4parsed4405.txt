well.... now that is on sale of 75 it might be worth it, its really fun no doubt, its a great pirate game, very nice open world and a ll that, they nailed that, yup no doubt. but, this is an assassins creed game, not pirates of the carribean blonde addition, anything assassins creed related seems halfdone and stale, the missions are not very interesting and the story gets dumb pretty fast, if u want an exciting exploration game, with pirates and fine gameplay, it will be worth your 8 bucks, if its an assassins creed game, with deep story and stealth gameplay, probably wont get what you are paying for.
