One of Ubisofts triple A titles, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag AC4 BF further expands the Assassins Creed universe not only in terms of the plot, but in gameplay as well. Its rare to find a game that builds off of so much material, but AC4 BF stands out against the traditional video game since it offers a variety of sidequests or minigames. Within AC4 BF there is crafting, naval fleet management  trading, item collection, hunting, harpooning, piracy, exploring and of course the thirdperson assassination missions that we all know and love from the franchise. AC4 BF is absolute fun and has become the premier pirate game. Everything from the diverse gameplay to the graphics and sounds, AC4 BF is not to be passed up by any selfrespecting gamer as it is what video games should be delivering in terms of experience.
