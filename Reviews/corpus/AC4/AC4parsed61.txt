Best Assassins Creed game by far. But I might just be biased towards liking pirates.Dont buy the timesaver packs. Might as well just ask for a pack to make the game 3 hours shorter. Or a pack that plays the game for you. Some DLCs arent really DLC, and some are proper DLC. Youll have to figure them out yourself cause some arent really clear.If you have the patience to get past the tutorial bit at the start all the way till when you can free roam, congratulations! Your suffering is being met with an ocean of fun. Literally.The only thing that bothers me is that this could be a fully made pirate game with pirate combat mechanics, but it doesnt fail to remind you that youre still an assassin every time. Which breaks the appeal for me a little bit. Having Assassin Creed in a pirate game. GET OUTTA HERE ASSASSIN!I just look past that most the time.... when i can. The parkour on small islands with no people are pretty fun.For the restStorytelling  MehTutorials  HandholdingMissions  MehBut thats just assassins creed, heres what Black Flag has to offerOpen World  GorgeousPirate Theme  Sick but falls out in certain locationsShip sailing  F AWESOMEDoing pirate things like diving for treasure and stabbing whales? Fun as all hell, even more fun when PETA or whatever actually gets worried of the influence of that xDOverall just a fun game if you dont take storytelling too seriously. I know some take the gameplay too seriously and cant even enjoy the open world sailing because of it. Just have fun! D
