Absolutely loved it, fantastic story and setting. The atmosphere combined with the music was brilliant. Incredibly astecthically pleasing game. I did not come across any glitches that Ubisoft are known for incorporating and even on my rig at high settings the textures were not great but over all it was thuoroughly enjoyable.
