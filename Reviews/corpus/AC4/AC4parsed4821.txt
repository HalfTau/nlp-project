This is two games in one. Neither of them is very good, but the combination has a nice pacing that is more pleasant that previous AC games. One of them is a game about pirates and naval battles. Its quite basic but it doesnt overstay its welcome. The other game is same old AC. Its done a little better than previously, but still not good enough to make you care about it.The main strength is the graphics. The various settlements, seas, sandy islands and jungles are among the most colourful and naturallooking locations ever featured in an AC game. If the conditions are right, you might even experience things that look like those overly dramatic paintings of battles from the 18 century.The biggest weakness is that it doesnt look like this game was intented to be part of the AC franchise. Most of the content has nothing to do with Templars and Assassins, and that includes the main characters and the heros motivations. Sure, theyve written Assassin and Templar here and there, but it always feels out of place. The worst part is that they completely failed to explain why the hero moves like an Assassins, is friendly towards them and does their missions, even though he is explicitly not an Assassin and not motivated by their cause.
