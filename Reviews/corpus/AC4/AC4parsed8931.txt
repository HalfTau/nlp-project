Not only is this the Assassins Creed game Ive been waiting for this is the pirate simulation game that I have been waiting for. This is probably my favorite Assassins Creed game, over the triumphs of ACII. The story and writing is the best it has been in the series and so is the gameplay, plus naval combat is perfect, takes me back to the days when I played Sid Meiers Pirates for hours on end as a kid only in a much more immersive way.I thought this is where the series would jump the shark, so to speak, though you could argue it already did in Brotherhood and Revelations but it doesnt. This game breathes some fresh air into the series that ACIII tried but didnt quite acomplish in some ways though I still loved ACIII. And, it sets up a new metaarc for the series that Im actually kind of intrested in unlike the previous one with the 2012 apocolypse thing.But, seriously, this game isnt just good or great, its fantastic.
