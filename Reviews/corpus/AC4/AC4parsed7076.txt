Obviously this long after the games release my positive isnt really nessessary due to the amount of other positive reviews although I cant reccomend this installment in the Assassins Creed franchise enough.  However, there are a lot of reviews for this game on Steam NOT reccomending it due to Uplay deleting save data.  I bought the game during the Summer Sale 2014  and have managed to finish the game to 100 completion without once having an issue with Uplay.  This could just be me being extremely lucky, but I suspect that the problem may have been fixed, as I have also yet to see a problem with Splintercell Blacklist since around March 2014.Basically, the game is fantastic and going out on a limb Ill say Uplay wont mess up your game anymore.
