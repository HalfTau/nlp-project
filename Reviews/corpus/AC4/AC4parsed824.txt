Been along since AC part I and imo this is the best AC part ever created.What i especially like about this one is the weather engine, which e.g creates massive storms. U see the clouds slowly gathering together and u know  going on if u havent found a port yet. Another remarkable thing is the water  its the nicest Iver ever seen in a game of any kind. Additionally there are plenty of small islands, which all hide their secrets.The fighting can be compared to AC 3. What i like here is that u can have 4 holster as the game is progressing besides other improved gear e.g. more health.Definitely a buy recommendation for all who alrdy enjoyed earlier parts especially AC3 but its also a great start  for the Assassins creed series.
