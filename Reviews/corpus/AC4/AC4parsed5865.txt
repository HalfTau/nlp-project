The worst game I have played in a long time. I would rate the gameplay, the story, the characters, the voice acting and everything else, but I cant because I dont know anything about the game. I cant even play the damn game. I have a GTX 760 FTW 4gb and an i5 4500k running at 4.7 ghz, and it was so poorly optimized that I couldnt find the best setting for my PC. I always had a 2025 fps framerate no matter what I tried.On top of that, the game crashed every fifteen minutes on average. I troubleshooted, verified files, changed settings in the nVidia Control Panel, reinstalled the game on my C drive, started a new save in case mine was currupted, turned off Uplay overlay and automatic backups, ran the .exe in different compatibility modes, and many more. None of this helped what so ever. I got 7 through the campaign and I cannot continue the game even if I tried. Im not even exaggerating I literally cannot continue the game any further because it crashes at the very same point within like a 2 minute window of a cutscene on one of the missions. This is the last Assassins Creed game I will ever buy.
