Absolutely amazing. A really strong and fun storyline that left a lump in my throat on the last sequence. Very much a massive return to foorm after the how that was AC3. Immediately into open world, a massive world to play in, lots of side activities, strong story, immersive world, meaningful character progression tied to the ship and base. Just brilliant.An absolute must have of a game.
