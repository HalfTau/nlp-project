I play a lot of steam games of which whom has an amazing storyline and pleanty of action, with the needed thinking in order to accomplish difficult missions. This game really put forth the effort to make that happen to all the player and has made the top 3 games that i have ever played and it will hold its spot for a while. I logged in just 60 hours without even reaching the pinacle of what i wanted to have done. Loved the ability to make my ship and still have plenty of time to spend on land. I urge you to immediatly purchase this game, you will not regret it!
