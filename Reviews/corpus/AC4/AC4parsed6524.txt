Probably the second best out of the eight entries in assassins creed, second only to assassins creed 2, which is still a high honor. unlike previous games where you have a lofty goal to vanquish all the templars and win world peace, this time you have one singular objective GET PAID.Sail the high seas of the caribean taking what you wish and singing focsle songs until your throat bleeds rum.Turn off antialiasing to avoid game breaking graphical issues when piloting ships, expect janky and weird kill animations from time to time.THEN SAIL THE HIGH SEAS AS A PIRATE. Simple enough.
