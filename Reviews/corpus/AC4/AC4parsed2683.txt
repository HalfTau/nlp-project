Fun and bountyful. Loved the vastness of the map, tons of activities and collectibles. Havent 100 the game, yet spent 150 glorious hours pillaging and plundering the Caribbean! Seafaring is fun. Story is good, especially the pirate parts, action is great. Freerunning controls are a bit clunky, so you may fail pursuit challenges at times. My only gripe with the game is the fact the amount of assassination contracts is finite.
