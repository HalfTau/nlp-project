Ive played every Assassins Creed game, and I must say that this is one of the best..At first, I didnt think that the caribbean pirate would have been a cool background character for an assassin, I thought that Ubisoft made this game just for the naval combat, and then added the usual Assassins vs Templars thing. But after finishing this game 100, I completely changed my mind. The background story is really well done, the introduction is nice also very piratestyle, and the end is even better. Through the game Ill try not to spoil anything you gradually assist at the transformation of a pirate, interested only in gold, in a real assassin. I mean, its not instantaneous like Assassins Creed II or III, that in two missions you become an assassin. In this game, until almost the end Edward remains in a neutral state between Assassins and Templars, because, as I said before, his only interest is gold. And I really really liked this thing, it makes the story more realistic, in a way.But enough with the story now, I dont want to spoil anything The new game engine, introduced by Assassins Creed III, is good on some things and simply awful in others.Its great that now you have to simply press the RT button to freerun, thats very nice, because in this way you can adjust the camera while you run. But the combat controls, in my opinion, have become worse. I dont like parrying with the B button, and honestly, I miss the dodge. Apart from the combat. though, I like this new engine and it works great.Last, but not absolutely least, the naval combat.. Man thats marvelous! Nice controls, beatiful scenes, it really makes you live what it meant to be a pirate.. PerfectWell done, Ubisoft.. 9,8/10
