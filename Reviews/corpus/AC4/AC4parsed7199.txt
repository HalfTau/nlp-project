Having played most of the Assassins Creed series I am quite used to it but, This game is just so much better than the rest. The combat is awesome Infantry and Naval and there are some really good elements to the game such as, recruiting pirates, taking over other ships and then choosing what you can do with the wreckage of the ship  Repair, Destroy and so on This really does add to the game in an awesome wayThere is a couple of problems involving minor detail for example, The death animations of the guards and enemies are broken...  For example, you kill a guard near a wall and his foot goes through the wall playing the death/execution animation after you have killed him and in order the the corpse to ragdoll it need to go in to the ragdoll physics, in the ragdoll physics you will see that the foot has got cought in the wall and makes the guard glitch out. Its amusing to see but kind of annoying at the same time.Over all I rate it 8/10 because it is awesome but not perfect. Thank you for reading my review.
