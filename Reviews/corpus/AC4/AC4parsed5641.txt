Arrg, who doesnt want to be a pirate!  I mean, when youre a professional pirate, you dont have to wear a suit!  So hey oh hum...  Plenty of ship action with a huge amount of running on rooftops with ease as you hunt your prey!  Great game, just wished there were steam achievements instead of the uplay BS
