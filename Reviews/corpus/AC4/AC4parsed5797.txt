AC IV BF is the final amalgamation of the lastgen assassins creed games. All the things that youve come to know and love about the franchise really shine in this installment and the missions with the ships are just spectacular. Some might quibble with the story elements of this game after the conclusion of AC3, but Ubisoft does a great job creating new story hooks for players to explore. My only qualm with the game at first was the Phone Application style fleet mini game. I really lamented this aspect of game play, I hated the fact that I had to check my game every four hours to optimize my fleets performance Im obsessed with such things and it became tedious. Despite all that the fleet management grew on me and I found myself booting up the game just to hunt the elusive highlevel Manowars to be the flagships of my burgeoning fleet. I became so invested in this aspect and made so much ingame currency that I lost the will to play the game... Also Uplay sucks...In conclusion, this game is worth the full pricetag by far, but at this point it goes on sale every other weekend. Grab it and youll be doing yourself a great favor... cue the obligatory You are a Pirate  la Lazytown
