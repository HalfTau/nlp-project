Pros Massive, vibrant open world. Visually stunning Great setting Sea Shanties! Plenty to do for completionists Naval combat / sea adventures Crafting / Hunting / Diving / Looting / upgrading and outfitting! 18th Century characters brought to life 18th Century story part of the gameCons Tail missions that almost all end in a scripted blood battle, thus removing the need for stealth Follow missions. You would think that by 2013, the ability to force NPCs to run to the next objective would have been established in the series. Abstergo  everything. Pulling the player out of the 18th Century West Indies to remind them that they are in a game with condescending puns and euphemism really breaks the immersion. Controls sometimes fiddly, Edward would occasionally jump in the opposite direction that I was intending, but this is rare.ConclusionAS4BF is easily the best game in the series. The 18th century world of the West Indies has been brought to life with all of the swashbuckling adventures you would expect in a fairy tale. The only thing that stops AS4BF from being a truly fantastic game are the same hangovers from previous games that the developers have failed to iron out. Tail missions and Abstergo present day activities are tedious and immersion killing. Even still, AS4BF is probably my favourite game of 2013. 9/10.
