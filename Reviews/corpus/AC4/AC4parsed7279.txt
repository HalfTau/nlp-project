This was a fun game with lots of things to do. I was pretty impressed by the number of game activities  piracy, raiding warehouses, assassination missions, hunting/whaling, underwater treasure hunts. They are not overly complicated but fairly engaging, nonetheless.Ship combat was an interesting mix  ramming, broadsides, using the environment as a weapon. Another interesting tactic is to board the ship inport and take out the crew before initiating naval combat. Individual combat is also pretty fun with lots of different options  stealth, berzerk darts, gunplay, throwing opponents off buildings. My only problem with combat is getting kill streaks and not really understanding how to use rope darts. A little documentation on those mechanics would be helpful.Overall, a good value in my book.Note I disabled cloud save and had zero problems with saves.
