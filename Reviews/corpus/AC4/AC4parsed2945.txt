As someone who found running over roofs in previous AC games repetitive and boring, I was actually pleasantly suprised with the Black Flag. Its still the same busywork game we are used to from Ubisoft but the range of activities is so wide that you wont get bored anytime soon.I liked change in the enviroment from just plain cities to wilderness and sea I havent played AC3, so I dont know about that, very refreshing. There is so much things to do, ship battles with eventually managing your own fleet, diving to shipwrecks using diving bell, hunting using harpoons and I could go on. Mentioned running across rooftops has been put behind a bit on behalf of these things, so theres just a couple of cities that are nowhere near the size of AC2 cities. But I didnt mind, didnt really missed them.Graphics is great and runs ok with occasional framerate drops in cities or wilderness vegetation causes this, I presume. Ubisoft Montreal really managed to make a nice, tropical world in which you could imagine living, which is a sign for me of great work.Story is a bit weak but youll have fun nontheless.Giving that the pirate theme is not being used much in games, this is one of the best pirate games you can get. I wouldnt hesitate to say even the best.
