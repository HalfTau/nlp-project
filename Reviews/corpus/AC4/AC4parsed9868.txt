This game is probably the best if at least not one of the better Assassins Creed games. To start, all that horrible, impossible to manage parkour as Desmond is gone  instead, when not in the Animus you are a firstperson Abstergo employee who is working on a game using the animus and some hacking part of the story. This is a refreshing break from the previous games, and delivers the story a lot better. Overall, the game is a general improvement on AC3 with few wrong moves. The separation of Islands and having a naval map helps spread out the game, create more content, and resolve past fast travel issues. The game is larger and better than the previous ones. Multiplayer is good but too much content is unlocked by leveling giving experienced players greater advantage. Obviously you buy it for the story and gameplay though. In general, only issue is after playing for a few hours you will have major lag and spasming spawns/ light splitting your screen this is on an asus g46vw laptop, however, since you can always open up the menu and not skip cutscenes!, you can simply quit, saving progress and avoiding a crash/task manager/restart hassle, and let the computer cool off. Overall, definitely worth a buy, and us stingy steam users can wait until it goes down at Christmas if necessary.
