Not a bad game, in fact I really did enjoy sailing but thats maybe cause I love to sail IRL.But what a  ending !!!!!!Apart from that, a few minor bugs and frustrations here and there due to the automation of the characters movement.Also sometimes it really feels like the plot wants you to do things one way, and if you dont, it makes it hell for you.I was a bit dissapointed with the story, the home base with upgradeable stuff had absolutely no use or purpose except maybe in multi player .Black Beard was anything but a terrifying tough crazy famous mythical pirate.Oh whatever, its always the same with this franchise, and I still enjoying playing them, the games fun and I guess that is what its meant to be.I wouldnt invest too much money or expect anything deep though, just a bit of fun in a AAA type surrounding.
