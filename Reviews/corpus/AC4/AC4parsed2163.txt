good storyline, good gameplay, and good character development, i highly recomend this game for people who loves adventure type of games.dozens of island waiting to be discovereddozens of forts waiting to be taken overhundres of ships in a vast ocean to plunder and lootall AC series has its own Gimmick that makes it unique and in black flag it came in the form of large map and naval battle which kinda addictive,
