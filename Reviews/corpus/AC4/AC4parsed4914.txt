Nope, dont do it....I have basic high speed internet, this meant a 6 hours to download the game. I was fine with that. Started download, went to sleep. When the download completed I clicked the play button, It then tells me I need to be in uplay. AGAIN I was fine with that. Uplay has awful servers that Aparently go down frquently When every something new comes out, or a sale happens. I would have been totally fine with that if the multiplayer was the only thing effected.NO.Steam Cannont Activate the game, even though its a steam Game You have to Sign in to Uplay and do it that way.Which means the game is unplayable if their severs go down.Im sure the game is great, but I cant exactly tell you, because they wont let me play it.....
