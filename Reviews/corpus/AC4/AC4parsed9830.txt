AC4 Black Flag is an excellent addition to the Assassins Creed franchise. This latest installment is perfect for the avid AC series fan. The world is much larger than ever before, it is almost entirely openworld. Your ship is fully upgradable / customizable, as you upgrade the number of broadside cannons or change the style of sails you can see a visual change in appearance of your ship. You can leave the wheel of your ship and jump ashore at any moment. It is a shame though that you cannot captain any other ship other than the Jackdaw, but seeing as how youre supposedly reliving the life of an ancestor it makes sense. There are literally hundreds of events and side missions, ranging from diving a sunken ship, following treasure maps, attacking and boarding trade convoys on the high seas, and so much more guaranteed to keep you occupied for many hours. The Ubisoft crew brings back the old traditional AC gameplay with new features and a nice clean polish. The fighting is more smooth, and you can finally dual wield swords. They added in a hunting / crafting system that is similar to the one in Far Cry 3, which adds incentive for you to explore the 50 some exotic islands inhabit the West Indies / Caribbean. Personally, Im a huge fan of pirates and when I heard that this installment was going to take you to the 1700s during the Golden Age of Piracy I was very excited. The game did not disappoint. Im not a history buff or anything but I know enough to appreciate the fiction that is created and interwoven by the AC team onto actual history. It would be super cool if there was actually a global shadow war between the Assassins and Templars right? Haha, anyways I highly recommend this game to all RPG / Action / Adventure players who enjoy endless games, because as with all the previous AC games you can continue to play forever after you complete the story. Overall, Id give this a 8.5/10
