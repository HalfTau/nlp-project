I recommend getting this game, you have great fun, has an amazing story, great graphic and is my all time favourite game series, especially this one, I personally love all of the Assassin Creed games, but this one stood out to me from the very start I bought this game. So to sum up this review I definitly recommend you buying this game if you can and playing this, having alot of fun.
