This is like the Need for Speed of pirate games. It isnt super accurate but it is certainly fun. The Far Cry 3 outpost elements work well, as does the PETA trolling whaling/shark hunting mini game. The grind for upgrades/the need for DLC to give you stuff that should be basic/and the remaining Assassins Creed game elements are dubious at best. The main character is much more likeable than AC3, but the villains are decidedly less interesting. I really love the sea shanties and the pirating sequences but this is the sort of game thats worth it more when it goes on sale unless you must have a pirate game/love them.
