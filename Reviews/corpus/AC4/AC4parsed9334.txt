so, its your regularcreed game. The story is meh, one thing Kenway was able to do assassination contracts before he even knew how the assassins were yes, use their crrier pigeon things. A lot of plot holes and the like, but the gme was enjoyable. I enjoyed sailing about and plunderung ships. I finnished the story and it was ok, not bad, not great, just ok. I didnt every collectible because I dont enjoy finding the same four types of items in different cities over and over and over again. The shanties were what i focused on, so i didnt have to hear the same three the whole game. buy it if your a fan ofcreed games, this isnt a modern pirates of the carribean or age of pirates 2. Go in knowledged and dont expect too much.
