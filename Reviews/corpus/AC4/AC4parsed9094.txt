Runs like crap, if youre going to get this and youre a huge fan like me, get it on Xbox or some console, even Wii U just not the PC version. Heres some examples of the problems.1 Huge FPS problem2 I have this strange glitch where on the main menu it keeps scrolling up, I dont know if this is common or if this is just me3 Ubisoft doesnt respond quickly, I have a deadline of when I want my games to be fixed. For example small bugs like texture I dont really mind maybe a few months Huge FPS glitches, I at least want them to respond within 2 weeks. See what I mean now They didnt respond for 2 god damn months.So that concludes why you should NOT get Assassins Creed IV Black Flag. Thank you all and good night, Also if you could please post how to fix these if you do know how.
