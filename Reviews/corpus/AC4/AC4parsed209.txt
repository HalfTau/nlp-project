This game is really addictive and continues on a massive story line.  Even when you finish the game you can have plenty of other things to do such as plunder level 60 man o wars, do all of theassasin contracts for the pistol swords, or complete all of the naval contracts to get the golden flintlock pistol and there are loads more. To anyone who wants a game to last really long and that is still as fun as the begininning get this game.
