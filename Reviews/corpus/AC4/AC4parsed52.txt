Just an amazing game overall. Compared to Assassins Creed 3, Assassins Creed 3 looks like hot garbage. This game is beautiful, has amazing voice acting, an amazing story, and great gameplay. The Jackdaw controls feel a little clunky at first, but once you get going and have it for a while then you can pick it up pretty easily. This is an Assassins Creed game, so it strongly focuses on the story, but honestly once you get the Jackdaw you can just say Screw that jazz! and just explore if you like. Really the only thing I have to complain about is the real life section. The part is annoying to play at first, but when the story kicks in and you do more and more while outside the Animus, then it starts to get a little more interesting.Final Rating 8.89/9
