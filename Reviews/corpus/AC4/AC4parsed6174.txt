Great game overall, a few glitches here and there that I ran into. But nothing game breaking.Overall 90/100I feel the story was a bit rushed later in the game. But dont get me wrong, it was 100 enjoyable running around blowing everyone up D.The Jackdaw was my baby from beginning of the game til the end. Only at the last few sequences 9 I think did I finally upgrade my sabers and pistols.Naval Combat was tons of fun, but at a certain point you just become a monster in sea battles, taking on 2 or even 3 ManOWars at once and being fine and some times a few of their escorts.Open world is better than previous Creed games, mechanics are the same, some a bit better, but this was my first time playing the series on PC so the controls needed getting used to press E to counter! dead wrong key doh! .Going to play Multiplayer soon, yes i played single player for 40 hours before even getting to multiplayer thats how much i enjoyed this game.Drink up me hearties yo ho!
