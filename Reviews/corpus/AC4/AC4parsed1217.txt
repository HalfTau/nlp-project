a very enjoyable and intense game that everyone should enjoy.I finished the campaign in about 2 weeks, so the main storyline isnt that hard though, it focuses more on the present goal for most of the campaign, but theres also lil flashes of the past and how edward kenwaygot here.There are tons of little nooks and crannies to explore, and the side missions have a unique prize after they end.upgrading your ship to max level is a goal everyone has and envies, I personally did not achieve a maxed ship, but when you actually do get it to max, your ship will be the most elite elite ship Youll ever see in the elite waters of the elite forseeable future.And when you get to the credits, blag flag was actually before forsaken, jesus christ!Imean, compare the graphics, i thought haythem was like....edwards lil grandpaOH spoiler alert!
