A plague, this is a plague. Sometimes I wonder if they play there games.Instead of creating a game, they just mass produced this big piece of money maker.Bad optimizationMany glitchsssssssLack of responsiveness with controlsMore god damn boring boatsDid I write bad optimization? Bad optimization also means bad overall experience.Im really sad to see Ubisoft turning into a fast mass production of crappy games with no souls. Take your time, please, all I want is to have fun, not getting frustrated over stupid games that could have been great. Buy this in a sale, really biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig sale. And Ill surely play Unity and Rogue, but in a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiggggggggggggggg sale. Is this really profitable?????????????? I dont understand anything it seems.
