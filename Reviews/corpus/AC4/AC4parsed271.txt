After uninstalling the game a couple of years ago and losing access to my registered email account, I am now ready to start the fun from the beginning again. But the hardest mission of the game is the first Logging into Ubisoft account to load the game. Insistance on utilising the rubbish Ubisoft portal is the games biggest downfall. The actual game is great though.
