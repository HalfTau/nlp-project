Having played most of the Assassins Creed games, I can safely say that this is my favorite of them all. The naval portion of the game is very immersive, to the point that Ill float around taking on groups of ships, to the point that I then spend the next 1015 minutes boarding my conquests. The on foot game play is as good, if not better, than previous installments.The story, thus far, has been compelling and exciting.
