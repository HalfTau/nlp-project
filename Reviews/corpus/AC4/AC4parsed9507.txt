I decided to delete my earlier review and write this one as I can no longer recommend this game due to Ubisoft and Uplay.First, after 56 hours of game play, my save game was lost. I did some research and found out a LOT of people have this issue. I decided to open a support ticket with Ubisoft so I logged in to their support site. I went through the Submit a question option to explain the issue. When I click submit it take me to a list of possible solutions, none of which are even close, and says if these dont fix your issue click submit. Only the submit button does nothing. I click on My Questions only to have no new questions there. I tried this three times and could not submit a question.I then went to the Ubisoft technical support forum to post about the Black Flag issue and the Submit a Question issue. I typed out my new post and tried to submit it. It tells me I have to choose a thread prefix so I choose one from their drop down box and click submit. It blanks out my thread prefix and tells me I have to choose a thread prefix. I think maybe this is a bug because I didnt have a thread prefix selected when I first submitted. I retype the entire post, choose a prefix and click submit only for the forum to blank out my thread prefix and tell me I need to choose a thread prefix.I finally had to reply to someone else complaing  thread because I could not create my own. Uplay and Ubisoft have forced me to change my review as I do not want my friends to have to go through this crap.
