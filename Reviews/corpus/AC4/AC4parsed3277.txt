Fun at first. Lots to do and see. Swashbuckling and sailing on the ocean is fun, but it gets really repetative fast. Story is kinda boring, and the missions are pretty much the same thing over and over.The ending was the worst. I didnt even realize I had beaten the game until the credits started rolling. Meh
