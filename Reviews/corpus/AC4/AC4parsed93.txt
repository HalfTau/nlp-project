About 70 of the way through and the gameplay is good. Odd funny glitch here and there. Typical of what you expect from these ports. However, if you are looking to 100 sync all memories, dont. Its broken as hell once you reach sequence 9 and you will try upwards of 1030 times restarting from the last checkpoint just to double assassinate two guys who arent next to each other during the mission for their walking or standing sequence or rope swing assassinate some captain where the rope swing is so bugged your character wont even attempt to assassinate even when timed correctly checking walkthroughs on this one I saw many comments of people saying to swing when he is going down the stairs which he has never done in my playthrough so that might be a difference in port from console vs pc. As a guy who wanted to go for 100 completion, this gets a bad rating from me just because of these unreachable milestones for a sequence.
