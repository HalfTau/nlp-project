The game is awesome but... oh well... Sometimes you play for like 7 hours and progress is gone.Also i played for 77 hours overall, returned to the game this week, but saves are gone.Ubisoft cloud save system does not work really.Not buying Unity before they fix this issue, looks like they dont care about their old custumers, no real technical support at all.
