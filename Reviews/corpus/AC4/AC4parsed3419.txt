Who doesnt love sailing a pirate ship!! And having ship wars and plundering and doing treasure hunts! Pirates and assassins. Its a good combo. This is a pretty interactive game, as are all the AC games, but more than the first few. Im yet to follow on to the latest games. Theres a lot more collections. More side quests, It kind of pushes the limits of just enough to keep the game going for longer than what the main story actually goes for, and almost too many that you get bored and dont finish the game. Puzzlers will enjoy, and anyone that loves a neat mini cinematic on the finishing combat combo blow, with blood splashing at the screen and all action movie like, its cool.
