A much needed return to form the AC franchise. Edward Kenway is still no Ezio but provides a likeable lead with depth and character far outstripping that of his lifeless grandson! The game is deep and wonderful in so many ways that it would spoil them to reveal them all here. Suffice to say this retains everything you love about the AC franchise free running, contracts, brutal combat etc, while also adding a good dose of pirates. As someone who grew up playing Pirates! the PC game, not just running around with an eye patch on, I have to say that AC4 is the best pirate game ever made. That is not a statement I take lightly. Again I dont want to extrapolate too much and spoil the fun but you owe it to yourself to play this gem! Whether you are running through havanna or engaging in multi sided fleet battles this game is a blast.If I had to make a few nitpicks it would be that the story, while good enough doesnt really carry the same weight as other games in the series, they are simply content to let Edward pirate around with the usual AC stuff in the background this can be viewed as a good or a bad thing. Secondly the graphics can be stunning at times but this was clearly designed to run on the last gen of consoles and even with PC shaders etc its age can show at times. This does however give me hope for what a next gen AC game can bring. Finally the combat, while still bloody fun, feels a little less controlled and a lot less brutal than that of AC3 with the weapon variety also lacking a little.Those nitpicks however are exactly that. I simply cannot recommend this game enough! Buy it now BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!9.5/10
