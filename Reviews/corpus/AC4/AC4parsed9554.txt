Kind of a Laura Croft meets Far Cry 3 in Stanleys Parable. But the truely fun part is the naval battles. If they dont come out with a massive online multiplayer sea battle then they are really missing the extra value that this game brings.The story line is making a good movie and that is enjoyable. Odd though that you have to walk through the story to open up areas and level up. That whole memory wall thing is just offputting and ruins my emersion from the top notch graphics.I like it, but could have waited for the sale next year in hind sight. Yet I want the Season Pass now. Torn.
