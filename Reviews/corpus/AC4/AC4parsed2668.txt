The most fun AC game to play IMO. I just love the movement/combat. It felt so much more smooth than the previous titles, and Edward gave a well needed push in a different direction for the series. Amount of grind after finishing the story is quite cool.I just wish it saved my savefile, means I probably wont play it ever again.9/10
