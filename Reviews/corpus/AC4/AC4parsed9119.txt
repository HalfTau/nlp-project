i flippin love this gameassassins creed 1 i enjoyed, i like the setting and the story even tho it was a bit DUM. AC2 was probs the best game of the series even tho the setting was better in in 1 imoAC3... absolutely dreadful, terrible game, convoluted story, poor pacing TERRIBLEEEEEEE.. awful main character. only redeeming feature? the ship battles..... which brings us to ac4... they took the best bit of AC3, the ship battles and made a pirate game. its well good, sailing and naval battles are amazing.. you go from firing cannons at a frigate to boarding it and jumping onto their deck and slaying the crewFLIPPIN AMAZIN
