I started with AC 3 and for me that was an amazing game. I later played they rest of the Ezio trilogy which i still enjoyed but not as much. Later Black Flag was annouced. Having played the naval part in AC3 i was stoked. If AC3 had thta little bit of naval mission, could i imagine what Black flag had in store. Come the release, i picked up my Collectors Edition of it. Still to this day the BEST out of the AC game after Revelations. Ac1 through Revelations was a category in its own. Which was great. I mean who wouldnt like to parkour around Italy?Now to point out, Black Flag on pc still has its bugs whihc are annoying. Frame Drops, Bad optimization, no mod support no surprise. Otherwise amazing game. THIS is innovation, adding ship battles. Combat, is too stale. Feels like another batman game. The control mechanics. THIS is what bugs me the most. I want to do something and he does the complete opposite. In my opinion, i would like to have more freedom. Be able to crouch, slow walk, do combos between weapons shut up hand to blade, blade to sword etc etc. A little bit of difficulty. Something to spice things up.Overall, Black Flag is an amazing game. Enjoyable not to be taken seriously. Enjoy and have fun.
