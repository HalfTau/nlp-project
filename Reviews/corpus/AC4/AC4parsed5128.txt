One of the best AC games ever. Debating wheter it beats Assassins creed 2. While the story isnt fantastic, I really dont think any of the AC games have amazing stories. So technically this one has one of the best stories in the AC franchise. But what really makes this game amazing is the gameplay. Its so fun just to sail around the ocean and murder other ships!  What makes it better is the fact you must upgrade your ship to defeat the harder ones which kept me entertained for a very long while. Theres so much to do in this game too! You can find treasure chests, collect mayan artifacts, murder people, blow up ships, upgrade your fleet, craft different upgrades and outfits, and play those weird minigames that were in AC 3 Im pretty sure noone does that though. Okay story, much replay, very open world, so entertainment, wow.
