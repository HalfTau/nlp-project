I might be a bit late to the party, but I recently picked this up on sale. I have not been this immersed in a single player video game for a while. Assassins Creed Black Flag is tons of fun, whether its the excellent story or wonderful side activities. If I was not bombing the heck out of British war ships, Id be on my row boat spearing killer whales, or salvaging treasure from underwater shipwrecks. 30 hours of game play in 5 days, and it was all worth it.I did not have any issues with the Steam  UPlay link like other users. Everything worked flawlessly. I have 0 complaints about this game.I highly recommend you give Black Flag a shot.
