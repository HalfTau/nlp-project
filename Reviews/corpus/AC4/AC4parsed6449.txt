All I can say about this game is meh, it is without a doubt the most meh AC game I have played.CAUTION! SPOILER ALERT!I will say that the graphics are absolutely beautiful, and this game has the best textures I have ever seen in aTripleA release title I have played, to this day. However, the big thing that I loved the AC series for was the story. And in my opinion, the story fell flat. I just didnt find the storyline compelling, and I just didnt want to keep playing it. I honestly think that the series should have ended at AC3. They could have completely done this game without the whole Assassin vs. Templar war, and in this game, it almost felt like a gimmick thrown in at the last second. Another thing that I liked about the AC story was the presentday storyline, but in this game I cant help but ask why the Assassins even care about the templars anymore. Considering that in the previous games the whole point of the presentday story was to prevent the end of the world, I dont know what the point was of even making this yet another sequel even though the end of the world was prevented in the first game by Desmond sacrificing himself. Also, the ending of the presentday story was dreadfully unsatisfying, forcing yet another sequel.Overall 6/10  just meh, dont by at full price.
