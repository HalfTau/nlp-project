A triumph!Ill be honest and say that Im basically an AC fanboy  before playing Black Flag I played AC, AC II, Brotherhood, Revelations and AC III. Hands down AC IV is the best edition to the series yet. The sheer amount of content here is incredible  comparing favorably to open world games like Grand Theft Auto or Prototype. The core game is still the same  you play a cloaked assassin who systematically eliminates a series of Templar targets  so AC veterans will find much here thats familiar. However, theyll also get naval battles and exploration, underwater exploration, improved hunting and a crafting and a trading system that actually makes sense. I also found the combat system to be much improved over the games predecessors.Newcomers looking for a fun actionadventure game have come to the right place. The story break after AC III also means they wont really be missing anything for not having played the previous games in the series. However, newcomers be warned, what this game is not is a stealth game  for that you should try Styx or the classic Thief games. In AC IV you can proudly play as if youre the main character in a Schwarzenegger movie and almost never pay a price for it.The game is not perfect the controls can be a bit wonky at times and the game suffers from occasional clipping and bugs, such as when your ship disappears. Still, this game is one thats worth picking up for both AC veterans and newcomers!
