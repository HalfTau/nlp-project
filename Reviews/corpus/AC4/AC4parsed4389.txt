Everybodys already said it, but it bears repeating  the boat stuff in AC Black Flag is immensely fun.The series gets a lot of flak for stagnation and yearly installments, but you can tell this one was made by people who really wanted to make something new and exciting. Sailing the seas, attacking forts and boarding other ships, finding buried treasure, and listening to your crew sing various shanties as the rising sun burns fog off the waters surface is something thats actually pretty unique in video games.Any complaints I could have about Black Flag are mostly related to some legacy AC stuff. Theres about two dozen too many tailing or eavesdropping missions and the controls are slightly improved but still randomly has a bit of that trademark series stiffness. Thankfully, everything involving being a salty sea dog out for the next big score looks, plays, and controls wonderfully.Strongly recommended. Go plunder some booty and then play this game.
