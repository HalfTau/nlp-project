One of the best pirate games ever hands down.Really sets the mood for some lootin and scallywaggin, mateys!I found the storyline engaging and after thats finished theres stilla lot of adventure to be found.This was my first Assasins Creed game, I cant give any feedback on that.If you buy this on a sale you will never regret it.
