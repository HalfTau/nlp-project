Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is the best Assassins Creed since II. Many of the superfluous gadgets and tools have been stripped away, giving the game a refreshing back to basics feel. The same is true of the labyrinthine story of the previous titles, which is largely ignored through most of Black Flag. The ship combat is a blast. Theres tons to explore in the open world, and the freerunning gameplay makes navigating these locations easy and fun. So if you like openworld exploration, pirates, and Assassins Creed gameplay, then this is the title for you.
