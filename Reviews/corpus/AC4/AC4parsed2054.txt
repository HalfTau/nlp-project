After playing about 20 hours of Black Flag and finishing the game... all I have to say is I want to play more. The story line in this game is great, and I want spoil anything but the story that you take journey in as Edward is very good, the story you take on outside of Edward, seems like it is a little lack luster but that is why its a series. Id persume that the rest of the series plans on slowly capturing the world outside of the animus.I heard lots of things about the graphics of this game being to much for others PCs. Well I have a standard gaming PC, its fairly decent. I was a little worried when picking up this game but I have been able to run the whole thing on high graphics with no issues whatsoever.If I was to say anything bad about this game, itd be the weapons... If I am not mistaken there may have been a few more in A3 and Brotherhood but I think the gameplay makes up for it. The outfits in this game are nice as well, I love the hoody assassin look but sometimes its good to take a few steps away from that and they have the options to do that.I have lots more good to say about this game, but I really dont feel like leaving a 2 page review and I dont think anyone wants to read it haha.But I give this game...7/10 on gameplay mechanics9/10 on graphics3/10 on multiplayer no ones online not their fault9/10 on storymodeOverall I would give this game a 8/10. If I could play AC Online and expect a good amount of people and good game modes without having to buy the new release each year thatd be great. I really think Ubisoft should develop some sort of MMO off the AC world, with pirating and other MISC stuff. but thats irrevelant.Good game would recommend, will continue playing even after story mode.
