Wont recommend. Why? Its not open world, at least it doesnt feel that way. It feels very, VERY railroaded along the missions. Controls are horrible. Sprint is the same as climb and almost everything else is on E. My keyboard has 104 buttons, my mouse has 17. Thank you for not letting me use them. The controls are horrible. It doesnt feel like the game or the guy I play does what I tell it to but more like the game offering me a set of alternatives and me choosing one. Save / Reload is horibble. The game saves when it feels like it, not when I want to. I cant go back to earler saves, either. And when you reload, you DONT come back to exactly when it saved. Case in point If you hire s, they are gone when you reload, along with the money you originally spent on them. What gives? For an assissin game, youre not allowed to sneak much. OK, you can hide in specific spots, but thats it? Id like a bigger ship eventually.
