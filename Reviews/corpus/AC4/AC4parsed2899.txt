Ahoy mates! This game is an endless open world RPG with pirate ships. If you liked the ship playing aspect from AC3 or never played that and just want to play a game focused on being a pirate, then this game truly capitalized on those aspects. Sailing the seas in search of undiscovered territory/treasure, completing assassin / main / side quests, going against the templars, parkour style moves, and problem solving through areas. Best thing about being the captain of the Jack Daw? Being able to capture ships to be a part of your fleet, and the awesome crew that sings for you if you want! Better than the radio since there werent any. This is a great addition to the AC games, and I highly recommend it.
