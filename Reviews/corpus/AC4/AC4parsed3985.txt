Personally I think Black Flag is the best Assassins Creed game ever. Decent amount of enemies, great, great ship battles, some challenging stuff and so much to discover. Multiple nice cities and I love pirates.If you enjoyed the nature stuff and ships in AC 3, youll love Black Flat. a variety of weapons well done ship battles against multiple ships, gigantic ships and forts sometimes huge numbers of enemies at the same time a huge variety of activites, with diving and caves and stuff I love the songs they sing during ship travels a few stealth missions, I hate those combat is still to easy
