Worst game in the series, because lack of parkour elements bad controls better than in Unity, though ships boring plot unbalanced combat especially, the Ultimate CounterAttack useless collectibles a lot of pirats, instead of assassins terrible protagonist strongly reminds Far Cry 3 ships.Id recommend any of the previous ones or standalone DLC Freedom Cry.
