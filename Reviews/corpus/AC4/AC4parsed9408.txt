The last Assassins Creed I truly enjoyed until now was Brotherhood. It was fun, it was in Rome and the AC story had not been dragged on for an eternity. Now the Desmond is dead and his autopsy is there for us to watch, AC Black Flag adds a lot of life to this never ending series. I loved the sailing missions from ACIII and I was sad when they were finishded. I guess Ubisoft loved those missions too, because Black Flag is all about sailing! Between story missions I spent hours pirating and sailing the seas. The money you make has an actual use unlike brotherhood or III, that is to upgrade the Jackdaw. The story was great and the gameplay was awesome. Black Flag took some pointers from Far Cry 3. Inorder to carry four pistols you must first hunt and skin a bunch of animals. These animals range from wild pigs to humpback whales.Black Flag truly understands that in a sandbox game the player should get lost in the world that has been created.EDIT One negative thing I just noticed is the Time Saver DLC. WHAT?! Thats just ridiculous. Pay us money to play the game for you, yeah right. The the beautiful thing about AC Black Flag is the exploring of the world and finding that hidden treasure. Not to have the game developers point it out and say here you go. If you use the time saver dlc, shame on you. But, then again it is your money, waste it how you will.EDIT 2 This game still holds up as the best AC game.
