Who knew that all assasins creed needed was ship combat to make me bother with their games again.CONS FIRSTYes its a console port may the developers burn in hell for being so lazyControls are for pads and are prediction based so they can be horrendous at times, because it thinks you want to hump or climb every single thing you bump into.Fighting is the standars slash this guy then auto block that guy, blah blah blah, I just friggin shoot everyone cause its faster.The diving missions are so clunky and stupid, and the fleet missions battles is the laziest set up I have ever seen, why did they even bother with those terribly animated fleet battles?The game does randomly crash, and you will need to spend some time getting the graphics just right or you will be getting less than 30fps all the time.PROSNow for the reasons to get the game.The sneaking is awesome and I feel that elation and satisfaction when I RAM MY FRIGGIN SWORD IN TO A MANS BACK, and pull him into the bushes without his friends knowing.The story is interesting enough that I dont auto skip it.And the sailing...... IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!I instantly was brought back to the glory days of Sid Meyer Pirates, and I spend hours doing nothing but sailing around fighting everything or just watching the ship roll in the waves.If the game goes on sale just get it, the sailing more than makes for the other crap, and its really engaging in those moments when your not screaming at it for making you climb a wall when your actually trying to chase someone.
