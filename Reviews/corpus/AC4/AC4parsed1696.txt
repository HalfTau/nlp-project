I have played this game little while now and this is what i can say about the game.In my opinion the best assassins creed game in the serie. A couple of years old but it still checks out with great grafics and probably the best story and gameplay.I love that you can acually purchase a pirate costume in the Uplay store that was a big attraction for me. Realistic also with long reloadtime which makes you have more than 1 gun, badass!!Downsides! The first downside is the in combat animations walking around. Looks quite awkward and doesnt feel as smooth as Assassin s Creed Syndicate but its a couple of years old so i forgive.The biggest issue Ive spotted so far, is the fact that its Ubisoft. The game isnt super buggy as other ubisoft games but the server connection in kinda very sht.But i would still recommend this game even if the on foot combat is wanky af and the server sucks its still being a pirate owning a ship thats dank af c
