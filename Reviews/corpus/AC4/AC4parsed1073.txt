I have had this game on ps4, xbox 360 and now pc but I have never gotten bored of it. This is by far the best assassins creed game to date.Pros Great graphics, a very compelling story,  ships, pirates, soundtrack to last the ages, the ship battles are perfect and a large open map to explore with your pirate ship.Cons There are a lot of tailing missions following some NPC that doesnt matter to me for 20 minutes,  too many characters that I dont give a  damn about and sometimes the ship battles repeat which wouldnt be too bad if there were a few more objectives like get to the bottom deck and blow the ship from the inside after escaping with your crew behind you. Or entering the captains cabin and taking some money.
