Loved the story! It is probably the most unique AC game to date just because you can captain a ship and do as you please in the caribbean. The story had a bunch of twists that I couldnt anticipate. I wont expose any spoilers but expect to grow with the protagonist as we did with Ezio Auditore. Its that comingofage from boy into man.10/10  One of the best AC games to date!
