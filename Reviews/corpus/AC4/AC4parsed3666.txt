Let me put this out there right now.THIS GAME WILL FREEZE AND CRASH.IT WILL HAVE LAG.You can resolve the lag by running it in compatibility with XP service pack 2. mostly. Itll still be there sometimes.BUT IT WILL FREEZE AND CRASH... and sometimes crash your PC.All of that out of the way it is a really fun game and an exciting twist on the tired and trite assassins creed franchise. Id recommend buying it for a console. I did that originally, but had no internet for it, so bought it for PC... regret. Since the port ot PC was super lazy and is amazingly bugy.
