Best of the Assassins Creed series. Sailing the high seas and blowing the shiny treasuredout of everyone is great. If you like any other AC then this is fantastic. Beautiful environments and a fairly interesting well told story make this playable for hours. Having said that it does end rather abruptly and I left feeling like there should have been a better ending. That aside, Pirates is a lungful of fresh sea air.
