First and best AC game for me. Played the second one and saw other gameplays of other ACs but i think this one is the most fun since the naval battle and experience of it is very unique. Story wise, awesome. I want to be a pirate now xDFinished the game, now I feel empty. Well, time to buy freedom cry!yargh me matey. Me beards like this game yargh...
