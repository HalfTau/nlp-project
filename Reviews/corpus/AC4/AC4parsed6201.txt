Cant even believe this is a Assassins Creed game. It really stands out from the other titles.If you liked the naval combat from AC 3, which was pretty much the only good thing on that game, AC 4 is a nobrainer. Youll love it. Theres plenty to be done, you will scarcely get bored, activities arent as repetitive as they used to be, since you can vary from hunting animals in the jungles, whalehunting in the sea, collecting all those really usefull upgrades to your ship, using those upgrades to complete naval contracts, taking a break on Nassau, drinking some rum, killing someone in a assassin contract, doing one of those delicious main quests the plot of which isnt half as bad as your avarage Assassins Creed game, exploring around, having a hard time defeating legendary ships and, hell, even doing those boringtailing missions every once in a while. You name it, theres plenty to be done in the game. Some good activities, some bad, a few great, even.No need to talk about other aspects of gameplay, such as controls. It plays just like AC 3. Actualy, you might say Black Flag is Assassins Creed 3 done right More sailing, less tailing. Graphics are good enough for a immersive experience. Bugs are rare, but still present. I saw my ship sink to the bottom of the sea and come back in a few seconds once or twice, but nothing gamebreaking, dont worry.For all the flaws the series has, this one might be the best game so far. Pick it up, if you can stomach the ancient aliens and assassins versus templars t they shove up yourevery time you think youll see some historical accuracy. Dont expect a good game, expect a good Assassins Creed game, if you catch my drift.All in all, its a great game, and thats saying a lot about an Assassins Creed game.Gameplay  7/10Soundtrack  8/10Graphics  8/10Content  7/10Challenge Level  0/10Replayability  0/10
