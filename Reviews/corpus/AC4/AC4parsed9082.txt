Purrrtty God tier. It features an ACTUALLY INTERESTING notpast story line in which you play as a game researcher or somefor Abstergo Entertainment. One can imagine how that works. Its both interesting for someone who has never played an assassins creed game before, and long time veterans. Only bugs Ive come across are lip synching during cutscene issues, and overall framerate during that. Also the framerate does drop at random times, mostly during rain storms on land. Naval Combat is unf and regular combat is regular. As in its still the same old mash buttons until you win and then occasionally have to press another button. 8/10? I think so.
