This game is incredible inovative and creative compared to its predecessors. I played them all and I have to say that Black Flag is a huge improvement in the AC series. Its awfully addicting and there is so much to explore and collect. Its a very clever mix of creativ breath taking content and solid repeating gameplay like seizing other ships, which can be fun for hours. The graphics are still amazing now in 2016 too.All in all I really have nothing to complain about, I had zero problems with Uplay and only a few minor bugs fell threw the  floor once and some quest people were missing sometimes, but nothing which coudlnt be fixed easily with a reload or a quick travelI totally recomend playing this game!
