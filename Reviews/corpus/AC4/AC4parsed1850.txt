THIS GAME IS AMAZING I SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN THISEARLIER ! PLAYED IT LIKE 3 TIMES AND STILL FELT LIKE PLAYING IT AGAIN !Storyline is amazing and the combat is VERY fun but i would not say challenging.... There are alot of customizations which is fantastic and alsothe ship combat is fun and stuff but i would not say realistic IMO like if you fire cannon balls near the captain of an enemy ship wouldnt he atleas flinch or panic or something instead of him still casually sailing his boat...Anyways this game is still great and  i love every aspect of it ! GET IT NOWWWWWW !
