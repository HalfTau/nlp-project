This game is a refreshing change of pace from the most recent entries in the Assassins Creed franchise. I highly recommend this game if you like Assassins Creed as a whole, if you love fast paced pirate ship action, and a rathher intriguing plot. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU DO NOT LIKE ACTION, PIRATES, OR ASSASSINS.
