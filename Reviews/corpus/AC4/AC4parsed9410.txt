I loved this game, and personally regard it as the crown achievement in the Assassins Creed franchise. While Ezio used to be my favourite assassin to play, Edward has taken it to a whole new level with his being a pirate at the same time as being an Assassin.The story is fantastic, the characters are enjoyable and personally, I think they are much more memorable than the characters we met in Assassins Creed III and the scenery is just stunning. I have never enjoyed a game as much as Ive enjoyed Black Flag, and I highly recommend it to ANYONE.
