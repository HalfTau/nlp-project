This is another game broken by the way it puts players on rails in an otherwise open world. There are so many stupid and boring side quests, that are totally unrelated to the story itself, that I never got into the mood of playing all the way through it.Besides the fun and well delivered pirates setting, there is a totally unrelated secondary storyline forced upon the player, that totally breaks the sense if immersion and suspension of disbelief of the main story line.Between the storys chapters you get these silly science fiction like flashbacks of a different reality taking place in modern time  not in the 17th century pirate world, which only interrupt the experience of playing. There is absolutely no added value to these intermssions at all, just stupid, long cutscenes that try to come up with some clever explanation of why you are a pirate in the game.Who cares why Im a pirate! Im a pirate because I say so, and nobody needs to explain my own motivations to myself. Arrrrrgh!The real bummer is that this modern world storyline keep popping back up in between the 17th century story line, in the form of some bright colored geometric shapes that need to be captured its a sort of mini game. This is independent of the actual pirating or the progress of the story itself, you simply have to collect these stupid bricks all the time, instead of simply being a freaking pirate...Please just make a super open and responsive pirate game and let me do role playing myself. Trust me, my imagination is way more creative than yours, mister developer.
