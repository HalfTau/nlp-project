This might be the best assassins creed game, or it is the best one so far. I love the sailing feature and the good work they have done with it. A big part of this assassins creed game is sailing the ship but as always the fun of running, climbing and fighting is still there. I love this game and the idea of the map, open sea with islands freely explored. The world is beautifuly done, awesome work! I strongly recommend this game to old assassins creed lovers aswell as to new ac players.
