Quite disappointing start so far... the Keyoard and mouse is not working at all. Tried what ever internet could provide to disable other controller devices, delete AssasinCreed.ini file, edit it with keyboardMouse2 and so on... but nothing worked so far, seem like Ive bought something which was suppose to be tried for free from some torrent... hate it when you pay for something and it doesnt work... long live cracked games, atleast you dont feel the pain if they are ...
