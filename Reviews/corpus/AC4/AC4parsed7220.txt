As of right now, this moment. This is my favorite game. I am on my second playthrough as my first version was...ahem different. This game is a masterpiece, easily the best in the AC series. Who would have known in AC1 one that Altairs climbing, parkour, and wrist knives would eventually evolve into the ULTIMATE pirate game.. Ive always wanted to be a pirate, and this game lets me live out that fantasy. I want more pirate adventures like this!  On my facebook I said this was my 2013 Game of the Year. I am now going to say its one of the best games Ive ever played. 10/10.
