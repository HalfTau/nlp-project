The Best Assassins Creed Yet!There is really nothing bad to say about this game, it does have a few things that dont quite make sense. For example, when you board an enemy ship while in combat with other ships all the other ships just stop shooting at you until the boarding is over and youre back on your own ship. Not that im complaining it ends up working for the better. Its just that, and a few similiar things like that dont quite add up. All that said its time for the actual reviewGameplay is top notch, every second is amazing. From sword play to sneak  assasination. Then on to sailing the ocean blue with sea shanties carrying in the wind above your crew and the spray of the waves. Every texture in just the right place. It  is really quite an amazing game. Story Is alright, it doesnt have me as much as the gameplay. What I mean is that a good story keeps you interested in what will happen next, but I find myself having too much fun plundering and upgrading my ship, while training in the streets with soldiers to get my timing right with countering and breaking defence. What Im getting at is the story doesnt quite have the hook big enough to draw you back into it. Allnall though, Black Flag is amazing and nothing short of awesome, or it could even be something in between.A note worth noting, This game uses UPlay, I myself havnt had any problems with UPlay besides the fact that it is annoying. But you cant have a great game like this without a few snags.
