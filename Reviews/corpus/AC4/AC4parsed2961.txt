I apologize for the little bit of a rant coming up. So the main reason I cant recommend this game is because it isnt what it should have been. I wanted an Assassins Creed game, not a boat simulator point and click. It wasnt the worst game to play, but it did have a lot of flaws. The boring exploration of the ocean, the lessinteresting mapping of the towns and cities, and a main character that was such a jackthat I couldnt enjoy playing as him at all. In the end, I guess it wasnt so bad that I want a refund, but it isnt at all what I wanted it to be, and thats why I cant recommend it.
