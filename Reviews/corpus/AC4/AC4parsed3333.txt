well this type of assassins creed game sure is fun!!...missions might get a bit repetitive but ubisoft introduced the naval combat which is very fun...as soon as you get the ship you can go anywhere you can altough there are some locations which cant be entered unless you progress with the main mission...the story is great it makes you feel like a pirate captain and an assassin at the same time...overall, the game is great, the mission gets repetitive sometime but you get a ship and could battle other ships and become a ing pirate so its worth it!!!
