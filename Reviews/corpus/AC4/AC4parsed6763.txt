Without a doubt, the best Assassins Creed yet, the primary reason being it is barely Assassins Creed at all. The naval combat is unlike anything any other game has done before, and the story and voiceover work are exactly what one would expect from a AAA developer like Ubisoft. Graphics glitches and bugs still persist, but in a game this huge, they are forgiveable. A great entry into the series and also a great entry point for AC newbies.
