The possibilities in this game are absolutely wonderful.. if you have no problems at all. I had to turn off every spesial feature in the graphics and turn down the resolution to the absolute minimum, and it still lags as hell. That is just my computer though.I cant connect to Ubisofts server I waited for 45 minutes and 32 seconds, which makes it impossible to progress further in the game after inspecting Kenways fleet. Also, you can only save by checkpoints and you have to start at the very beginning of the mission if you have to quit. Any form of mod is also impossible. These parts would be, in my opinion, much more enjoyable if it was more like Skyrim or Fallout, where you save your games manually and the mods expand the gameinfinitely.The idea of this game is fantastic if you love the Caribbean Pirates, and its amazing that they try make a game based on that, but the technicalis just horrible.
