Great game, however i found the abstergo flashes/missions very distracting from the feeling of the game and was always quite distracting when they occured. the gameplay was great though and it looks amazing aswell as being exceptionally fun to play. I do hope they use this to create a free roam pirate game outside of the assasins creed universe. other than that no real downsides just exceptionally fun and entertaining to play. and a mandatory ARRR IM A PIRATE !
