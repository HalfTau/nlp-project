Like all Assassins Creed games, i love the begining...the enviroment, off exploring 15 / 17th century setting....then POW! all of a sudden im tossed into some futuristic time...WTF!? oh, then you return to your scheduled program.....the one and only reason i will not buy any of the AC games....i thought Black Flag would be different and its not.....waste of money for me.
