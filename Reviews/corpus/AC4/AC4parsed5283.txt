This is a really fun game, the graphic is also amazing! I love how you can hold two daggers/swords instead of one and the way of countering and being able to break their defence/way of blocking. I love to sail in this game because its cool and easy to do. I highly recommend that you buy this if you have tried any of the other ac games. WELL DONE!
