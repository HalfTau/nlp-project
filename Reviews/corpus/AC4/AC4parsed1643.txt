Easy the best of the Assassins Creed franchise, and that is saying a lot, although some of the series is, to be kind, bad. You really get the sense of being a pirate, every mans dream, and it somewhat historically accurate. I loved seeing this old carribean towns when they were first starting, for example Jamacia with its surronding jungles and flauna and animals. Walking amound the ruins of the earthquake. Small towns that of course are now huge. Its all great from a historic standpoint alone. I also had fun just running around pushing people in the water. The ship battles are great, and yes although you are a bit of a superman, the fights are still fun. One of the most fun games I played in years. I highly recommend.
