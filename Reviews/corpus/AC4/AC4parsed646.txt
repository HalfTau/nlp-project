Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is the indirect prequel of Assassins Creed III. You play as a Caribbean Pirate who sought to have a wealthy life.Very rich. You have plenty of side missions to complete, treasures to hunt, islands to explore, enemy ships to siege, a fleet to command, forts to take over, and collectibles to collect. Not good. I played this on a controller. Most of the time, your character would do something unnecessary like vaulting over objects when you least expect it. The only wellprogrammed controls is when comandeering your ship. I didnt have enough juice to maximize the settings but its still beautiful on lownormal. I had three crashes but it doesnt seem to be a problem for other computers.I would recommend this game to those people who love being challenged to complete the game with 100 completion.
