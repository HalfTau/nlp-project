This game blew my mind! I played AC, AC2, and AC3, and it seems that AC4 has taken the best from all of them. The combat never got repetitive, all the annoying skinning quality is gone, and the story is very fast paced and entertaining! It took me 62 hours to play through the story, but Im a little OCD about doing all the miniquests in the cities and collecting all the little things. As it stands now, I own all the forts I love taking forts and wish I could take them all again and Im 100 synced with every charted island. This was also the first AC game that made it clear there were objectives outside the Animus. Plus, on top of all that... pirates! I give it 9/10. Would be a 10, but there are still quite a few environmental bugs that stop Edward Kenway in his tracks. 100 guards to kill, no problem a six inch step up a rock, my demise!
