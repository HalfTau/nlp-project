Best one yet perhaps?Ill start with the bad, the combat system has been tweaked and is now more annoying than ever. Very often youll get attacked during a counter and you cant do anything about it smoke bombs solve though!.But, the game itself is brilliant. Theres so much to do and i guarantee youll end up just sailing round destroying/boarding ships for 90 of the time...
