I do love the Assassins Creed franchise, and I am indeed looking forward to Unity, but my problem lies with Ubisoft. They treat PC gamers like absolute dirt. Im not going to lie, their recent games do look beautiful, bar WatchDogs which was quite obviously not the same as we saw in the gameplay video back in E3.My problem is optimisation. Ubisoft just have no idea how to get it right, you need a super computer to try and run everything maxed out. And may I say, there are huge changes in visuals between Low setting and Max settings, but the frame rate is still low for both of them. I dont know if Ubisoft will ever bring out a game that has at least been attempted to have been optimised, but with every game they bring out, it looks less and less likely.
