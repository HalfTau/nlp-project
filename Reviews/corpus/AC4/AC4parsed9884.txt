Awesome. Assassins Creed is one of my favorite game series. Even after completing the main story, there is tons to do. Assassin contracts, Naval Contracts, Templer hunters, Upgrading the Jackdaw and a few other things. A lot of people find Assassins Creed to be repetitive gameplay and I agree, to an extent, but I think Ubisoft did a great job trying to avoid that with AC4. If you are a fan of the series or even mildly interested, get this game. You wont regret it.
