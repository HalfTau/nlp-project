Franchse fatigue is a word thats often used when speaking about Assassins Creed because Ubisoft releases one every year. I got hit by it pretty early, in the middle of AC2 and never finished another AC past that one. I love the gameplay in AC but apart from the main missions, most of the things that can be done are repetitive tasks that always end up feeling like a grind and Ive got a high tolerance for repetitive gaming tasks but they have to be at least a little fun. Another criticism is that AC never provided any opportunities to create your own fun like you would expect out of an open world so if you dont like the activities it offers, theres nothing else to do.AC4 has all of these issues, but for some reason its still a pretty good game. I did not get hooked right away but once I got far enought to be able to freely roam the open world with the ship, it became a pretty amazing experience that no other game has ever done. The naval battles are simply amazing.  It feels more like the ultimate pirate simulator than an AC game. Its something that has to be experienced. I finished the main story but I am compelled to continue playing because there is still a crap load of fun to be had with the open world piracy. I just wish they had made the naval warfare part of the multiplayer.
