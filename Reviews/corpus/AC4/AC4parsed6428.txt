 Rating Brilliant, 9/10. Review So, it starts off one of those regular Assassins Creed games. Introducing the characters and such...Then you get into the pirate stuff. OH MY GOD. Its amazing. The controls feel nice, the game looks good,the voice acting is amazing. Yes, there is the annoying modern daywhich can take away from the game,but most of that is brief and easy.
