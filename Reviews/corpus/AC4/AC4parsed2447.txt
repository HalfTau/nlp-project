Ok take it from the Assassins Creed franchise.. this is how you make an epic game, you take assassins, put them in the world of the TV show Black Sails toss them on a pirate ship, and get Jax from Sons of Anarchy to do your voiceovers.. This is the BEST of all of the Assassins Creed Games hands down the best one to date. This is a must have game if you are a man, like killing things, love pirates, love sea battles, love trading your plunder, or if you have any taste at all this is the game..10/10 Perfect  Game
