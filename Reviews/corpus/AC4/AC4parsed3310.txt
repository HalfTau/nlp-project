A MASERPIECE!One of the best pirate games out there with stunning graphics, an interesting story, some memorable characters and especially, the naval combat system is awesome. Edward Kenways badassness has led me to fall in love with this game and made me play other AC series as well. Personally I dont like collectibles put ingame just to extend the playtime, but Ive put my best effort to collect every single thing in this game. Ive spent hours and hours completing achievements and accomplished a 100 synchronization which I normally dont do.If only this was not developed by Ubisoft. you Ubisoft.Give me back my 100 sync save file.
