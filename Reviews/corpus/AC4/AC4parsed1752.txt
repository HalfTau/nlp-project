I shouldve pirated this game because this game made me feel so piraty I want to pirate everything. Yarr! My first assassins creed game but tbh the stealth and combat kinda sucks Way too easy. Ship battles are pretty fun though. Im using GTX 770 and aye captain this sometimes drops fps harder than I drop my cannonballs.Also first time Ive ever fear sharks in a game. THEY CAN SEE YOU FROM AFAR7/10 overall
