Great game! I wish I was able to play it whenever I wanted but.... UPlay. Problems every other day with log in. I recommend the game but the sad part is that you can never avoid Uplay of titles from Ubisoft. This game has a magnificent open world full of details and things to do. Story is interesting and the game has great gameplay Sword fights, stealth.Game 8/10.Game  Uplay 4/10
