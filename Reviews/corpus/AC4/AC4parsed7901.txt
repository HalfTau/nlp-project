I am not a fan of the Assassins Creed series. I played the first one long enough to get bored of running around and killing people, and didnt bother to play Assassins Creed 2, 3, or Brotherhood. That being said, I saw AC4 on sale for 30 and figured I might as well give the game another shot.I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed. The story while predictable is engaging. The ship combat is fantastically done and really serves to break up the monotony of onfoot running/killing/etc. The parkour running is just as smooth as ever and the completionist out there will have tons of collectibles to gather. The levels are lush however, they do all seem to feel almost exactly the same. Combat is more difficult than ever with multiple enemies being able to attack you, and the timing window for parries is much tighter. And when you do pull off a good parry, be prepared for some awesome assassination animationsSo whats bad? The PC version is pretty poorly optimized. Even with a fairly powerful rig, I would get pretty low 2030ish fps in areas with lots of foliage. In addition, PC PLAYERS SHOULD BE WARNED THAT THERE IS A SAVE BUG. I lost an 8hour session because there are apparently times when the game will stop saving EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS IT IS SAVING. The best way to circumvent this is to quit to the main menu every couple of hours and reload your game to make sure you havent lost any progress. PLEASE do not ignore this warning like I did when I bought it, because it is a very real issue that isnt that uncommon. Also, like I said before, the tropical island feel of every zone will start to bore you after a while.All that being said, this IS a good game. If you can get it on some sort of sale, grab it and give it a go. You wont be disappointed.
