After a playthrough I can say that my only complaint with this game is that the end of it sneaks up on you. I felt it necessary to collect every peice of information relating to the story of abstergo and the assassins. While the sans simulation parts ran a little dry at times, Edwards engrossing life proved to be a magnificient foil to them. Gameplay hasnt changed much through the AC series, which is a plus when not mentioning the horrible tailing missions. Online play is still a challenge and matchmaking is a little slow, but with a vast ocean to conquer there will always be a use for downtime.Recommended completely.
