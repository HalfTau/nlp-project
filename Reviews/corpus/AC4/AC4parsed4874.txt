PROs  My favorite in the series, any fan of AC titles or pirate themed games will love this one. Fast  fun action combat  stealth tactics with all the parkour trimmings, as in any of the AC games prior to Black Flag. Battle enemy crews on the high seas through boarding in naval combat while steering clear of violent, but awesome storms and rogue waves that will quickly send you into the deep watery abyss if your not careful. Hunt animals for hides and rescources for crafting your upgraded gear and even dive for sunken treasure or dig it up with aquired maps. Beautiful graphics, fun Multiplayer action with friends and one helluva story that sets the stage for this grand adventure in the Carribean. Highly recommended!CONs  Requires Ufail, er I mean Uplay.... Uplay Uplay Requires HighEnd pc to enjoy smooth gameplay without audio issues during cutscenes. Oh and requires Uplay
