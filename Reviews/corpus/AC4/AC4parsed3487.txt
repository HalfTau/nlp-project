I played the first Assassins Creed, where the fighting was a bit too easy and the story a bit boring sometimes. The second one, was a bit better, but I didnt play it for long, because it was too similar to the first one.Now to this one I think its the best Assassins Creed.The story is awesome, I always liked to hear the Characters talking, when I eavesdroped on my enemies or when film sequences were shown. In most games these sequences tend to get on my nerves, because they are simply not good. But in this game I always enjoyed watching them. The game always keeps you busy and lets you sink in into the pirates world. Sidequesting and doing stuff happend naturally just for the fun, how it is supposed to be, and then you get some rewards as well.Anyhow I recommend this game strongly. Its one of the best I played in my life and I played a lot of games.
