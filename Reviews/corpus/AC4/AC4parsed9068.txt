By far the best AC game to date imho, with a breathtaking scale of the West Indies Edward Kenway takes you on a unbelieable ride as a pirate in every since of the word. With spot on voice acting and a map as far as the eye can see this game is pure fun for anyone riding the fence about this game. Worth your time and money a purchase you would soon not regret
