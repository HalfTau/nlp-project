This is the most piratey pirate game ever! This is a game where my character risked life and limb to get a shanty for my crew to sing.Sure, I know what youre going to say This guy has over 1500 hours playing this game! Whaaat?Accidentally left it on when I was away for...a while. Often left it minimized at the bottom of my screen while otherwise occupied. But many of those hours were spent on the high seas, taking down evil empire flunkies from England and Spain. Or striding though towns looking for mischief and loot. Or skulking though a caribbean jungle looking for Mayan treasure and trying not to get eaten by panthers and alligators. Or losing 1000 reales playing checkers AAAAAUUUGH!My favorite thing about this game is the games combined elements. There are so many different things to do! When you get bored with one part you have many others to switch to.
