One of the better recent Assassins games, even if it is a little bit light on the assassin side of things. a fantastic pirate game cruising around the ocean in your ship, starting fights, capturing ships and building your crew up. honestly dont remember the story much, but the explration was above average for a ubisoft game, and in an interesting setting.
