How else can I say this? Note that my review is based on what i experience on the laptop i play this onPros Open World to explore Awesome Graphics LOOT BEING A PIRATE Boarding ships The long winded and amazing storyline. Online collaboration with Royal Convoys and certain chests. Amazing graphics and framerate even at semilow settings Awesome ship upgrades Major DLCs are a must Freedom Cry and AvelineCons During the first time start up, there may be a problem with logging on to the ubisoft servers which may crash the game. In this case, the game has installed incorrectly and must be uninstalled and redownloaded Happened to me. Smoke when you constantly fire the ships cannons at one place and never move cant see  Ubisoft potato serversThat pretty much sums up the game.Played on Asus N550JK. Intel i7 4700HQ 2.40GHz. 8 GB RAM. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 850m.
