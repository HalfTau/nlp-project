If youre looking at this game and thinking about buying it? Do yourself a favor and do it! I did on sale for 19 or so. I had mixed feelings about this game but it prooved any of my doubts wrong. My video cards is EVGA GTX 550Ti 2GB and optimized for games by Asus GPU Tweak. The graphics are amazing and the story is very interesting. The looting kinds of becomes repetitive, almost like a job if you want more money and reach higher modes for your ship and improve your home island. Diving with the bell is totally insane and the adrenalin rush by attacking huge ships and forts is great. I certainly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good story with good single player, adventure and skillful sword killing along the way.
