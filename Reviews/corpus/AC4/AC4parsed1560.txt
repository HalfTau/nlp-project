From the start of the game you are put into a seemingly endless wave of tutorial like missions. What you probably want to do in the game which is to pirate around, barely ever happens. If you die at sea, you are not revived next to where you were, but instead quite close to the main mission. The captain you and the quartermaster will then discuss the main mission, even though youve heard that exact conversation 50 times before.The entire games gameplay is very bad and uninteresting and dumbed down. It feels unserious and slightly arcade.Someones about to shoot you so a spacebar comes up above an enemys head and it says human shield. You then hold spacebar, wait for that person to be shot, and then continue fighting. LAMEAssassins creed 1, 2 brotherhood and revelations had good combat where you saw someone about to attack and you countered. In this game, a big red E comes up above someone whos about to attacks head, hinting you hit E there, dude, cause im about to attack now  because the game thinks you need the assistance, and that the game has to be that childish and unrealistic for you to get it. It also spams you tutorialmessages in and out of missions throughout the game about stuff you already knew.Many missions are forced to be stealthy, however these missions are very badly designed stealth missions.You are in a huge world, but you have no control or freedom. You are just on for a small bit of the ride, and the game lacks serious amounts of immersiveness.
