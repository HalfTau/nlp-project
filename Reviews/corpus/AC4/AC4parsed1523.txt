My favorite game by far and the best installment in the ac series. I love the free roaming and fully controllable ship. One little down side is, yes is a assassins creed game but on the whole it is lacking a little of the assassin part, but i guess he is made to be a man who does pillage and plunder with out mercy for he a pirate captain. I absolutely love assassins creed IV black flag 3 3
