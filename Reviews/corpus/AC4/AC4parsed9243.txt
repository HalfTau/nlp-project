This game is very much like the other Assassins Creed games.  The setting is very fun to explore.  I like the sea adventures from Assassins Creed 3 and this delivers where that game left off.  I played this from start to finish, then crushed the DLCs.  I didnt do much multiplayer because I had to wait for a while in the queue to form up a match.
