The game is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, the developers have done a great job of putting together an excellent sailing game that makes it fun to charge into a convoy to board and plunder the lot of sorry sods... but I honestly found the land portions of the game to be an unwelcome distraction.Ultimately, while I reccommend the game to everyone, I still have to say that it does not take the place as a model of the Assassins Creed series. Ive yet to see the same story and immersion in the historical setting that I saw with AC2, but it just makes it hard to look at this as an Assassins Creed game. It was still one I played to its conclusion and might come back to later.
