It might not be the best Assasins Creed game, but it one of the funniest pirate game so far ever made, to sum it up, even if you dont like the franchise you will enjoy it, I would say anyone new to Assasins Creed can enjoy this one without having to play all the othersif you dont care much about the game overall story so far anyway, all in all its worth a try for those who are already into this franchise and newcomers alike.
