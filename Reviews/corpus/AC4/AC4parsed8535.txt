from the first time I played assassins creed brother hood this game  or should I say this game serial  was my best .thats untill I tired out the new multiplayer system and I was totally impressed and my affiction for it raises even more and more .the singleplayer is similar to the game befor it Assassins Creed 3 but this time with the lovely and large open sea which give a real pirate experience that comes with about 30 islands or lands to explore 4  5 of them are so large .the multiplayer I havnt been playing it for so long but for my first look into it .. you are free to either select to join random existed lobey or creat a new one with your own role I didnt try out what I tired is the team death match where the team leaders select the character the team will be every charater has its own abilities to lure or hide form enemies and the game will start there are 2 rounds one of them you will be the PREY and other is the HUNTER with so many look a like NPC on the map which makes the luck and experience are the major role on matchsfinally after al this bla bla bla .. TRY IT OUT ,, IT WORTH IT.
