This game couldnt care less about you if you havent played the other games in the series. They make no attempt to explain the plot of the series that Ive seen yet, but they sure drop it on you in as confusing a manner as possible. Other than that the game seems enjoyable, but it really destroyed my immersion to be ripped out of the pirate era so abruptly and not given a reason why.Also, the game crashed every time I tried to play it until I manually downloaded and installed UPlay.
