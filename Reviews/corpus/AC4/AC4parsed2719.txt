Tremendous fun and addictively easy to play  the shift to the Carribean and the emphasis on naval combat could have been a huge mistake but they absolutely pulled it off.  Largely sidelining not only the modern storyline but also a great chunk of the Templar vs Assassin plot in favor of just playing as a pirate captain trying to get rich was absolutely the right idea.  While these plots do come more to the fore as the main storyline goes on, Edward Kenway has charm as the protagonist that unfortunately Connor in AC3 did not, making everything far more palatable.  I can absolutely recommend this if like me you got burned out on the series with the previous game, it has revitalized my interest.
