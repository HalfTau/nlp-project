Graphics look good but there is no storyline of compelling interest just a sequence of missions with somewhat arbitrary objectives. Then theres the Animus. I wanted to play a game about pirates and assassins and perilous adventures, not something watered down by the reoccurring notion of actually you are just replaying memories of a dead man... I would say this is a steaming pile of excrement if it wouldnt devalue excrement.
