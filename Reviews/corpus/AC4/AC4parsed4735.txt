currently on my 4th time of completing this game and i got say i love this game when i havnt liked any other creed games.i also got to add i love the fact they used the soundtrack from the movie last of the mohicans.and i was also at the bar in nasar and the band there started playing the theme song to the uk tv program shape from the 90s  which was based on the french war of the 1800s.has got to be the only game i have ever played where you can actually lose yourself as if your there
