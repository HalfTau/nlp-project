Another Assassins! But wait, this one has tropical beaches, sunshine, and plenty of palm trees! Arrrg! And Corsairs, Pirates, Plunder, and Rum  what more does an Assassin want?Ive been thinking about what this series needs. It does many things really well  open world, open missions, voice acting, visual fidelity, sound design, level design, animations, parcour elements  but honestly, it get boring after several hours in. Why? It needs more RPG elements for character progression. It needs a larger carrot on a stick.The series has slowly started to throw in more of these elements consider hunting, crafting, ship upgrading, but most of these are pretty unmeaningful. Why? Because the game is easy. I have no reason to spend my time upgrading my character when hes perfectly fine as is against any fight. This is too bad, really, because the game has wonderful systems for combat its extremely fluid, fast, and visually interesting, but without challenge.With greater emphasis on character progression and a steeper difficulty curve its nonexistant this series could be very interesting to play. As is right now, its a fine game, but none are all that memorable.7.5/10  its good, but not great.
