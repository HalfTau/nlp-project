I love the Assassins Creed series and everything they have done, but I will not recommend this game because apparently they felt more compelled to add as much DRM as possible making it impossible to even launch the game. 60 for a game that doesnt even launch is just plain stupid. You want to know why people pirate software, this is it right here. Its easier to just pirate than it is to legit buy it and spend days just trying to get the damn game to launch. Take for what you will but Im not the only person who cant even load the game...The issue was eventually sorted out and I admit this review was more from anger of not being able to launch a game I just paid full price for. In the end it was a very good game I just dont like the way they handled the DRM at launch.
