As an entry in the Assassins Creed franchise its an average game, as a game where you get to be a pirate its nothing short of amazing!.. I spent most of my time just sailing around boarding vessels and looting to my hearts content. The gameplay really shines through on this title i can see me coming back and playing this one over again.
