Awesome!For me, second only to Assassins Creed II, but this one has awesome graphics with caribbean beaches and sea.The naval battles are great, but I think there should be more advanced upgrade options for the ship like refire rate.Loved to dive. Wish we could have more freedom to explore underwater and more secrets.The assassins contracts were very interesting. In AC 2 they were quite boring and repetitive.The main story is very focused on your pirate life, which was a nice change of tone to me.I will really miss the main character Edward. He has a great story.This one I HAD to play until 100.Even if you are not a fan of the series, but like pirates, buy it.
