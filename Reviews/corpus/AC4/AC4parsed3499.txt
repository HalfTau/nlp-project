i have a 6600k, 16gb of ram and a gtx 970. with settings set to high at 1080p, i cant really even reach 30fps. whats worse is that it ran better when i had my amd fx though, not by much. ubisoft has gotten better in their optimization game recently, but i cant reccomend this game when i can barely run this pretty lousy looking game on my rather expensive build.
