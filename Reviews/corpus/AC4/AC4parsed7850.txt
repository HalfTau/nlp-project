Finally after a long time of bad Assassins Creed games, Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, picks the saga back up. Perfect balance between hand to hand and over sea battles. Though the Edwards story isnt as good as previous stories of the series, it leaves a weird twist unlike the previous games. No story will be as good as Ezios in my opinion.
