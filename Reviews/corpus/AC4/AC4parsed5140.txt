The graphics, soundtrack and gameplay are great and it runs well even on my measly intel 4000 integrated graphics.The story falls a bit short, unfortunately not only because of the writing but also because its easy to get distracted by side activities until you cant remember what was going on anyway and probably cant be bothered to care either.That said, its not bad, if you dont mind a more fantasyoriented AC game with a lot of focus on mythology and stuff, but its not exactly the most captivating piece of AC storyline Ive ever seen.The game runs smoothly even on my laptop Yes, Im playing this on a laptop. Sue me. and I havent encountered any bugs, either apart from the occasional sword phasing through some of the outfits, but I have yet to see a game where that doesnt happen.The parcour pathfinding is no less aggravating than it could be in previous games, and there are some climbable things it really hates, such as a few parts of mast and rigging, as well as the occasional tree. Fluidly running over rooftops and the like works good, though  if you can find enough rooftops to run over, that is.You dont need to constantly hold down three keys forward, sprint and freerunning anymore, only two you only need the third one for jumps deemed unsafe by the pathfinding, which is definitely an improvement.Handtohand or, well, swordtosword combat is okay, but neither particularly hard nor terribly exciting. Very satisfying, though, and it looks awesome.Naval combat, however, is fluid, streamlined and just plain fun once you get the hang of it.The only thing that is probably even more fun than naval combat is sailing The different weather conditions are beautiful to watch look out for high waves during sunshine  the color of the sea when the sunlight shines through the waves is a very nice and very pretty touch, if occasionally slightly aggravating hello there, superdense fog and intense storms with unfortunate timing but ah, the things you gladly suffer for a bit of realism.The ship handles very nicely too, and the level of texture you can see even while sailing is incredible.Also, bonus point for! Best thing ever. Although the soundtrack if you deactivate them is glorious, too. Win/win.I dont know if Ive mentioned it yet, but the game is stunningly beautiful. Very detailed, very nicely textured and well made, with a very clean, intricate and atmospheric look.If youre anything like me youll probably end up climbing sync points more for the looks than for anything else, especially because the map is a good deal less integral to you finding your way around than it used to be.The only thing that I dont like about AC4 is the amount of wasted potential AssCreed needs a more captivating story than AC4 has and as much as I love it as it is, it probably wouldve been the game of my dreams if theyd just made a pure pirate game out of it and expanded on the piratey parts of it. The Assasin parts of the game do feel a bit tacked on every now and then.Still, I dont regret spending money on this  it was totally worth every cent of it and I can fullheartedly recommend it  it may not be a perfect game, but it is a very,good one.
