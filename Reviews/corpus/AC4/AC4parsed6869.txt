The best Assassins Creed game since Assassins Creed 2.This is coming from someone who hates pirates.This game comes in three parts being a Assassin, being a ship captain, and being a ubi.... I mean Abstergo employee.The Assassin part is similar to the previous games, but it is improved. Sword fighting feels alot better than previous games, its more Batmanlike Arkham games and less Counterkill spam. Range weapons are powerful, but not over powered. They finally put stealth mechanics in the game!!!! A game about Assassins!!!! You can hide in bushes, long grass and are able to move around Mission design is really good, and more varied than previous games. Side missions are amazing too, they range from undersea diving to whaling to taking over forts.Being a ship captain is the best part of the game. I enjoyed exploring the high seas more than the storyline, I kept exploring till the point where all that I could was the main storyline. Your Ship is upgradable and the system is extensive. Ship combat is great. It consists of shooting cannons at each other and then boarding for some sword fighting to capture the ship. Its really addicting.Being a ubisoft employee is in first person, and you mainly do hacking puzzels in it. Doing these puzzels unlocks background information, that is really interesting.Multiplayer havent touched itOther Stuff Optimization could be better, but it is a beatiful game. Best play with a controller IMO, until you have to aim with a pistol. UPLAY Rating 10/10 1 for UPLAY  9/10
