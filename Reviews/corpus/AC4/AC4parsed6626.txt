Ive been a fan of the series from the beginning.The first game was alright for its time, AC2 was a great improvement and Brotherhood was correcting problems and expanding the gameplay... But then Revelations was, meh,, while AC3 is confusing and boring for the most part, so getting Black Flag felt more like a gamble rather than getting a game you enjoy... BUTFortunately Black Flag is fantastic!A pirate adventure that surprisingly doesnt portray everything on cliches, it has an almost ground to earth setting and inhabitants and you explore a miniaturized version of the Carribean. It looks great and it plays great. The sword fighting is a bit loose but servicable and the Naval Battles are challenging and exciting.Its the best AC game in my opinion.
