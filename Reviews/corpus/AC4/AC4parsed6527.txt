There was so much to do in this game, it was pratically overwhelming. So much extra side stuff that I actually enjoyed doing. I definitely got my moneys worth, I got 60 hours out of this game, just singleplayer too. Thats crazy, I didnt 100 this game but Im around 94 complete. Im very well satisfied with this game. Please play it, you owe it to yourself.
