Bought the game for sale for 10, along with the season pass for 6.I already played the game and had 97 completion on my 360 a couple of years ago, but seeing as how much I loved it, the nostalgia  memories I have with it, and the fact that it was also on sale  I just had to play it again on PC.Overall 9.5/10The world is amazing, the story is interesting ESPECIALLY with Edward as a main character who has his flaws and a truly amazing arc. The naval gameplay rarely gets boring, especially because its just fun. It has SO MUCH in terms of upgrades  customization  of ships and Edward himself, it truly is a game that rewards hard work and grinding. AND ALL THIS IS STILL FUN TO SOMEONE WHOS ALREADY PLAYED IT knowing all the tiny little details and quests.The only cons I can think of were the climbing controls being a little iffy since Edward kept doing stuff I didnt want him to  but the overall climbing is pre smooth. And the eavesdropping missions are truly annoying and not fun but they add to story and the aftermath is where the game jumps back.Hope this helped
