Black Flag saved AC for me, and I think it is funny how a ton of people are writing bad reviews because Uplay doesnt work. Even though they probably didnt download the new Uplay client from the Uplay siteThe Uplay Client Steam installs is an old one that cant connect to the Uplay servers.Got it on sale for 7 and it was totally worth it.
