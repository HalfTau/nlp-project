A brilliant game, its world is huge, and very much alive.It does have flaws however, the game lacks a difficulty setting, and is laughably easy, you shall be taking out entire fleets and whole armys single handed. The combat is very much press B and X to win Xbox 360 controller examble, and different enemys dont take much combat experience to beat.There is a huge amount of content, a huge amount, but it is rather all the same or not that interesting, but if you are a got  to collect them all kind of player, you will certainly love it. The voice acting is nothing short of amazing, it really brings the characters alive, especially Edwardyou, meaning that the main story line is very interesting and worth the time, but the side content not so much.Overall, its a very easy, but fun game. The main story line and characters are worth it, but the side content is rather boring because of the ease at which it can be done. Great voice acting. But the combat is lacking.
