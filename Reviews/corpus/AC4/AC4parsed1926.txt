Overview A fun addition to the AC franchise. All the AC gameplay you like sneaking, fighting, climbing, jumping with the added bonuses of being a pirate with your own ship.Good Solid Assassin gameplay from other games. It is mixed up a little to fit the time, but if you love AC games youll fit right in. Pirate ship! The ship gameplay is solid and fun. You get the feel of a ship on the seas without the tedium. A mix of speeds and fast travel help with life on the high seas. The ship battles are fun and fierce. Deal with waves and wind and cannon arcs but with plenty of help to keep it exciting. Choose to capture or sink ships as you will. Good story. You take a good story arc as your character grows from a simple man with a simple plan to a master assassin caught up in a worldly struggle. Manage your own fleet. It is a side game of its own, but very profitable if you stick it out.Bad The offline animus story is mediocre at best. Not near as fun as being a pirate.Overall a fun game.
