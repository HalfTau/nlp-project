While the actual play mechanics of Assassins Creed games are so stale now that they are almost mummified, its easy enough to bash your way through that it wont keep you from the fantastic open world exploration and encounters.   Similar to Ubisofts other franchise favourite, Far Cry 3, the freedom and navigation is whats on point here. The fun of conquering the west indies and performing various hunts  on man, beast, and galleon  make this the most enjoyable Assassins Creed game since the phenomenal AC2.  Sure, its a bummer when youre doing the same damned eavesdropping mission, but you didnt play Skyrim for the story either, did you?9/10
