From what Ive played of it Ive really enjoed it after the dramatic faliure of AC3. Unfourtenately Ive not managed to get to far into it. Brought to many games at once in the damn sales. Only regret when I brought this game was that I didnt get the season pass. I was reluctent at first as I wanted to see if it was better than 3 rather than pumping theextra 10 in. Wish I had now and I will be buying it next time its on sale
