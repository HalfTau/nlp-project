AC4... Is a great step forward in story delivery compared to AC3. Gameplay and mechanics are almost spot on! This game is interesting and fun. If you like AC as a franchise then you wont be disappointed. The game itself does differ from all previous AC games in a lot of ways however. It also falls short of feeling complete in such that a lot of content like sidemissions and items feel out of place. I guess what im trying to say is that its not as fluid as it should be imho. The game is beautiful and the story is decent voice acting is very well done. The games strengths like the very large and open world make for some very addictive elements but after a large amount of playtime the ship aspect of the game seems to dominate and grows very repetitive. Nothing seeming as important as it should but none the less you still have a good time. Ive found myself wanting more cities to explore late game. All in all this is a fine addition to the franchise. They seem to do something new everytime which is a hard thing to do and well but they did a great job on this game. Well worth the money. Arrrrghhhh4 out of 5 for the rating.
