Make ships go BOOM. I has fun.Make big, big ships go BOOM. Now pirate hunters after me.Dies from getting BOOMed by pirate hunters. No regrets at all.Serious reviewIn all seriousness, this is my first time playing a Ubisoft game and playing an AC game. So there are two points Id like to make1 As someone who never played the previous AC games, I thought this was a pretty decent entry to the series. The only problem I had is that I couldnt fully appreciate some of the easter eggs about Desmond and characters from the other games in the series. But that didnt take away too much from the story.ACIV got me really interested in the AC universe so Im slowly going through the other games to see how they all tie together.2 One thing that got me worried were the comments about UPlay.Sooo.... It actually s up like everyone else says.BUT generally, I got UPlay to behave 95 of the time once I disabled the cloud save feature and used offline mode when I didnt need to be online. It also doesnt hurt to back up the save files on your computer every once in a while. I also did this when I played WatchDogs and havent had any major issues that I can think of.The only things that got meoff and helped me learn what everyone was complaining about was when I lost some progress after the game crashed and subsequently had to reinstall the game several times to finally get it to work again.As long as you dont need the online bells and whistles and have the basic knowledge on troubleshooting software, UPlays temper tantrums can be tolerated.
