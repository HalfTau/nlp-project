The 4th memory line of the Assassins Creed storyline. Ill be writing this review without any or very little spoilers and for single player only. i am not much of a multiplayer personFirst off i just finished getting 100 in the main storyline and for the dlc with it and i must say, it was well thought and a very enjoyable experience.Story 9/10Replayability 7/10graphics 8/10Sounds 9/10What can i start with. You play edward kenway, A man looking for a way to be famous with a lot of coin to his name. You follow his adventure and how he helps change history as we know in the other franchise games.The story mission were maybe only a quarter of the time i spent playing the game and the rest was having fun sailing the seas with a boat you get very early in the game which you can upgrade with resources you find along the way, finding treasures and searching the entire world with the crew. It reminded me of the days of playing legend of zelda windwaker if you have played that youll understand completly what its like out on sea.Would i recommend this game. Absoutely. 100 Good story good sailing and good sights to see.If you like the franchise, it may not be these best of the series but it is one of the top ones hands down
