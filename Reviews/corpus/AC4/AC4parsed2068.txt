The game itself is amazing. Its Pirates of the Carribean meets Assassins Creed. Huge beautiful world with so much to explore and do and the ship system is amazing. The game itself gets a 9/10 from me. But this pc port gets a 5/10... Many people have performance and/or support issues with this version of the game. I myself use an ultra widescreen setup of 2560x1080 and cannot play this game unless I hook up my pc to my tv because it doesnt support ultra wide ratios and if I try to set a lower resolution, the display becomes 25 the size of the screen in the middle with huge black cinematic borders. It becomes even more unplayable. I tried using third party wide screen programs to fix this but it just stretches the lower resolution and looks terrible. I dont have a single other game in my library that doesnt support ultrawidescreen or allow me to adjust the settings accordingly. I have heard that Syndicate has this same issue. Seems like Ubisoft has gotten real lazy with their ports. If you have an ultra wide screen with no alternative options for display, dont bother wasting your time and money. Do your research to figure out if your rig might have any issues before you purchase.
