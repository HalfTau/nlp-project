This is really awesome game  as a part of AC series, and as a pirate simulator. Its up to you how to play though mostly youd prefer stealthy way  as a silent assassin, or as a crazy pirate.I didnt liked AC 1 and 2  not my type, and I would have skipped this game just as I skipped AC 3  but playing as a pirate really hooked me up  and after a first mission I was so astonished by the game so Ive played several hours in a row though its hard for me to find so much free time. I wont tell you anything about story  you should see it yourself. Go buy this game!P.S. Dont be afraid of UPlay, its not as bad nowadays as it was few years ago.
