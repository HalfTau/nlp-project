AWESOME GAME!This is the best Assassins Creed game by far... I was a bit miffed by Assassins Creed III, but in this game, there is sooooo much liberty, you can do whatever you want, you have your own freaking pirate ship... The map is huge, the graphics anre awesome...I dont see what people are complaining about... Uplay works really well, and I have 3 games on it...This is an awesome game, 10/10, I totally recommend it.
