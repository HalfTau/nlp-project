I thought I was done with the Assassins Creed franchise after III. The appeal of the series had just run dry for me. However, I picked up Black Flag and after slogging through the first two or so hours of tutorial I fell in love with it. Once you get your ship and are free to explore the game world at your own pace, Black Flag becomes an incredible open world experience. In fact, it might be my favorite of 2013, even topping Grand Theft Auto V. There is just so much to do and see that it becomes the best time sink of the year. It also doesnt hurt that it looks absolutely beautiful. This is my new favorite game in the series replacing Brotherhood and definitely worth your time, whether youre a newcomer to the franchise or a longtime fan. It should be interesting to see where Ubisoft goes from here. Whatever comes next has big shoes to fill.One word of advice turn off most of the HUD elements everything except SSI and the underwater breath meter. They arent necessary and distract from the fantastic vistas and art direction. This also enhances player immersion.
