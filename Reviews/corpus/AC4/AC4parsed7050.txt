Assassins Creed was one of the first game series that really brought me into the gaming world, and i must say, black flag, is probalby the most well done out of the entire series thus far! If youre an AC fan, GREAT! theres still some classic templar hunts, and just that classic assassins feel. If you havent been a fan of prior games, thats ok too! Youll enjoy this game just as much as a devout AC fan, its immersive, a great heart felt story, and youre a freaking pirate, whats not to love?
