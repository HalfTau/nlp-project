Ignore the previous uplay bad reviews.i just got this game from the steam sales and the Uplay thing worked fine. just needed to log into my acc and thats it! The game started and ive been enjoying it so far.its definitely worth the money especially the fact that i got it for 6.22 p ive always loved assassins creed so this is definitely a must get. Try playing it. You wont regret it. Unless u have a bad taste in gaming then...yeah. Good job Ubisoft. Loving it so far D
