Was never that interested in AC as a series until AC3 took the series to more modern times. Something about running around during the revolution seemed fun. The naval missions felt out of place, though, and the story felt lacking.Black Flag took those outofplace naval missions and centered most of the new gameplay around sailing the high seas, upgrading your ship, and occasionally making landfall for various story reasons. It gives the game a vast, organic feel that I thoroughly enjoyed.I bought the game a number of years ago during a summer sale, but I still come back to it on occasion for some swashbuckling. Definitely recommend it.
