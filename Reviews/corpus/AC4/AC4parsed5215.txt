This was a very fun game, after completing about 50 of it it crashed and would not load anymore.Ubisoft customer support blamed the problem on Uplay, and even after reinstalling it at their suggestion I could not get it to load. I even tried deleting the game from my hard drive and reinstalling it from Steam which would mean I lose all progress and would haveto start from teh beginning but that also has not worked.I dont know if there is something wrogn with the servers  all my other games even other AC titles work fine.I reccomend based on gameplay but would caution you to avoid it until the technical problems are fixed.
