The best game of the assassins Creed series ..... But Of cource there are ALOT of glitches and they probably will never be fixed . There is one glithc when you are sailing close to a fortification and ... there are alot of those .. your screen freezes and it ruins the game becuase you cant progress anyfarther in the game when you have to take over a fort ... otherwise thi game is amazing and ubisoft actrally used some imagination good job .. ohhhh and Uplay sucks giant ingcrack  you Uplay i hate it sooo much
