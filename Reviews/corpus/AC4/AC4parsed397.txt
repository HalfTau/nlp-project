Black Flag was everything I never asked for in an AC game, but it still manages to hold a spot in my top 3 AC games right behind AC2.Traversing the Spanish West Indies was a treat. Ubisoft recreated cities and locations beautifully, and the naval battles were a welcome departure from the norm. What surprised me most, however, was just how much I ended up loving Edward after completing the game. Character development on him was simply superb. Would recommend this game to anyone. Literally anyone.PROSnaval battlesgorgeous scenerytop notch voice acting and storytellingholds its own against the other ac games and keeps it freshsoundtrack was greatplaying as a pirate was literally the most fun ive had in agesCONSsome stuttering with the 1050ti i had been using and seemed like a lot of people were having the same issue. i dont seem to have this problem with my 1060 thoughthe side quests felt pretty redundantpresent day storyline was weak in comparison to inanimus plotbut overall, definitely a 9/10
