An amazing game that has aged very nicely over the span of its 4 year lifetime. Nice graphics, a great combat system, and a nice storyline. Only thing I hate is spending a lot of time traveling to new locations to complete mission, as it can take quite a while without fast travel.Would 100 recommend getting this game.
