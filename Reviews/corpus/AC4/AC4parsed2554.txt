Definitely well worth your money. The story is compelling, and naval battles are a lot of fun. Even though Uplay can be a pain, for the most part it was pretty seamless for this game. This was probably the best AC game, because of the Naval combat system. Its not particularly challenging, but its definitely a lot of fun, and something that I could play again after a year.The DLCs probably arent worth the money, because the game itself offers plenty of content.
