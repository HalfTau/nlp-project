Simply put, this game is fantastic. The story is one of the most emotionally engaging Ive ever seen, game or otherwise. The gameplay is much imporved from previous titles, but still not very challenging. The naval aspect is by far the star of the show for as good as it was in ACIII, its twenty times better now with free roam. Theres so much to do, it seems like itd get overwhelming, but it never does. Theres no pressure. You can spend ours just being a pirate  plundering ships, sailing the seas,, and singing along with the shanties I lied. These are the best part. Really and not feel like youre missing out!9.5/10. Definite buy for fans of the series, pirates, or a good time.Pirates, mate.
