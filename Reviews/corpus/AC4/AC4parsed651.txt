So, full disclosure Im an RPG gamer at heart. However, I have a deep and abiding love for games where ridiculous stuff happens and it ties into real world conspiracies. The first few Assassins Creed games were just too... one note for me personall,y which isnt to say that they were bad.This game is Pirates of the Caribbean, but without Jack Sparrow. Im not the first person to say that, I know. But like... go in expecting that  and a heck of a difficulty curve  and youll probably enjoy it.
