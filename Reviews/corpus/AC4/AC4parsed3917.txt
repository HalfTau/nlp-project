I got this as an entry point to AC after having played either AC1 or 2 for ye ol xbox.I loved it. I knew what I was getting, and I got a bit more than I was expecting.Solid game. Dont set the bar too high, its AC. Beautiful game fading away slowly so get playing it now.Totally good!Got Rogue and Syndicate since then. Kind of think AC4  Syndicate is all anyone with a very strict modern graphical eye would need from the series. Highly recommend both.
