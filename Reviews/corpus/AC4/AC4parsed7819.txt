Singleplayer is awesome till now. Multiplayer is fun, too.Problem You often need half an hour to find a good match, which takes only ten minutes if you find it.Its not that there where too few people playing it, but the connections are very unstable. And if you happen to stay in the game chances are good you are alone against a team of three highranked and high levelled playerd, some times from one clan. If there is a matchmaking system, I didnt find it till now. It takes much fun away.You are able to buy many things in the multiplayer with ingame money. Many things are too expensive to buy them without playing it for months. So if you wanna have them, you should buy them with real money. And we are talking about a fullprice game, not an F2P one!I only can recommend the single player without doubts.
