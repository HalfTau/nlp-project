It seems like a great game for console. However, on PC with an AMD video card, the fps dies. This is because of the way Ubisoft implimented vsync. The frames are divided by two when vsync is turned on, so it goes from 60 to a 30 fps maximum, meaning that it is unplayable. Any sort of load on the PC will drop the fps to around 2027. Turning vsync off tears the screen beyond your imagination. I do not recommend this title for a PC with an AMD graphics card.
