This is basically the pirate simulator Ive been waiting for. The ship combat is pretty good if a little unrealistic and the boarding happens seamlessly. On land the missions are pretty fun and theres enough to do to entertain you for 30 hours.The only issue is that, due to the nature of this being an Assassins Creed game, the soryline is completely linear and there are no real freedoms within the game which is ironic since all the game seems to go on about is freedom.
