I had many issues getting this game to work, inculding 1 with uplay. Seems lots of other people had issues like this too.BUT! The game itself is amazing. I was never a fan of the series, but the pirate theme got my attention. The story is quite lengthy which is rare to find in games these days, and the huge open world is full of life, many naval battles going on out at sea, assassins still fighting templars, hunting, crafting exploring, finding tresure maps, side missions/stories ect. Also its based in the tropics so very colorful world. Also plenty of customization and upgrading for your character and ship. Its still very assassins creed game and combat system is the same, but if the rest sounds intersting to you, maybe pick in up when on sale. Sometimes movement,jumping and climbing over objects and terrain is a little buggy, which sucks when your tryna escape or go stealth. Thats my only complaint besides having trouble getting it to launch.
