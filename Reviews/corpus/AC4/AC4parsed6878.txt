My first fray ino the Assassins Creed franchise.  Im not sure why I havent played one until now.  Probably a mix of not having the right system or the money when they came out, but It finally happened with Black Flag.  I went in thinking that I liked the franchises aethetics.  Great style.  I was expecting a decent game.  I expected to be done with it in a few days over summer vacation.  Instead it took me a few weeks I have over 100 hours logged according to steam.  I was blown away by thesize of the game world.  I absolutely loved the game.  I came away feeling like it was a great game, one I wanted more of.  Id give it a 9/10.  I should point out that while I played it on PC via steam, I played with a xbox 360 controller plugged into the USB, so I cant speak for how the keyboard and mouse controls feel.
