Out of all the AC games , this is my favorite 1 , unfortunately it still has the controller problems of it not being smooth or good . if they sorted it out to react as fast as my fingers can , then it would be almost perfect , but they won,t change what they think is a good thing , .Its not its very slow and sluggish and does not respond to my commands as it should , its like its always one move behind me and thats very bad for a game that works on action , .They should take a look at the way Doom works , fast, fluid and always in control .......
