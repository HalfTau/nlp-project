Except for the battles on sea  this game is boring and controls are clunky. If I hit the button for picking up a body I want to pick up the body, not rob it so I expose myself in the stealthpart of this game. Or when I hit the button for taking out a guard silently though I did it on the right moment I dont want it to make me bump against him with nothing happening but alerting him and making me lose a stealth part. Also  really? I have to do it all over again because the system fails? Also when on sea, it happened that the graphics went berserk. Loved the second AC , every thing else  plain boring and they did not learn from their mistakes. This game is good enough for a cough potatoe , not for a hardcore gamer.
