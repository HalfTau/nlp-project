Exceptional AC game, I have played all the previous AC games and have found this to be the most enjoyable, lots of freedom, the graphics is excellent, the way the sea has been portrayed is very realistic, with the motion of the waves and the detailed underwater scenes , and the ship to ship battles are very entertaining, highly recommended.
