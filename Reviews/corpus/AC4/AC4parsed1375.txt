Chucked in a total of 13.4 hours into the game where I said enough is enough with the stuttering and frame drop . This game stutters heavily whenever youre roaming around town areas which highly interfere your pace of sneaking around. Otherwise , this game works really well on sea and this is where the game shines best. Sea combat between AI ships and the physics of the sea wave bring tons of intensity to this game. Would recommend until this game has a fix for the stuttering
