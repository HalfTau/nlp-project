This game is like Wind Waker mixed with Pirates mixed with Assassins Creed. Alot of customization, lots of adventure, lots of side missions. I called in sick for 2 days just to keep playing and I still didnt even get close to beating it. I havent been focusing much on the main missions because ive been sucked into upgrading my ship and just taking forts. Yeah, this game is fun.
