I really did not enjoy this game, I would not recommend it to anyone who has no knowledge of history. The gameplay itself is rather, how should I put this, stale? You just jump around like a mad man and kill random people. What got this game in my library was that I thought it would tell the tale of Blackbeard, but it was just a British colonialist doing 5 yearold action fighting. If you are an immature, illogical millenial prick who only finds entertainment from games like Garrys Mod, maybe youll like this utter piece of hogswash. Anywoo, you play as a man with a hood, havent I already seen that in Brink? The splitscreen is COMPLETELY broken, and the targeting system is just painful. What makes it worse is the story, it portrays pirates as a jolly group of sailors who just want to drink rum and go Yarhar. However, in reality, pirates are MONSTERS who KILLED INNOCENT ING PEOPLE. WHAT MAKES ME EVEN MORE MAD IS THAT THE ING POLICE IN THIS GAME CHASE YOU EVEN UNDERWATER LIKE THAT DOESNT MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IF YOU GO UNDERWATER THEY SHOULDNT SEE YOU! THIS GAME PISSES ME OFF!!!! !
