Another super awesome assassins creed game! really good one! good gaphics, good story and i love the new things like sailing all day long on that HUGE map or the creafting section where you can like craft that supersexy leopard outfit  i haven t got any lags or bugs maybe because i run on a pretty expensive computer except the colorful eyes glitch that everyone seems to have it. Not to mention the multiplayer which is AWESOME!! i love the new charcaters like the pupeteer or lady black and so on. i just love this game but they need to fix the eyes glitch. i give it 9.5/10 D
