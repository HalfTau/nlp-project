Black Flag brings the Assassins Creed series back to the heights of AC II with both a great story and a brilliant and varied cast of characters which AC III fell just a bit short of delivering.Combat and navigation are solid and little changed from the established formula but are sidelined in this installment by naval combat and navigation which is refreshing as the gameplay threatened to become increasingly tedious as the series progessed.The only noteworthy faults I can think of are small but can build up to the point of frustration in a long playing session. The freerunning sometimes decides to throw you in a direction in which you werent pointing or you end up running into something that looks perfectly scaleable but apparantly isnt. As a result the freerunning experience seems slightly less fluid than in the previous installment. Boarding enemy ships is definitely one of the most exciting aspects of the game, however on a deck crowded with allies things get cramped, ruining the fluidity of combat and sometimes making it hard to keep track of where you are. Finally the missions can seem a bit repetative if youve been playing for an hour or so though a controlled progression through the story more or less alleviates this problem.Overall this is a beautiful game with a gripping story, excellent characters and great gameplay. I would most certainly reccommend.
