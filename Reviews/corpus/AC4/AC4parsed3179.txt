I honestly hesitated a lot between recommanding it or not.The graphics are awesome, the gameplay is as epic as Assassins Creed 3 and the story is soso.But you have to explore the game a lot otherwise many quests will be bugged such as forts that you have to capture before certain missions in the campaign.My previous campaign was ed up because of the fact I advanced too much and when I tried to do the quest after capturing a fort they told me to destroy english ships but there were only spanish ships because I was already too far into the campaign.But other than that the exploring in this game is perfect, the sea fighting is awesome, I had fun during my first 2 campaigns.Its worth buying it for its current price to be honest but you have to explore a lot especially capture forts before advancing into the campaign.7/10
