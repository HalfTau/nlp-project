I dont like assassin creed games, theyre so repetitive. But a lot of people told me this one would be different, so i gave it a shot. Still very repetitive, but i found myself actually enjoying the game a little... that is until i got on a ship. The ship missions are sooooo damn boring. I just couldnt bring myself to play anymore. Just another boring assassin creed game.
