Gets in boat, starts sailing the high seas enjoying the view, listening to your crew sing shanties to pass the time. Sees a large boat, checks its rating. Its higher than me. Ill try to take it down. through a tough struggle and a few well timed shots I manage to cripple it, time to board mateys. I hop on the swivel cannon and take out a few sailors before we jump on. I slay all their men except for two generals, as I approach them I ready my blades. Then suddenly I realized this is a Ubisoft game instead of attacking when I press the attack buttons I flop my swords around like Im waving around a pair of , they hit me for half of my health. I try to counter instead, playing on the defensive now I manage to stop one attack then a rouge cannon shot from a passing boat nails me in the head and I fly off the boat desynchronized. 2/10 would captain boat again.
