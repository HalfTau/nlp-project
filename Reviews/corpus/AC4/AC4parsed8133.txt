Assassins Creed is a series that has been a series that has never really been all that great while still being enjoyable. While I do not care for games where the only enjoyable aspect of the game is multiplayer while the single player seems like the exact same game with the exact same story just reskined and rereleased. Black Flag has been the first AC I have played since the original where single player felt enjoyable again. While the melee combat is still the same old stand still and just press counter to murder everyone that it has been since the begining, the ship combat adds a lot to the table.Honestly there has been no real reason to buy many games in the AC series since it has been the same game each itteration with next to no changes, but I can safely say while the combat is still counter to win, the addition of sailing in its self makes this game stand out from the rest.Would I spend 60/80 on it? NoIs the price difference between standard and Gold editions worth the price difference? Since its the exact same price as the season pass that comes with it but has more and not just skins, yeah I would say the gold edition is worth picking up over the standard edition if your looking for a bit of extended story lines in the DLC that comes with the gold edition.Would I pick this game up if it was on a decent sale or after a price drop? Definitly, its not a great game, in fact the land combat parts are so outdated and lack enjoyability, but what it does have is a fairly unique ship combat system that is enjoyable enough to where I would say play it just for that even if you have to suffer through a bit of the same old land combat AC has had for 6 and a half years. Heck if Ubisoft where to take the ship combat polish it up to make it stand on its own two feet and toss it into a game by itself I think I would probably purchase that game because it is the one thing that brought me back into AC and it could actually do really well if a game was designed around navel combat where you had to fight the winds and waves to be able to steer your ship into possitions to be able to attack your enemy.Prior to playing AC Black Flag I was not looking for any high seas ship combat simulator, but after playing Black Flag I wish there was a good ship combat simulator game that was standalone so that I could enjoy that combat without having toabout with pressing counter 20 times in a row to slaughter an entire army of idiots who only attack one at a time even if 30 of them surround you.
