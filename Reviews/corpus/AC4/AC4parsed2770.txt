pirates are every childs fantasy. me, i always knew i wanted to kill myself, but this game has managed to put it off for a little while before i got better games like the witcher 3 and dark souls 3 and just cause 3.  before i had those, i played this and just stabbed some fools into next week. boating is okay, fighting is mediocre, world and story are interesting, and is a pretty good timesink.
