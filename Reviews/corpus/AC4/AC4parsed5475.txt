Its one of those strange things, I really enjoy sailing, ship battles and upgrading the ship but the missions are AWFUL. Its the same thing over and over, follow someone as they loop around the city, get spotted once and you restart. I come back to assassins creed games hoping they have come up with something new, something unique in the missions but they havent. If they only spent as much time on the core game as they did on the ships, physics etc... Its a horrible game with a decent candy coating... A candy coated turd.
