Finally you can roam the seas as a true pirate. This game got tons of stuff to do, exploring, pirating, fighting, crafting..and the list goes on. Graphics is awsome and sailing into the sunset while hearing the crew sing their shanties is truly wonderfull.Played some 50 hours and are only on memory 8. Hope this last forever.
