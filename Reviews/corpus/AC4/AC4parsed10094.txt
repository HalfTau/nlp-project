Great game. Most fun I have had pretending to pirate since Sid Meier took a shot at it in the 90s. Largely addictive, great voice acting for the series, and dialogue that isnt painful to listen to on its own as well. This game could have a real shot as THE redefining moment for a series that has otherwise been largely stagnant. Unfortunately alot of those stagnations still exist here, repeated follow/eavesdrop missions for instance. All in all though this is easily what I would consider the BEST of the entire AC series since the first 2 games. Hope this is the start of a trend in making these more engaging and different/unique with each setting and iteration that follows.Check it out if youre ready to hit the open seas with your own brig, exploring the beautiful environments of the West Indies.
