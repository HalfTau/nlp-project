First of all, if youre expecting this game to be like the other AC games, youre wrong, the story is more 60 pirates and 40 assassins. Im not saying that this game doesnt live up to the franchise, because it does, and my favorite key elements is that it has good replayabiltiy, fun ship battles and fun missions as well.
