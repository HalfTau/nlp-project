As a long time Assassins Creed fan I must say I had my doubts for this particular title. With Assassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood alike being my all time fave AC titles, I was rather spektical about this at first. The whole idea of how Naval Combat in AC3 was horrible and made me rather avoid this title. But thankfully I took my chances and played this. It is absolutely incredible. Simply amazing.The gameplay like previous AC titles is well worked and serves a great time while it follows the same idea of counter killing just about anyone via combat remains classic and at its finest. Naval combat has been refined in an amazing way that made me simply love it compared to AC3s naval combat.Edward is a real fun character, altogh he seems like the worst Assassin at first, he appears to have a much better liking than Connor, the story is fun, intresting and all around enjoyable.Map is huge, no need to explain on that detail. Its big, no other word needed.Like any other AC games it can have some humerous but only sometimes game breaking glitches, Ubisoft get your head straigth please, Unity just shows how much people can stand your slackering.People tend to hate Uplay, and I actually did at first. But hey its not THAT horrible, as long as I dont have to use it to actually get in my games so for all I care I just ignore it when the game finally installs.Great PC port. Just love it. Solid 60 frames nonstop.Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is an amazing title, it serves the idea of a good game for both AC fans and non AC fans. While this may not be your typical Loyal to the Creed against the Templars type of game, it well enough deserves a top spot in the franchise and sits very well with the legacy AC2 holds.All in all, Id give Assassins Creed Black Flag a 9.7/10 A must have if you enjoy these types of open world games.
