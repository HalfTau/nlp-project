The best Assassins Creed game to date. My only complaints would be the lack of weapons, the combat which remains extremely easy and the frame rate you will not get an average of 60FPS even with a 780. Other than that, it is a great pirate AND Assassins Creed game so I highly recommend it. Get it for the PS4 or Xbox One if possible.
