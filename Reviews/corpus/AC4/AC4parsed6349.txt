Between Black Flag, III and Unity... I think this is one of the best game in the series! I have been with AC series from the begining and Blag Flag is just an all around truly open world kind of game! Who doesnt want to own a pirate ship?! Not to mention own an entire fleet of pirate ships?!?! hahahahah this is truly one of the best! I havent gone back to Unity yet since they have issues with it.. But I got Black Flag on Pre Order and all its DLCs... Its just Perfection!!! Super Fun!! !
