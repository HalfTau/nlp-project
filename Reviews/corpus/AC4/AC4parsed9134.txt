If you love the idea of buried treasure and booty plundering, alongside being a ninjaAssasin I would highly recomend checking this game out. Sounds are imersive which compliments the graphics. I love pirating ships, which are plenty of and different kinds of ships, like 40 cannon Man OWars, to the original pirate ships the Skooners. Most real life pirates didns have ships the size of Kenways, sorry to burst that bubble lol.One thing that Irks me is that when running with the character, he some times goes up a tree or tries and climb something more than twice when he cant so choosing a line to run is important not to get too close to an object you dont want to climb or such so watch out where youre running.
