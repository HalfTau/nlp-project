Never gets boring. I would also recommend getting Freedom Cry if you have the money. Naval combat is lovely, assassinations are fun, occasional gliches witch are hilarius if you see one, combat is fun and challenging when it needs to be, upgrades are kinda limited especially if you have a lot of reales, ship upgrades are expensive when needed and VERY useful, tresure hunting isnt really fun but it is neccissary is you want all the upgrades, parkour is abit jerky and unrealistist at times but hey who really cares that much but smooth and very uesful, npcs get a little repetitive, side missions are really scarse and when they do come up its pretty easy, missions sometimes emotional but I get atached to video game and movie characters at times, stealth is extreamly handy and neccissary for a lot of missions and plantation raids, free aim is wonderful, ranged weapons are great if you know how to use them properly. allinall, wonderful game, recommend this to a friend instantly, 9.29.7/10.
