I want to start the review by saying Uplay sucks. I was about halfway through the game when I built my desktop. Went to play the game and none of my saves were there. All this is in steam is a link to uPlay beware.Now to the actual review.The game itself is wonderful. Although its not like the original games I throughly enjoyed Black Flag. It fixed alot of things that were wrong with AC3 and improved upon them.1. THE GREAT SEAS. One of my main issues with AC3 was the blandness of the Frontier. Now there is a sea which may leave people wondering how it was improved on, but there is so much going on in the Caribean. Ships are everywhere, explorable islands are scattered throughout the map and alot of other goodies. Plus the ship mechanics are very well done and were alot of fun.2. The storyline is wonderful. No it does not focus on the Assassins as much as it does the games main protagonist Edward Kenway, but molds into the AC world very nicely.3. Outside of the Animus actually makes sense now. I never liked being outside the Animus Except towards the end of Revelations, thatwas cool but now it actually makes sense and goes well with the story. Its not as exciting, but some cool story tidbits are nice to see and it integrates well.
