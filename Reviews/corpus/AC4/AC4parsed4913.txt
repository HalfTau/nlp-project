This game is unplayable garbage! Super low FPS. When are these stupid game companies going to learn to stop programming games for the absoute best computer out there? That used to be a good strategy when computers were advancing so fast your machine was old in 6 months, but that has not been true for several years. Somehow todays game companies dont get that?
