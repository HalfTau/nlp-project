This has to be one of, if not, my favourite game ever. Growing up I played a lot of AC on Xbox 360Xbox One and AC4BlackFlag was a game I never really got to dive into. Its amazing. Despite the fact that its not completely attached to the regular storyline, it gives a fresh and inspiring story of a man named Edward Kenway. Its very hard to put into words why this game is worthy of playing without giving spoilers so, just play it! Its not expensive, the gameplay is on point and, the storyline brought me to tears by the end which every other game Ive played has failed to do. Mostly RPGSOverall, I cant begin to describe my love for this game and its truly imo underated storyline. Please give it a play. Trust me.
