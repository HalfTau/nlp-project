Ive always been a fan of open world and pirate games so these two together is a heavenly gift. This being the fourth installment of the Assassins Creed series I think its the best to date including Unity. However being an Ubisoft game utilizing UPlay it is rifled with game breaking bugs save games dissapearing, saves being corrupted, patches rending saves unplayable etc. Its a shame that this great game is made unplayable. 4/10
