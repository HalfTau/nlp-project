A step forward and then backward for the series.The gameplay is much more consistently difficult as far as the quest progression.Sidemissions are quite fun and sometimes difficult. The Ship battles with Legendary ships were fun and really hard the first few times.However character development was terrible. We dont like anyone especially our hero.Regular combat and most of the general gameplay became quit stale quickly, with nothing to break it upAll in all was great, but slightly boring and fairly easy.
