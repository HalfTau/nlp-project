8.5/10Finally finished this game, after being behind in the series for years, and then restarting after getting half way through the game, due to needing to factory reset my computer.ProsGreat character developmentHuge at least compared to the other AC games world to exploreTons of side questsShip battles are pretty fun and pretty intense, when you get 34 frigates and a couple man o wars on youCrafting system was okay, and it made you have to go out and hunt to be able to craftHunting was alright, harpoon hunting was pretty fun although the trajectory of the harpoon was a little weird at timesConsCharacters that I really liked died... criesShip trading route things, while good at making money, were insanely boring and annoyingAlthough I didnt do every side quest, the game seemed a bit shorter than the othersEvery once in a while, even though ive done an objective for a main mission, it wouldnt register, and Id have to reload from my last checkpointSlightly repetitive, like all the other AC games although not quite as repetive as the othersTo get a full sync on your memories, you have to do certain things. to my knowledge, theres no way to see what those things are, unless you by chance do it without noticing, and then see the little progress box come up about half of my memories are only 80 sync because of thisFunny bug I foundIf you jump from the top of a windmill, onto one of the rotating fin things while its coming up, it shoots you about 100 feet in the air, and then kills you when you fall to the ground. Im almost ashamed to say I did it for a solid 20 minutes, because it was funny.
