Easily one of the best games Ive played recently.Graphically beautiful, the textures are high enough resolution that they dont look like a bleary mess when objects are near the camera, godrays are exaggerated enough to be atmospheric but not enough to be intrusive on gameplay, lighting and shadow in general are beautiful and the water is gorgeous despite a few trifles, particularly when youre out at sea and all of these factors combine, the sun shining through your sails and refracting through the waves. TXAA does its job correctly as well. Ive rarely seen a game that looks this nice unmodded, though it obviously doesnt stack up to the likes of, say, Crysis 3.While the freerunning is a bit sloppy as in past titles, its easily manageable, and the handful of forced stealth missions in the game are compensated for by a fair share of naval combat missions.Most of the time Ive spent on the game has been sailing, capturing ships, sieging forts, whaling, hunting and collecting the various collectibles strewn around the Caribbean, and its these things that Ive enjoyed the most about the game. I would say the games strongest points are its appearance and theming, and most of the aforementioned activities build into the latter, setting a distinctly swashbuckling mood.Against the game are a cheesy plot and a reliance on quick time events for encounters with predatory wildlife, particularly sharks which are moderately difficult to avoid and cannot be dealt with in any other way. These arent big concerns for me. The game also has a definite point where there isnt much left to do, the story is completed, everything there is to be collected is had and youve seen every bit of the world and conquered every enemy, but that isnt a complaint so much as whats there, which has been over 175 hours worth in my case, being good enough that I want more.
