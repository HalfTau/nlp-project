Great game, this is the best game in the AC franchise since ACII. They improved on the naval combat and added new ways of combat such as dual wielding swords and pistol combat. The freeaim system feels clean as well, not as if it was gimmick. The story of the pirate Edward Kenway is much more relatable than his grandson Connor, and continues to show the eternal struggle of the battle between the Templars and Assassins. What is also great is that the DLC so far are simply shortcuts or cosmetic items that do not significantly impact the game and the story. 10/10, would play again!
