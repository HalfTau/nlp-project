How do you know if a game is good? well, for me, a good game is a game where I have tons of stuff to do, while having a great story. When i play this game I dont feel this urge to finish the story, I just take it easy. aside from its fantastic graphics the mechanics of this game are great also, not mentioning the iPhone app that connects your account so you could do all kind of cool stuff! 10/10 no doubt!
