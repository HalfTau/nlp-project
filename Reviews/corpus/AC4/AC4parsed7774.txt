Overall Fantastic game! Buy it, play it now.Graphics Grazy stunningStoryline Entrolling  captivatingGameplay  I was hoping for a bit more build your own like in AC2  but this takes more from AC3. Regardless, the fighting is entertianing, the missions are fun and the open world is...well..full of water. Duh. Lots to do from mini games, to missions, to terrorizing the sea. The underwater was a nice add, but it was only in specific areas  I would have liked to really go underwater in some missions.Bugs a few  the cut scene sound would sometimes not be synced and I fell through the world a few times. However, nothing stopping me from playing the game.
