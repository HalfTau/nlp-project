I only have just under six hours put into the game but I have to say it is everything I have wanted in a Pirate game the fact that it is an Assassins Creed game is just an extra. It runs beautiful on my GTX 760 and I havent had any bugs or problems so far. The game is certainly one of the most beautiful games I have played in a long time.
