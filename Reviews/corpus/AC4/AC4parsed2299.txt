I played every Assassins Creed game up until 3. I got a sour taste in my mouth, and got sick of the copy paste type formula because Desmond and Connor were just so unlikable in that game. I was berated for awhile to try this game. I got it off a sale, and finally played it. Thank god I did, because this is one of the most fun Assassins Creed games and pirate games in general I think I have ever played. I love the progression system for my ship and my character! I have to sink some hours in, because I still havent collected 100 of everything!
