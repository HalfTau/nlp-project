Wow, they really polished AC up from the first to the fourth!!! Outside of being terribly optimised for PC especially my GTX 960 Strix 2GB hitting on average 4243fps in normally graphically intense situations. The quality of the game though is beyond compare. I loved AC2, really liked Brotherhood and to me Revelations was a cash grab that I didnt see go bhai due to its shallowness and convoluted finale still dont understand all the ancient stuff malgr that I played the Desmond scenes.Ubisoft is a treasure of a company unlike EA and Activision and that fact that Vivendi is trying to buy into that invests brain capital is worrisome to me as a gamer. I love games that take inspiration from history and being a pirate in the Caribbean was an instruction and great fun.So overall for me an 87. RPGs are my sort and repetition brought the score down. Optimisation too
