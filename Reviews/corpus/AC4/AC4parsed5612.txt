Very good game, free world and adventures awaits. Game mechanics are just awesome emerging you into almost movie like world. Just beware that its a console game and not designed for PC. Furthermore there are SERIOUS game breaking bugs, like i send my fleet out on safe routes only 3 returned, rest is hanging out there in a bug loop so i cant trade with my fleet anymore. Also you many times cant repair your ship coz its says nothing to repair. Also the menu system was never finished on release so its a big mess. Still i give this 8 out of 10. They could so easy made this a 9 out of 10 game but they released it unfinished and with major bugs.
