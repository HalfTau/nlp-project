Imagine assassins creed but with a nice ship battling system that is actually implicated enough to vary gameplay. This breaks up the monotony of the series and is also very fun. The port is solid as are the graphics. Only real complaint is there are a lot of pointless collectibles and the real life stuff gets annoying. moving around on ships is also kind of weird especially when going from sailbeam to sailbeam its easy to get caught on stuff.
