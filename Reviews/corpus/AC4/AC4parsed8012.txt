While this game is the best AC in my book, I wont be finishing it. I pushed past the repetitive feeling actions. I enjoyied the story. The game excedied my expectations. The code and ubisof screwed my experiance big time. After putting in alot of hours with the game, 53 complete, I experiance close to 40 crashes throughout two weeks. I have given up as my 53 profile is no longer available in game. I hate the online presence with ubisoft and prefer staem. Over all I say 20 is what this game should be worth due to the hastle.
