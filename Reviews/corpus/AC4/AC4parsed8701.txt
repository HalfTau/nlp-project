After the travesty that was AC3, I was about ready to be done with the Assassins Creed series. This game has renewed my faith in the franchise. Without a doubt the most open and spawling game in the series so far, as well as a protagonist that the player can really get behind. I havent had this much fun with an AC game since AC2. Lastly, and most importantly, you are essentially a ninjapirate. I mean, what is not to love?
