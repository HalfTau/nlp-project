First installment that actually was entertaining and fluid. Definitely had some effort put into this game and youll end up pouring more hours on your ship than you do parkouring like and  and shoving civilians out of your way.6/10 with 3 points being taken away from the annoying asfollowing/trailing missions. WHY ADD IT TO YOUR 3rd, 4th, or any other future title? NOBOY LIKES THIS 1 point being taken away because youre a PIRATE, yet looting and harrassing non targets is frowned upon....
