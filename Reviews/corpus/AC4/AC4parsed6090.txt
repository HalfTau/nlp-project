First and only game I have ever 100 percent completed. A blast to play all the way through and even fully upgraded the true final bosses float over to the coners of the map youll see what I mean Are still rediculously hard but somehow still fun. One of the best open world games Ive ever played, the best AC game still and enough strength behind the upgrades to keep you fed till you hit the end.Seriously my biggest complaint about the game is that there wasnt more of it. What I wouldnt give for another 2 games exactly like this. Never gonna happen but I could dream I guess.Also check dat play time.
