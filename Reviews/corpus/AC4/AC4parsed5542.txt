I own the all the ACs this is probably one of the franchises best instalments.Its got an actual metric sheet ton of stuff to do. Including pirate ship battles unlike any game you have ever played.Great story like all the assassins creeds.Multiplayer is dead except for a few die hards, so get that out of your head.You get a base island as well, nice spot to upgrade and plot your next evil deed.Bottom line is, really, Who doesnt like being a murderous pirate ?Game is still worth an easy 40 but its worth it and its probably even cheaper now.If you like pirates and murder this is all you ever wanted.Followers of the church of zordon you will love derpin in this game.Ominoh.
