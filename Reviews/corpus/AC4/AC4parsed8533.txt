I was initially going to stop playing this series after the last one, but this Assassins Creed is one of the best! The ship battles are abundant and fun to play strategy really comes into play when taking out multiple ships. The story itself is really interesting too. The main character isnt an assassin, but a pirate that happens to kill an assassin and pretend to be him. Play the game to find out if his ruse will work on those who were seeking the assassins services.
