This game, this game, this game. To put it shortly I LOVE this game. Many others do too. If you like pirates, DEFINATELY pick this up, if you like Assassins Creed, pick this up, if you like open world games, PICK THIS UP. There is SO MUCH stuff to do! And, its fun too. The naval battles are amazing, combats good, the freerunnings great, and the graphics are really great too. Also the sea shanties. I dont know why you would EVER want to turn them off, but they are great. It makes sailing really fun. The story is really good too. And Edward is probably one of the funniest, wittiest assassins ever. The music is great as well.Thats just the singleplayer.The multiplayer will leave you playing for hours, its really fun.Overall, if you buy this game, you will get MANY hours of enjoyment out of it. Have fun on the open seas!
