Black Flag is excellent. I was very pleasantly surprised with the melancholic and brutally realistic looks at pirate life, and they were well balanced with the joys of freedom and exploring and plundering. Treasure maps and sea shanties were the standout features, but I also enjoyed the variety of side stories and the gorgeous open sea. This game is worth playing even if youre not into the Assassins Creed series.Full review
