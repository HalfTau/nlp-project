After the intro sequence,you engage in the first hour of the game,where you impregnate a sea turtle and give birth to a bunch of baby assassin turtles that look so gothic you swear they were Hot Topic Hipsters,air assassinate boars and violently cut them till there is no flesh left,and have a emo whale commit suicide by jumping out infront of your ship.You then exit the Emous,and are greeted by a red hair emo pig ,who rants about how awesome it is to cut and feel depressed,she then takes you around shows the other emoswho all wear glasses,wear black clothing,black makeup,and have cuts on their wrists o.o,then I am compelled to go to the coffee stand and get some coffee.The guy yells,I DONT SEE NO CUTS ON THEM WRISTS BOI!! !So,I had to take out my hidden blade and slit my wrist just to get a cup of coffee.Then she takes me into the main lobby and she is greeted by another 4 eyed emo ,he headbangs her two times then talks to me about his day and how he sat in a tub all day with a knife.She then says,It is time to initiate our new guy into our suicide pact!So,he raises his hand towards me,showing all the cuts on his wrist,and yells some emo ritual and I am now part of a suicide pact.I enter the Emous and load the game,and the logo comes up with a fancy insignia that has a skull with a headshot,and the title,Emos Creed IVBlack Emo.10/10 would cut again.
