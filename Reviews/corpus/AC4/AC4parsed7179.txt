Optimized for PC, huh?  Despite having worse graphics than many titles, thing game is so poorly optimitzed for PC that it is super framey, and usually chugs along 4555 fps.  If I wanted the 30 fps experienced, Id have played this on the consoles.Beyond that, the controls are typically AC, which is to say super wonky.  When youre free running and climbing, youre constantly sticking to things you dont mean to, the context menu is always flashing around, and the controls are just kinda loose and sloppy in general.It also turns out that I hate stealth gameplay, but thats my subjective problem.Still, this game is a typical console developed AAA title that Ubi slaps together every year with little care or emphasis for the PC gamer.  It shows.
