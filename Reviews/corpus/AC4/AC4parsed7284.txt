Great game on console, just have not played it much on here. But it is worth your time. I find it to be a fun game... the only downside I have to say is you need to download Uplay that is a pain to set up. I took me some time to get my username changed from guest to BONESAW74. It is great other than Uplay. 9/10 because of Uplay
