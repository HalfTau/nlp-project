Downloading the game from steam, launching... Then the piece of garbage of uplay software pops up... new download, updating.... then time to log in... Oh I dont remember my password, so I ask for a reset... link does not come in the email box mail or spam folder... After 15 min, still nothing... the link might come tomorrow, but the game will be uninstalled...Shame on Ubisoft, for forcing us to install crappy DRM software, while we are playing with steam account...No more Ubisoft games for me by the way... That is for sure !
