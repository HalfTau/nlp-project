I liked it. Time to nitpick.The sailing is dull, youre on a boat in samy looking waters doing bugger all until one of three different types of ships decide to invade your personal space for whatever reason and you either blow them the heck out, or do nothing  mostly the latter because it really doesnt affect anything at all, youll have plenty of gold to upgrade your ship just by doing main quest line and the rest is aesthetics and upgrades for the water levels  oh yeah, it has underwater levels, because thats what audiences have been wishing for since Ocarina of Time More underwater levels.Somebody employed at Ubisoft still thinks that escorting a character while he/she explains and sets up the plot for the next boat ride to another darn boat battle is good storytelling.The amount of stabby you get to do is incredibly limited and the game is just too damn long by being artificially inflated by sailing about.I started out by being a good pirate and finding that one special set of armour thats in every assassins creed game, and its unlocked by killing some scrubs. Then you show up and you talk to some pleb and the plebs act like theyve known you for bloody ages even though youve never met them before, and theres one of them you dont even meet in the main quest even though these guys are pretty important.Then you do the stabbing  its okay I guess, pretty unremarkable really, but at least its not sailing unless you count the ages of sailing to get to the islands to get to the people to get to their throats to get to the key to get to the suit.Finally I got the suit, but it has no hood and good ol Kenway still does the putting hood on animation in every cutscene, as though hes tipping his imaginary fedora.The best part of the game is when you come to a city and they expect you, so it feels like Assassins Creed  the first one. Makes you feel like youre an actual threat as opposed to some arbitrary pleb.Had to climb up some building to kill the last guy contextually in stead of shooting him with my gun because he had plot armour out of nowhere.Basically the stabbing is sparse, the locations are, as thinly populated areas with something like 4 sheds tend to be, not well suited for assassinations, the animation bugs are stupid but not Unity stupid, the storytelling is garbage but at least its not AC3level, Kenway being able to do the things that a highly trained assassin can do is breaking the suspension of disbelief, the areas all look identical and theres just too much water.Now take what I said, and remove every complaint about how much the sailing sucked, because Ive heard its a really great pirate game, Im just not that into that kind of thing it seems.All in all6/10, a pirate game in the flavour of Assassins Creed because the title sells well.
