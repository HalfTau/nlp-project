The game is not meant for multiplayer, it is only meant for singleplayer because the game has no match making where they keep the same level people in the same level cap, so you got level 1s going up against level 28s. DO NOT GET FOR THE MULTIPLAYER, not that anyone wants to get an Assassins Creed just for the multiplayer because, lets face it, it is a singleplayer game. Again multiplayer bad singleplayer good. Maybe in the next AC game that they make, if it had Coop that would be fine.
