Gameplay was great, personally didnt care for the story at all since IMO the AC franchise kinda died with Desmond. Edwards story didnt really stick with me but his journey was definitely fun to go through, probably wont be playing it again. But its a fun timewaster if you pick it up during a sale. Also, disable VSync because it causes the game to really bog down during heavy action sequences
