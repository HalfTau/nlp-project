A refreshing take on the Assassins Creed series with a memorable protagonist during the pirate era, good gameplay, memorable characters, beautiful environments, a soundtrack suiting to my ears and last but not least great sailing mechanics and naval combat. This is the Ubisoft i admire just like in the early 2000s unlike nowadays.
