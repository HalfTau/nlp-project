A thing of absolute goddamn beauty!Tried a few of the older Assassins Creed games and never quite got on with the controls but as this one seemed to be a good jumping on for the later stuff I gave it a go and am VERY glad I did.Great action, fun combat both hand to hand and ship based and absolutely STUNNING to look at.Have just finished the main story. Its a game Ill now keep installed so when the mood takes me I can jump back into the world for an hour and go looking for new stuff to do as, like most open world games, you can finish it but only have completed 50 of what the maps promise. There are contract to take, sharks and whales to hunt and loads more.Oh, and being Cardiff born it rocked hearing so many Welsh accents in a game...even if one NPC I bumped into called me a sheep shagger  Only downside being Im now addicted to rum captain morgans of course and the wife has said shell punch me if I tell her I want to plunder her booty one more time.
