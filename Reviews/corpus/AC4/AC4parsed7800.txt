I enjoyed the start a lot, until the games actually breaks open and you become more of a pirate than an assassin.Ubisoft failed again to make a masterpiece, espacially after AC2, AC Brotherhood and AC Revelations.I am a fan of AC but if the next one is as bad as this one, i think i may give op on it.I still wonder what a pirate in the Carribean sea has to do with an assassin, whos strenght is to blend in and never been noticed.However it must been said that is allready better than AC3.And appearantly i suffered the same bug as many others and lost my save games.This sucks.UPDATEI have to say that i started the game a second time, and with a lot of patience, i even started to like it.To bypass the savegame bug, i manually coppied the savegames in an extern map on my pc.With that big part of my frustrations gone, i started to enjoy the game.It still is not as good as Brotherhood or Revelations, but it is actually fun when you start to know how to use that ship.
