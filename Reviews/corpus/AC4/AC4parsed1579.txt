Assassins Creed may not be my first experience in open world game, but the beauty of the games is beyond measure. Sure the graphic is sometimes bad, bad optimization display, Ufkingplay, but still the franchise has its own pheromone.As for a casual gamer like me, I dont really need 10/10 graphics. 7/10 graphics but 8/1010/10 storyline is enough to make me play for a whole day.Bottomline  This AC IV Black Flag is intoxicating.
