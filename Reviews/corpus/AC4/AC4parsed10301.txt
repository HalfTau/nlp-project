Easily one of the best AC games to date, the story is fairly solid and a nice break from the usual in the series.The pirate theme won the game for me, easily one of the best pirate based games ever made, with the ship battles actually being interactive, boarding ships a risk, and the customization worth the time spent to unlock.The world is HUGE, but in no way empty, and the introduction of social elements was a great idea, discover a naval treasure convoy? the game broadcasts its location to all of your friends.The combat seems like a small step back and sometimes becomes a little repetative what AC game didnt? but overall fits with the others.The only complaint a small one is that some things dont add up, the ability to do assassin contracts ect before you meet the assassins, doesnt quite make sense, but other than that well worth the price, and the time to play.Awesome graphics, great story, great gameplay.
