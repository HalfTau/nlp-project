This is a pirate game.Sid Meiers Pirates leaving a void? Play this. Nothing else will match it.Im a fan of the AC games, but honestly all the Templar/Assassin stuff was wearing a bit thin. The main character in this feels the same way. While it creeps in, this is a pirate game first and foremost, with some AC stuff tacked on. Same bad controls, same annoying present time stuff, but less of both.As a big age of sail enthusiast, some of the naval action, and inability to switch ships, turned me off early on, but the farther you get, the more it scratches that itch. Trust me, if you want a pirate game, play this. Youll be glad you did. Especially if you like the historical background of the Golden age of Piracy.More looting, more killing, more sailing, and more shanties. Good stuff.
