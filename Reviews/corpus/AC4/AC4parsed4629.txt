Well, i have much opinions about this game.Uplay. As long as it works, i mean, i can launch my game, i dont mind. But if Uplay denies my gaming experience, then i mind. Its shame how so good game series have gotten bad reputation because of 3rd party software.The game it self. Story is pretty linear. Assassins Creed series has been good in my opinion, but now, i feel like it has started to repeat itself. Yes, there is always something new, but there is so much same things from other Assassins Creed games. Like assassination contracts. Those were in AC games in AC2. And sailing was first shown in AC3 if im not wrong?There is plenty same things from past of this series, i can not even name them all.Sailing. It is cool, yes. It takes also alot of time. And if you get in toruble with pirate hunter, and dont really know what to do, you are totally screwed.Combat. It is just boring, and not challenging at all. its most likely 3 button combat system. also, Also enemies attacks you onebyone, making an fight even easier. Also they used COMPLETELY SAME ANIMATION AND EVERYTHING AS IN AC3. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT.Moving system. Its just UNBEARABLE. If the story wasnt good and and didnt hook me up, i would have stopped playing this game instantly. Again, they used same moving system as in AC3, and i am super, super dissapointed about this. This system just doesnt work, your character just jump around the places when you dont want to and doesnt jump there where you want to. I hate this game moving mechanic over anything else. I really cant understand what kind of so called potato counters did ubisoft take as coders. They didnt even finish the moving system. IT JUST SUCK.Thats really so far what i have to say about this game. There is much more to talk about, but i just cant. Overall, if you see this game on sales, like i did and got it for 4.99, i do recommend it. But i wouldnt pay full price for unfinished game.
