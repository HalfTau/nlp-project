I became totally invested in the life of Edward Kenway and his comrades. Loved the story admittedly this was my first Assassins Creed game, and it felt personal to Kenway rather than just another entry in the franchise.What did like? BEING A PIRATE. I was more interested in running my ship, navigating the sea, attacking convoys for plunder, and the thrill of boarding and seizing other ships. Skippering a ship through an intense battle, sometimes firing blind through layers of smoke and praying you can take down that manowar that clearly outguns you... havent had this much fun in a long time.Even after unlocking fast travel options, I preferred to take the time sailing as my crew sang sea shanties. I thought I heard the old man say Leave her, Johnny, leave her...The developers did a great job of making the cities feel active and alive with people, rather than sparsely populated with stiff mannequins.Things I was not too keen on sometimes the random weather and waves were actually repetitive. Example, when trying to dock my ship at a particular fort I had captured, a rogue wave would roll in from the same direction, over, and over, and over, and over forcing me to turn into it and sail away from the fort. After the wave passed, I would try to dock, only for the rogue wave to come at me again, like clockwork.There were some later gameplay sequences that were rather anticlimactic given the prior encounters I had to sweat through. You want that sense of accomplishment, as if you just climbed a mountain, at the end. It didnt quite hit the mark in terms the final challenge. I had a much tougher time steal rum from warehouses. For real.But in the end, I do love this game. And whenever I hear Parting Glass being sung, I get choked up.So fill to me the parting glassGood night and joy be with you all
