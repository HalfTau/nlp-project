One of the best games I have ever played. I didnt think itd take me almost 70 hours to complete one playthrough. I never got bored of it. I didnt want it to end and when I finally beat it last night, I was sad. It was a great ending with a beautiful song playing during the epilogue. Black Flag is the best game of the series and easily on my top 5 favorite games.
