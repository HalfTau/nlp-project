Why I love Pirate SimulatorThe last two words of that sentence should alone warrant you buying this game and playing it asap. It literally is a in pirate simulator. You command a crew and can continue to recruit scurvy seadogs to your collection of misfit plunderers, sail the open seas, your crew sings shantys, you can hoisten and lower the sails all damn day long, you can change the sails/wheel/figure, fight other ships and choose to either sink them or take over and impress captured sailors and add them to your crew while looting a lot of goods. Being that this is the Caribbean, you get a lot of rum, so I dont know why Captain Jack Sparrow was asking why its gone, theres plenty here. There are treasure maps, messages in a bottle, Blackbeard and other famous privateers of the early 18th century. You can hunt whales, sharks and a number of land animals. There are tiny islands out in the middle of nowhere that if you want, you can jump off your ship Errol Flynn style and just hang out for hours. You can visit Cuba before it became CUBA!! !But yes, this game is worth money. I cannot comment on the DLC because I dont have any of the expansions yet. Multiplayer for the most part is the same exact thing that its been although there seems to be some sort of developing storyline along the last 23 multiplayer parts of AC games. This is without a doubt the best AC game of the series, and may end up being the best overall, unless AC5 is set in like space or something.
