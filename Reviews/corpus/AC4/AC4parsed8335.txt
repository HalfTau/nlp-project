What a great game! So much to do and see, sailing the seas, pirating, pillaging... Great stuff! To be honest i lost intrest in the series after playing a bit of the second assassins creed, so i only have the first game under my buckle. But i must say after playing this one i might go back and complete the series. Even if you havent played the others though, Still highly recommend you play this one, great era, wooden frigates sailing the seas, was great playing a pirate captain! !
