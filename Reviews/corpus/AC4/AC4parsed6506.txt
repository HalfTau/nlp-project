I really really enjoyed this game. Mainly for the playing pirates part. You have awesome ship battles and can sail around the ocean looking for treasure, upgrading your ship, capturing other ships to add to your fleet, taking strongholds. I didnt like the stealth part too much. Youre on the one hand completely overpowered, but on the other hand, the controls are pretty annoying. Running and Free running are the same button. That means that sometimes you want to run up to stab a guy before guards get close but youll end up running up the side of a wall and falling back down by accident. The loot body, pick up body, drop off a ledge, sheath your weapon, and counter button are also all mapped to the same button. This means sometimes you want to move a body real fast but instead hang off a ledge. Sometimes you want to be in counter stance in a sword fight but end up putting your swords away. The other side of this is that other than fighting the controls, no fight is really challenging. The guard AI also forgets where you were really fast. But the sailing the ocean on a pirate ship is so fun it makes it all worth it.
