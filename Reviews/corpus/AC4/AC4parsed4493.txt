I also made a video review of this game.Assassins Creed IV Black FlagPROSWell developed characters. Thatch/Blackbeard was a personal favorite. The characters are the story.Fun battles between ships on the open seas.Cool assassination animations.A lot of customization with your ship and weapons is available.Sea storms are awesome, period.A vast world to explore and a lot to find in it.Sea shanties are really cool.Great combat.CONSStory seems very shallow and pointless overall.Really dumb that they had to make this an AC game, it should just be a pirate game, I hated the Abstergoin between big parts of the game.No replay value whatsoever.Uplay is a .Ending was somewhat confusing.Why do I have to climb everything?8.7/10 Assassins Creed IV Black Flag My Rating90 Steam Ratings
