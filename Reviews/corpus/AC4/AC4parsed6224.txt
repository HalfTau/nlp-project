I really enjoyed AC4 and its surely the best of the series so far. The naval combat and exploration add some much needed variety to the gameplay. I bought the game for 7.5 euros and it was totally worth the money. Some of the best graphics Ive ever seen GTX 970 Naval combat and upgrading your ship Very little outofanimus gameplay Lots of gameplay variety for an AC title Beautiful animations with a lot of variety Tons of exploration and side activities Short main story and all the interesting characters get killed too early. You can probably finish the story in less than 8 hours so do yourself a favour and spend some time on the side missions too. There are a million ways to obtain money but nothing to spend it on. You can buy the best weapon in game during the first chapter. Upgrading your ship costs a lot but theres no need to upgrade your ship if you just play the story. Fighting is too easy you dont really have to sneak around because you can easily kill any number of emenies in combat even with the starting weapons. Poor character customization options just like in the previous titles. Side activities get boring really fast. It can take over 100 hours to complete everything the game has to offer but in the long run its not very fun to wander around for no reason collecting pointless animus fragments and chests full of money you dont need. Some VSync issues. The game tends to lock to 30FPS while using VSync in GPU intensive areas. You can solve the problem in Windows 7 by pressing CtrlAltDel and then alttabbing back to the game. That way your FPS wont lock to 30 and theres still no screen tearing. Overall its a great game but it wont keep you entertained for very long. I totally recommend it.
