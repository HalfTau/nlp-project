From the improved textures to the sunlight streaming through the trees this is the best looking AC game to date. The pirate life may not be for everyone but it adds a nice twist to the gameplay. Sailing the open seas and blasting other ships with cannons is fun but can get boring after boarding the 1000 schooner or frigate. Finally we get to go under water but is only limited to certain areas. My biggest complaint with this game is the Assissins vs Templars fued takes a back seat through out the story. Not to say its bad but I feel like Ubisoft could spin this off as its own pirate game instead of AC. Its still a fun game but would recommend waiting to pick it up on a steam sale. Overall a good purchase for any AC fan like myself.
