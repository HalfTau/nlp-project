The best Assassin Creed game yet. It diverted little from the fight of templars and assassins and focused on pirates, plundering and sailing, this was great choice. Your ship Jackdaw is your home and you can sail trhough Caribbean, destroying and plundering Spanish and English fleet, exploring Kingston or Havana or many exotic islands and locations. Pirating and upgrading your ship can be pretty addictive. The part of the game in present day is again boring and useless, they should just present it as short animated sequences and let us rather play more in great historical periods.
