Dont buy it, The game doesnt work AC4BFSP has stopped working, and UBISOFT dont seem to be in any hurry to fix it.After being able to play this game thanks to the Steam Community for finding a fix, it has to be 1 of the best pirate game ever, shame it owned by UBISOFT who dont care abaut PC community and patching the AC4BFSP has stopped working problem, but if you dont mind messing about with files then i would recommend this game, but at the moment BLACK FLAG has a warning label like cig, buy at your own risk and fix it your self.
