This is by far one of the best Assassins Creed games Ive played to date. AC3 was good, a let downn story wise, however Black flag is top notch. It has an interesting story topped with good gameplay elements, the ship controls are for better and is one of if not thee highlights of the game itself. Sailing in Blackflag has been one of my favourite experiances ever, I have always been a fan of ship combat and untill now i havent felt it had been captured well.Overall it is just pure enjoyable, youll be pouring the hours into this game.You will not be disappointed.
