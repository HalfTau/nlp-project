Black Flag brings exploration in the Assassins Creed series to another level. I love the ship mechanics, easy parkour system, and so much more awesome features that make this the best game in the series yet. Although you dont feel a connection to Edward Kenway like you do with some of the earlier assassins, he has an enjoyable story and awesome background.There is not only many upgrades for Kenways weapons such as new gun holsters and health upgrades but there is upgrades for your shp as well. Seafaring the ship and exploring is so fun and the hunting and crafting is straightforward and easy to do. The setting, the beautiful Caribbean, is beautiful and amazing to explore and the graphics make it all the better.Id recomend this game to adventurerers, parkour lovers, and most definitley people who love great combat systems.
