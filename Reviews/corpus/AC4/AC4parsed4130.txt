The absolute tiptop epitomy of boredom, of all the games Ive played in the past 5 years or so.The amount of mind numbing filler in the game is ASTOUNDING. Why would anyone  ANYONE subject themselves to it is simply way beyond me. I just wanted to blast through the story, but about 70 of the way through, not having completed any filler sidequests caught up with me where a mission required of me to have a very strong ship, which would cost at least 3hours worth of grinding in money for ship upgrades.This was the point where I uninstalled.Aside from thatLooks amazing.Plot feels rushed and inconsequential, due to developers efforts being poured into the bland snoozefest of open world design.10/10 sea shanties.horrid sound engineering, playing with headphones at top system and game volume, was still fairly quiet
