This is the best AC game to date.  It takes nearly all of the best from the previous generations and adds new and expanded elemements of seabased combat into the mix.  The story may not wow, pending on how you felt about the other games story but the gameplay is fun.  PC version however suffers from LOW FPS even on the most powerfull of systems, Ubisoft claims ignorance so it may never be fixed.
