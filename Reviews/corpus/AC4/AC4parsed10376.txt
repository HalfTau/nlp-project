Great game I love it. You get to lead your own ship as a pirate, gain your crew, pgrade your ship, and get into action packed battles at sea, but you still get the full Assassins Creed experience! I find this game very enjoyable and emersive. The story is great so far. I recommend you drop that 60 dollars on this game. You wont regret it!
