Assassins Creed IV is an amazing game plagued by a terrible game breaking bug. For some reason or another, on login you will find that HOURS of your progress has been deleted. For me, the first time was about 2 hours. The second time, I lost 6 hours of gameplay. This is unnaceptable, and it has been a problem since launch. Do some research and you will find that hundreds or even thousands of players are experiencing this issue, and after 4 months Ubisoft has said nothing about it. It is a shame that a game as good as AC4 is plagued on the PC by poor optimization and a terrible cloud save system that turned what couldve been a great game into a reason to boycot Ubisoft. Unfortunately, I cannot play this game until Ubisoft fixes this issue, as more play time will just be deleted. I have decided against buying any further Ubisoft products until further notice.
