Can be summarized as a pirate simulator! If you love pirates this game is just awesome. Most of the game takes place on the sea and really captures the pirate feeling as you loot ships, dive and explore islands. The chores like synchronize/fragments etc are antifun though but those who feel the need to obtain them for a sense of completion have no choice. The story is quite short and about 3/4 of the game time was spent looting, exploring, and doing side activities. This is a game that if it wasnt for all the repetitive chores, you would want it to go on forever.Personal experience score 9.5/10Story 9.5/10  A pirate story, very awesome but suffers from being too short.Sound 9/10  Good, would have liked to hear more pirate themed shantiesGraphics 8/10  Very good. However even with a GTX960 this game stutters in heavy foliage areas. Turning off aliasing fixes most of thisControls 9/10  Controls seem better than AC3, but still tries to climb everything or jump where not desiredGame Length 9/10  About 5 hours including all chores / side activities and Freedom Cry which is a AC4 DLC.
