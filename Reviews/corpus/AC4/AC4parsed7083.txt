This game can be broken into three parts Playing as a pirate doing anything you want because a pirate is free, An assassin vs templar war your character is thrown into, and the overarching story bringing all assassin creed  games together with the animus. The pirating is a blast! The moment you start controlling a ship you feel This is something else. The whole war between assassin and templars feels like a story that has been forced on you and even the main character doesnt seem thrilled about it. He was a pirate that happened to land in the role of an assassin doing what a pirate does, trying to make enough money to not have to worry about money again. The over arching stories of Assassins Creed is really interesting and a little more of it gets added with each game, however with game five unity coming up and it is not in the future it will clearly not be resolved. If you buy every assassins creed game when it was new it would cost 360 if you only found the over arching story of ancestor exploration through genes. Which in this game you walk around with a tablet in an office and end up hacking terminals for the guy in IT.I would pick this game up on sale or rent because the pirating world of this game could have been its own AAA title without the assassin creed tag.
