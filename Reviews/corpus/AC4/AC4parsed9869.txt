This is what an Assassins Creed game should be like.Despite the main character not being an assassin for 3/4th of the game its got a better main character than 3 and a more fun one than Ezio.It greatly depicts the ending of the pirate era and has an overal nice looking setting. Theres always SOMETHING at whatever given moment youre sailing.The game overall has taken the Sailing from AC3 and improved upon it and made a game around it. The pirating stays fun and theres actually a feel of limit to your ship. You cant go out and take on a ManoWar without upgrades. Whats considered a downside is that you cant switch ships, or that there isnt Naval Combat in Multiplayer wich is the same as ever, fun for a while, but dull afterwards.The missions can be a bit onesided, consisting mainly of Tail this guy or Listen in on this conversation, but thats what AC1 was all about and everyone still glorifies that. And it actually made me feel more like an assassin, despite the lack of variety.Theres too many things to widely discuss, but overall a great game and a definite recommendation. A certain competitor for GOTY.
