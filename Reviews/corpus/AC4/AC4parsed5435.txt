Fan of Assassin Creed franchise? No? I wasnt myself, the games seemed a bit, well... Lets just say repetitive. Well I am a fan of old Pirate games. Very big fan, and this game just happened to hit the jackpot with the gold right their. Pun intendedAssassins Creed Black Flag is the game for you, trust me its worth the money how it is, I havent purchased any DLCs yet and its amazing.
