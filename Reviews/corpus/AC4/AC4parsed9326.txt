Love this game, beautiful, fluid. My only complaint is that it is very easy to lose your way and thereby lose the story. Distractions can distract for HOURS and by that stage you have forgotten what mission you are on. The gameplay however is excellent and I have pumped 30 hours into this game and am only 40 through it.
