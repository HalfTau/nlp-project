Easily in my top 10 games of all time list, this game is worth buying to hear the soundtrack alone. I adore this game to pieces! The main, and one of the only things that bothers me, is that the cities feel quite lackluster and dont have much personality like they do in earlier Assassins Creed games. Other than that, they took what they had created in Assassins Creed III and developed it into a true masterpiece. I can heartily recommend this game.
