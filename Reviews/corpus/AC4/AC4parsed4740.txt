I was really enjoying this game, and was almost done with it, but then it decided to delete my save. I do not understand how a saved game stored on their server could be deleted. This makes it impossible for me to recommend this game, and I will never find out the ending. I may read it eventually. Sad that such a large franchise has such a significant bug that has been reported a lot, and not addressed. Uninstalled.
