This is the best pirate game I have ever played. It is also one of the worst Assassins Creed games. However, if you can look past the Assassins Creed branding, it has a good story and being able to be a pirate is awesome. I mean, you can even have your crew sing songs why sailing across the Carribean.If you were looking for a strong addition to the Assassin Creed story, then this isnt for you. For everyone else, who doesnt love pirates?
