Ubisoft have proved that they could make a best carribean pirate game in the history. Yet they have decided not to do that.Great cinematics, good story, some incredibly immersive details. But there are some mechanics in this game that might make You hate Ubisoft for ruining Your pleasure. The trading mechanic is just a dumb minigame. Crafting also is just a minigame for the marketing department to claim that there is one. Upgrades are dumb and linear.I would also like to challange the developers at Ubisoft to show me at least one brig in the world that had a ram installed.I wish, a russian developer team NMG in 1995 had this engine when they made their game Sea Legends.I recommend this game only because the sailing part is really good and makes this game worth the price.
