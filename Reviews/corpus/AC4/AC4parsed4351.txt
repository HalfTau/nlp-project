Since I got this game I havent been able to put it down. The ship combat is amazingly fun and while boarding ships does get repetetive I still enjoy it a helluva a lot. The characters are well written and very memorable. I have noticed in a lot of Assassins Creed games the recording quality of some of the backround noises and other things are absolutley horrendus, the cheering you get when you succesfully harpoon a shark or a whale sounds like something out of a Win 98 era. The world is large and fun to explore with amazing visuals and fun random events, overall I would recommend this game to anyone who has not already played it, I mean  Pirates man, how could you go wrong with Pirates!
