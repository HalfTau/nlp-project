The gameplay is fantastic. Really, it is!I havent had any issues with uPlay or the like at all.The story so far seems interesting enough.But I do have one issue with it, and thats the graphics.See, my laptop is, admittedly, a bit old. Its not really primed for these kinds of games.I can run AC3 at allHigh settings at a resolution of 1360x768. Same, oddly, with MGSV.I was hoping to do the same with this, but unfortunately I cant.Instead of scaling the resolution to match your screen, it keeps it in a black border. This means that I have to squint.And this wouldnt be so bad were it not that, even when I change my desktop resolution to match, it stays bordered.I initially refunded this game, but Im willing to give it a shot with some tinkering. I just wish the graphics customizationwas a bit better implemented.Overall, Id give it a 7.58/10.
