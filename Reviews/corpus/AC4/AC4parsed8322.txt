This game is actually very good. Assassins Creed is not a series that I can play every year, the last ones Ive played were 1 and 2. Black Flag actually feels like a good step foward primarily due to the much more open ended world, and of course, the ship mechanics. The only draw back that I have is that the main missions feels somewhat repetitive, its always listen to someone for 5 minutes, then kill someone. Despite the small set back, the ship mechanics and missions pertaining to upgrading the ship more than makes up for the story missions.
