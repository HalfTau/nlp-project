The gameplay is awesome, combining improved stealth and combat with Caribbean cities and ship sailing. Its really the only triple A pirate game, like how Red Dead Redemption is easily the best Wild West game. The story is much better than its predecessors, having a likeable but dynamic character and humanizing pirates beyond their legendary status. All around, Id say to give it a go if you like pirate games or travelling, even if you didnt enjoy the last ones.
