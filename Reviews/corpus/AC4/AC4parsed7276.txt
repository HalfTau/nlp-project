Possibly my favorite of the AC series. Initially, the amount of things to do is rather time consuming and at times, overwhelming, but personally I found the game to be rather enjoyable. Visually striking and an in depth story really made the hours pass by. Whether it was sailing the seas for ships to plunder, or completing missions for the pistol swords, Mayan Armor, and Templar Keys, there was never a boring moment. Cant wait to see what Ubi has in store with AC Unity
