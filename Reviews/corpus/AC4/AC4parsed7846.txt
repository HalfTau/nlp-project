Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is the usual Assassins Creed game, with open world exploration, free running, epic combat and a historical setting. This time, however, the setting is 18th century Caribbean and that means pirates. Assassins Creed and pirates, need I say more? PWhile the modern arc of the storyline is really weird, I found that the historical arc was very interesting and engaging. Definitely a major improvement over Assassins Creed III. The combat system is even more advanced that ever, with the usual counterkills and assassination moves, but now including even more pistol usage and interaction with the world around you. Naval combat, being the main focus of the game, has been revamped and upgraded since the previous title. One thing I did notice was that compared to previous Assassins Creed games, makng money in order to buy new weapons, outfits and upgrade your ship and mansion was a lot more difficult.Black Flag was a really fun game to play and I highly recommend getting it, especially if youre a fan of the Assassins Creed series. Or pirates. P
