Its the type of game where you can play 2hrs of the main story and then go do your own stuff, discover the world, level up and spend a few dozend hours having a blast, and when you check your actual progress you see youve only advanced only 15 of the main story. It is massive and full of content. Ive had similar experiences in that regard with Skyrim and Far Cry 3.
