After the dissapointment that was Assassins Creed 3, Black Flag really was a surprise. The developers have managed to create an interesting group of characters straight from the history books Calico Jack, Blackbeard, Anne Bonny etc. but added their own creative twist to them all. The sailing mechanics introduced in AC3 are even better this time around and for once the side quests are really worth playing. The storyline is a bit difficult to follow and it has some weird time jumps that are never really explained, but the events that take place are are captivating and the player character really evolves from a scurrvy roque to a true assassin. All in all, 4/5 would play again!
