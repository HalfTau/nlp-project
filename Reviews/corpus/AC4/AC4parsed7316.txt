I was skeptical of this game for a long time because Id found Ezio to be such an unlikeable character with no redeeming qualities and theyd clung onto him for so long I thought chavvy boys were their only target audience now. I really neednt have worried. This is hands down the best game, even from an AAA company, that I have played in years the main character is truly an epic man, and even though all he seems to care about is money hes a pirate after all, I cant help but really like the guy.This game is full of epic sword fights, ship battles, sailing, looting, pillaging, and obviously plenty of parkour and assassinating too. AC IV is basically everything you ever dreamed a Pirates of the Caribbean game might be, but with ninjas too.
