The game is fun, for about 3 seconds, until you realize your frames drop from 60 to 30 every .5 seconds, and after you try everything, you look it up on google, and find everyone else has the same problem. 0/10 wouldnt buy on PC.Other than that, the game is 8/10, use to have it for Xbox, lost my copy, decided to get it for PC, and was dissapointed.
