Its hard to imagine how Connor from AC III has no charisma, since hes grandson of Edward Kenway. A very cool guy,  and a character that makes you want to play more and more to know everything about him. And he is the main character of a perfect game. Black Flag, like AC III, gives you the freedom to hunt animals all over land, in a bigger map. But is more than that, you also can hunt whales and sharks. THIS IS AWESOME. You can spend hours just sailing and hearing the shanties. This time the story has more fantasy details. But the piracy system works perfectly. And again, this is not an Assassins Creed game, just has the name. The DLC, its way more loyal to the Assassins Order and Adewale really is an Assassin, different from Connor and Edward, who are just themselves, but Edward is way more charismatic and fun to play. The game presents iconic pirates like Black Beard, Anne Bonny, Mary Read who in the start posed as James Kidd, an illegitimate son of the late William Kidd, in order to facilitate her career as a pirate. And is fantastic how the game was able to develop all this characters, and more, in a very curious and so fittable in just one game.
