While the story missions tend to suck especially the eavesdrop ones. The free roaming and ship to ship combat are unbelievably fun. Its a shame they didnt add ship warfare to the multiplayer. Needless to say this game is pretty amazing. Less of a Assassins Creed game and more of a Pirate game. And when I mention pirates I mean more on the line of Master and Commander and less of Pirates of the Caribbean garbage.9/10
