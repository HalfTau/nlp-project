Had pirated version but wanted to be able to do kenways fleet and get additional content so i figured id take the time and buy it and the damn game wont even create a savegame file in the file systems because of uplay i found out after reading an unlimited amount of angry uplay comments wrote by people having same problem. went back to pirated version. not worth the money until ubisoft eradicates uplay. 10/10 game if pirated tho
