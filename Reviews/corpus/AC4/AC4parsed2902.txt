Play Black Flag was great, its an excellent game filled with places for you to explore.For completionists out there this game is great for you getting 100  doesnt get too repetitive like in other games on the contrary things like assassin contracts and naval contracts keep it interesting!As for the story, definetly amazing and brought me into the AC series!
