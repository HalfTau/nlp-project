Now that my journey as a pirate has come to an end is time to make a small but incisive reviewThis is one of the best games ive played! Ever! I just loved the plot, i mean the story was so immersive and theres is so much to do. The graphics where stunning but with a disapointment, which is, it cant be played at 144hz, only 60hz. So with my 144hz 2K 1ms Gsync monitor i felt kinda sad, because if you know what 144hz gsync gaming is, you know what im talking about, and 60hz just hurts your eyes.Thank you ubisoft for making this game, and i apologize for not having played it sooner.Im off to AC Rogue now, wish me luck. road2origins
