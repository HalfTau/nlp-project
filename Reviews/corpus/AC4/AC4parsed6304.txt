Its a very good game and only gets better as you progress through the story, Probably the best Assassins Creed yet. The only thing I dont like about it is the Naval Combat, Its not bad I just dont like to do it and what is quite annoying is how you cant take a ship after you board and add it to your fleet, you have to stick with the Jackdaw which is dissapointing but none the less a great game.
