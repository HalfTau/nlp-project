Had an amazing time with this game. The best Assassins Creed game after Assassins Creed 2. The story, albeit slow, is amazing. The combat mechanics has improved. Totaly like the dual cutlass. The main focus is on the sea where you travelled between islands with your ship, the Jackdaw. You can upgrade and customize your ship. Now the secondary objectives only applies to the story mission. You can play on the sea all day long pirating, attacking ships, plundering, harpooning, diving etc. The music is great too, especially the Jackdaws radio. The Kenways Fleet minigame is good for extra income and you can play it with your smart devices by installing their app. Multiplayer is awesome as always. It got Game Lab mode which allows you to customize a game. Wolfpack coop mode also got improved.The parts that I dont like is lack of weapons. In this game, you only have cutlass and hidden blade for combat. No small weapons anymore like previous game. But you got pistols, 4 of them which is good. Assassination missions are same and boring, but the final reward is awesome pistol sword FTW XD. No more silent ranged assassination since no bow or crossbow. Dunno pirates dont like bows. The main villain didnt get much spotlight and kinda forgettable. Collecting uncharted chests and Animus fragments is a hassle.This game deserve 9/10. Totally worth it.
