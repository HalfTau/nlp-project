Assassins Creed IV Black Flag ReviewAhoy m8! Ready to sail the Caribbean? Assassins Creed IV lets you do just that. Assassins Creed IV is a large stepup from Assassins Creed III. The naval combat is much improved and sailing around is generally a good time. The graphics are beautiful if your GPU can handle it. They made huge strides to improve ambient life and vegetation, and it really paid off. Everything is an improvement, except one thing. I feel like I was cheated out of land battles and exploration on land. The 3 cities you get are not enough for my type of exploration. Another city would have made this game a 9.9/10 for me. Having said that, I give this game a good 9/10. Solid, compelling, innovative, fresh, and most importantly fun.
