ProsShip combat is fun.Visual effects are near icEdward is a sexy welsh wizard.PiratesNo desmond YAYAble to explore underwater, above water and islands.ConsThe A.I is slightly buggy.Missions and sidemissions become repetitive.Many times it was quicker to hack and slash instead of stealth, with no punishment for doing this, i chose hack n slash over stealth.Able to fix your ship mid battle by boarding an enemy ship you defeated, enemies just stop firing at you.Out of animus story was silly and boring.Sounds out of sync sometimes.Despite the cons, i highly enjoyed the game and only noticed these cons nearing the end of the story. I cannot compare this game to all the others since ive only played AC1AC2 but i enjoyed this a lot more.I loved it.den oudda den
