This is by far my favorite AC game in the series to date writing this ater Unity is out, Syndicate not yet released. There is something awesome about being a pirate in addition to an assassin, and I suppose for people like myself who always dreamed as a kid of being a pirate, it is just even more awesome. Would totally recommend to anyone!
