I have played this game apx 100hours and I can definetely recommend it. Actually as I have an experience with previous AC games, this part is more about pirate action then assassins deals, but finaly I can say thats good balanced and maybe pirate action was more exciting for me. So YES, I can recommend this game for a good action relaxing with AC theme as a fascinating background.
