Id heard and seen some very good things about Black Flag, but was not quite prepared for this return to form for the Assassins Creed series.Without hyperbole, this is pretty much as close to a perfect game about piracy as the gaming industry has had since it began. Ubisoft Montreal have really nailed the feel of the open waves, with your crew singing sea shanties and yelling out to you about incoming ships or men overboard. For a game about a vast open ocean, there really is a lot to explore and do, from hidden treasures to taking down forts and legendary ships.Once you hit land, however, it is the same old Assassins Creed. Running rooftops and trailing people to learn about and assassinate them, you know the drill. But this time there is the itch to go back to plundering which the game is only to glad to scratch.The weird alien future story really doesnt come up that much and there is a quite a bit of meta based humour and self reflection to it. Overall it feels less shoehorned in than in previous games in the series.Brilliant stuff. A true turn around.
