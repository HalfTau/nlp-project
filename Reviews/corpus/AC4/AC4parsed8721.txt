If youre new to Assassins Creed, or a history buff like me, theres no better place to start than this game! Great graphics if your PC can handle it, great story without spoiling anything, the ending will have you in tears, awesome atmosphere, excellent gameplay, this game has it all! If you always had a fascination with the pirates of old, like conspiracy theories, or simply want an excellent openworld game while waiting for Grand Theft Auto V to come out on PC, this is more than worth the 60/80!
