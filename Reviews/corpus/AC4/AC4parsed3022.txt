I have no words...This game is a flashback for me, because I used to play the original AC on my dads Xbox 360, but I never played that much.I also played Pirates Of The Carribean Online when it was at its peak, when I was a kid.I would recommend it to anyone that played POTCO, and to anyone thats a fan of the AC series.
