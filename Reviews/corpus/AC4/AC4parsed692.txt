Definitely my favorite game in the series so far subject to change, as Im writing this 2 days prior to the launch of AC Origins. My only issue with it is that the mandatory Assassin parts of the storyline actually detract from the far superior openworld pirate sections of the game. Im not even going to mention the Abstergo interludes.All in all, it would have been a flawless game if it simply ditched the AC franchise and was its own pirate adventure.
