Oh wow. I actually dont really care for the Assassins Creed games. They were never interesting to me nor were the stories anything that struck me as anything I wished to experience. But when I first saw things for Black Flag I believed it might be something Id be very interested in...and holy crap it is.The way I see it...this is probably the BEST pirate game Ive ever played. It also has the bonus of having Assassins Creed gameplay in it as well. The stealth parts arent too bad but honestly I came for the pirate high seas gameplay and it certainly doesnt dissapoint. I highly reccomend this because its something different, in a most wonderful, amazing way for the series!
