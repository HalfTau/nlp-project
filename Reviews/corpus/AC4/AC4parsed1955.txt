Wow, just WOW! I wasnt expecting something like that from Ubisoft.Amazing graphics, HUGE OPEN WORLD WITH TONS OF THINGS TO DO Islands, smugglers caves, a lot of AWESOME collectables everything done with a big attention to details.Dont except an AC story, except an PIRATE STORY ! And is one of the best.If I were to recomend a game to someone, would 100 be AC IV Black Flag !Just buy it, and hope for a new AC game done like that  IMPROVED  PLEASE UBI, HAVE THIS HAPPEN !!!!
