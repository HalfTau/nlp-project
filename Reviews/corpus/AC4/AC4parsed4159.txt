The best Assassins Creed Ive ever played, and I played 5. If you like pirating, sailing, naval battles  you MUST play this game.Not only, that the missions are quite interesting  I loved just to hear gunfire somewhere far, just to look around and find a naval battle being fought somewhere far... I loved watching those battles, at day, at night, in the sun, in the rain...I loved it.PS. Assassins Creed Rouge is not that good
