Pirates and ninjas! Sort of.What is to be said? Much ink has been used to describe the AC franchise, and I for one have put in my two cents at a couple of times. As I have played 13 in the installments I can say Black Flag is the best of the bunch. That sadly doesnt mean I really like it.I love the exploration.I love the pirating.Where this game falls short is the Assassins Creed bits. The stealth is cluncy, the worlds illogical in its own universe and the story missions only interesting when they are about the pirate half of the game.The graphics are good, still. The audio production is splendid. The storms are brilliant and very lifelike, as lifelike moving polygons can be.I havent finished the story yet, because of the abysmal AC missions. I spent my time raiding ships and that is where Black Flags strength lies.
