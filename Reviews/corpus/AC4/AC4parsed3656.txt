How in the world am I not able to run this game. I can run Hitman Absolution and Bioshock Infinite in 4k, and I can max out the Witcher 2 on Ultra and can very comfortably run the Witcher 3 at around high. Why on gods green earth am I not able to run a game this undemanding at least 3040 frames on high. Even if I try to lower the settings to their bare minimum I still get practically the same frames.I refunded the game almost immediately. If youre planning on buying this, purchase it first, try it out, and return it if you run into issues immediately...
