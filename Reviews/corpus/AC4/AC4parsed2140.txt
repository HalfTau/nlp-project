Here is my honest opinion after 70 hours of this gameThe main storyline in the beginning was very entertaining but the further I got into it the worse it became eventually at the end I just wanted to get through it,and it was a really bad experience.Despite this the SIDE MISSIONS are just wonderful,atleast I enjoyed them even thought Im the kind of person who hates grinding.The scene is beautiful and there is a lot to do in the Caribbeans.Unfortunately I often had bugs in combat when I wanted to do things fast to pull off a fancy combo but aside from that the game was correct.All in all I would recommend it for those who like open world games and pirate adventure.8.5/10
