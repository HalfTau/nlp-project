This is one of the best launch games ive played by far. the difference between this and the last creed game thath aciii was a slow linear mess that included a boring character, where as ac4 is a nice paced, free roam, priate simulator. about 2 hours in after the tutorial of creeds mechanics and character backstory, you immediatly grab hold of your own ship and begin the pirating which consists of weakening ships to near death, and then boarding killing sailors, from there you choose to either use the ships dead carcass to repair your own, barter with the military to lower your wanted level, or send it to use in the fleet mingame that earns you money by sending out ships to do minimissions, which is something taken from previous creed game,the story is interesting, while short compared to ac2 the only creed game i completed. The interesting part of this game are the side guest and little things you can do to earn money and resources, like using a diving bell to search sunken ships, sinking valuable convoys, templar mcontracts and assassanation missions.For an annual francise, there is a ton to do in this game, i recommend you buy it on nextgen, since the pc version may not be as optimized for everyone, even for highend ones
