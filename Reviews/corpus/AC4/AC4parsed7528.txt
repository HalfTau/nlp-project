Arr is it a Pirates life for you?Well then go get Sid Meiers pirates! That game has better pirate game play and managing then thisASS ins Creed game.But if you want a game that is similar toASS ins Creed three without all the stupid stuff but more of the exciting stuff like sailing then this is the game for you.Assassins creed IV is the 6th game in the franchises NOT including the 10 spin off games that we will no longer mention this review and by the looks of how much money they are making there will probably make a fk ton more.Lets start with the story ofASSins creed Black In the Animus you are Edward Kenway a drunk who pirates on the side and looks alot like the blonde guy in that Pirates porn film. Now when you think of Pirates do you think of parkour spec ops fighters? No! So why does this Pirate just so happen to know every skill that an Assassin does just by putting on a uniform?No Idea! But What does it matter it anAssins creed game and by fk is this story better then the one out of the Animus.Out side of the Animus you are a faceless, voiceless, corporate zombie employe of Abstergo which is a shorter story then the other present day stories in the other game but two times more stupid. You are asked to break the law and send sensitive classified information to people who dont give a fk about you and your happywill do it  EVEN THOUGH YOUR A BAND NEW EMPLOYEE AND I DONT CARE HOW YOU THE PLAYER KNOWS THAT ABSTERGO ARE THE BAD GUYS THE CHARACTER DOES NOT KNOW THAT AND NO IS THAT STUPID JUST TO FALL FOR THIS LITTLE OH YEA YOU CO WORKERS ASKED YOU TO GIVE ME CLASSIFIED INFORMATION FROM YOUR COMPUTER THAT YOU HAVE TO HACK INTO...Sorry got a little out of hand there where was I?Game play can be a bit glitchy when you ask Kenway to run straight and he ends up running up a wall that only lets you go half way when you are being chased by 50 armed soldiers who all want to mess your St up. But the world you explore is huge there are loads of collectables that you will spend a good longtime to collect which I do find fun.They Also brought back the sailing fromAssins creed 3 duh and I always have a blast sailing through the seas blowing up any ship that looks at me funny.All in all I really like Assassins creed 4 spite the whole story that takes place out of the Animus which is getting dumber and dumber They already saved the world why do we even care anymore, you cant go from the world is going to end to these mean old white men want to take more taxes and take away my right to vote.
