At first I was afraid of sailing into restricted areas. I was careful, I avoided ships.Now, 20 hours in, I laugh when I sail into restricted areas and some Spanish Frigate starts shooting its worthless cannons at me. I just turn my ship towards them and let them have a taste of my own fireballs. Safe to say, Im not afraid anymore.But those damn Legendary ships, I still stay away from those.. Any ship that has its own cutscene in freeroam mode is terrifying.
