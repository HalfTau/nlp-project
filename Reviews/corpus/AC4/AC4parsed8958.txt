I have been an Assassins creed fan sense the first one. Ive always thought the story lines were profound. The story line for Black Flage  does not dissapoint at all but gives a new twist and its enjoyable. Also, it does not seem as repetitive as the others which is nice. I would  give this game a 10/10, but Im also a hard core fan so some might see it as a 8 or 9 out 10.
