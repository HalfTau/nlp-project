Running on 1070 / i7 7700k / SSD, this game displays spikes from 30 to 60 fps NPCs constantly materializing in front of you, way to break immersion.I am running it at high detail not very high with no particles, god rays and other eye candy.Id say that if this was better optimized, it might be a fun pirate game. But otherwise I cannot recommend it.
