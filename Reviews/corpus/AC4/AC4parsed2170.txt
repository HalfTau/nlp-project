By far the best experience I have ever had in an Assasins Creed game, and arguably, the best Assasins Creed purchase I have ever made. I think they should focus more on adventure in their next game than the action, leaves a much more appealing and lasting experience. A must buy for any serious gamer, just watch out for the settings though, needs some highend hardware to run it on ultra 60FPS FHD.
