Awesome game aside from the normal annoying assassins creed controls,  but dont let that bother you if youre thinking about buying this. Im playing on everything at minimum even the resolution 800x600 i think it was, averaging 1015 fps still very playable on a geforce 610 2gb graphics card, windows 7, 12gb ram, and quad core 3.2ghz. My only complaint is when it rains because I have such a low quality graphics card it lags and or acts as if theres a slow motion effect in effect, but I still am able to play the game and Id be all the Legendary Ships admittedly took a few tries but still. Im considering on getting the DLC for this game.
