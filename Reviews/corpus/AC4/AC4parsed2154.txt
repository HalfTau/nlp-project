This pirate game is the best Assassins Creed Ive played so far, and its still one of my favourite games. What I really like about this game is that you have your own ship that you can sail on a big map. The map is located in The Caribbean sea, and the game has lots of IRL cities like Havana and Kingston, and everything is timed in the early 18th ceuntury.If youre thinking about buying this game, dont hesitate to click that Add to cart button because a history lesson is waiting for you.
