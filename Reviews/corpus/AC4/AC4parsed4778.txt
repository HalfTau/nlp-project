Well, now that I finished the main story, I think its time to write a review about this game.Is it worth It? DEFINETELY YES!In my opinion, Its alongside ACII the best Assassins Creed game to date. Edward is, in fact, a great protagonist, the story has fun, epic and sad moments that will make you want to come back for more. Besides that, there are a lot of extra activities that fit perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. You really will want to explore the gorgeous scenaries that the game provides and battle a Mano War until you can board it.9.5/10
