This game has got to be best in 2013. I would recommend that everyone play this if you like pirates at all, I mean what young boy didnt dream of being a pirate in his life?? I was blown away by the awesome graphics and the detail history written into the storyline that truely made this experience feel like being there in the carribean pirating honest working citizens of the british or spanish navies. There are a tonns of side missions, collectables, unlockable kits for both you charactor and the boat he commands. Hours of fun for a decent price. Once you get bored of all that you can just travel about blowing the crap out of everything that moves in the seas and make a proffit to use for upgrades to the boat.9/10
