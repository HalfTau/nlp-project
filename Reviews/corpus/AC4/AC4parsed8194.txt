I would love to recommend the game. But I never will and so long as Uplay exists I will never buy another Ubisoft game. I have spend more time trying to get Uplay to work than I have playing the game and Im 12 finished with the singleplayer campaign.The world is beautiful and the gameplay is fun. But the game requires Uplay which is a broken pile of steaming... excrement. According to Ubimal, Uplay needs me to set static a static IP for my computer then set up port forwarding for TWENTYFOUR different ports. And if my wife or I want to switch computers we have two desktops and a laptop that can run AC4 on max settings, then I have to go into the router configuration and change ALL TWENTYFOUR ports to forward to the other static IP. And thats if Ubisoft connects. I havent been able to connect yet. I have 70 games in my Steam Library, and I semiregularly play five or more MMOs. I have a 200mbps connection up and down that usually sees maximum latency with North American Servers in the range of 100200ms. The only time I ever have trouble connecting to a game is when it requires Udontplay.We almost bought two copies so we could play the multiplayer together we normally just play MMOs together. I am so glad that I didnt because buying the deluxe version of this game plus all of the DLC only to find that I cant access anything but the basic singleplayer game is frustrating enough. I would be highly irritated to have blown twice as much only to be locked out. As it is, I am strongly considering demanding a refund for everything except the basic game. Something I have NEVER done in twenty years of PC gaming.
