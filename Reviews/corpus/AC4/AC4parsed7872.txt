Great game, but some signifigant software bugs. most notable is the disactivation and current lack of cloud sync for game saves and their tendancy for corruption. Ubisoft recommends regular manual backups of your savegames which are buried in the programfiles rather then the documents folder. Certainly not an elegant or convenient solution to a critical flaw in the game client on PC. Having been an avid AC fan and owner since the first game, I am sad to say I will seriously think twice before purchasing the next game in the franchise or any additional DLC content. Ill stick with steam client games that have functional savegames and cloud sync.
