Love this game, worth the buy and time.only problem I have with it is how badly Ubisoft did on porting this to PC. Frame rate drops constantly sometimes even as low as 25 fps. Id say my average fps is around 4550. at times I do get a solid 60fps. my monitor is only 60hzFX8350 OCd at 4.4 ghz16Gb 8x2 Ram 1600mhz cas9ASUS DualGTX 1070 OCd at 1.8ghz
