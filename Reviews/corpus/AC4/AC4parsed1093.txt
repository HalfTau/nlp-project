Cant play the game, bought this game and the dlc, freedom cry to play. I am so angry that you cannot purchase a game anymore and play it on your own computer. Now you have to go through a server in order to play the piece of !. I played this game in college on the PS4 and I loved it and now I cannot even experience the video game. It really is a master piece of a game, however it is a shame I cannot play it on steam. Will update if I can or cannot get it to work. To everyone else do not purchase it is not worth the headache you will go through. If I cannot get to work I will demand a refund
