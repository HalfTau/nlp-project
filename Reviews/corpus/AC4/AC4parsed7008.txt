Yet another amazing Ubisoft game. Ubisoft seem to be making nothing but good games recently and their uncomming game look amazing as well. By far and away the best Assassins Creed game yet would highly reccomend this game 10/10. The Graphics on ultra look absolutely fantastic, the story while not amazing is still very good the gameplay is excellent and for the first time ever an AC game has  comfortable controlls on pc without remapping.
