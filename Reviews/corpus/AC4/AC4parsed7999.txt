I love Assassins Creed. I ing love Pirates. Ubisoft listened to the players and made a majestic game that can only be described as unicorn  on a strip of bacon. Sailing the seas, taking the helm, looting ships, and listening to sea shanties has got to be all I could ask for in a Game. Best game ever.
