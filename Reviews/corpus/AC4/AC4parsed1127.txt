the game feels very gamey, which I hate. I prefer games that immerse you in a world instead of Oh while youre supposed to be killing the commadante, also try air assasinating three crocidiles for bonus pointsbut those gripes aside, the game had me lose intrest halfway through Or maybe I had to go to college but in that time, I lost access to my Uplay account. and also the subsequent email that was tied to that specific uplay account. basically meaning that its bricked, showing up in my library but wholly unable to play.So now when I want to play, I cant. literally makes me turn my nose up to Ubisoft when literally my only gripe with the game was that it felt like a game....That and the abstergo cutscenes.... felt like THIS IS A GAME ception over here.That aside, what I remember playing of this game I liked. but now I cant play!
