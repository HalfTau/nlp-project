If you are fan of the AC series then chances are you probably already own this. Great comeback after the whoopsie that was AC3 whilst also bringing arguably the best part of said whoopsie into the fore as a main part of the gameplay Sailing the fairly open seas in your own brig.Freerunning controls can be a bit all over the place when in close proximity to lots of objects but easy enough to get a handle on I play with an XBox360 controller.Good story with a few plot twists and enough side missions/activities to keep you busy when taking a break from the story. Side missions and prowling the ocean for plunder are pretty much the goto method for upgrading Kenways ship and gear.The protagonist is also likeable enough this time round better than Connor but not quite on Ezios level imhoNew gimmicky weapons are good enough but darts can make the game a bit easy i think and the combat system is a little more straightforward than the AC2 franchise but fun nonetheless.Graphics are quite good for a PC port but to have all settings maxed not really needed your rig might need a bit of muscle for steady 60fps.All that said I was already a fan of the AC franchise and really enjoyed this addition to the series.
