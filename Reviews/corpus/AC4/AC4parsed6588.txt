Really darn Fun! some idiot had a negative review for this reason                                                                                                    Great game. Easily the best of the AC series so far imo. My problem is that I WOULDNT be able to recommend this to ANYONE on PC. Consoles... fine... its obviously just a port anyway but my game is unplayable for months at a time. Ill be able to play it for a few hours one day and then it crashes on start up the day after and wont work again until it randomly decides to. Have contacted Ubisoft but theyve been useless at trying to figure something out.I know a LOT of other people have had this issue too.Im very angry as Ive wasted 40 on a game I can only play once in a blue moon when its on a good day.Some people are idiots with reviews and i wanna tell him this is the only way i can IDIOT IF YOU GOT A CRAPPY MAC YES! IT SUCKS FOR CONSOLES COMPARED TO PC!..... That is all..
