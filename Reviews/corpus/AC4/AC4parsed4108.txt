DO NOT BUY ANY UBISOFT PRODUCT FROM THIS POINT FORWARD.You will be denied access to your games sporadically and whenever their servers cannot handle the bombardment caused by simple betas for other games they are developing.You need to be constantly connected to even see the games list you own with ubisoft. I went to reinstall this great game, only to be denied access to something Ive paid for AGAIN, because ubisoft is busy dealing with The Division and its broken their servers.
