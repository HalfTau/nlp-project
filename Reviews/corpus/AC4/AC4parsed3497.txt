Why do i recommend this game Story mode is decent Plundering other ships You can send ships you overtake to your fleet and fight another ships in Kenwayss fleet, getting money with trading cargo for R Multiplayer is also fun, would be better if there were Multiplayer ships battles or coop open world campaing I like the climbing movements, which are new, not like in Ac brotherhood or Ac revelations so developers really took some time to improve the game When you are sailing the ship and roam around misterious ocean your crew is singing some Pirates shanties, which you have to find of course Amazing thing is also that you have to work hard to upgrade your ship, hunt yourself for Heros upgrades, crafting darts etc. When you go and hunt some Legendary ships, be sure to play some Pirates Of The Caribbean theme music Using diving bell, to explore underwated world If you are gold thirsty and want a lot of it, you can go in the pub and catch some rumors about Naval Convoys Also there are other activities outside the Animus, where you can hack into your coworkers Computers and find out about secrets like Bermuda triangle, what happend to Subject 17 and moreThat is my opinion about the game, I was also reading that people had some problems with save and so on... well I did not experianced that and I think its fixed.
