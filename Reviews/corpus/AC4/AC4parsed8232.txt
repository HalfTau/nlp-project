This is the best game I know right now. It has a huge open world, sick graphics and a lot to do. I ve played nearly 60hours now and I havent finished the game yet. I m still missing a lot and I really liked the pirate theme.Theoretically it s not an AC game because one is missing the Assasinate stuff but it is an awesome pirate game nontheless. The battles are fluid and the climbing is great. Kenway knows all the climbing moves of all the Assassins before him so you can get around pretty fluidly.Totally recommend buying !!!
