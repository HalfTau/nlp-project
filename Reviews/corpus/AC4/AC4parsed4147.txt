Before I bought the game I felt like I was done with the AC franchise. Then I saw this in the winter sale and bought it, thinking if it sucks, its not a waste of money.I was wrong.Its good. I kinda have faith in the franchise again, too.Why is it good?The pirating aspect makes the game. Its fun to steer a ship and battle other way larger ships. The usual Assassins Creed  plot is just a subplot, with the main focus on pirating. Sure the importance of the whole AC plot grows, but for most time it feels like a good Pirate game. Also the out of the Animus stroy line is nice, the segments of it are simpler and shorter, allowing players who dont care much about that, to return to plundering ships. It controls good, like the older AC games AC2 is the last I played, and is easy to learn.If you like Pirates and dont really have a thing for the AC series, go for it when its on sale. Otherwise I fully recommend it.
