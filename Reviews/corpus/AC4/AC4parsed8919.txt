Dont get me wrong, the game looks awesome and the bit I played is just fine. The only reason I dont reccomend this game is because of the bloody DRM. You have to download ubisofts UPlay and create a new account on it and stay sgned in to that if you want to be able to play this game. I recommend this game overall, but if you want it, get it on a console instead.
