Terrible broken husk of a game. I bought it on sale and regret it. They didnt bother optimising for PC, lag is high even on high end rigs. Also, a very common issue that others and myself are having is that the game will delete your progress randomly. Its a joke. It also launches through Uplay so you buy it on steam which forces you to make an account there. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Im personally trying to get it refunded.
