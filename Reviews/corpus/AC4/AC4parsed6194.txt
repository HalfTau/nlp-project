I have played Assassins Creed, AC2 and now the Black Flag. Out of these three, the black flag is the one I can say money well spent. The story is ok, the visuals good and sailing is just excellent.Unfortunately this game, like most sandbox games with collect these thousand trinkets, suffers because of these very same collectibles. They are just such a bore to collect and if one doesnt take the time to do it one single push it will cut up the story and create abnormal pauses and delays in it. And the result is a weird underwhelming experience. The collectibles are artificial prolongment of the game and have a devastatingly negative impact on the game experience.But still, this is the Assassins Creed game to go to. I wish theyd develop a new franchise with just the sailing part.
