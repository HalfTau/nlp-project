I honestly think this is the best Assassins Cred Game personally, I love this game and all the stuff you can do. You can raid other Pirates ships and up then kill people, raid more ships, kill people, and etc.Also I like the story I bought it on PC recently, so Im gonna replay it on here I finished the whole game on my Console and I loved it.
