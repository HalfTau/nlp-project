So, UbiSoft.. You do realize that your crap DRM is only stopping people that pay for your games right? Right now you can, go to the download this game for free with the drm bypassed, and play to your hearts content. What in the  is this for?!? It has been 5 days since I purchased this game. For 5 days I have not made it beyond the UPlay login. SO I quit. Since I have not played this game yet I cant really give it a review. I thought maybe one of your kids will read this or something. Maybe they wont be as useless as your service and the information will reach the geniuses up top. Whatever I guess. Im considering a refund then a boycott. UPlay unless our service is down then, UPlayNothing!
