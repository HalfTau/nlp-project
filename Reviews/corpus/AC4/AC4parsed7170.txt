Assassins Creed has changed quite a lot in every sequel of the series. The major change, occurred in Assassins Creed 3, with a new engine being used, bringing many new mechanics to the game, including naval warfare. Assassins Creed Blackflag, expands on that engine, while fixing many problems and things that just didnt work out in Assassins Creed 3. The game has astonishing visuals braving a big storm, while taking on 2 Man O Wars is definitely something to remember.  New user interface has made an appearance, from the new and unusual Assassins Creed 3 interface.This is the first game in the series, where the game is set in an earlier time from the previous game. So the story can be quite confusing, leaving you wondering where the Assassins Creed 3 characters have gone. Youll soon realize, they havent been born yet .Without going into too much detail, this is definitely a must buy in the series. Though I am looking forward to Assassins Creed Unity, that aims to bring the series back to its roots of assassinating, with new features, and improved gameplay.
