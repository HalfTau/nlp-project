Please note, although I only have 67hours on steam I have played for many more on Xbox360Short ReviewBuy this game because pirates!A more detailed opinionThis is a great game. I feel that compared to other titles in the series, especially AC3, the storyline missions get to feeling a little repetative however they make up for this with the vast amount of gameplay that takes place around the open world.Many agree this is the best AC game of them all and going off the titles I have played AC, AC2, AC3  Black Flag Id say judging them as a whole, I can probably agree. I do however feel that gameplaywise, the storyline missions from AC3 take the biscuit over black flag.For anyone completely new to AC I would suggest trying to play them all or atleast the main titles  in order, as the story does follow on from one to the next, landing you in a potential wtf situation regarding certain aspects of the storyline should you jump in mid series.If however, youre not so bothered about that, this is a great game to to introduce you to the awesomeness of Assassins Creed and will probably inspire you to take the leap into the deep and complex stroy that runs through the whole series.
