I thought this was rather fun and I was disappointed when I beat the main story and the game was over. If you played Sid Meiers Pirates! growing up like I did, then this will feel somewhat similar and bring back a lot of memories. The ship battles and hunting for treasure in particular feel the same. But stealthing around and assassinating guards, which has nothing to do with pirates, is pretty fun too.Its not perfect. Some of the missions were dumb  too many involved tailing/eavesdropping  and there was one mission that almost made me quit the game the one where you need to locate James Kidd, but instead I just watched a YouTube video of how to beat it and copied it. All of the stuff that took place in present day was very stupid  Im not sure who thought walking around an office sounded fun.But aside from those blips, the game is otherwise fun. Exploring and checking off various tasks off the path of the main mission was fun, and Id go around and kill guards or wage ship battles just for fun. Wish the game lasted longer, but I clocked 60 hours, so thats pretty good. This is the first Assassins Creed game Ive ever played and I feel like I will try another because of this positive experience.
