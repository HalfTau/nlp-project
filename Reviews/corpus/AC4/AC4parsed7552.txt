I really, really liked this game. I got sucked in and immersed. The Pirate Life is the Life For Me!Solid gameplay, great graphics, but I wish it was a tad bit better optimized for PC. I have a pretty nice rig and it slowed down where I believe it shouldnt have. Still, very playable and very nice to look at.
