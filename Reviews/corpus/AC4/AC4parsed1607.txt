To me, this is the only Assassins Creed game that I could stomach to play.I like pretty much everything about it, and the graphics still look good to this day. The only thing I dislike is the running, and how it automatically jumps onto walls, sometimes when youre running past them, which throws off the whole chase if you were doing a chase mission, but thats a crap feature thats included in all AC games.Dying Light did parkour right, not Assassins Creed. Assassins Creed made it too easy.Still worth buying, definitely.
