yes yes yes, you must play this if for any reason that you love Pirates. This is by far the best in the series and i havent finished it tho but im enjoying it very much 8 Sea battles on the boat is fun, the sending convoys out at sea is fun, the combat is fun, all of it so far for me has been fun and lots of freedom like in AC1 for the most part 8
