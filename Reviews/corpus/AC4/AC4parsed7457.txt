This was a let down to all of the Assassins Creed series after just playing Assassins Creed 2 i just dont understant how they could have ruined so much of what used to be one of the best triple A titles. They keep on trying to make you use boats that are really annoying but frankley they just need to stop. Compared to the other games this story is not meaningful it tells a story but its not really a recorded story in history like when they brought in Leonardo da Vinci in Assassins Creed 2 and told his story instead of making up a terrible story about pirates. This just was not really that good of a game hopefully the next Assassins Creed game will be better. One more thing they need contorller support because the controlles get a bit annoying after a while and you need to move your hands alot and in a battle situation you need to press the button as fast as possible and with no contoller support you will find yourself freakquently hitting the wrong button.
