Everything Age of Pirates and Sid Meyers Pirates set out to be plus the Assassins Creed. Naval combat holds fairly well and the exploration part is almost infinite. the only thing lacking is the former and later AC games mechanics especially on stealth.so do you want to follow Edwards life? take contracts? fight the templars? maybe lead a life of plunder and booty, arrrhhh? how about finding that perfect scenery... this is the game for you.
