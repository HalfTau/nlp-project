A great pirate game with a huge emphasis on exploration and discovery. You can be a pirate, hire a crew, customise your gear and look as well as your own ship. The only Assassins Creed games I ever played were I and II, so my basis of comparison is relatively uninformed. The assassin mechanics seem hamfisted into the game and the modern backstory is beyond outofplace  its a distraction and a complete breaking of immersion. Whilst sailing seamlessly through the tropics of Middle America one may encounter warning signs or glitches deliberately put into the game by the designers to convey narrative drive or meaning. Not only is this detracting but unnecessary. All in all a BRILLIANT pirate game plagued by the failings and tediousness of the Assassins Creed franchise.
