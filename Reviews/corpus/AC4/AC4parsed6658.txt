This game is unoptimized as hell despite meeting or exceeding the RECOMMENDED system benchmarks I still get barely 10 FPS.Having played this game on the xbox 360 I can say the game its self is very good and worth buying on that platform however the PC port is a waste of hard drive space. Dont waste your time or money on the PC version of this game.
