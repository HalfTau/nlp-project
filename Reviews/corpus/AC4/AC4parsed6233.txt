8/10 Would recommendIts a great game. At times, it can get a little slow but for the most part I enjoyed almost all of it. The story line is well written, almost always keeping it fresh with the plot twists. I do not regret buying this game, especially since I got it on sale a few months back, I find it money well spent.
