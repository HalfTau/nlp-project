Hands down the best Assassins Creed in the series. If you played Assassins Creed III and didnt like it, no worries. That game was garbage in comparison. Even AC2 doesnt haveon this. My only issue with this game is that its not optimized that well for PC. Even high end computers seem to have significant frame rate drops. Enjoy the hell of it but dont expect a smooth 60 fps the entire way through. That being said, the graphics are incredible if you have the system to display them. Perfect game for the winter too. If you have seasonal depression, this game is like a portal to the Caribbean.Overall game  9.5/10Ive played and beaten this game three times, and Im still going to play it again. The gameplay is incredible and the graphics are superb.If you factor in the poor optimization and performance  9.0/10.You need a pretty solid rig to run this game on Ultra settings.PS. I never touched the multiplayer so dont factor that in to this review.
