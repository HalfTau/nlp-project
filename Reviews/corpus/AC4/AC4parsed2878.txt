Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is honestly the highest point the whole franchise has reached since Debuing in 2007. While people will still say that 2 or Brotherhood are the best they are still fantastic games though, Black Flag offers a sense of scope and exploration that just hasnt been matched before or since.The Caribbean open world that the game offers is HUGE and not only that its dense as is tradition in any ubisoft open world game so there is tons of stuff to do. Hell being able to sail to remote islands with your ship, the Jackdaw, makes all the crazy item hunting to 100 the game more entertaining than just running around like a rabbid parkour runner.The customization in the game is some of the best Ive seen in any game. The variety of upgrades you can offer to both yourself and your ship gives you a ton of options to live out the ultimate pirate power fantasy as well as having a crafting system in the game just like in the previous AC game. Except there is insentive in this game cause you WANT a lv 4 gun pouch or better armor so you look like an even bigger op badass.The PC version is buggy as hell though. But not in the sense that the game crashes every other auto save BUT the graphical glitches are nothing short of a borderline Unity in terms of faces dissappearing, NPC movement clipping, and other texture ery.But that does not stop the game from being GORGEOUS when everything is actually working. The lighting and rain effects are still phenominal almost 3 years later and it isnt that demanding if you pc is a bit more modern so most people can enjoy this game a very high graphics settings.And finally in regards to the story. Edward Kenways story and overall development is the best in the series since Ezio in AC2 untill they dragged is character through the dirt for 2 more games with some expected but still interesting twists as well as having memorable characters such as blackbeard and kidd.This game is super cheap on sale at this point got it for 7.50 this summer so I more than recommend AC4 to anyone who wants to play quite possibly the best pirate game ever made.
