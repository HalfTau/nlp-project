The Pirate RPG/Sim is tons of fun and I wish theyd pushed this even further with more ideas, more features, more ship types, more interesting ship advancements etc. E.g. the 4 legendary ships in the corners of the carribean are awesome encounters, want more!The Assassins Creed part of the game is worse than ever. Combat is barely improved, you constantly run up the wrong things or suddenly do jumps from great heights when you meant to go the other way etc. There are way too many missions where its game over if you are discovered especially enraging with the odd bad savepoint placement but always anticlimactic and a bore to get through and it feels like every 2nd mission is one of those horrible tail/eavesdrop POSs and is it just me or do these make it really difficult to follow the story?.The UI remains horrible while they finally allow mouse control in the map screen its implemented in the most insanely bad way you could think of. Its quite impressive really, itd be difficult to come up with something more annoying.Kenways Fleet is a joke. Completely disjoint from the rest of the game, just a waste of time.So yeah, all in all a recommendation as I DID enjoy myself, but some of the heritage is just bafflingly bad at this point and sadly drags the whole thing down.
