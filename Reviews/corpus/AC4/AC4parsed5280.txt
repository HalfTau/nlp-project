Great pirate game. Assassin parts are dull and some of the follow missions are awful. Not only are they frustrating to play, but end up being a waste of time because you dont really care what the characters are saying and even if you did youre focusing on not getting caught and cant understand what theyre talking about.But the pirate stuff is dynamic and most importantly very fun.
