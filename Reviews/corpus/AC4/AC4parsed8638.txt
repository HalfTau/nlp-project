Im Sad they for the most part left the old storyline behind, and replaced it with some whack first person thing, with very slow camera turning. But the actual in the animus part is WAY WAY better then AC3. It feels like a actual improvment and new game to me, where AC3 felt like less of a game then AC2. When all said in done, I rank ACBF number 2 in the AC series, with brotherhood being the best.
