I tried to play first Assassins Creed game in past, but it bother me a lot by dull and repetitive objectives. I have bougth Black Flag in sale and also thanks to positive ratings and I totally dont regret. Its catchy and I have fun to do all the side objectives. The mini game with the ships by looting other ships is great. The only things I hate are the diving bells location. And the control of the character is little bit cumbersome in some situation in comparison with Batman series for example.
