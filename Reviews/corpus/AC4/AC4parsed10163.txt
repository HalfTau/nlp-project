If you dont want another Assassins Creed, you shouldnt get the new Assassins Creed. Yup, its pretty much the same as all the previous games have been. Add piratetheme, open ocean, your own ship with its own upgrades and crew, and naval battles, you get Black Flag. Great animations and soundtrack.Has its problems, like multiplayer crashing, weird FPS drops, 1610 letterbox, Uplay...
