I am obsessed with this game! It is huge! There is SO MUCH you can do. It never gets boring or tedious, just due to the crazy amount of activities you can do. Doing the dives gives me pretty big anxiety though the sea creatures really freaking me out!All in all, I love this game. I never usually buy games when theyre new and 60 and Im so glad I took the risk and got this game. TOTALLY worth the time Ive put into it so far, and the money I spent! I would recommend it to anyone!
