Bought the game, really wanted to play and then after its installed, i need to create an account with Ubisoft, or something. Then I need to install their software, link it to an email, then i have to visit a webpage via email they send me, not to verify my email, but so i can download an app onto my phone so i can install that horrendous piece of trash on my phone, so i can get a verification code, so i can input it on a third party software, so i can play a game, via steam? Is this log in inception? Was I told Im going to have to go through any of these loop holes, where every other game i buy on steam I just install and play? No.Youre putting me through an extra 20 minutes of hoops and ladders for added security for a game that came out like what, 2 sequels ago? Im so tired of all this trashy security and trash we need to go through. Im sorry that people out there are too young to understand not to click random links in emails and get their parents credit card info stolen.tldrSo, the game looks great. Couldnt play it too much muck to wade through.
