Honestly, Im a little  I love AC4, and I play it on the PS3.  So I though ok, Ill buy it for the PC so when I travel, I can take my favorite game with me.  So I download the game, play for a couple hours, then go to bed happy.  I go to play the next day, and my save data is gone.  Not panicking, I thought maybe it was a system error and tried reuploading everything.  Didnt work.  So I did some digging on some forums and tried running as admin.  Didnt work.  I feel a little cheated to be honest.  So unless someone can come up with a solid way of fixing this problem, I would reccomend just sticking with buying this game for your PS3, Xbox 360, ect.
