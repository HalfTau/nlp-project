Arrr, a pirate game tharr be, mateys!A lot of fun, a lot of content and a lot of fun with pirate content!Black Flag takes the only good things from AC III  the melee fighting system and the naval combat and improves on them.Then it adds what AC III was missing. You get a good, interesting protagonist bit of a jerk, but a likable one, an involving and varied plot, and the greatest cast of characters in any AC game to date yes, even better than brotherhood and syndicate.And when youre not off mainplotting, well then you get side quests, exploring sunken shipwrecks, treasure maps, fighting and boarding ships as well as the traditional hunt for chests.What else, i hear you say? Well did i mention that the game has great graphics? And great music as well! Shanties which you collect are great but make sure to visit taverns as well and listen to the ballads sung there.PS. The dlc outfits are worth getting as well. They look amazing.
