I always wanted to like Assassins Creed, the idea of a parkourish game about assassins always appealed to me. Sadly however, despite trying Assassins Creed, and Assassins Creed 2, I never finished either. This is the first Assassins Creed game ive tried since then and ive gotta say I enjoyed it immensely.My criticism would be that while most of the game is fun? The story missions can be as tedious as they were in the other assassins creed titles.
