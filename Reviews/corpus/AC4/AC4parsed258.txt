I reccomend this game.When I first popped into the game I didnt like it that much, but I kept playing to see if I could get into it. And, if you wanna be doing a bunch of parkour in cities all the time. This is not your game. Most of this game is sailing/upgrading your ship. Although, you can get into this game. It will just take a little bit.
