Played the original, and its been a while, but I dont remember any hacking.Bought the game to be a pirate, not some silicone valley bean bag sitting culture warrior who happens to be the key to world salvation, or whatever.  It wasnt clear.The frogger on crack hack mini game was the end of it for me..  couldnt do it.. didnt  have the patience.  ive played enough atari style games to be sick of that  Just made me feel like I was wasting more of my time that I already was.  If it didnt have this animus crap it would be a pretty good series.The parkour is great though when youre not accidentally jumping up on something in the middle of a chase..
