I just lost my save game after 91 hours of game play. After some research apparently this is a common thing, with apparently no definitive way to recover your position in the game..Even though I hadnt finished the game I dont think Ill be going back to it for a few reasonsYou had to grind quite a bit if you wanted to do the Kenways fleet stuff  but grinding was fun, as it meant you fought other ships and then boarded them.All the assasins contracts were super easy once you got the beserk darts.Overall the game was playable, and I would have normally played it to the end.However as Im a bit of a completionist when it comes to games and this game has SO many things to complete, I would rather put 90 hours into another game, rather than risk losing my progress again.I will no longer be playing this game, though it was fun at the time.
