Everything on land is extremely boring. Being a pirate, however, is the only reason to play this heap of garbage.The story is forgettable and bland, and skips the parts that could have been interesting Like how Kenway makes it back home after being marooned on an island.The movement controls terribly with tons of bugs thrown in the mix. Ive died many times due to the game assuming I wanted to plummet to my death instead of grabbing a ledge. The game tries to force you along its many predetermined paths. Oh, you wanted to leap over this small wall and continue forward? Nah, instead youll hop on top of the wall, run along it, and continue leaping onto conveniently placed objects. Is it too much to ask for separate buttons for leaping and running?You can get the very best swords and guns right at the beginning of the game. Theres no point in using any other weapon unless youre a completionist. Completing all assassin contracts awards you with a pistolsword... which is no better than a sword you can buy. It merely adds a new slow kill animation with a very quiet gunshot noise.Every enemy is killed with little to no effort. BX can kill anything.Almost all missions are the same thing. You find a target. You follow them. You wait until they get into a closely guarded area. Then kill them.I could go on for days about what is wrong with this game.
