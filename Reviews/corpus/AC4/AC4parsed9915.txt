 Awesome game, sea battles rule and they made a gorgeous world. Loved the new main character and would like to see him back for another game. Way better than Connor. Turns out if you read the AC3 novel Forsaken, it gives away how he goes though  Quad pistol mayhem Missed calling in my Assassin bros to wreck face. Crew mechanic could have been more fleshed out Combat felt a bit more simplified due to lack of weapons and not getting Ropedart until the end of the game didnt help. Also only saw 1 double counter the whole game. No jumping puzzles were a huge missed opportunity with all of the Mayan Temples around.I give it 4 pirate swords out of 5
