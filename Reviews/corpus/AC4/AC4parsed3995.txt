i reccomend this game, but half heartedly.the setting of this games is amazingly beautiful and very helpful to a writer like me who looks for nice refrences on the 17th century and the golden age of piracy/age of sail in particular.but as a gamer i found this game very frustrating, the controls were sometimes jumbled up and the game wouldnt save past a certain point.if those problems would be fixed i would gladly dive into this game again, but until then it is going to stay in my steam library untouched.
