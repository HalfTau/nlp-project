Just for fans. The game didnt introduce something really new to the franchise. The naval battles arent enough to give some fresh air to the game. The story walks in the same way as the last games of the series. Maybe just for the fun of vsiting some beatiful enviromets could be enough to play this game. Ive played for as long as 40 hours, and yet, cant find any empathy or simpathy with the main character.By the way, im a fan of the series, and for this, I preferred to wait for a price drop. It didnt attracted me enouch to adquire it in the first day like the AC III.
