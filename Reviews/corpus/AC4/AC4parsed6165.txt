This game is so good!It dials back all the innovations in AC3 which overreached beyond functionality to an optimal point of function and fun. It adds a perfect touch of Grand Theft Auto style sandbox gameplay that is perfectly suited to the AC series.The characters are great. The story is engaging and compelling without being too serious as the previous installment of the series did.Above all else and most importantly, it is a lot of fun unlike Assassins Creed III.If you didnt like AC3 or didnt play it, dont worry. Get this game and youll love it.
