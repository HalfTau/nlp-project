A worthwhile purchase. If you like pirates this is a game for you. After 44 hours of game play Im only around 40 complete of the single player story campaign, there is just so much to do in this game. Ive really enjoyed the naval battles and updgrading my ship to take on even tougher enemies. Looking forward to the point when I can take on the elite ships. The story has been pretty engaging thus far, but Ive been taking my time exploring other avenues of the game so I have not been focused on completing the story yet.
