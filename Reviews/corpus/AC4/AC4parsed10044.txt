Nice game!and for all guys who think that the story does not fit to the AC Series, the story fits PERFECT to the other AC gamesits a really nice game when you want a assassin game and also if you want a good pirate game you should buy this game!I had so much fun with the sidemissions and the many ships you can destroy I never wanted to play the story  thats really good by the way because it never gets boring.
