One of my favourite Assassins Creed games to date. I really enjoy the setting of the Caribbean Ocean and the surrounding islands. Its really cool when youre sailing and then your crew begins to sing a shantie, improving the immersion! Combat is pretty nice, but the naval battles are amazing imo. Really recommend this game to all AC fans. To those who are starting out, I do advise to look up the story of the previous main AC games just to know whats going on in the AC universe.Sure, there are some bugs, not game breaking though. I wish there would be more customization with the game, but its still not that bad. I did miss the building improvements like in AC2, Brotherhood and Revelations, however, you will be able to improve on your personal HQ.8,5/10
