uPlay is annoying as hell, graphics are dated and missions and gamplay are annoying. This could have been a great pirate game, but instead it is just another Assassins Creed with its ridiculous story and broken parcour gameplay.My main complaint is uPlay though. I bought this game against my better judgment, assuming Ubisoft would eventually manage to make uPlay slighly less crappy, but it just keeps getting worse.
