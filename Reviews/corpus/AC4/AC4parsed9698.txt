its incredible. a third person, action/adventure game based in the golden age of pirates. there could have never been a better time to be an assassin. while action packed, there are some heavy, thought provoking moments that make you question the world around you, both inside and outside the game. much like AC3, this also boasts a endgame setting, offering a semisandbox setting for hunting, looting, shipstealing, fort demolishing, treasure hunting piratepaloza. plus a multitude of treasure chests and animus fragments throughout the world map to find and collect. beware, for those who are achievement hounds, or just some well rounded OCD suffering gamers, this game will ruin your social life faster than you could sneeze the word Zuckerberg. all in all, its a pistole whealing, cannon shooting good time!
