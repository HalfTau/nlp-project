This game might very well be a great game. I wouldnt be able to begin to know, however, considering the game wont run past 10 fps on the absolute lowest possible settings despite the fact that im running an Intel i5 4560 Quad Core 8gb RAM 3.3ghz with an nVidia Gtx 750. I love Assasins Creed and have really been looking forward to trying this title but the game is not even remotely optimized and every single workaround i could fine through 3 hours of research yielded no results. Another bad mark in Ubisofts recently terrible track record
