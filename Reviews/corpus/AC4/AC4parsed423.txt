Let me just say that this game is an all time masterpiece. I am playing Black flag 4 years after its been released and Im totally into it. Despite seeing that graphics is a bit out of a date when you are used to playing latest titles on high end machine I would still recommend it to anyone. Its a first person action with loads of conquering either on land where you have to conquer various forts or estates or on a sea where you have to conquer forts or other ships with various canons of your gorgeous ship which you can also improve by scavinging materials from other ships and purchasing upgrades. The way you fight those naval figts with other ships is abosolutely addictive. When you add that songs yours sailors sing when you are out on endless sea, you can be sure to taste the true pirate action and atmosphere.
