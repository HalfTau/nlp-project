Are you a fan of a game that crosses over pirate plundering and assasinations? This might be the one for you!Note The game runs with uPlay setup is easy, and Ive personally never had any problems  but known to cause problems.After finally finishing the game to my hearts content, I can say AC4 is probably in my top 2 from the franchise.I loved the storyline, as it flowed nicely and really pulls you in once you get to do some naval exploration.The game had many different side quests and minigames, some which are repetitive but hey, its very fun for the first few times!As for me, I was never exactly the playstealth type of person, and Ill end up just killing everything that comes into my screen which was quite an enjoyment to me.All in all, without giving too much of the games content away, Id say if you have the money, looking to do some running on rooftops and just killing templars, then you should definately play this game.
