This is a very well made game. If you are a fan of the series, you should definitely get this one. An excellent freeroam game, but more of a pirate feeling game than an assassin game like its predecessors. Make sure you check your comp specs before downloading, Ive had problems with lag and quits on start up. Story is a bit anticlimactic, but the fun gameplay is worth the buy alone. 9/10
