Very fun if you like a normal assassins creed game but you also like sailing and plundering and killing and hunting although its role is very minimized because you have a ship now not other stuff. Hunting is only required for upgrading your persona and even then is best done with a sleep dart then walk up to them and kill them unlike in assassins creed iii where you had to load bow your now loading a dart which you get in sequence 4 and it is very useful so overall a great game.
