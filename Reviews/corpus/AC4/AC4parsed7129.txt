Great game, has some fps sinkholes here or there, and can heat up your system if you play to long 2 Hours, but it delivers theres always something to do, or presenting itself to the player as the developers promised. I feel my purchase was a good investment, havent played in a while but Ill get back into it eventually. Every once in a while I feel the urge to be a pirate Cons Uplay steam clone required to play. Is ok if you already have it though, I have alot of uplay games so I dont mind it so much but uplay needs to stop forcing it on people that are happy with steam.
