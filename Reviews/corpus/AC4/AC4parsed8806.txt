Im a pirate!! DI had been looking for a decent pirate game for a while now, After playing one in my youth and not remembering what it was called... haha   I could not have asked for more with the game! a decent story  sea battles, fights  lots of distractions!! and IM A PIRATE!!! D haha.The only downside I have had with this game is when I ended up on the inside of a ship! and had to quit XD
