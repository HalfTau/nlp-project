Well, considering how long ago this came out. It definitely wasnt bad. I was actually holding off on getting this game because I was like, What? Theyre seriously doing this? After what happened in ACIII? Seriously?. I was definitely overreacting to I thought this game was going to be really bad, but I found myself playing it for quite the time. It is quite enjoyable since the naval battles actually didnt get old. Expanding on the naval battles was actually very fresh, and it was the only game where I looked forward to upgrading my ship more than upgrading my assassin. If youre a completionist though, this game can be a nightmare, but Ill let you find that out on your own.As per cons, well, Ubisoft certainly could have done a better job optimizing an issue that plagues all their games, not just this one, the graphics could have been better, and if you thought that the controls in ACIII were wonky, welcome back.
