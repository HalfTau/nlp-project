Wow, what an awesome game. Played them all, best so far.There are a couple of bugs, but they are easy to live with.Game play  910Graphics  910Story  910Sound  1010Im playing the game through for the 3rd time, and still find different ways to do missions.If you want a really good game to spend some of your bonus on, I recommend you buy this game. But if you havent played Assassins Creed 3, you will not understand the games ending.
