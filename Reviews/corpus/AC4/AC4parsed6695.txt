This game is similar to the rest of the games in the franchise, so its good. Too bad it is a lag monster. If you have a real high end rig, you might be okay, if not, dont bother. Obviously they didnt optimize this properly for the PC, since the graphics are not all that much better than AC3 which runs fine on ultra settings with my gear. Even turning the graphics way way down may not make this very playable for you. I wont be purchasing new AC titles anytime soon. I have better things to throw money down the drain on.
