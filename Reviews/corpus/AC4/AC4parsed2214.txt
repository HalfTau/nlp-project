Black Flag is probably the best AC game and Ive basically have played them all.  Some of the side quests get a little monotonous, but AC seems to have that in every single AC game they put out.  Heres a crazy idea, perhaps the franchise should have the side quests relate a little more to the main story line...????  I know, its crazy talk, lets just keep it as it is where I feel like Im completing side quests just for the sake of completing them.  They have nothing to do with the main storyline.Besides that nagging problem found in all AC games, Black Flag is actually rather fun and somewhat educational if you want to learn about pirates and the different caribbean islands.
