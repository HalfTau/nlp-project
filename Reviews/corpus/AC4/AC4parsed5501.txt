Ok so some history...I played AC1 and the AC2 trilogy essentially back to back to back to back so I suffered some AC fatigue. AC3 was a hearty disappointment to me...I do not know if it was just the familiar feel or the even higher amount of go here and press a button type side missions. To be fair, side missions arent required, but a 75/25 side quest to main quest ratio felt overbearing...well...I LOVED Black Flag! If you burn through the game you can probably get it done in 20 hours but if you want to touch every uncharted island just to get some booty and some fragments it will stretch much longer hypocrisy at its finest but the fetch missions felt different! Upgrading your ship is definitely rewarding there are four monster challenges that will make upgrading essential. The sword combos are as cool as ever, though bring smoke bombs, seems there are many more brute type enemies which are harder to hit.What I especially like about this game is the ending, I shant spoil it here, but its unlike anything else in the series!TLDR  If youve ever like an AC game PLAY BLACK FLAG!! Even if youve gotten AC Fatigue PLAY this game! A Rating!
