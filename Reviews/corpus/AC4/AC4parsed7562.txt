Definitely one of the better parts of the AC franchise.There are tons of things to do and the story is good so far. Be it collecting chests/shantys/ ship upgrades, assassinations, naval quests, attacking ship convoys, raiding legendary ships, conquering forts, hunting wales, diving for treasures or hunting templarsside storys  I guess youll find your niche.If you liked the naval part of AC 3 you will love AC 4.Definitely worth its price. Would buy again.
