This is definately not one of the better Assassins creed games.It starts well but halfway thru you will be bored to tears.  Its Longwinded,  boring and you will spend most of your time attacking one ship after another and its so repetative that you will hate this game before long.ProsGood looking game.Nice sounds affects/music.ConsLong winded and boring.Terrible and unlikable charactors.Very repetative.Gets old pretty fast.Try a demo or borrow a friends copy of the game and try it before you buy it.I give it a 4/10.CheersD
