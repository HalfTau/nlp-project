Can see why people claim this is the best AC game ever.Upgraded my pc recently and on high ultra settings it looks incredible, optimization is probably the only con.Really annoyed i put off playing this on release back on console because of the pirate setting, its integrated to the world so well and really expands the experience the older games felt like a half open half on rails adventure game. this feels more like a open world rpg and its the biggest map so far.Highly reccommend it to anyone remotely into AC you wont regret it.
