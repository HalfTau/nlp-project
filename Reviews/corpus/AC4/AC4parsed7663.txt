I love this game, but not to be an assassin, to be a pirate. The Assassins Creed games have become a little stale over the last few years and being an annual franchise has basically turned it into another Call of Duty for me. Having said that, its like the pirate game ive always wanted but never got. The pirate part is where it truely shrines and if if Ubisoft was smart theyd listen to the fans that think as I do and make their own stand alone pirate game. I love the Creed games but there hasnt been enough innovation lately to keep me really interested for a long time, until this game. They did it right here because it was something fresh and had new mechanics such as true open world gameplay and brings back the sailing mechanic from ACIII, but making it 10 times more enjoyable this time around. Sailing around the Caribbean plundering and pillaging ships, settlements, and hidden coves alike was an exciting and new take on the series and is by far my favorite part of this game. They also have an interesting story to tell which involves famous pirates from history including the notorious Blackbeard. Once again the pirates is where the draw to this game is for me and i couldnt get enough of it. Heres hoping they hear those of us asking for more and give us the pirate game we deserve thats not held back by the now lackluster assassin story. 9/10Edit So here I am  a couple years later and my opinion hasnt changed on this game. Its still the best pirate game out there and while I feel for the people that hated the pirate aspect and just wanted a good assassin game, I want a good assassin game as well, I still feel like we need more AAA pirate games and this game still beats everything else out there in my book. Having said that, I think this game deserves a 10/10 now because its stood the test of time so far as the best.
