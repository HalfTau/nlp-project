Loved this game. Didnt want to play any other game till I finished this one. Took me 76hrs. Personel opinion, this is the best Asssasins creed in the series. Didnt feel repetitive for me.Pros Great story Good combat system Good Graphics Decent gameplay, smooth after the updates Pirate theme if youre into those sort of things Lots of exploration and questsCons Wish it was more challenging sort of easy few glitches Uplay problems, but after finding out how to solve the not able to log in crap never had any problems since then.Conclusion Buy it you like pirates of the caribbean this is prbly the best pirate life game out there well for me
