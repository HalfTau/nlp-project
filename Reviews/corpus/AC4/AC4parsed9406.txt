Good idea bad execution.  I have spent over fifty hours in this game, and then suddenly uplay deletes my save file.  This is nonsense.  I was playing this game as a completionist.  I had my ship upgraded to just under 100.  I had to do a lot of grinding to get it there and now all of that is GONE.  I am not starting all over.  I am not the only person to have this game breaking bug.  It has happened to other people and so far Ubisoft has done NOTHING about it.EDIT  They have finally fixed the save game bug.  Due to this I will change this to a positive review.
