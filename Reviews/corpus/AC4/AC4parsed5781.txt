intresting storyline for a AC game, but I liked it most of itgreat gameplay music and very dayum fun  to roam around the map and plunders enemy ships and capture fortsa little disappointed with not being able to get bigger ships in single player mode. also may have a glitch in which you get blackscreen everytime you start the game, possible fixes just run the game, and leave it blackscreen for half a hour then it should start.
