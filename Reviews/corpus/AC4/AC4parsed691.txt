Where to even begin?I think this is the best Assassins Creed game I have played so far and the best pirate game I have played so farA lot of dumb mechanics from previous games were discarded, few things were simplified  it just plays really well both on foot and on the shipPerformance is bad. BAD. I often found myself having 30fps on a GTX 1060 6GB. So far this is the first game I wasnt able to play on locked 1080p/60fps and its a game from 2013!Main quests are alright even when you want to complete them with full synchronization  yes they are often just some fun gimmicks during the story quests, they no longer require some really stupid, almost luck based interactions from the player as it was in AC3A lot of collectibles, ship upgrades, suits, weapons etc. One major flaw are the chests/animus fragments scattered on small islands around the sea. Getting them all would be a brainkilling grind and its the only thing I havent completed  sitting at 99And dear Ubisoft... stop with the goddamn trailing missions  follow this guy, follow this ship and dont get spotted. Worst part of any AC game by farOverall I give it 8/10. Some things could have been done better but its a very solid game
