Love the game concept, but cant recomend it for PC due too very low frame rate. even with a high end pc fps is locked at 30 and usualy drops to less than 20 so not optimized for pc at all. so thx ubisoft for stealing from the PC ppl in the world. this is like the third game u ppl made that realy sux on pc. I will not be giving u any more of my money. and i hope no other pcers do either. THX FOR NOTHING..........and have a nice day
