The game itself is awesome, but i dont really like uplay. I downloaded this from steam, and the Uplay that came with it is somehows broken, it cannot save the game. If you have the same problem as i did no saves, delete the Uplay that comes with steam, and download the correct one from ubisofts website.I have to say, i love this game, compared to the previous assassins creeds it has so much more to do.Have a bad day? Play this game, and a bad day is gone.5/5
