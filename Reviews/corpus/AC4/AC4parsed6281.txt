Best played with a controller but mouse/keyboard combo is just as good. For deaf gamers  it is fully subtitled. Game is better if you have a tablet so that you can use the companion app at the same time Kenways Fleet is better done this way. Being a pirate is pretty damn fun and a good alternative storyline for the usual Assassin Creed plot.
