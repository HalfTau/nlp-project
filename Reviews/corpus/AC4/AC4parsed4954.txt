Taking Sea forts, building a pirate base and upgrading your ship.Continues the templar assassin story arch with a new character who isnt really either an assassin or templarDialogue is spot on and believeable.Black Beard!ConsThe obnoxious modern day scenes in abstergo where your some lowly game tester looking through these genetic memeories. We get it Ubisoft, youre trying to make a subtle connection between the evil corporation of Abstergo to your evil corporation, we dont care! All we care about is high seas piracy, not some un interested un inspired immersion breaking scenes of corporate espionage where you have to play these silly minigames to break into things. again we dont care! stick to the history scenes.
