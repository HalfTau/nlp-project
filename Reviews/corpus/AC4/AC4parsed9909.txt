This is hands down the best Assassins Creed game created to date. It features a sprawling world filled with treasures and things to do such as finding collectibles, helping the Assassins with various missions, etc. The story line while interesting isnt as deep or inpactful as say Ezios storyline but it will keep you entertained till the end. The characters feel authentic and real, they are very well written and feel like real pirates.The best part of the game is the naval combat. It has been refined since AC3 and is now more fun and rewarding. To upgrade your ship, the Jackdaw, you need to capture resources from other vessels in the game. It proves both challenging and rewarding at the same time.The only parts I did not like about this game was that the combat is still somewhat too easy, and the main missions mostly revovle around tailing your target which will get boring quickly, its literally filled with Tail X missions.ProsVast world with many things to do.The sea shanties are amazing.The animation of Edward and other assassins are still top notch.Hours of entertainment.Naval combat feels great throughout the game.ConsSomewhat badly optimized PC version.Tail X missions.Still a very easy game.
