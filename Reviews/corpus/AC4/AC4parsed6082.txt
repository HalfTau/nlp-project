Unless you really love pirates and I mean really a lot, Its not worth it, I am so disappointed by this game, The worst in the series so far... Entire story feels like one big intro into the game that never comes. Sailing and all that is very limited and offres just a small variety of things to do, which makes it too easyposes no challenge at all and therefore gets very boring very fast. A tons of glitches, bugs and ridiculousness is simply everyware and ruins the game experience. Combat brings no improvement, main character is still absolutely over powered. Stealth is pitiful, boring and totally expendable.It is literary 10 times faster and easier just go and kill all the enemies in a fight. All Mini islands, which include collectibles on the sea are all a combination of just like 3 different types of islands.I have never ever seen collectibles such as boring as these. Terrible soundtrack except the main menu music. 90 of Mini Games against AI end up with a draw, which means you lost. The list could go on and on... this is only an example of what flustrated me the most during my gameplay.A few nicely looking locations.I can imagine someone who loves pirate stuff and sailing on an old ship yes you get only one ship for the entire gamemight forget these shortcomings and acctualy enjoy the game for quite some time, but other people should avoid this.
