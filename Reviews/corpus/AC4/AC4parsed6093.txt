The ultimate pirate game! After the somewhat disappointing game that was AC3, the series comes back with its best yet. Visuals are great, audio is solid with good voiceacting and the shanties sung by the crew as you sail are a nice touch. Gameplay is pretty standard AC stuff on land, though the berserker darts are probably overpowered.  The naval gameplay adds a lot of depth and really sets this game apart in the series.  Theres a great lineup of characters, including the main man Edward Kenway.  Theres a lot of content here too. I loved this game. Two thumbs up!
