Looking at the store page now, Im pretty upset that I purchased the Gold Edition AND the Season Pass and Im still missing at least 3 pieces of content DLC not the stupid Timesavers worth about 15 bucks. Other than that, this is all at once the best Pirate Game, Assassins Creed game, and the best open world game in a while. Even though the story cant stay focused on what makes the game cool, its still a shipload of fun!
