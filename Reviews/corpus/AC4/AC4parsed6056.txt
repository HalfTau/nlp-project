Adorable art of assassination and playstyle meets the amazing islands of seven seas. With its great customization, wide map, treasures, assassin and naval contracts, side activities, long and beautiful story, the best parts of history, and every possible thing you can see in this game is awesome. Playing a Welsh character against templars and he is a little far away from brotherhood. Youve got your hood, hidden blades, two swords I prefer cutlasses, pistols, a beautiful brig with a crew , going around the West Indies, assassinating, fighting, hunting, looking for medicines, liberating the islands. You wont need anything else than a good PC, thats the only problem. I like the AC3 which is about civil war, and the other Italian protagonist Ezio and the others Altair, Arno, Aveline etc. Even if they are all old games except Unity, my pc cant handle them with a proper 60fps while I can beat the 100 fps in every Crysis or Far Cry. Unity lacks of historical parts of French Revolution and the other AC games are very good but, the Black Flag, this was the game I always wanted. Assassination and piracy. I would really want to be able to play this one without no problem about optimization... Anyway, its a great game and if you have a mid or midhigh end gaming gear for today, I strongly recommend you to buy this one. Its an intense experience that you dont really want to miss.
