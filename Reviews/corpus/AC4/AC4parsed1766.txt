The Assassins Creed IV Balck Flag is a fun to play game. There are tons of collactables and costomizations in the game that are worth your time to explore. The combat system of both ground and naval are improved a ton from the previous game, but still get me kind of frustrated sometimes. However, if youre looking for an old school naval combat simulator, dont buy this game. The naval combat is not even close to realistic. The story is okay, not good as the old Ezio trilogy, but accaptable. The modern story line is boring and completely unnecessary, they could just store those background lore stories in the game menu for players to check out. The optimization of the game is pretty bad. I have a GTX960M labtop but it can only run the game around 30 fps. There are tons of other games with better graphic that have better performence on my laptop. I got this game on discount, which only costed me about 10. It definately worth the money even on full price 19.99.
