All Right lads. I am the only one that lived to tell this tale, and now im going to tell you exactly what this story is, if its action and adventure you want.Captain Kenway is your man. hes a thirsty one, a man who knows how to pick up whats rightfully his and to make whats anyone else, this game is full of adventure that you seek, if you want to sail ships and and plunder what value others have. Then you may find the awnser you seek, you can customize kenway to be anything you want, he can kill anything by your desire and can plunder anything by your desire, you can sail your ship to anywhere across the sea through grand caymon, jamaica, and the small towns that were there. you can have dual weilding pistols and swords to kill your foe. Do equipment like the javalin to fish and scaver sharks adn whales! And as well your very own personal way of delivering your reputation, you can take over cities and seige them to command your area of teh sea as well as your own fleet of pirates, there is no stopping you from the wretched english or the spanish Kenway doesnt give a . From Englind to kingston to new orland. Hes a lootin, shootin, Henry frootin rollins. theres even mystery in that man. that i dont even ask.
