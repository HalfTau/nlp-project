I only recently bought this game because of the holiday sale in Dec 2015.Assassins Creed Never played the series. I have seen bits and pieces of the series before Black Flag cuz of friends, but I was never interested.Black Flag Sid Meiers Pirates on crack.I played the crap out of Sid Meiers Pirates when it came out for the Xbox and replayed the crap out of it when it came out again for pc. Now Im playing the crap out of Assassins Creed IV Black Flag. I would love it if they would make Black Flag its own series.Do I recommend it? As an Assassins Creed game I have no idea. As a pirate game, yes, a thousand times yes.If Ubisoft just so happens to read this, please more. I will gladly pay full price for another game like this.Liked As stated above, its pretty much Sid Meiers on crack.Disliked Would have liked more ships you could sail around in. Fact is though Im only 27 through the story as Im typing this review so maybe there is more? More piraty stuff would be cool too. Make people walk planks. Seducing some goveners daughters is always fun too. Maybe kidnap a broad or two to ransom to said goveners. A bigger hat.I did have issues with some hardcore lag at first but I turned V Sync off and restarted the game and it has been runningflawlessly ever since. Read some reviews about Uplay being crap but my fix for that was to turn the cloud save thing off. Also, and I dont know if it actually helped me, I turned off the Uplay overlay as well.
