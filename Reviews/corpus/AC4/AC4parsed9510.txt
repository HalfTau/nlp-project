This game is a god damn awesome game. When your off the main quest, side quests are very preductive and fun like assassin contracks and hunting for keys for tresure or side pirate quests will seem quite fun and it might take you off the main quest for a while. The animus and Edward main quest will seem confusing at first but as you play through it will make more sence no Edward will not become an assassin very soon in the game but will come across them once but is not welcome into the creed at first but becomes one much later on in the game. The main quest will be more then 92 hours of gameplay plus that other 40 of it will be side missions and contracts would be about 30 hours or less or more I highly reccomend a fast comeputer for this or it will either be very laggy or a bit laggy and the sound might be outimed with the anomations. I think this game does a good job of doing a pirate assassin game I highly reccomend this game in your library
