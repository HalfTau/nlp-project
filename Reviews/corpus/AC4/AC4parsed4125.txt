This is my first Assassins Creed game and I enjoyed it very much.Edward Kenways story is one of the most depressing and brillaint at the same time.The Combat both ground and naval is fantastic with a lot to do outside of misisons thanks to the huge open world and many islands and citites to explore.I will check out the other AC games in the mean time.
