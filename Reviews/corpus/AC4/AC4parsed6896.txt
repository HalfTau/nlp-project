To start of yes, this is a Assassins Creed game, one of many. Does it surpass the one before? I can with a clear mind say yes and no. Honestly like many other point out is that this should have just been a pure pirate game instead of sticking the Assassins Creed logo on it. Its the same consept in story and mostly gameplay except for two major things. In order of story is Desmond, he was a character i was somewhat invested in since i started at the first Creed and now he is gone pointing to that they are dragging the Creed series unto a more fun History lesson witch i can support but still cringe a bit over. Gameplay is somewhat the same with maybe one more toy, even so you like me are probably gonna stick to pure swordfighting and such. Except from the naval gameplay witch is quite fun to the certain degree it become as repetetive as the normal combat. That saying, does not mean it is not fun. Hell the game is a barrel of laugh sometimes because this series has found what works and whats the point of fixing something that isnt broken.The world is gourgeous and the waters are beautiful filled with lots of content for you to drown yourself in.This game is one i recomend even though you only care for the gameplay or the story. If both, you are pretty much in for a good time
