I freakin love this game. Sailing over the seas while my crew sings shanties and the boat rocks on the incredibly detailed and beautiful waves never fails to make me a tad bit happier. Of course, the cities look great, and the combat is fun, as in all the AC games. Tangent Like the LEGO games, ACs combat is always near identical, so if you like the setting of the game, youre almost guaranteed to enjoy it. All around a worthwhile buy, especially for 30.
