This is a review after playing the game for only a little bit, it will be updated later.  I started my gameplay with a bit of a sour taste in my mouth as I didnt realize it had yet another wrapper program that added another login Uplay.  That was my fault though for not reading all the fine print.  It took a while to get that setup and ironed out, but its not that bad once in place.  I didnt find it installing any plugins, etc. without my knowledge as some people have reported.  I guess Ubisoft maybe figured out finally that people dont like that crap.  I suspect however that the apps with these wrappers do not share under Steams family sharing program, as no one that I share with can see this game in my list of shared applications.My actual gameplay experience was on the whole favorable.  The environment is beautiful, the gameplay is fairly intuitive after about 1015 minutes, even if youre using keyboard and mouse for the controls.  The voice acting is great, and the ship battle I played in the prologue was fun.  Im looking forward to playing more of it when I have time.
