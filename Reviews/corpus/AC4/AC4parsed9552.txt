Short review This game is HORRIBLE!Longer review I am really disappointed with this game as I was really looking forward to this, and when it was released early, I was over the moon!But now I believe that I maybe shouldnt have got so excited for it, as I was let down BIG TIME! Heres why I dont like it1 The controls are fiddly There has been a few times when I was in combat and I just didnt have control over Edward. Example, I would be fighting a group of 34 guys and when they got in close range, I couldnt move away and couldnt fight back either. Even when youre not in combat, running/climbing all over the environment can be tricky in places!2 Graphics problems The graphics are consistantly going weird on me. It becomes totally unplayable. If you want to see what I mean, please feel free to have a look at some screenshots Ive taken. Youll see what I mean!UPDATE Here are links to the screenshots3 Gameplay can be generally frustrating I must admit, I cant remember if AC has a selectable difficulty as it was a while since I started the game, but I ALWAYS start on easy mode on the first playthrough of every game I buy, just to get the hang of it and then move up after. But Im still on my first playthrough and can be waaaaay to hard. The number of times Ive actually got super angry is unreal. Avoid this game if you have anger issues/prone to high blood pressure. You may just suffer a stroke!Finally, I think its such a shame. I had really high hopes for this game and really did enjoy it for a little while, and the one good point is that the storyline is pretty good and sucks you in, but knowing what I now know, I really regret buying this now! I know Steam says Im entitled to only 1 refund, this may just be the one time I exercise that right!Avoid like the plague!
