Edward Kenway sure is my favorite Assassins Creed character so far... and this is indeed the best game of the series I still havent played Unity.Highly recommended, with well over 40 hours of fun!After all this time, plenty of AC have been launched, and I havent played them. Nevertheless, this was indeed an amazing ride, and I highly doubt I will find the new chapters better.The ship wars was one of the most entertaining mini games so far in the series.
