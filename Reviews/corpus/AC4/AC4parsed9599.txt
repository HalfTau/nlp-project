Been with the assassins creed series since the beginning, and overall been very happy! AC4 Has brought a whole new meaning to the series. The capturing graphics got me hook the very minute I started the game. The voice acting and freeroam world bring it to a whole new level as well. If you like Sid Miers Pirates, you will love this game! Highly recommend!
