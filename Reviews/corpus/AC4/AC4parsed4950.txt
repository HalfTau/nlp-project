Small crowded street chase simulator 5000tm. The chase missions through the cities are an exercise in frustration which kill the illusion of an open world. Not to mention a tired and over used mechanic. The phrase Oh look  ANOTHER stupid chase mission. was relevant way to many times. If you are just looking for a pirate game pass on this one. If a semipirate themed Assassins Creed game appeals to you then go for it.
