If you are having WIndows 8.1 installed you might have a problem running this game or event AC3, or AC2 or Brotherhood or Revelations... only AC1 works at the moment and Im analyzing this problem with the Ubisoft Suppport.But it leaves a bitter taste if youve PREordered a game like I did with nearly every of this titles... and cannot play it. Its a shame really.AC3 played nicely on Windows 8.0 but somehow, after the Update to 8.1 no AC game except the first one works at all.If you are wise, wait for Christmas, and buy it then... you will miss out on some content but hey, you can play it when you order it. .UPDATEAfter one week and countless tries, I figured out that Ubisoft doesnt like the Storage Spaces from WIndows 8.1. With Windows 8.0 and the GameData on Storage Spaces I didnt have a problem, so I hope that Ubisoft is working on a fix for that
