This game is in my top 3 all time favorite games. To have piracy mixed with assasination game play is just mind blowing. Its really a shame that Assasins Creed ramped the time line between games soo much. It would have been great to see another one of these.Game play is very open with endless oppurtunies. You not only have an endless selection of upgrades with ship accessories, but you have and control your own FLEET. I truly hope to see another game like this. Its a shame no one pursues pirate games
