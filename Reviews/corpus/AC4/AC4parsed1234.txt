One of my favorite AC games. Great story, and cool take on the Abstergo part of the story.ProsPiratesShip battles are well done, pretty funHUGE gameworldGood story, lengthy as wellGreat characters, all the historical piratesGraphic are awesomeInteresting fleet building mechanic, like managing your assassins in the older gamesCons As with any AC game, so. many. collectibles...Fragments, viewpoints, Mayan statues, treasures, treasure maps, the treasure from the treasure maps, forts etc, etc. Whereas AC3 seemed too short, this game almost seems too long considering half of the game is accomplished through ship battles/missions which can be very difficult.Upgrading your ship is a pain in theand takes a lot of grinding, by attacking and boarding enemy shipsIf your ship isnt upgraded, some parts of the game are very difficultCertain ship upgrades have to be unlocked by finding diagrams which in underwater ruins guarded by sharks. Sounds cool, but I found more annoying than anything else.Overall 8.5/10I definietly recommend this game if the idea of being a pirate at all sounds cool to you. Must play for AC fans.
