Best Assassins Creed game I play so far with a great story, unlike other Assassin Creed game. The story line has a really happy ending even though the middle might be sad and not hoping that it would happen. The best part about the game is controlling your own ship into battle, I only wish is that I get to upgrade the ship more or move into it interior, That would be the best base spot ever if the game would be more upgradeable. Overall it a great game on story line and ship battle. Wish they give more time on upgrading houses, ship, interior. Cause one it complete it still look the same as what you start with.
