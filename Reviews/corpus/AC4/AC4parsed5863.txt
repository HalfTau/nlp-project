One of my favourite Assassins Creed games since ACII. The story could be better but hey, anything is better than Unity, Crash Team Racing has a better storyline and Gameplay than ACUnity. Once you have finished the game you have hours of collectables  forts that we have become used to in other AC titles.The controls for this game are great, combat is the same old counterbased style which i like. The Ship combat is easy to get used to for anyone who has not played ACIII. The free running is solid apart from a few glitches here and there but for me it was a rare occurence.In conclusion this game is worth the 20 I payed for it and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to play or have played other AC Games.  10/10 would play again
