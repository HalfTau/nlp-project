The only reason I would not recommend this Game is Uplay....you have to create an account etc...WHY GAMERS NEED A THIRD PARTY DRM ON TOP OF STEAM? ......and they always have problems...I lost 2 games because of Uplay...had to contact support...took me 3 weeks to solve it.... ACTUALLY YOU PAY FOR THE GAMES BUT YOU MUST  HACK THEM IN ORDER TO PLAY!!! THANKS UBISOFT!
