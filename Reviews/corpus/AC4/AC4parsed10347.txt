Do enjoy this game at about 30 hours on second try and still havent completed it to 100. The game has little bugs that I have seen but know they will be fixed with patch. Worth it for the money but if you dont have still worth getting when the price drops. Great game for any FPS player. Also you get a ship and chase after booty.... treasure not actuall P
