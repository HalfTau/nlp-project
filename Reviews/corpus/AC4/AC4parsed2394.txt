This is probably the very best Assassins Creed there ever was since Syndicate, at the time of this review.Moving around as Edward is fun and free, but where this game truly shines is in its pirating.This game is the quintessential pirate simulator.You man your own ship and crew. They sing sea shanties. You get into ship battles, with crashing waves in terrible storms, all to a musical score akin a Pirate of the Caribbean movie. But it doesnt stop there! Once the enemy ship is weakened, you board the damn thing, and fight the crew on the deck of their own ship. And its all so wonderfully seamless. From sailing, to ship battle, to boarding and fighting, it all just flows right into the next without a loading screen, all in real time, right there on the map, next to the island you just got done exploring. You can probably still see the trees you were swinging through earlier.The action only stops when you finally defeat the enemy crew, but its necessary since you get to decide what to do with them. Kill them and scuttle the ship to repair your own? Capture the ship and make it work for you in fleet minigame? Let the survivors go free and lower your wanted levels? Thats up to you.If you had any interest or liked any of the other Assassins Creed games, this one is an absolute must buy. It simply does not disappoint.
