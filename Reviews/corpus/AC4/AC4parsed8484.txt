What a ride! Just finished it. The best of the series so far. Alot to do.The good  upgrade system, Kenways fleet management that you can manage with a phone/tablet app too!, everything about the boat and what you do with is extraordinary! The story is good, the music is very good, characters are complete!The bad  Eavesdropping/following people is REALLY annoying and there are too much of these missions. You are forced, again, to play multiplayer to get every achivement. Optional objectives are not always obvious, you have to check them manually.9/10!
