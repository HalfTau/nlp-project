There are not enough games about Pirates, and most of the ones out there arent very good. But Black Flag is good. Its fun. Its got some lovely visuals and some very satisfying combat, both at sea and on land.The worst thing about this Assassins Creed game is the assassins creed parts. The modern day section where you play a game developer working for an evil quebec based games company feels half baked, and the story about how the developers got a massive and lengthy insult at their company past them is probably more interesting than the story the modern section tells.  The other Ubisoftisms, like the weird mesh of linear and openworld and the watchtowers dont improve the game either, and overall I feel like it could have been much better if someone else was making the game. Also Uplay is absolute but you probably knew that already.In summary, its a good game, I just would like it more if it was made by a different company.
