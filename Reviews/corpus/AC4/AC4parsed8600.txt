Awesome game to the end, by far the best Assassins creed I have played yet since Assassins Creed II.  Naval combat has been refined from ACIII and is a blast to sail the seas of the West Indies.  There is tons to do and you can get lost in doing the side stuff that you will completely forget that there is a main story to finish which fits in nicely with the lore that Ubisoft has created.  If you are still thinking about getting this dont think just get it and have a blast playing it.
