This game was a birthday gift to myself, though it came out a day after my birthday... Nov 18 and boy has it been worth it. I have never played any of the previous assassins creed games, but I believe I picked the perfect one to start with. I am totally enamored with it. The ship to ship combat is easily my favorite part of this game, and on many an occasion I have fistpumped with my virtual crew on the successful boarding of a larger Spanish or British ship. In short... this game brings out the pirate in me! ARR!I have run into little to no bugs at all in the game, and it runs fine on my system, especially with the big screen as my main monitor, and the surround sound. I am pretty sure the neighbors think I am conquering the block, and probably expect me to swing through their windows any minute, yelling Heave to, mi hearties!I have yet to try the pvp aspect of it, as I am not much of a pvp player, but I am loving the heck out of the story mode, even the parts in the Montreal office. Well designed game, well written story, highly immersive. All of the characters I have encountered thus far have a certain charm to them, including the one I am playing, Captain Kenway. I have been posting pictures of my adventures on facebook, and I may even blog about it in the very near future, or at least post some youtube videos.Hats off to the crew at Ubisoft who put this game together, as it was just what I needed to scratch my looting and pillaging itch!
