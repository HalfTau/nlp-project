Ive played the FirstIve played the SecondIve played BrotherhoodIve played RevelationsIve played ThreeI can safely say that AC4 is the best installment of them all. The game was such a cool and refreshing change of scenery that made me want it to never end. The story was decent and it had its fair share of quirks a Ubisoft game wouldnt be complete without them, but never did I feel frustrated with the mechanics. The best experiences came from just sailing the high seas in free roam.Fish in the Sea was the best sea shanty btw, none of that overplayed drunken sailorbr
