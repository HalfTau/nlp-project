So I wont lie this game is pretty emersive, well rounded to a point you really get into to it. Your sitting there hacking away at a british man 0 war with your pirate saber having a ball then BAM! All of sudden all that emersion is shattered, like your dreams IRL will be in 20 years. You get yanked out of having fun and then put in this futuristic office in lufantufel france, with some supervisor going ya im going to need those TPS reports by saturday and your like Hoe saturday is my day off!.......also where did my pirate stuff go.......what am I doing here. Turns out your not really a pirate just a nerd with a computer having fun with a simulation.........kinda like in real life. Then you discover you have a subplot outside of best pirate simulator 2013, that you do not infact care about. at all. infact best pirate simulator 2013 could have been a stand alone game without lfantufel frances office involvemnt. Not going to lie though when your not having to turn in those TPS reports the pirate simulator is really fun.
