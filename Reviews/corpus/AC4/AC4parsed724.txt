If you buy a Ubisoft game in this line of games, this is the one to buy.  Black Flag is fun, and has a pretty solid combat system... the other ones are clunky glitchfilled romps of pain and miseryother than AC2, which is also pretty good.But, youd have to cash out money to Ubisoft, who are pretty bad about DRM you need to install their crappy DRM, Ubiwhateveritscalled to play it, and also do a lot of needless cash grabs for their newer games.  So, again, if you have to support these games or are interested in them... this is one to look at.  The boat stuff is dang fun, theres a lot to explore, and best of all?  Theres no RNG lootboxes to ruin the experience and take away content that should have been implemented in the game, or that feed gambling addictions.
