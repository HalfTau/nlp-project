After finishing the game, I honestly believe AC3 was a better AC game, and I played ALL the AC games, so Im no noob to the series.At first I appreciated the gameplay changes, additions, graphics, the first act of the story, the exploration but lets be honest, going to every single miniisland and going on a tedious collection spree got boring FAST, and naturally the improved and expanded ship mechanics.But... The game kind of lacked something.The 2nd act of the story, which was pretty long, just felt like one huge meh.I wont complain about the character of Edward, but needless to say that by the time the 3rd act of the story rolled in, I was disliking him, preferring Connor over him by miles.Yes, the 3rd act of the story was good enough to make me not lose all hope, and the reveal around 3/4 or 4/5 through the game in the modern setting was actually very nice and a bit unexpected for me, but...In the end, having read Assassins Creed Forsaken a canon book that is essentially Haytham Kenyways journal from youth to his eventual death that there is not a spoiler for AC3, technically, due to the fact that everyone dies eventually, ya know?, I already knew exactly what happened with Edward in his later years, and how some of his character developement around the late parts of AC4 were simply gone, and overall..The game just lacked an enticing cliffhanger, a twist, a hook for a sequel.Indeed, the modern day story has moved ahead very subtly, more so than Assassins Creed Revelations.In fact, I dare say Im actually pitting Black Flag with Revelations in a contest for the worst Assassins Creed title in terms of story, narrative, and overall feeling after finishing the game.Edit I meant talking about the modern day setting. The wrap up to Altair and Ezio were both excellent, forgive me for that.Edit 2 Actually you know what? Forget what I said about Revelations.The game ended rather well, its the actual game itself that hardly felt like it was a step forward from Brotherhood, and how it was just all too similar in feel.The story was ok, I just hated the 1st person segments and the whole safe mode animus feel.Its Black Flag that stands alone with an unenticing ending, then.That is to say, I do believe that when an Assassins Creed game isnt very good, its still pretty damn good, which is why I 99 the game Im missing 3 buries chests that can only be found by getting maps from Kenways Fleet, and 1 glitched viewpoint I synced, by the game didnt count for me that I did, so unless that gets patched, my save will forever be bugged and will remain at 99.I did appreciate the content you could access while wandering around Abstergo Entertainment, though, particularly anything related to Desmond, and the Subject Zero tapes.Also, that single Subject One tape was quite an interesting look into seeing how it was inuniverse for someone else to experience memories in the animus prototype, back when Warren Vidic had a young and EXTREMELY cocky voice, heh.I just wished for more plot advancement in the modern day setting, thats all.Overall, Id rate this game high, and its not quite the disappointment Far Cry 3 was for me I rather not explain that in an AC4 forum, and Im eagerly waiting for Freedom Cry, and even Liberation HD, so I can finally play the story of Aveline, and later actually allow myself to play the Aveline content in AC4.Yeah, I like story chronology, thats the way I am.
