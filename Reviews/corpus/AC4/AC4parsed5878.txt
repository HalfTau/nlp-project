This was definitely my most favorite of the Assassins Creed franchise so far.But why?Because.. PIRATES.I loved upgrading my ship, adding to my fleet, running out of ammo for my mortars and running for the nearest shoreline even!The ONLY thing that was irritating about this game was that you could buy all of the crafting components without having to do any of the fishing/hunting parts of the game. That made it a bit too easy IMHO.No Spoiler Favorite part Captain Kidds son.... who didnt see that coming?Definitely and heartily recommend this game to me hearties! Yar!
