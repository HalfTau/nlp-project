Its a pirates life for me! The best parts of Assassins Creed 3 turned into a whole game. Everything is fun, from sailing your ship to harpooning whales to exploring islands. Combats the same as its been for the last few games, with some old classic gadgets as well. And THE SEA SHANTIES HOLY CRAP THE SEA SHANTIES. Worth it for them alone.
