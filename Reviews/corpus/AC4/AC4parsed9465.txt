I had given up the Assassins Creed franchise for dead after they became a yearly installment. I loved AC1 and AC2, but the formula got tired and I couldnt get interested in AC2 Brotherhood though it is considered one of the high points of the series. Despite concern over the setting of AC4 I thought that it might just be a cheap pirate cashin I purchased the game and couldnt have been more pleased. The setting is truly excellent and beautifully realized. The protagonist, Edward kenway, is a breath of fresh air into the stale series. His shoes are a pleasure to inhabit as he has a lust for life and adventure that is refreshing. Also, Edward is not motivated by the usual assassin t, but rather money and fame. This makes him a much more real character. The story does not strive to be as absurdly oversized as in previous games and that is fine. The segments taking place outside the animus are kept to a minumum and can be somewhat amusing if you dont take them seriously they really are most enjoyable when seen as a sort of selfparody by Ubisoft. I highly recommend this game and spent dozens of hours enjoying it.
