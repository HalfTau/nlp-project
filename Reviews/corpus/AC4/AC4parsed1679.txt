As a longtime Assassins Creed Player, this is generally more of the same fare, nothing new here other than the ship combat at the pirate atmosphere. Despite almost universal recognition, I found the storyline far less engaging than assassins creed 3, to which I prefer over this game.Either way, it is a beautiful and welcomed addition to the AC line!
