Cannot recommend this game enjoy. Huge open world, with loads to do. Some tasks are a little repetitive with the side missions, main missions have way too many follow and eavesdrop missions but otherwise they are quite varied which is great. These 2 points are my only real issues with the game overall.Sailing, harpooning, collectables, hunting, ship battles, looting and so much more. Doesnt really feel like an AC game though but is definitely the best Pirate game I have ever played. Main campaign 1520 hours.Been playing over 40 hours and still have side quests, legendary ships to destroy and will be going back to complete these.The atmostphere is the game is also fantasic and drags you into this world and you wont want to leave.Overall score 9.6/10
