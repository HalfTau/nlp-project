At heart, AC IV is a great game. Well, its a great pirate game, anyway. The sailing feels great, and ship battles are fun. Whether is blasting away with cannons or climbing the rigging to assassinate enemy captains as I capture a ship, playing as a pirate is extremely fun, and more than a little satisfying.And therein lies the problem.Because AC IV does not want me to play as a pirate. It wants me to play Assassins Creed. You know, annoying hud, immersion wrecking, failed attempts to create set piece missions, and linear, scripted content constantly interrupting my open world frolicking, the tacked on AC bits are the worst addition to an otherwise fine pirate game ever created.And they really are bad.Whether its the twenty or so tailing and eavesdropping missions, or the way in which whole swaths of a town suddenly become hostile territory just to make the mission harder or the idea that while tailing I have to look at the person I am following literally ever 20 seconds or fail the mission or the absolutely horrid HUD  the worst I have ever seen, in any game, ever  tacking AC IV onto an otherwise solid pirate experience served to do nothing other than ruin the pirate game this could have been.And thats before the modern day content. The parts where you are yanked out of the game and forced to walk slowly in first person mode as you perform hacking missions as an errand boy at a Templar run video game development office. Yep, dont see those in the previews or advertising screens, do we? Know why? Its because they suck. Add to that the worst hacking mini games ever invented by man, and the modern day sections are easily the worst of this entire series. And that takes some work indeed.Ubisoft could have built themselves a fantastic pirate game. By leaving the absolutely dreadful AC IV stuff out. Because adding it in did nothing for the game but drag it down.Cannot recommend done with this series forever.
