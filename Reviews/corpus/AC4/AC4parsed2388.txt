This is by far my favorite Assassins Creed game. This has bits of everything you could want in a game. And the various locations are just breathtaking. This was the first in the franchise to have naval warfare and despite that I think the subsequent editions have been disappointing. The gameplay is fantastic, and is less cumbersome with Keyboardmouse that most of the other Assassins Creed games. Lastly the story itself is pretty good. If you still have doubts, one word for you  PIRATE !!!
