After Revelations and III, I had my reservations about the Assassins Creed franchise.. Currently, I am about 16 hrs in IV and In my opinion, IV is a breath of fresh air and has reignited my interest in the direction of this franchise.. The story can be lack luster and in general, follow the same format as the other games.., However, the large amount of terrific side activities, collectibles, and the vast open world in IV is fantastic.. I definitely recommend purchasing this game.
