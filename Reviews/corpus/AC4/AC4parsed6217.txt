Really an interesting turn for the Assassins Creed francise, this game provides something other than just stabbing dudes and brings in the whole new concept of ships! I like the concept and it is executed nicely, with amazing graphics and an interesting world to explore with large cities like the other AC games. This new mechanic allows for epic ship battles and an interesting story line. A must play if your a fan of stabbing dudes while wearing an eyepatch.
