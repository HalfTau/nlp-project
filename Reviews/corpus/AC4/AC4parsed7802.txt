I got a confession to make I havent finished the game. I have 57 hours in and I havent finished the game!?!?!?! I will take me another 50 hours I think.  Really liked the pirate game play on this game as well as the fighting.  2 complaints about this game The stupid underwater mini games I just dont like them.  And the inability to use a dual screen set up with this game. Overall great game better than all its predecessors 9/10
