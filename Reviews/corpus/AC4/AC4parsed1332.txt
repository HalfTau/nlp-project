This game is probably one of my favorite Assassins Creed games, only rivaled by the Ezio collection. It leans more towards the piratey aspect of the game, but that is in no way a bad thing.Ive had those shantys stuck in my head for days.I suppose the only notable bad thing about this game is if youre looking for 100 achievements/UPlay completion you may have trouble if you do not have that many friends on Uplay that are actively playing the game. There are plenty of people in the Steam discussions also seeking friends for this sole purpose though, and i had no trouble looking for help.
