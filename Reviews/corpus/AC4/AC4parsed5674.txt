While I agree with many other reviews in that this game is almost identical to the other assassinss creed games in gameplay, there are some new features, and a new story line to follow which i believe make it a worthwhile game, however I play most games simply for the storyline and the main bits, I dont do a lot of nitpicky do everything and test every scenario. XDIf you havent played any of the other AC games, some parts of the story wont make sense. but thats the same with most series right?In summary, the game is very similar to other AC games, but still very enjoyable.
