its a great game that is a must buy especially if this is your first dip into the assassins creed series it mostly allows you to go where you want without limitations and you dont have to wait till the end game to unlock more powerfull weaponsif you have the money and resources go crazy i also love taking over forts and getting land the only thing i would have liked was if you can take over ships and use them as your own i HATE how futile the jackdaw is compared to other ships like i beat many man o wars the least you can do is let me sail one
