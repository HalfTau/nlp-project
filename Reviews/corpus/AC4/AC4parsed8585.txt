A superb pirate game on the high seas of the carribean. Sure there is a little Assassins Creed shoehorned in to keep it on franchise. The naval combat is great and the exploration is seamless. The missions are varied enough that you get some good playtime out of the land based sections.All in all a great game. Only bummer I would give is that the Steam version requires UPlay, so you have to run two game clients at the same time.
