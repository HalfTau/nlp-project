A fantastic Pirate game but a mediocre AC game. From sea shanties, to whaling, to finding buried treasure, to engaging ships, boarding them, and sinking them, this game does not lack. However the story is somewhat bland, but the gameplay makes up for it more than generously. I still give it a solid 8.5/10 because I get completely lost when playing this game, you will sink hours into it and love every minute of it. If you are a fan of anything pirates, then this game is a must.
