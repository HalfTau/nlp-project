yeah so i tried to play it and i tried to log in with a uplay account, it logged me in and it was really weird and buggy, i could NOT play the game because it was not there and i couldnt close the launcher for uplay without task manager. i tried to change my password which worked but after i tried logging in again it banned my account for no reason other then the fact THAT I ING LOGGED IN. you ubisoft
