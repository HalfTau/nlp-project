Played AC4 on the 360 back in the days and loved every moment of it. Saw that it was on sale for 5.43 and had to pick it up.The graphics are amazing and the gameplay rocks. The Naval side of this Assassins creed was such a great move by ubisoft.Would highly recommend the game to anyone who loves an action pact Assassins Creed. Only downside I can think of is the screen tearing I know it can be fixed by Vsync and the FPS drops to around 3045 in some places on the map if you have Vsync on.
