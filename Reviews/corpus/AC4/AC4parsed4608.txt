Game looks ike a lot of fun but the games desont save ever. Supposedly, its suppost to keep a copy in a savegames folder on the hard drive but now it no longer even creates the needed folder. I would love to play this game, but dear God we need to be able to save our progress. Steam WONT REFUND if the game has been played for more than two hours! !
