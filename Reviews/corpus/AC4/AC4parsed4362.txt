Best AC game out there, especially on pc. Improvement in controls compared to ac3. Looks nice. Your pirate ships more fun than gta. Good entertainment, ok story, no surprises. Ship spawning couldve been done better, slight lack of dept there but can be expected with this series or console titles in general.
