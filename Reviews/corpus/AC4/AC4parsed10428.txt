When I played the PS3 version of this game, I remembered a comment in an interview by one of the Ubisoft guys where he stated that they had mastered the flee movement between manmade structures and natural objects like trees.  I remembered it because the PS3 version does not feel like they have mastered it at all  Edward does at LOT of unwanted things.I read that Ubisoft was treating the PC like a real market and releasing the PC version with the nextgen Anvil engine used with the PS4/XBone versions of the game, so I got this version.Beyond the phenomenal graphics improvements this version contains over the PS3 version  I definitely see where they feel like theyve mastered the movement.  With a more powerful processor controlling the new free movement AI in the updated engine  Edward moves much more responsively and is incredibly fluid.The game looks just astounding with everything tuned to the max.
