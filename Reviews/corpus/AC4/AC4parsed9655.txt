An awesomely fun addition to the series. Most of the things that frustrated me in earlier games are either completely absent or substantially reduced in this one. Combat controls are much simpler and shiptoship combat is very fluid. The Kenways Fleet minigame and its companion app for tablets are very nice additions. There is still some bugginess with a couple of side missions, but the main missions are pretty solid. Optional goals arent well explained or well documented, but these are only going to matter to completionists. Some control information, especially in combat, isnt wellexplained, either. But theyre things that you can pick up on over the course of the game. If youre just out for a good pirate romp without a parrot, youll have a blast and probably want a second or third runthrough.
