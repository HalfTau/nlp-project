This was the game that I wanted to play since 2013 even though it was from Ubisoft my last Ubisoft game that Ive played was Brotherhood, their recycle model has been what kept me away from their games, but this one, I really wanted to play it, but after one day trying to launch it due to the game crashing on startup with the error ACBF4SP.exe has stopped working I found a solution which was not by them because Ive made a ticket support and they took some longtime to responde so I installed it on my main drive my ssd and it works.I went to play it and I notice 50 fps on a 980 ti and the game has this mechanic that when not on 60 fps it automatically goes into 30 fps I didnt even bother to know what the  option made me had so many performance issues, since the game crashed again when I was swimming after my boat went to hell.Its a shame I like pirates and blowingup in a open world game maybe in the future someone makes a decent pirates game and doesnt have the name Ubisoft on it or ing uplay.
