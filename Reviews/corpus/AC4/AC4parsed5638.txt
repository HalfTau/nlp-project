If you havent played Black Flag yet, you should.  Black Flag does a really awesome job of giving you the entire AC experience, while adding the finely tuned pun intended ship warfare and shanties, which make the games expansive world so much more pleasant to traverse.  I consistently fall under what I call Grand Theft Auto Syndrome as I completely forget what I was doing, to go off pirating some ship I just saw for the fun of it all to the tune of What do you do with a drunken sailor.With a semigoofy storyline Kenway is a superb assassin, having never been actually trained as an assassin, and the fact that I wanted MORE content from this great game this is easily a 9/10, and a definite mustplay for fans of the series.
