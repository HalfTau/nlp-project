I would not recomend this game to anyone. Not that I think its a bad game but you should buy the cd. The reason being that when you download it through steam it says that there is an error. And no matter what you do it wont fix. I am not the only one who has had this problem and I am mad that I spent 39.99 on a game for it not to work and neither ubisoft nor steam will help me.
