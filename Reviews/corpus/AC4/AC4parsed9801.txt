Stunning game. Assassins Creed IV Black Flag may leave some buyers confused. How does one continue as a Kenway with the ending of Assassins Creed III being the way it was. Well, you play as youself in the Animus. Abstergo is now a game company too D BIG PROBLEM ON STEAM! THE GAME IS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. IN THE UK ITS 39.99 WHERAS I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON US FOR 34.99 WHICH IS 21.38. Always have a look there, they even use Steam DRM even though Uplay MUST be a mandatory secondary client.
