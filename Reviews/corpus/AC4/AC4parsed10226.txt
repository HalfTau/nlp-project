Assassins Creed IV has been a great and addictive adventure thats only major shortcoming is when it pulls you out of sailing the high seas during the Golden Age of Piracy and reminds you that is an AC game.Building upon the Naval Combat of AC3, Black Flag delivers the Best pirate sims since Sid Miers Which is high praise. There is an incredible satisfaction when Black flag puts you on the helm of your ship and lets you loose on to pillage and plunder, with the tight combat mechanics of parry and destroy that has become a staple of the AC series. I have never been a giant fan of thier free run mechanic but if you like it then it is back with little if any change. Top all that off with an endless supply of islands and forts to explore and nice micro managing side piece and you will be hard pressed to ever not have somthing to be doing. My only major gameplay gripe is the ever present Follow quests, they were annoyong and tiresome in the previous ones and while Ubisoft has done so much good in this AC they still lean to heavy on this tired quest type.I havent had too many tech problems game runs at 35FPS on a modet rig with no big frame rate dips that I could see, so take that as you will. From lush jungles to the changing waves of the open seas, their clearly was a lot of attention to enviroment and I had my breath taken away a few times.AC4 does a very good job of revitalizing a series that I felt was getting very stagnent and had lost me a few installments back. Its biggest set back still being the convoluted story of AC with some of its outdated follow quest.While not perfect I reccomend this game for any and all Skallywags that are looking to itch that pirate itch.AC4 Black Flag. 4/5Check out my other reviews and add me!
