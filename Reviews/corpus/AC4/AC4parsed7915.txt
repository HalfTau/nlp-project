One of the best assassins creed games in a long time. I wasnt even hyped for this so it took me by surprise how amazing the game was.You dont play as an honorable character, or a character driven by revenge. Edward Kenway is driven by money and the persuit of more money! A nice change to see things from another perspective.Combat is more fluid than AC3 but also made hard again like AC1. And I dont mean hard as in big tough guy who blocks everything you throw at him those guys were cheap in AC3, but you have to plan your way out of situations. Take out the small fry, let the Captain ready his gun and then use the Brute as a human shield and finish the Captain. Then escape!The ship side of things is sooooo awesome. They took what was good in AC3 and expanded on it. More attacking methods and lots of nautical terms which is nice. And due to the open world nature of the game, you can get off of your ship and explore an island and while you are on it you can hear a random ship battle between Spanish and English ships out at sea.The story like all AC games keeps you coming back for more and the modern day aspect has been reduced to very little if you dont like that side of things. Or if you do like the modern day angle, lots of exploration and discovery. Basically its there if you want it and can be ignored if you dont.I could go on saying much more basically this game is worth the purchase.
