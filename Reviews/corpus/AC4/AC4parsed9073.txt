I have to say this is the best one in the series so far. There is so much to do, so much to explore. Sometimes things can get a little repetitive such as raiding ships and such, but over all the game draws you in and keeps you there. The graphics are beautiful from the rain running down roof tops to your foot prints in the sand. The replay value seems like it will be high as well because you can do so many things and nothing needs to be done the same way twice. I rec this game to anyone.
