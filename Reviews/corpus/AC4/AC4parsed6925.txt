I have been a big fan of AC since AC2, and I have to admit that Ubisoft did such a good job in Black Flag. Despite it is an action game, it is also the best naval battle game ever! The story line is great and there is so many extra places to explore! The naval battles can be really challenging and funny, espeacially four legendary ships. The only thing I do not appreciate much that there is way too many fragments to collect. I spent as much as time that I finished the storyline to sync 100, but still, the best AC for now!
