Paid 30 for a steam activation of this game on Amazon. Way more fun than ACIII, being a pirate is great, have been having tons of fun in my first 10 hours of gameplay. Stay tuned for a better review once Ive actually finished the game but for now, totally recommended. Tons of collectibles, as always, and bonus points for the Voynich Manuscript being among them.After ACIII, people probably have a lot of doubts about whether Ubisoft Montreal blew it again on Black Flag. Let me just say that I played a couple hours of ACIII before putting it down in disappointment, and so far Black Flag looks like another game I will strive to 100, just like II, Brotherhood, and Revelations. Dont let the disappointment of 3 influence your judgement of this game.While the game itself is truly great, you should be warned. While I havent experienced the serious technical issues that many claim to have encountered on PC, this game does force you to use UPlay, and its not a secret to anybody that UPlay is superduper. The game also mysteriously decides to minimize itself every so often if I input too many xbox360 controller commands too quickly.
