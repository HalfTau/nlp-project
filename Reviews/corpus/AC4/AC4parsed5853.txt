Pirated this game originally considering its a ubisoft product. Was pleasantly surprised, but was full of bugs so I thought buying the game would fix it  you know, having an official version.Boy, was I wrong. There are more bugs than the pirated version how ironic considering its a Pirate game. Player control bugs, graphics bugs, NPC bugs etc...Like most of ubisofts products its a good video game but an utterly CRAP piece of software. A direct console port with no enthusiasm at all.I will not reccomend a Ubisoft product until they start doing their job as SOFTWARE ENGINEERS properly. They should either stop producing video games/stick to designing them or get their act together.
