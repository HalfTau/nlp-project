I have played every assassins creed game on the computer multiple times and I love the story line, very imaginative. Unfortunatly the gameplay peaked at assassins creed revilations and has since simplified. The sea battles are fun and a great part of the game that sets it apart from the rest of the series, but unlike every other game in the series it limits you in equipable weapons. Personally I loved switching up my weapons to see all the different ways I could kill opponents in the previous games, but in this game you are limited to dual swords. 3 was bad enough with the tomahawk being overly powerful, making it pointless to change weapons, but at least you had the choice. Even with this draw back this was a great addition to the assassins creed line up.
