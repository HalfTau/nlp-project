Moving the character around is a chore. It constantly switches its direction during the parkour, overruning your input in the controls as if the game thinks it knows better than you where you want to go. You press forward  jump and the character jumps in a tangent to reach some platform that you werent looking at. You hold the running button and try to run through the environment and the character climbs a wall if you get near it. This bloated movement, constant and frustrating interruptions of your input NEVER STOPS.Climbing is boring. Just hold forward  A until you reach the top. Occasionally you have to press another button or slightly change the directional button/stick as if the game is trying to wake you up and ask you to participate.Melee combat is beyond boring. Just press B counter then X attack. There, now watch as your character makes half a dozen sword attack animations while you do nothing. Occasionaly you may have to press Y break defense, then X attack. The sword strokes give no sensation of weight or impact.Mouse  keyboard doesnt make this game any better.Theres no danger of getting killed in combat  the only danger is some arbitrary crap causing you to desynchronize and then having to repeat the chore. You dont fight the enemy, you fight the controls.The warship combat is the good part, but it doesnt make up for how bad the rest of the game is.Overall frustrating, boring and an insult for anyone looking for good action gameplay. Ive tried, tried and tried to get my moneys worth playing it, but the fun never showed up. I regret wasting my time and money with this.
