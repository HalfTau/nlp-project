What can i say?Finally an story orignal idea! instead of the usual oh my father was an assassin, better start jumping on living thing to make them dead Eward ends up being caugth in the templar/assassins war against his will. It has the usual elements, jumpy jumpy, stabby stabby, hidey hidey that we expect from an AC game, not that thats a bad thing,HOWEVERwhat really sets this game apart from the other games is the excitement and engagement, the ship battles are perfect, thrilling and satisfying, the missions are fruitful, always introducing new advantages in stealthing or downright rampaging, he is a pirate after all, which ubi captured well. Edward is focused and acute, no faffing about like in ACRev have to write it like that now, thanks ACRogue  and i know its a grevious sin to praise this... but the environments, the isalnds, the trees, the beaches, are all so lovely to look at.
