This game is amazing! Graphics and sound are beautiful and bombastic, atmospheric with daytime changes, awesome water, cannon blasts and pirate shanties. The vast open world is filled up with activities, but feels not so overloaded like in some other openworld games. Its only tons of fun looting chests, running after shanty sheets and searching for treasures, hunting animals for crafting materials and fighting on sea and land. When cruising around with your ship, you can stop by a small island and jump into the water to swim over there and discover its secrets. I love just climbing around in the rigging of my ship.In my opinion, this is the best Assassins Creed and one of the best video games I ever played! I LOVE IT!
