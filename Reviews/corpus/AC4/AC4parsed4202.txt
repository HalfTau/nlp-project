I dont get the reviews here, since I had NO PROBLEMS WITH UPLAY!The annoying part about the game is the fact, that it feels pretty unfinished.Here a little list of stuff, that I had to see Enemy AI figures spinned unnatural in the middle, so the feet showed towards me, but the stomach hat a 180 view. The character jumped at a edge and instead of getting it, he flew through it. The fighting was the most amazing part. I blocked a guy, but being 3 metres could be more away from him. I attacked a guy and he just disappeared. I had enemies on the minimap, that werent there. Finishing Moves hit everything, but not the enemy, that you used it on. That looks really crappy!There was much more annoying stuff, that I have NEVER seen in a Assassins Creed part before and I played them ALL!It is a shame, that Ubisoft just released this game, without fixing the bugs. And it is unbelievable, that they NEVER ADRESSED the bugs until now 2 freaking years later!. Instead they spitted a dozen new parts out.I cant support a company, that gives such a crap about their fans.But dont get me wrong here. The story and the new features are fun, still the most part of the game gets destroyed by the crappy programming! I am really angry about the fact, that they still didnt fixed the bugs.
