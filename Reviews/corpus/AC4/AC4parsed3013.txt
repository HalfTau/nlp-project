Well after 44 hours on this game and the main storyline finished i guess i do a review on it.This is to be honest the best game in the series since ac2. The story is good with a lot of charathers and fun but at times repetetive missions.The biggest and best part about this game is the open world, The world is HUGE and the sea is gorgeus.This game also looks SOO good if you only have a decent pc So my final verdict for ac4 black flag is8/10 D
