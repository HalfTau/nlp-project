I have beaten this game to a pulp, both on console and PC. I love it to death but there are some issues that some people may not be fond of.1. Performance Issues, hovers around 4560 on land 60 sailing.2. UplayGreat ship battles, music, and visuals. I wish the Assassins Creed studio made a standalone game about this genre and remove all the weird assassin bits. Honestly the assassin stuff holds this game back by throwing you back on land to follow soldiers and forces you to do a questline that is less than exciting. The ship customization makes you stronger and makes you feel like youre actually progressing instead of going off on wild tangents tackling massive ships to use for trading which is what youre actually doing, because youre a badpirate thats why.Highly recommended.
