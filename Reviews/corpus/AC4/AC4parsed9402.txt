A fantastic game with an immersive world, compelling story, and fluid gameplay.Ive been playing Assassins Creed since the beginning and this has certainly been my favorite iteration of the series. Sailing can become repetetive at times, but otherwise, the game is wellpaced with plenty of side activities to enjoy.
