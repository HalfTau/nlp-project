The best Assassins Creed game to date. The sccenery is gorgeous and fun to explore, and the boat combat is farily fun, even if it does get a little stale after a while. This time around we have a likeable protagonist, which is good after the moody trainwreck that was Connor Kenway. The multiplayer is extremely fun in my opinion, if a bit grindy.
