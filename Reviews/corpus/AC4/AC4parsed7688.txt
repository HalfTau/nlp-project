Black flag builds on the naval battles of AC3 superbly, being much more exploration orientated. That said, the main story can often feel almost entirely at odds with the rest of the game. While Kenways selfish ambition makes for an unusual and heart wrenching story, it makes it very difficult to empathize with your character or their choices.Still, this is all about piracy and ship based combat which the game utterly delivers on. A huge improvement over AC3 and a great introduction if youre new to the series.
