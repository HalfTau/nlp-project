Well, if youre readng this, youve probably played 13 Assassins Creed games already so you probably know what to expect. Probably the last Assassins Creed game that my computer will be able to run so i guess ill have to live it up. Anyways less about me. The game is nice, clearly Ubisoft has done something about some of the worst mechanisms of AC3, sailing is better and such, very similar to AC Rouge if youve played thatThe game will run at around 710 fps on the average computer so if you expect more, disable some of the useless features in the graphics settings, disable things like high quality water and improved shadow textures and the game will run smooth as hell
