AC4BFSP.exe has stopped working Thats all you will ever see with this game, I played it for 38.5 hours with no problems, then I redownload the game one day after it had been deleted due to boredom, and all I get is this damn Error message, with no fix, no one knows how to fix the damned problem and its been happening for 2 years now, plus to top it off, Ubisoft is aengine, that constantly deletes all your saves, and its clunky as all hell, and Ubisoft wont fix their I wish I could get a refund, but I have to many hours in the game, so there ya go, i spent 5 hours of my life looking for a fix, with no success, overall 0/10.
