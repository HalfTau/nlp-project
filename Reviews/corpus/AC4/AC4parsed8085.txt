Although I havent finish this game, I believe this is a great game. That is why Im recommending this game.But let me say that I gave up on playing it because it glitch a lot times. I had to restart a mission twice just because they dont want to progressthe target didnt showed up. Glitch like that is a game breaker for me. But that was months ago, so I really hope they patched the game. Im ready to jump into the game.But in all seriousness, eventhough Im recommending this, Im not saying that its ok for developers to give us games with glitches like this. They should stop giving out games that are not ready. I sure hope Watchdogs doesnt have glitch in it since they delayed that game long enough already.
