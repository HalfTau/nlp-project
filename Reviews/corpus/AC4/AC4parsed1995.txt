Assassins creed IV Black flagPro Great sailing, enjoyable ship combat.Satisfying to upgrade your ship, and mansion.Interesting setting and characters.Fun quests.A story that will have you smiling and crying, okay maybe not crying but it will hit you in the feels.Interesting collectibles.Con A few glitches.My main problem, its to easy the combat, stealth, sailing and the extra challenges within the missions.Copy and paste from AC3 just slightly imoroved.The game was to short 50 hours to 100 it.9/10I love the AC franchise and this game is one of my favorites, if you have played any previous ac then this will feel similar maybe to similar, so if you liked the previous games then you will like this one aswell, if you have not played any other AC then get this, if you want to you can play the others but it is not necessary.
