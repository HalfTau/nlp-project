I played Assassins Creed 2 and was unimpressed with it for the main reason that the title is misleading. There not really that much of a stealth aspect to it, or atleast not as much as I feel that it should. However, I like pirate games and tropical setting so I bought this game any way. I absolutely loved this game. Being able to command not only a ship, but an entire fleet, and the ability to obtain more territory is extremely fun. The story was interesting as well. Even after the story was over, there was still plenty to do. Overall 9/10
