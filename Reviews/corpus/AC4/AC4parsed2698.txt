Score 3/4A story of a pirateassassin. Beside of playing stealth and assasinate your targets, this game allows you to do a lot of stuffs such as hunting, taking naval forts and naval combat. The overall gameplay, esp the ground combat, is not challeging. Yet, I enjoy playing this game very much. Naval combat is the biggest hit here. yeah.
