Assassins Creed IV Black Flag focuses on less Assassin work and more pirate fun. I see this as a positve, and the world is fun to explore.For completionists, however, be prepared for a large task ahead of you. There are hundreds of random items and chests that do not do much, especially the uncharted ones in the open sea.Other than that, Black Flag is a very enjoyable game, and I recommend it to everyone interested.
