GREATEST AC OF ALL TIME, SANK THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE TO DAVY JONES LOCKER, I LITERALLY CAN PAY JACK SPARROWS DEBT, AND YOHOHO WITH A BOTTLE OF RUM, that being said, great gameplay and ship battles, another arcade land battle, but improvement nonetheless from AC III. Great side missions, nice story, start of Sage Story Arc, and DID I MENTION SEA BATTLES? ROAMING THROUGH STORM AND GALLEONS WITH BOOTY FULL OF SPAINS GOLD, CAPTURING FLEETS AND KILLING CAPTAINS SWINGING FROM YOUR MAST?TLDR  AC lover already got the game AND YO HO HO others could try and enjoy one of the better game in AC franchise
