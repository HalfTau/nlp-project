Hello,I like to say that this game grabbed me when i first played it. There is so much to do in there, from exploring to ship battling. I just love almost everything in it. The only boring thing is that its bothering me is that every mission is almost exactly the same go kill, destroy the target, eavsdrop the meeting, tailing.I think it should have been better if there was a chosing dialog and many different endings, altough im happy with the current game too.
