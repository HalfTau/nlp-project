TLDR  i wanted to play the SINGLEPLAYER but ubisoft punishes you for it if you dont play with friends or buy microtransactions...Okay so I went into Black Flag with it being the only assassins creed i have wanted to play recently so from my game time as you can see im 5 hours in Uplay stopped steam from counting an hour and so far it was pretty much another assassins creed go do this, climb to the top of that and kill this guy, only differance being the ships which is pretty cool and work well. ship gameplay is fun and good but probably only becasue we have no pirate games out besides this one. Anyway it gets to making a fleet and sending your fleet off for recourses and Ubisoft being the devs they are think its a good idea to make the player wait to begin with for the 2nd fleet mission 5 minutes OF REAL WORLD TIME and then comes up saying To complete these missons quicker play them with friends. Sorry Ubisoft I thought I was paying for a singleplayer game where story and missions are important to the experance not so you can add on some tacky multiplayer even though the entire franchise is based around the story. OR I COULD PAY FOR THE UPGRADES AND SKIP THE MISSIONS COMPLETELY!!Unacceptable Ubisoft bad business practice leave microtransactions to cosmetic items and not to game altering buyouts single player or not.
