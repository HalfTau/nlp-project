I highly recommend the game at any price. It is fantastic and the plot is beautiful, if a bit short. This easily falls in as one of the better games of the franchise.In terms of DLC, I really recommend just Freedom Cry. It stands as a powerful short game in itself. I wouldnt recommend any other DLC, but then again, I was never really into the multiplayer anyway.
