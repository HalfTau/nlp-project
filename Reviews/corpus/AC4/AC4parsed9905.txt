Im a huge Assassins Creed fan and from the gameplay Ive seen so far it looks like a really good game. But even after reformatting my computer and updating every possible driver in the world, the game still crashes after 3 seconds. The ubisoft support team couldnt help me either. I even heard of players who could get it to run, but have very bad framerates. This is very poor optimization for PC on Ubisofts part and unfortunately I cannot reccomend the game in its current state for the PC. If you have a console, dont get it for PC, it will save you a lot of headaches.Its sad to see such an amazing game being so poorly optimized for the PC.
