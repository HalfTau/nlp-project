I bought this game and installed it on a computer that had all of the recommended hardware and software.  First time installation went through all the normal stuff and then it crashed.  Repeated efforts to restart crashed every time.  Got fix recommendations from the website and all they managed to do is crash my whole computer.  Uninstalled and reinstalled on another even higher end computer.  Same result.  Monumental waste of time.  At least Steam let me give it back for a refund.
