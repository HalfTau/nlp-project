This is by far my favorite entry into the series. The pirate theme works, and works VERY well. Its the usual Assassins Creed entry minus the Desmod Story feeling like a screaming kid trying to get your attention during a movie youre trying to watch. The outer story is MUCH, much less intrusive.The game itself is standard Assassins Creed fare. You parkour around the carribean in the year 1710. You fight in largly the same way you did in every other Assassins Creed except of course its a little better and a bit more stream lined since the last one. However, I found myself really enjoying the protagonist this time. As I climbed the ranks of the pirate life I found myself eager to see where the next story mission or wonderfully done naval battles took me. Outfitting my ship with a sea shanty singing crew yes they sing when youre on the open water, I dare you not to sing along and other bits and pieces to make it faster, stronger and of course look like the Black Pearl as much as possible.All your fantasies of being a pirate are right here. Underneath it all is a solid Assassins Creed game that will bring you many hours of joy and discovery. I continue to have a blast with Black Flag.9/10
