For being called Assassins Creed, theres a serious lack of assassining, and a serious amount of boat ramming.Not to say that the boat ramming is bad, in fact, the boatering is probably the most fun you can have in the game. The gameplay is fun, interactive, and good lord is it pretty. You just have to have a 700 series, or whatever the equivelent for Ati would be filthy plebian, to really enjoy how good this game looks.Now, the actual assassin part of Assassins Creed... oh boy... not fun at all. Fighting has been dried up to hold 1 button to annihilate entire enemy forces. The sneaking missions are just plain stupid, its so easy to just mass murder EVERYTHING that sneaking seems pointless. Nothing like in AC2 or Brotherhood, where it would actually spawn a horde of super difficult enemies to make you ... dead. No, AC4 just makes you reset from the beginning of the sneak mission.And this really is what kills the AC series for me. Combat is mind numbingly simple, you are forced to follow a single strict tactic or be punished, and the story is about as understandable as monkeys ing a coconut.All in all, maybe a 6 or 7 out of ten, because its still a terrible lot of fun when you get to go on a murder spree, no matter on sea or land. And hell, at least it isnt AC3, amirite?
