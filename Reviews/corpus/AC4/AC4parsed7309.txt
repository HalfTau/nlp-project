Easily the best looking in the series runs great on a half descent PC AMD 1090t / 8GB Ram / SSD / 2x GTX580Its Assassins Creed and it just keeps getting better.Thou at some point they will finish the story.The 4 in the title is very missleading i belive this is the 7th game in the series.Yes you really should play the other games 1st it would help you to understand the massive story
