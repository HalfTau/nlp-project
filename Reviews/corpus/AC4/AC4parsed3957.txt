Assassins Creed IV is a beautiful games with flaws.ProsGraphic on High/ Ultra are stunning for an open world gameCombat is fun Espcially if you love the Arkham Franchise like myselfShip combat is easy to get a grip of yet hard to masterConsBuggy I have picture of my boat glitching under waterThey still have those AC missions that you wish you could skip like the tailing missionsThe characters are pretty dull apart from EdwardVerdit  7/10Want to see a WW2 AC, if not i personally think that i will just stick to the ones with Ezio in.
