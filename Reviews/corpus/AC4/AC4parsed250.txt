This game is really weird for me when it comes to looking at the series from this game to now.And for what i mean by that is really big details that been removed in future games ever since AC IV, like Unity and Syndicate.i didnt play these games in order,the first Assassins Creed game for me was Unity and looking back at it now, its a terrible game with questionable design choices.Some obvious stuff that i noticed in this labeled stealth game were that you could carry bodies and whistle,yes its my fault that i didnt play these games in order,but i honestly thought these mechanics were added in Syndicate and i was suprised and confused that they were in AC IV first,while in the other hand Unity didnt have the whistle and body carrying and it was the game after AC IV which had those mechanics.But in my opinion Syndicate did add a lot of new cool stuff that i personally enjoyed like the fight clubs and raids AND A CROUCH BUTTON IN A STEALTH GAME,but theres something that AC IV and Syndicate have in common is that they both have a way of mobility, AC IV has the boats which were really awesome instead of Syndicate which literally added carriages but they only added carriages to help the player get to point A to point B faster and not to do pointless parkour around the city,AC IV had really boring boat travels but for me the only thing that saved those pointless boat travels were the boat fights which were really fun,they are boat fights that can go to one on one boat action or just a entire fleet at you which on 1v1 boat action you could put them in a dying state that then allows you to raid the boat,when raiding the boat the objectives can sort from killing a certain amount of dudes,killing the captain,blowing up gun powder barrels and taking out the ships flag.AC IV was clearly a less stealth focused game than Unity or Syndicate for example because the combat is a lot better,but they screwed it up in Unity but then fixed it again in Syndicate.Gun play is a lot better than in Unity because not only you can wield up to four guns at once to shoot all of them in combat but in change for that the reload is almost impossible when youre inUnity can only wield one gun so its basically useless because you can kill one dude and thats it and should be pretty obvious that in stealth the guns are bad cuz noise,and like almost a running gag,Syndicate fixed by adding guns with magazines and you can actually reload them in combat.Most of these three games ive been talking about have actually good sandbox worlds,for each game having their world help the player by being a world that helps the main of form of mobilty of theAC IV for example has a massive ocean for the boat while having multiple towns around the world.Since Unity doesnt have any cars or boats it helps the climbing and chase sequences alot,for example having the player be able to walk inside houses.Syndicates has the carriages and the grappling hook so the world has really tall buildings and streets.In the end of the day AC IV had most of the gameplay mechanics right,the combat,travels,world,missions and even though you couldnt crouch in stealth it had good and easy to understand mechanics.Most of the things Unity and Syndicate were copied or straight up downgraded from AC IV which makes the pirate game the superior game of these three games.But its a Assassins Creed game so the winner has to be Stardew Valley for the Atari 6000
