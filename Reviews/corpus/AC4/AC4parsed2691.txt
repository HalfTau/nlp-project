This is by far the best Assassins Creed game. I used to play Sid Meiers Pirates! from 2004, Back then it was the best pirate game ever made. Black Flag is basicly the same game but with updated graphic and a new story. The best thing about this game is that most of the stories are based on true events that actually happened back then. This is like playing a history book I recommend this game to all pirate lovers who like hours and hours of fun 10/10 points
