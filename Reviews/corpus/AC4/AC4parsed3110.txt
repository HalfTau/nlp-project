I rate this game a 9/10. It is a almost perfect game. There are few flawsStory The storyline is fantastic. You are a pirate named Edward James Kenway. You and your crew are after an ancient place called The Observatory. There are problems within the time it takes to find out its location. These problems are important to the story so Im not going to spoil them.Graphics The graphics are actually pretty good. I usually hit around 3050 fps. In menus I hit 60fps. I think the developers took more time than they did in the other games.Combat I feel that the combat is smooth most of the time. Sometimes 3 enemies will try to hit you and obviously you cant counter attack them all so the developers could have done something about that. Everytime I try to attack an agile guard, right before I break their defenses a regular guard will always attack me so I have to counter them,kill them and then try to break the agile guards defense again which can be repetitve.Freerun The freerunning is often good but sometimes Kenway will for example, climb a tree instead of run and jump over a fence. This can obviously be very annoying at times because you sometimes have to get to the Jackdaws wheel in about like 30 seconds and Kenway climbs random things.Controls The controls are responsive and easy to remember.at least for me I personally think everything is easier on the PC so this may be biased.Overall This game was great on console and on pc. The story is great,graphics are fantastic,combat is mostly great, freerunning can sometimes be annoying, and the controls are good. I would recommend this to other people if you are looking for a pirate adventures in the WestIndies sea. I got this game for sale only for 7.49
