An Assassins Creed game with barely any references to the sempiternal Templars vs Assassins conflict, instead focusing on piracy and exploring the Caribbean.Pros Naval battles are quite fun and refreshing! Ubisoft is slowly learning how to polish the gameplay The theme of the story is surprisinglystrong and focused compared to the other games of the series, and thats not even including the meta commentary on the video game industryCons Too much reliance on old Assassins Creed staples like tailing missions and poorlyscripted stealth Very unoptimized PC portIts a bit annoying when you already know from older games how everything will eventually end for poor Edward, but in the meantime, what a cool protagonist to follow.
