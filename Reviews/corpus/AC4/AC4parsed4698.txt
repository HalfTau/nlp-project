Well, this was a very nice surprise from the people who buggered up WatchDogs. Assassins Creed IV  Black Flag can be seen as a new high point for the franchise and with the ability to traverse the world in a boat Wind Waker style, the hours of playtime dont take long to pile up.This time the setting is the 18th century and the player is in control of swarve pirate captain Edward Kenway the father of the very British Hatham Kenway and the grandfather of the very angry Conner Kenway. Throughout the game, Edward will sail the high seas in search of a great treasure and like him you will lose yourself in a lust for gold. Then youll remember that youre playing an Assassins Creed game and youll have to spend a decent amount of time tailing someone before you get to feel the sea breeze in your beard again. But fear not, your missions on land can lead to great rewards and eventually youll earn enough money to fully upgrade your ship, giving it enough firepower to blast the entire Caribbean to hell and back.Although this game does have a few issues, mainly the fact that its optimisation is all over the place a deal breaker for some of you out there, I can recommend this game simply based on the hours of fun that I got out of it. With a large map, thats mostly made of seawater, and the songs of sailors filling the air, youll have a decent amount of fun sailing your ship into the horizon.DRINK UP ME HEARTIES, YO HO!Update Ive found a fix for the FPS issues, theres a really good guide on the AC4 Steam community hub.
