WARNINGDont buy this game. Uplay essentially is playing a game of russian roulette with the barrel trained right at your save game. 7 hours? 24 hours? 100 hours? Uplay dosent give abecause one day youll press play and your ship, your crew, your treasurewill all be gone. So, way to go Ubisoft youre king of the pirates but all the rum in the world wont wash away the bad blood youve just established between most your fans.
