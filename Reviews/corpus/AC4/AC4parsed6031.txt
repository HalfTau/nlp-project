After Assassins Creed II, Black Flag in my opinion is the best Assassins Creed game I have had the pleasure to play. It is an excellent port of the Currentgen consoles XBone/PS4. There are some minor issues though, it is the constant framerate drops. I own a top of the line Lenovo gaming laptop w/ a gtx 860M and this game managed to dip in framerate. besides that I give Assassinss Creed Black Flag a 9.5/10 and I recomend it to all who have the system to run it
