Assassins Creed 4 may be the best game I have ever played.With only abugs, it has amazing graphics, outstanding gameplay, and a good storyline. With plenty of suprises, it is a game not to miss. I would recommend this game to anyone. The only downside is that you should probably expect frustration, because some missions are very hard, likeI enjoy the game a lot and whoever reads this I bet you will too.
