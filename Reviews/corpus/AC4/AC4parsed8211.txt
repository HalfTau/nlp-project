This is the best in the series since ACII. It takes what ACIII tried to achieve with naval combat and open areas such as forests and makes it better, the world feels alive and massive  the world is interesting and interactive, there are many things to do outside of the main storyline. It has a few optimisation issues for PC but if you can overlook those, the game itself is highly recommended. ACIII was a bit of a disappointment, but ACIV is a highlight of the series by far.
