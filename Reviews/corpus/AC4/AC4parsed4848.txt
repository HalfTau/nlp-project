Played AC1 years ago and just found it boring as hell. Picked up the rest of the series on a Steam sale a few days ago after reading somewhere that AC1 wasnt really representative of what the series had become. So... Tried AC2 a few days ago and couldnt even get through the mess of a tutorial before rage quitting and uninstalling after 30 minutes. I then played AC2 for a couple of hours before uninstalling out of sheer boredom. It was with low expectations then, that I installed AC4BF and gave it a shot.Eight hours in, to my great surprise I find myself a fan. The story is beginning to open up, the gameplay is varied and even the occasional glitch/bug or the stupid tail/eavesdrop/chase missions dont really bother me this time around because theres so much freedom to do all sorts of other stuff in between.Edit And then there was locate James Kidd. Google it. Dont say I didnt warn you. Still fun, just dont enter that disaster of a mission.
