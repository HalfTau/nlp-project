Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is one of the best AC games in the series in my opinion. The game sort of died when Desmond got killed in the finals of ACIII, but black flag really managed to revive the game. The game has tons of side quests, and it seems like they have taken the best elements from all the other games. I can only give my strongest recommendations on this game.
