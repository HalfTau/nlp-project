Before I bought the game, I saw those negative comments and I didnt understand why because this game is good.When I bought the game, I still didnt understand why those negative comments because this  game is great!After some days of playing the game I played only 57 hours well, I realized why.Im not going to talk about how much the game bad and he has bugs, no, the game is great and has no bugs.Im going to talk about Ubisoft.Ubisoft, The worst company I have ever seen. After  1 month I wanted to play this game, but when I connected to Ubisoft it showed me that I dont have this game. I tried to activate the key but it just said that I cant because this key already used. I used it thenI tried to contact Ubisoft many times, Their website, Facebook, and more, but as you can understand, they didnt even respond! I tried to contact steam with a very long message that tells everything that happened, but I dont think they even tried to read the message, they just sent me an email that says that I cant get a refund because I played the game more than 2 hours.Shame. The game is good. Ubisoft sucks.Thank you for reading this.
