Great graphic, beautiful landscape, good ship battle experience, unique gameplay with previous Assassins Creed game, glicthes happen sometime but not affect gameplay much, Uplay does not give trouble for me like other saying. Game runs fine 2540fps with medium video settings on my Acer Aspire V15 Nitro 2015.10/10 Very huge map with tons of collectibles and side missions enough to keep you busy until next summer sale.
