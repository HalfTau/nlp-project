Assassins Creed games have a reputation of being repetative and such. This game breaks away from that reputation taking all the good aspects of the original games along with it. This is a game where youll enjoy every task you do. There is the occasional track and follow but these too were fun and challenging to me. Ship play is amazing, combat is polished. If you are on the edge of buying this game I recomend you do. You wont regret it.
