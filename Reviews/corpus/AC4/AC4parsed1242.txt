I believe this Assassins creed game was on par with AC2, which could be considered as the best AC game in the AC series so far. I mean honestly, I have completed this game 100 on two different account I am talking about 2 of the 3 data you get when you start the game. Heres some pros and cons that I found throughout the gamePros Pirates Who doesnt like being a pirate and killing pirates while raiding pirates ship Fighting mechanism You get swords, guns, ofc assassin blades x2, swords with guns, raiding, etc. Voice acting The singing in the end makes even the toughest man cry. I cried for 3 days after hearing/seeing my former comrade SHANTIES I dont know how you spell it, but who gives a fck. You on a damn vast sea with your crew and singing even in the fcking storm. How awesome can it getConsAbsolutely fcking none.Conclusion Well done Ubisoft, I know there are several branches making AC series but youve done magnificent job. ACU and ACR was bad but nicely done on this one. I am looking forward for the ACO.
