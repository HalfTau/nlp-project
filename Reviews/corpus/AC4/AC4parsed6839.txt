This game for PC is broken. It is not worth your money. You will be gambling your money on a game that has a high chance of being unplayable for you.After installing and starting out in the game I was loving it. The graphics are gorgeous, and my complaints about the stealthlite mechanics of old Assassins Creed games are all silenced in a much more action driven game. The naval combat is a blast too. So much so that I played around six hours in one sitting.... And then when I came back my save was gone. I looked around for an answer and found this is a known bug that has been persisting for almost six months. I have tried every fix for it Turning off cloud saving, running the .exe as administrator. None of these work for me. Now after losing hours of gameplay for the third time, I am done with this game.Again, do not purchase this game. It has an absolutely critical bug that will ruin it completely for a high percentage of users and Ubisoft has done nothing to rectify it.
