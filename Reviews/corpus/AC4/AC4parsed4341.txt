Very good game, This is how a realy open world should be!This AC game is totaly different than the others but still you feel like you are playing a AC game on the good way!You can customize you ship totaly to your style and terrorise the sea. very nice system with building and upgrading your ship. The main story is fun but nothing realy special.8.5/10
