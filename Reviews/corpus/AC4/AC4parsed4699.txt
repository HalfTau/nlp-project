So far, I am infinately grateful for the fact that I bought the 30 version of this game for 10, because I cant play it. Every time I submit my activation key to uplay which I shouldnt have to do if Im playing through steam, I shouldnt have to go through two seperate game sites for one game in the first place, I get uplays general error message, and I have gotten for officially a whole month now. I didnt see any warnings or bad reveiws regarding this issue when I purchased this game, only when I later googled the problem, so I figured I risk the occasional save wipe. But this problem makes the game completely unplayable. It also semes completely random as to who has issues and who doesnt. I would have to say, I only reccomend buying this game if youre NOT buying the PC version, as my uncle has the playstation copy, and that plays wonderfully.In short, what I played on a different console was great, but DO NOT take the risk of buying this game for PC, you may waste your hard earned cash.
