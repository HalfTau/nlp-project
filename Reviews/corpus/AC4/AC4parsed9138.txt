Wow..What a game..I was always loyal to Assassins Creed Franchise, but after Revelations I never bothered for another title. Even though I own AC III I never wanted to play it. But then I saw some game play videos of the Black Flag, and thought of giving it a try, and wow. I was amazed what this delivers. Graphics, the game play, everything has been improved to a new level. The only con I see on this game is that it also requires uplay as every other ubi game which now we are kinda got over.So its worth every penny a spended on.
