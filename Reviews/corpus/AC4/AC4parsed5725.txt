The second best Assassins Creed next to two. This one by far has the best gameplay, setting and theme around it, however it does not dethrone 2 because 2 had a really REALLY enjoyable story and also was more about actual Assassins whereas this one is more of a wacky pirate adventure.The game is long and really fun and also is one of the more challenging games of the series. The PC port isnt perfect but this game is really fun and stable. There is something I really enjoy about sailing around the Carribean while listening to sea shanties and then going to islands to collect maps and dig out treasure. It is all so entertaining and I love it. Buy this game!! !
