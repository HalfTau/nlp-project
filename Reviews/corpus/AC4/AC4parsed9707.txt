Its good to have yet another likeable character in the series, even giving Ezio a run for his money. Even more, pirates! The Abstergo scenes are blander than a salt cracker without the salt, and of course that part of the story is cut short, but thats nothing new to this series. Another new feature is taking control of a fleet and having them run errands, which I found much more interesting than the previous games of sending out assassins to compolete missions instead. The upgrading system for the Jackdaw is also very fair, and the battles are also plenty more varied than the last game. There are also a bunch of different ways to find materials to purchase the upgrades, and a new tool that in my opinion is incredibly overpowered for this game, so there should be no chance of getting stuck in any of the on foot parts of the game. All in all, best game of the series, and I am absolutely looking forward to Pirate Simulator 2014!
