I enjoy this game pretty thoroughly. Ive played through it nearly 100 on one save file, and decided to start a new one.I do have one major complaint the optimization is rubbish. I have a powerful computer i74790k, GTX980, liquid cooled, etc, and I struggle with framerates in some places. Otherwise, its a well done game.
