Good  If you like open world games this game is for you. The storyline is tight enough you can follow it but loose enough to do whatever you damn well want. Amazing graphics, good storyline, plenty of open sea adventure, ships are easy to manage and navigate. Be it as simple as hunting game or as wild as taking over a heavily armed naval base, its a lot of fun even thru its repetitious quests. You can sit down with this game and play 24 hours or play 15 minutes at a time and still enjoy it.If you had a childhood anything like mine you owned or rented the Disney movie Shipwrecked Haakon Haakonsen This game makes you feel a little nostalgic and want to watch that movie again.Bad  My biggest gripe with these games will always be coming out of the animus to real life and having to do a quest here or there. I felt the storyline here was weak, 1/3 the way thru the game I could predict the goings on. The cut scenes... there are many. Objectives arent 100 in the begining area note you HAVE to find 100 of the items to be able to leave that island.Ugly  Uplay... HAS TO BE OPEN as well as Steam add all your activation codes to Uplay before you start the game. If Uplay is online you will have one set of saves, if Uplay is offline you will have saves on your hard drives. Pick online or off and stick with it. Still some glitches in game play with climbing, a rock 1 foot tall you run off it like a wall 20 feet tall. Free running is still faulty from time to time. Having to be directly in front of something and x feet away to be able to interact with it gets silly esp after the 100th chest/cargo/dead body.
