So when Assassins creed first came out I instantly had to get it along with the xbox360 and just kept buying every single one that came out, but never have I had one of them have such a badstory line as this one. Maybe its just because I personally love the time era aswell as the whole pirate theme. But the ending is seriously touching. Its as if you are reading books when playing these games and this one is that one book that hits you hard. It is well worth the buy, despite what people may say. The graphics are amazing and the game play is just unbelievably fun.
