This is an extremely pretty pirate simulator with a coating of Assasains Creed thrown on top of it. The naval combat, the sea chanties, and some of the other various piratey side activites more then make up for the bugs, certain annoying storyline missions, and a few of the less then fun side activiites.I really wish they had built up more piratey things to do from town to town, like buy and sell goods with different prices at each port, more drinking and debauchery, or the ability to actually sail a fleet of pirates and take over full sized towns. The fact that I wish for there to be more and more things to do is a sign that the core game is quite good.The main missions help guide you through playing the game but dont actually take much time if you concentrate on them. I suggest doing many if not all of the side activities to help prolong the game, otherwise you will be done in about 20 hours.The game is quite fun, especially things relating to pirates. If you are a diehard AC fan, you might find this title a bit lacking in how little the main character has anything to do with assasins but it plays like an AC title and is quite amazing, especially if you love pirates as I do.If you love pirates then you have to ge this game, simple as that.
