After that nasty Connor fiasco... Ubisoft has redeemed themselves a bit with this one. Kenway is almost as cool as Ezio. The gameplay is exceptional. The story continues to have many holes. The battles on and off shore are very violent and gratifying. Ive seen better puzzles in games from Ubisoft but these ones still get the job done. The ending was very brief and completely unsatistying. Over all Id say Ubisoft lost its way with the mystery and intrigue of the story that was present in the game right up til then end of Ezios saga. But this game is still entertaining and fun in spite of these ball droppings.
