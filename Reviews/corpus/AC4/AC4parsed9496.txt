Easily the best Assassins Creed yet. The dull modernday storyline has really been cut down, whilst the things that made the previous games fun have been maximised. Best of all, pretty much the only memorable part of AC3 i.e. the surprisingly good shipbased gameplay is now the main focus of the game.
