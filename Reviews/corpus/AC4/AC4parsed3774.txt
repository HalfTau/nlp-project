Im only making this negative review because Im sick and tired of companies like Ubisoft that force you to create one of their bs accounts in order to play the game. I just want to play the game I paid for without the extra hassles of their DRM and social crap. To top it off, I cant even make an account it simply says account creation unavailable, please try again later.
