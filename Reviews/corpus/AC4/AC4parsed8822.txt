Was a huge pain to get running. But had a ton of fun once I got it working.On the down side got about 50 through the game and ran into a series of follow missions that are boring the hell out of me and now I just dont have the urge to pick it back up. Missions are just puzzles of looking for the exact right path to follow. YawnNot worth the full price 60 but if it goes on sale for 30 I would say pick it up.
