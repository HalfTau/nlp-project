I love Asssassins Creed games and this is probably the best.The best Pirate siimulator to date with an amazing open world to explore and plunder.I am usually obsessed with needing character customisation in games,but in this case i really couldnt have done better myself. Edward is a Legend and makes Jack Sparrow seem boring Pnot to mention all the characters you meet on your travels. the story and characters are amazing and the game is worth getting for those reasons alone. then there is the sailing... omg HOW AWESOME! you feel so immersed in the sailing and shanties that you forget what you were doing and just go exploring. Crafting is fun and you feel like a boss the more you play very satisfying.The segments when you leave the animus are stupid but other than that its a pretty flawless Creed game and a must buy D
