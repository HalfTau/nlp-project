Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is a great game and really shows how far the franchise has come since the first Assassins Creed game came outI remember playing the first few hours and saying man this game was awesome and then after that I was like ok do the exact same thing the same way Assassins Creed 4 has so much more to do than previous installments I sunk in over 60 hours into the game by the time I beat itbut I will admit I did not do everything  but really the only thing you need to know to make you want to play this game can be rolled into one word PIRATES!
