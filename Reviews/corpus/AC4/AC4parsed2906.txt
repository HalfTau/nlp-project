Great game! With a little outside of the story questing and pirating you could make this game last 100 hours easily. This is honestly the best game I have ever played, the story line is gripping, the characters full of character, and the voice acting is awesome. As for graphics, theyre top notch.I completely suggest this game over any other in its franchise.
