I cant get my saved files. This game is good, but it honestly sucks when you cant play from where you left off. Even when I checked CProgram Files x86UbisoftUbisoft Game LauncherSavegames.  I dont know what happened but I reinstalled this game twice and still dont have the savegames folder that I just mentioned. Uplay is terrible.
