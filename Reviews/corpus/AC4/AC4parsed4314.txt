Oh where to begin.. also spoilers maybe.So in summary.. This game is a good Pirate game, but its a bad Assassins creed game, and heres why.So as many of you know..Desmond is dead, which I thought was a terrible shame to begin with, but this game only confirms my suspicions.Story wise in terms of Assassins creed its total 13ullchit, as a pirate game though its decent enough. You spend the game playing as one Edward Kenway, on his way though pirating the seas and stuff, killing people to get treasure. and some of them happen to be templars... sometimes. And thats the problem I have with this game, you arent an Assassin, for a good 75 of the story you arent an assassin in an assassins creed game which is rather silly, you fart around on the seas doing pirate things and stealing from people to make you and your friends richer, which is why I said this game is more of a pirate game than an assassins creed one.As for the other part of the story in the real world you play as..absergo employee number who gives a crap, thats right, youre a nobody, for one of the most important parts of the game, the whole reason you go back to the past in the first place, youre no longer a important character to the story who develops over time, grows over time, youre a random silent nobody absergo employee who just happens to be going through desmonds memory with no significant impact to the story whatsoever. there barely even is a story, it pales in comparison to previous installments story wise.So in conclusion..bad AC game, Good pirate game.
