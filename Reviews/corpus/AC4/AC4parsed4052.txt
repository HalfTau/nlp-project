Fantastic addition to the AC series, the setting was great and the game runs smoothly with no fps drops. The naval combat was enjoyable and at some points had me feeling like a real pirate However it felt a little too forced, but then again youre playing as a pirate. Black Flag is definitley in my top five! Overall, its pretty much what you would expect from an AC game but felt more enjoyable than some previous titles 3.
