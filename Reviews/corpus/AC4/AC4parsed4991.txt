By far the best Assassins Creed I have played since AC1, the main character is boring, the plot is boring, the naval combat which the game was entirely made for is a shining gem but could have used more meat. Considering that you will be spending a majority of your time in the ocean on your ship I think they should have focused more on the naval aspects of the game and less on the typical intown crap. Maybe allowing the players to trade their ships out for others they come across, along with a more intense way of scaling up their ships and aquiring new gear, giving a different play style and more playability. Overall the game is still great, but I think their focus was more on milking the consumer demand than building something absolutely stunning.
