Cant review this game as I cant play it. It starts up okay, asks me to press any button to continue but as soon as I do this it crashes when it tries to reach the Ubisoft servers. This seems to be a common issue. So, what now Ubisoft?Okay, finally got this game to work. I tried running in admin mode, deleting saved games, verifying install, setting resolution, etc. The only thing that eventually worked for me was the followingSimply, go to game directory Steam/steamapps/common/Assassins Creed IV Black Flag and remove all these folders dlc1,dlc2,dlc3,dlc4,dlc5,dlc6,dlc7,dlc8,dl c9,dlc10 Just, remove all these dlcX number folders.
