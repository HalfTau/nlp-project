this was the first AC game i bough on PC and it was fun but oh my freaking god that uplay think i had to do before playing it was bull that was just a bug waist of time its a fun game but that uplay just ed it up by doing that luckly you only have to do it once and play the game when ever you know unless the damn server is down and that bugs me too why the  do you have to connect to a server to play a game offline that is conpleat t.either way the game its self is really fun and worth the money.
