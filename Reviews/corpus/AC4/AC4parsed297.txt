The best Assassins Creed, period.I dont even know if I should call it Assassins creed, honestly. This game does so many things right. It basically grabbed one of the only good parts of Assassins creed 3 and made it into a full game. You actually feel for the characters in the story and whats happening. Its genuinely intriguing and leaves you guessing as to what happens next.The gameplay is spectacular, it nails the classic AC formula, but also adds the incredible sailing to have you feel like a true pirate, and it  works beautifully. I guarantee more than half of the game you will be on your boat, pillaging and destroying ships and fortresses.Absolute mustbuy, even at full price.
