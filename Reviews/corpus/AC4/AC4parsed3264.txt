EVGA GTX 780 Ti SCi74820K16GB RAMW7 Ult 64bit1TB SSDRuns at like 20 to 30 fps.  1366x768  and can dip to 10 or less frames. And not using more than 50 of GPU and about 55 CPU. Unplayable, I refunded it after 26 minutes of play.Its been out since 2013, and no patch to make run well on a PC. I am so tired of consoles dictating the quality of PC games. Especially when its poorly ported.Googling the issue after I descovered it from purchasing and attempting to play, reveiled many, many others with all types of hardware configurations having the same issues. Please be aware before purchasing, there are those who are having 20 fps even with GTX 1080...
