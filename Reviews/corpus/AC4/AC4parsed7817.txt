The most open, and most funloving AC yet. Theres definitely still a storyline, but for most of the game you just have a big map where you can do whatever you want, and thats brilliant! I had lots of fun just sailing around, fighting and capturing ships, destroying forts, hunting whales, etc.Naval combat is even more fun than in AC3, the protagonist is likeable, the NPCs are very well done, melee combat is still very satisfying, and the environments look great.The only real minuses are that the game doesnt have anything comparable to the wonderful homestead missions of AC3, boarding ships does get repetitive after a while, and the present day parts of the game are still a bit superfluous.Overall, I really like this AC, and I hope the next one will have a similar do whatever you want philosophy.
