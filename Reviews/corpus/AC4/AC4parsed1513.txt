Over all not much has changed in the copy paste world of assassins creed.They still think copy pasting same activities over and over and making a stupid and pointless amount of side activities that bring nothing due to broken game economy and ecosystem.Handling your ship, fighting etc. is the only redeeming quality though it has its missteps.Combat, weapons, character controls and stealth  all low quality, feels like paper toy. Oh and you have to log to ubicrap to play steam game...
