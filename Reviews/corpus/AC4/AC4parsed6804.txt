Just check the PC requirements and then enjoy it! I have to say the game its quite high resource demanding currently playing with 16 GB Ram and 8 cores 2.4 GHz cpu and have some glitches but its definitely wonderful! The subject is great, as all the other AC, the gameplay amazing.. Found it with 33 discount and made a deal! Just pay attentions for a few bug well documented over the web that for some reason Ubisoft didnt find worthy to correct..
