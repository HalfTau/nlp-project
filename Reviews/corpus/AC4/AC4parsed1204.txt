A really good entry in the series and considered by many the best in the series, Assassins Creed 4 is a really good game. Beautiful cities and locations, massive open world to explore, the ship combat, boarding other ships, hunting, sailing, ship to ship battles provides for hours of entertainment. You can also capture ships and send them to and manage your fleet. There are also sea shanties you can find which your crew will sing as you sail the seas adding even more immersivness to the game. But, as an Assassins Creed game it falls a bit short. Some of the missions are way too easy, also TOO MANY TAILING AND EAVESDROP MISSIONS. Lazy way of explaining how Edward is a Master Assassins with no training what so ever. Also the game ending was way to quick. The real world part of the game was also fun and hacking other Animus devices and computers gives extra information about past games and other events that take place or have taken place withing the game world. Overall a great game that many will like for the pirate stuff, ships, shanties. Long time AC fans might be dissapointed with the story, but all the other stuff will help you forget the boring story and just go out there and board some ships and find some treasure. 8.5/10
