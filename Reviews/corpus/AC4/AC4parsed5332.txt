An amazing game which blows all the crap predecessors out of the water Brotherhood, Revelations, 3and brings AC back into a state of glory like the first 2. BEing a pirate is amazing, and collectables are worth getting this time unlocking new shanties and ship upgrades rather than just being terrible feathers or flags. The adaptations of real people are awesome as well, with nefarious pirates such as Stede Bonnet and Blackbeard making appearances, pirate fans are well satisfied. Honestly the only downside I found for this game, is that the money isnt referred to as Doubloons, but thats just the booty Ive always fantasised about plundering.... 10/10 would pirate again
