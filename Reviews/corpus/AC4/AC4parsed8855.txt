The games singleplayer is beyond amazing. Wonderful graphics, great enviroment, immersive music, the dialogues are welldone, easytolearn and good controls and fairly good AI. The story was really thrilling and long, eventhough there were a few major gaming cliches and 1 or 2 bugs.Sadly enough, the multiplayer is far from good in comparison to the singleplayer  not worth playing.I would give it a 9.75/10, not considering the multiplayer.
