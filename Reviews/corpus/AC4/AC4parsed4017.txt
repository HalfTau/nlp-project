You will hate your life so badly while trying to get this game to launch. It took me 5 hours to figure it out which is just so much of an unnecessary headache when you expect your game to start as soon as you double click to play. The most important thing to know of the version of uplay that steam automatically downloads is worth so uninstall that program right away and go to the actual UPLAY website and download the uplay for PC computer as that is the most up to date version. If you dont do this, youll be met with a repeated message of there is a problem connecting to the uplay service and well restore the connection as soon as we can which nothing ever happens so dont hold your breath waiting like I did.once thats all sorted, restart your computer and launch the uplay game site and go to my games and activate code which steam gives you the code for the game you purchased. Enter that into the prompt and you can FINALLY enjoy gameplay. It shouldnt be so hard to launch a game though and there needs to be someway to fix this for other users in the future. What a giant headache.apart from that, I do love this game and highly recommend it more so for the XBOX version as thats the easiest way to play. You put your disc in and can enjoy right away. Once you bypass all this steam and uplay t, its a highly enjoyable game to play but it doesnt have the same achievements for steam that are there for XBOX. So I give this computer PC version just a 50 rating. Id say yes and no at the same time but for purpose sake, I clicked no
