by far one of the funnest games ive played in a long time! plus i love pirate games and this is the best ive played since Sids Pirates. i do wish the world was bigger like in the old mmorpg pirates of the burning sea. and it would be fun for once if they brought in myths and legends into a game like this,as in a sea serphant or ghost / skeleton pirates. im petty and want more! regardless,a must buy and the best looking ocean ive seen in a game.
