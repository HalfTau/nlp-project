Let me start by saying that i have owned this game for a while now but just today sat down and really played it.Pros Incredible Graphics if set correctlyHugely expansive and explorable mapimmersive gameplay with new elements and more focus on the seaside aspectPirates!!!Cons FPS is pretty rough as well as set to 30 or 60 with Vsynceasy to turn offsome very small bugsOverall this game is fantastic, i just played for so much longer than i expected i had to write a review.
