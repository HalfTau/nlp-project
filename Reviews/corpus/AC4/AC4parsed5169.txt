The naval combat in this game is one of the best recently new game mecahnics Ive played in a long time.  It makes this game endlessly enjoyable.  55 hours into it and im only 30 through the storyline.  I freaking love the fighting on the open sea!97 hours and Ive beat the single player campaign while having completed most of the solo side quests.  Im at 85 complete and will definitely still hop in to do some naval combat.  I love this game.
