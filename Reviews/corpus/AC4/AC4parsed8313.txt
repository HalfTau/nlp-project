Avast Landlubbers, Pirates Creed 4 is without doubt the most fun creed game so far. its just a shame that about 7 games in and they still cant get the freerunning to be smooth. Doesnt matter though, since you basically just spend your time sailing aboot terrorising the West Indies. Its sort of like Sid Mieirs Pirates, but instead of a dancing minigame, theres an assassins creed minigame that you occasionally have to do.
