I highly recommend this game to new and returning players to the AC franchise. The naval free roam feature of this game makes the world feels so alive. You can lose hours just sailing around the open seas listening to the excellent sea shanties. The stealth mechanics are improved but still mediocre. Combat is the same and is still heavily centered on counters. There are actually LESS weapon choices in Black Flag! What happened to all the daggers and other small onehanded weapons! I have been a huge AC fan since the original and this is by far my favourite of the series.
