If you liked commanding a ship in ACIII, then youll love being a pirate in ACIV. This game takes the beloved ship portions of Assassins Creed III and blows it up into a fullfledged pirate game. This is one of the least assassiny games thus far, mostly because your main character doesnt actually spend most of the game as an Assassin. What could I possibly mean? Well Ill leave that for you to find out.The TemplarAssassin modern day conflict has been set in a point in the series where newcomers to the Creed can enjoy it while the story is much better for those who know what theyre reading about.Fantastic amount of content in this game. Even when youre done, theres still a ton to do and unlike the one man killing machine you certainly are, your ship will NEED upgrades and the fact you arent invicible also makes this a great game.
