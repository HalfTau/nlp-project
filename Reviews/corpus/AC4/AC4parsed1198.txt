A really fun game. Who doesnt love to sail into the ocean while hearing your crew singing pirates song? Well,the only problem for me is the storyline because its too short,45 hours and already finished it.  After the ending there are lots of things to do,but i only interested to do all of that when there is more story that i didnt see. Glad i bought this game on the half price and if i bought it at full price,theres a good chance i might be disappointed.
