After 100 hours on this game...I decided to give a review!You can do so much besides the missions! You can explore,hunt,loot,destroy ships and more...Upgrading my ship was fun and awesome and it did not even get bored to upgrade my ship to prepare for whats next!However, this game is a new start and KINDA different from others Assassins Creed game. But the game is awesome and there some glitches that DOES NOT RUIN the game. The glitches make this game funny but it does not ruin the game for you.There is 2 outfits in the game where you could unlock! You dont even have to buy a DLC or anything that has to do with buying in order to open it.There is a Templar OutfitYou have to collect ALL Templar keys to open the OutfitandThere is a Mayan OutfitCollect ALL the Mayan stones to unlock it...its worth it and if you get shot there will be no health taken away from you! Its damn sure recommend if you hate to use the human shield or getting shot every single time.There is new items that is soooooooooooo useful in this game to help you out threw the gameplay!Assassins Creed IV Black Flag Freedom Cry DLCThe DLC is really short and you can beat it like in couple hours. Depends on how you play but when the DLC goes on sale...its worth for like 5.00 to spend couple hours and try beating the DLC!I am getting ready for Assassins Creed Unity!Are you ready for Unity?
