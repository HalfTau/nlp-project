HAve you ever wanted to play asn AC game that provided somehat of a challenge. Well, yourre in luck, this game actually has some ing challenge to it. I mean, it is ioptimized like I can imagine those ing French Canadianat Ubisoft Montral going, quotces sales amricains et leurs ordinateurs, le faire tourner  30fps sauf si vous voulez quil ressemble  AC 1 sur Xbox 360. All French Canadian and anyhow, it is pretty fun, taking all the fun parts of AC 3, all four things, and taking out all the all 27 individual . So yeah, being a pirate is fun.
