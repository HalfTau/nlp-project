I bought this game, and I couldnt even load it. It went to black screen. I alt/tabbed out, and because uplay was running, I went to bed and it ran all night. I requested a refund the next day from Steam, and they had tallied that I had played it for 26 hours! I couldnt even load it once. Refund denied, but if they had cared to look, I was being honest, and they would have seen that I had not unlocked a single achievment, had never created a single character, and had never logged onto their servers. They can see that! But they wouldnt give me my money back, because as uplay was running without me realizing it, that tallied up the hours as gameplay. UNFAIR!!
