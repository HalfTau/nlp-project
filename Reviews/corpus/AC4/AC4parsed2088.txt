After playing Assasins Creed 3 on Uplay and being bored to death by its endless Go here  go there quests i decided to try Black Flag. After all the frustration i experienced in IIIs repetitive nature, i still enjoyed the story it told of revenge and revolution. It was one of the strongest parts of that game and strong enough to entice me to move forward with the numbered series.So How does BF Compare?For starters, the game is horribly horribly horribly optimized. Im on a GTX 980 4GB  12 GB Ram  I7 4770 3.9  and while it can run everything at very high settings and maintain a solid 60 fps, any AA above Msaa x2 and there are massive fps drops, not to mention using Physx at all considerably lowers the frames you get. The in game vysnc seems to be broken as well, double buffering rather than triple. To fix this you have to use a third party program to force triple buffering. After you get all the technical issues under wraps,however, you get one hell of a game.The story thus far has been engaging and has a certain charm. Maybe its the pirate theme. The missions have also been a better experience this time around, giving you multiple sidequests to pursue in the open world from the start.  I havent felt this engaged in an AC game since the release of the original on the Xbox 360.Totally buy it if you think you can run it.
