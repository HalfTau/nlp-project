If you enjoy pirate adventures, this game is not to be missed. The incredible detail of the period and place brings the West Indies alive. Deep yet accessible action gameplay with multiple layers of wellcrafted story, as video games go. Just about everything you could hope for in an open sea exploration game from ship battles and boarding, weathering wild storms, to conquering massive sea fortresses and ghost ships, on top of the established Assassins Creed style 3rdperson freerunning action. Absolutely one of the best AAA games Ive played, and it is packed with content.Just on a technical note, I dont think a more realistic ocean shader/fluid simulation has ever been achieved in a game. Both your ship and the ocean itself are the real stars of AC Black Flag.I will say the game is not without its flaws and glitches, nothing really ruinous but sometimes the parkour is fidgety and you will guaranteed have moments of yelling WTF are you DOING? at your character as he runs up the exact wrong part of the wall and gets stuck there with nowhere to climb to, in the middle of a pursuit. That kinda stuff. Also the unlock/upgrade system is a bit shallow. And a lot of the open world adventure is just cleaning up a bunch of icons off your map with very little effort. But these issues honestly should not deter you from enjoying the richness of the experience offered by this game, as long as the subject matter appeals to you.You may find some things to gripe about here and there but overall I felt the game was fun, gorgeous, and solidly worth my time.
