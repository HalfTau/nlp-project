This game is definitely worth the money, especially if you love pirates which I do! The campaign is very cool with loads of awesome missions as well other tasks, taking down the Legendary ships pain in the D upgrading your ship, looting other ships, just so damn awesome, loved every bit of and would recommend for everyone to try this game even if you dont like the other ACs!
