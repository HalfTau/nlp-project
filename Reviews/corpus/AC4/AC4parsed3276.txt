To give you a rough idea of how much I enjoyed this game 63 hours in, I lost my save to Uplay sync issues forgot to disable cloud sync after reinstalling Uplay, and didnt actually mind having to start over from scratch. I can safely say that this game has singlehandedly restored my faith in the AC series. It really taps into your inner adventurer and every new element seems cleverly designed to make you want to keep going, craving for more.
