Many people give the game a negative review because they lost their savegame. Well, same happened to me. Storyline finished, only some stuff to collect left in Singleplayer, Multiplayerlevel quite progressed. One day starting the game, finding no savegame... googling what could have happened   Uplay happened!Looks like when there is any problem while the game is syncing or loading the savefile via Uplay, its gone.After weeks of beeing justoff at Ubisoft, I gave it one more try and made it a 100 Like I did with all other AC titles.It is a great game worth the money. Story Graphics Action many additional places to go besides the main story UplayIt is an unnecessary piece of software, Noones likes it, noone needs it.
