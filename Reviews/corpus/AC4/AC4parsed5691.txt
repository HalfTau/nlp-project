A fantastic game which has been ruined by DRM.First off let me just say that Ive nothing but praise for ACIV itself. I love the combat, the setting, the characters and the first time I got to pilot my own brig over stormy seas with canons blazing, well I cant remember the last time a game had brought me such a sense of joy. I was really getting into the story as well.Which is why its so frustrating that in order to play Black Flag you are lumbered with Ubisofts DRM Uplay. I wouldnt mind so long as it actually worked, but it doesnt. In fact it makes the game damn near unplayable at times. At one point due to the repeated freezes and crashes I was faced with due to Uplay I attempted to reinstall it. However, upon uninstalling it despite being asked whether I would like to retain my save game files, I found that all my progress had been erased and not just for Black Flag but for all Ubisoft games, regardless.I dont mind DRM in principal, Valve obviously have a very good system in place, but I do object to buying games and not being able to enjoy them because of lousy, unnecessary software that goes unfixed.
