its awfully hard for a game to describe a person from a multifaced level, Edward is greedy, relentless  and sometimes arrogant , but hes  also lovely and innocent somehow. Thats the very way to depict a pirvate or assassin possessing such complicated characters. Anyway, its  uncommonly amazing for me.
