There are a few barriers preventing me from playing the game.1 Creating a UPlay account. Servers were down for a few days and I was not able to make an account.2 Once my account was FINALLY created, UPlay servers were down so I still cannot play the game.3 No proper support to this day to address the issue.Ubisoft just wanted to make a quick buck and they did so effectively. For all those who managed to pass this and also did not have their saves fail, I congratulate you. Please stop at your local gas station and purchase a lottery ticket.
