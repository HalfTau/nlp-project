So far this game is amazingly good! I only played AC1  AC2 and what i disliked about those was that other than doing the main questline it was very repetitive but this one offer a lot more variation to it since you can sail your own  ship and upgrade it. I thought at first that the sailing part would be very boring, well i was well surprised to see how joyful it is.I would definitly recommend this game to anyone. If you have never played any AC games before you dont need to follow the order, just go on and enjoy this game!
