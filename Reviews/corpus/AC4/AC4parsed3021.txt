Pretty ok I guess. Tutorial comes after the first mission. Pretty bad keyboard controls. Sadly, no Steam controller mapping / onthefly swapping between keyboard and Steam controller, like other games do. Unfitting and inconsistent cutscenes/removal of control Freerun not really working as flawless as I had hoped occasional blocks, unwanted jumps Seems to use mouse smoothing with no turning off Very basic/generic fighting system Item shoppingI was looking forward to an action game with ships. But thats not really what I got.
