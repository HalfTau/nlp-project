This is the one game that really hit me emotionally. The story line was outstanding, you could just feel the pain when a friend died and you could not do anything about it. This was a well made game and I hated when it ended. I would defenetlly recommend it to my friends but tell them not to get to caught up with the carectors. because it can hit your heart.
