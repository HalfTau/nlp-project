Great game concept but it gets old! I dont know how but it does. I think it has more to do with the story outside the Animus not being substantial enough like going from Desmond to this is kinda a let down. The game is awesome though! Some say they need to expand on the gameplay thats true but I beg to say this is the pinnacle of what the orignal AC game was trying to achieve, as far as combat and open world go but, people are right it has gotten old and it is time for them to up their gameplay steath/assination style and mechanics a bit. You gotta play it though! also as a  true gamer I must say DOWN WITH UPLAY! !
