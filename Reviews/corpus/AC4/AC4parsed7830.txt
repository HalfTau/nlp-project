This game is great fun.  Theres plenty to do before repetition begins to sink in and dull it somewhat.  The best thing is the sea fairing and sea battles, taking on a highlevel Man of War is pretty gripping stuff.On the assassin side, its the usual assassin faire so if youve enjoyed previous assassin games, youll likely enjoy this.  However, to its a pure assassin game is stretching it a lot.  This is more like a story of a pirate who happened to become embroiled in someone elses fight.  Edward Kenway makes a great antihero not always to be sympathised with.  This is very much a game of pirates with an assassin mission bolted on.For those who have played ACIII and wondering about this game, ACIV is much much better and virtually glitch free.
