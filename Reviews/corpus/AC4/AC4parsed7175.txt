Will never buy an Assasins Creed game again. Terrible optimization for PC. I wont buy on console either just out of spite. On an i5 3570k  4.2GHZ, and a gtx780ti SC ACX, with a gtx660ti dedicated physx card, I still cant get a decent consistant and playable frame rate, and no matter settings I choose it seems.
