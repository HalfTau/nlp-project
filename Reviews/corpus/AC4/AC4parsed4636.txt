I dont know why people say this is the best Assassins Creed since 2 and Brotherhood. 90 of the game is tailing missions, there is too much sailing with slow and clunky controls, youre forced to farm a lot to upgrade your ship, the huge sea makes exploring even more tedious when youre forced to get off your ship to swim to an island to get a chest or fragment just to have to swim back to your ship and repeat for every single island and the story is easily the worst in the series.
