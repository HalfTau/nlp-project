Creed Blackis easily a game that has acheived G.O.A.T. status. Its stunning grapix, mediocre fr33run1ng mechanics, lack of h0es to get greasy wit, and ludicrous prices to make my ship Michael Jordan status. I easily give this game 9.5/10 mainly because there arent any h0es to get greasy wit. AGAIN I just want to reiterate that Assassins Creed Black Flag is G.O.T.C. Game Of The Century, G.O.A.T. Greatest Of All Time  easily worth the standard AAA price of 59.99.IGNPS We were not paid to write this review  3
