Unlike any Assassins Creed you have ever played. This assassins creed goes out of the normal revalutionary war assassins creed that most fans are use too. If you have been playing assassins creed since first released than you know what im talking about, if not, than your probably the douchbag that gave this game a bad review. Yeah, you cant run This game with Anti ailising on because it will crash but, that is the only flaw to this game. It is unlike any assassins creed ever. If you have played the series in order. You never know what to expect when it comes to assassins creed. sometimes it takes you to 1665 whit pirates and sometimes it takes you to 1865 in the wild west. If you did give this game a bad review than you must be mentally handicapped or just stupid, So please, KILL YOURSELF.
