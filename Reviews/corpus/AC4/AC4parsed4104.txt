This is the first Assassins Creed game ive played and what an awesome experience, its been a long time since ive felt so immersed in a game.Theres so much to do and see, you take the game at your own pace, even sing a few sea shanties I feel like a big kid now some would say Ive always been one, although who could honestly say they wouldnt enjoy being a Pirate.My only criticism would be...wheres my parrot? lol.
