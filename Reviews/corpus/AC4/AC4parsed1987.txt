Gotta be the best Pirate game out there to date.  So, here are my thoughts.  At first, you have to get used to the play style.  How to move around, jump, climb etc... and you will eventually get the hang of it.  Even though the game has a mind of its own and will at times make you wonder it is the worst part of the game when it has a mind of its own.Otherwise, yes it has its assasins type sneaking and killings.  But, that is just part of it.  You are a captain of a PIRATE SHIP. Best graphics out there with regards to waves and weather.You upgrade ship after you get you booty, you hunt for animal hides and upgrade your charecters outfits.You use a dive bell to go to the bottom of the oceans for further adventures.You hunt sharks and whales with harpoons on a whale boat that you launch from your ship.Good stuff and more to do than that.  Definitely one to get.Oh, did I mention, there is a multiplayer mode?  So, when you are done with SOLO.. or had enough, join the internet and have group fun.  Good stuff.
