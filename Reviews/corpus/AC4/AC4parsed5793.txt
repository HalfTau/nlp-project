i dont know what should i say about this game , there was not a single sequence or mission i was bored with or hated , i thought i may hate the hacking mini game at abstorgos office or the deep sea diving missions but even those had thier own flavor of fun, the only thing which i found it a bit annoying is melee combat system there was no fun in getting at it but the game is about to be an assasin and they dont rather to fight in open like warriors, other than that this is one of the best games i ever played, a game that kept me going to completion at 100 in 74 hours .
