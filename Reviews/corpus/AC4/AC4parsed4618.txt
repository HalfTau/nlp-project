Id love to reccomend this game since Im sure that it gets quite fun with some progression.But naturally there are crippling seemingly unfixable errors that make it so that my save games cannot be loaded once Ive shut down the game.Whether its a problem with the  games platform Uplay that it forces you to download or a problem wtih the steam cloud I dont know, but the honestl truth is I cant reccomend a game that has a common bug of not allowing you to save your game. Its not even worth sale price to just repeatedly play through the first few hours then have the game delete your saves.
