Bought it in the Lunar Sale.Found it impossible to play because of Uplay and the no internet connection bug. A word from someone waiting on a refund from Steam, Im told Black Flag is the best Assassins Creed game to date but I cant recommend a game a third party program like Uplay governs.Uplay 0/10Assassins Creed Black Flag ?/10Edit due to commentsI had tried troobleshooting various recommended ways including clean installing Uplay from the Uplay website, still no luck. Luckily I was smart enough to close the Steam Uplay launcher, if I hadnt Steam would have taken the launcher being open as me playing Black Flag and I would never have gotten my refund.
