Great game. The sailing is fun. Naval combat becomes repetitive, but still remains fun. Unlike other AC games, with sprawling places to explore, this one breaks things up into bitesized islands, each with its own secrets. Individually, these arent very interesting, but they are tied into a greater whole and this makes them interesting to explore.The story is compelling. I liked how the present day story is tied into the past one, and found the present day activities to be the best in the series. Very walking simulatorish, but a good change of pace, with humor and interesting backstory.I think this game has a really good twist in the Kenway storyline. Its not a surprise ending, but SPOILERS 2/3rds of the way through things go from peachykeen to dire. The people youve befriended start dying and your character changes because of this. Its storytelling 101 3act play, but it is well done and compelling. It means that Kenways saga ends not with a cheap twist, but a real resolution, which I think makes this game a complete experience, more than any other game in the series.Good stuff. Recommended.
