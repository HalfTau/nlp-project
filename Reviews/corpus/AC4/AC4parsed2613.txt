The game sets you off deep into action giving you a real idea on how the rest of the game will be. One of the most appealing aspects of the Assassins creed collection are the fight and chase scenarios where you may choose your approach to battle. In this installment, Ubisoft added a new change  where you may take your battles out to sea. However, once you reach the halfway point of the game, the sea battles tend to be very repetitive. They tried to keep you hooked with the option to upgrade your ship however that little treat gets very boring, very quickly. After a few attempts at hunting and fort destroying, I soon forgot what the storyline was even about. It doesnt have the same feel as the first 2.Very fun for assassins creed fans, however if youre looking for an upgrade from Ezios storyline, you probably wont be getting it.Gameplay  8/10Graphics 8/10Storyline 6/10Overall 7/10
