TLDR Score 7.3/10Quick Review When i got it, was broken and never saved the game. had to play in 1 playthrough or wait for UBISOFT to fix it, which they did after some time. yes, this is a ubisoft client game that, when i bought it, steam forgot to mention, because i ing despise ubisoft for the way they tream pc players and bring out games they deem 10/10 yet are broken as im looking at Watchdogs icon on my main monitor as i write this. HOWEVER it is now a good game, with a nice take on piracy.Pros A nice idea on piracy, with control over loot and such.  Once sorted, Supurb graphics if no bugs/glitches with it Great control and gameplay over ship fights. Story hey, its assassins creed, need i say more?Cons Bug, Bugs and more ing UBISOFT bugs. UBISOFT UBISOFT sometimes youl be stuck in a never ending loop of spawn, run a mile, die, repeat, due to bugs.Main ReviewAny Updated ReviewOld reviewBROKE IN UPLAY DOES NOT SAVE GAMES DO NOT BUY.seriously the tutorial offers NO ship fights, so unless you plan on keeping it running or playing 6 hours and dont mind resetting everytime you go back to the main menu or quit the game, dont buy it. along with the  ubisoft customer support and massive amount of bugs that never seemed to get fixed, dont buy it. cant refund due to being in inventory for a while, and since i do keep my systems on 24/7, i am actually playing it in one playthrough for the sake of just doing it and getting it done.1 pro alt tab works fine with this game in full screen mode.
