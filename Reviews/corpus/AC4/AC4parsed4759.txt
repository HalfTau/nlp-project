Purchased game through steam played once for about five hours and saw it saving multiple times.  Attempted to start playing again the next day, but there was no saved file.  Started a new game thinking that it was just a small error and again played for about five hours.  Saw that it was saving multiple times, but when i finished this time i checked to see if my save file was still there and able to be played.  Worked fine.  Exited to desktop came back to play again the next day, everything was erased again. Very displeased.
