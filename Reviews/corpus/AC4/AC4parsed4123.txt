Very disapointing a great game but not ment for steam. This being said my computer can handle this game on medium settings  but not full, and this could be the reason ive experiecned troubles. In the short time ive played it, the game freaking sucks, the controlls suck with a mouse, the dialouge is off soooo much, and over all just a waste of my god damn time. Would recomend on consoule but NEVER on steam regardles of computer.
