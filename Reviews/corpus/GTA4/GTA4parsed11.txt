So I watched steam comments of this game and thought that should I buy this game at all. I decided to buy and it works without any problem. And about the what use to be Games for Windows live thing, you dont need that account to save the game. Just click the button in game that says create account and from there click create a local profile. Now just type name you like and thats it, now you can save the game.
