Do NOT get this game for PC. Its a fun game, sure, but only when it works. When I first launched the game I was getting massive frame drops. Now that may seem like my problem but I have double maybe triple the system requirements needed to run this game on a decently new computer. So I looked up the issue and found many MANY reports of the same issue. As well as an options menu that didnt help my cause in any way. After hours of testing and removing mods to help fix these issues I have come to the conclusion that this game is almost completely broken on my end and if you got it to work I envy you. This is one of the worst PC ports I have ever come across and by a major developer working on a major title. I dont usually recommend this but if you want this game buy it on console. Otherwise, I advise against buying this game on PC unless you think your computer wont have an issue or that you can fix the issue. I have given up on it but maybe you can do it. Waste of my money.
