Hey, you heard of all that controvosy surrounding the Grand Theft Auto series? No? Well, no better chance to learn than now. As Niko Bellic, Russian war vet, you steal and kill your way around Liberty City with a myasmer of character that are all surprisingly fleshed out. I really enjoy the open world fun and killing everything is still as good as ever. Im sort of surprised that anyone has not played GTA IV regardless of the fact that it was sort of eclipsed recently by GTA V.  In any case, its still great and everyone should play it up.
