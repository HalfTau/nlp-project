DONT GET THIS GAME OR THE BUNDLE.This game along with the rest of them bundle does not work on windows 8. Been trying for a few mounths now to get it to wok. I have the mouse problem and tryed everything. diffrent mouses, changing my CPU settings, changing the version of windows that the game runs in.  So I say  steam and  the franchise for putting a game out and NOT putting a worring before buying. I expect a refund for the bundle pack. So this reveaw will go on every site I can get it on. and I will give it the worst rating I can intell problem is fixed or refund is given. I loved the game on the og Xbox. but will no longer be buying future games.
