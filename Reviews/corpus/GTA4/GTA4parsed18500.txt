Ahh playing this on PC sure takes me back to the 100s of hours I played on the Xbox 360. Except now instead of playing the game at 30fps in an upscaled resolution with horrendous jagged lines everywhere, Im enjoying a crisp, fluid 1080p experience with nearly every car in the game modeled to real life vehicles.Running over 40 pedestrians with a Shelby GT500? Why not? PC Master Race!
