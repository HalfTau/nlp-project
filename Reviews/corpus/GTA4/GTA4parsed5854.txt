Short version There are hoops to jump through at first, but GTA IV is worth the money and the 1015 minutes it takes to set the game up to play.I write this review understanding that this isnt a brand new game, and as such, this review is for people who, like me, are buying this game waaaay after its prime. Why am I writing this review? Because I nearly found myself dissuaded out of a perfectly good game by reviews that targeted easily bypassed issues.Now, Id like to begin this by saying that no matter what platform you play it on, GTA IV is still a good game, and a fun entry to the GTA series. A lot of the other reviews for this game note that theres difficulty getting this game to work on PC, and, I wont lie, its true there are some hoops to jump through to get this game working. These reviews, however, vastly overstate the difficulty of playing this game, and as such, advise against its purchase, but dont heed these reviews, the process of getting this game to work takes 10 minutes, 15 tops. Combined with the time it takes to download in the first place, this is totally negligible.Down to itThere are two main barriers to pass before enjoying going bowling with your virtual cousin, Games for WIndows Live, and Social Club, both of which can be gotten around very easily. In the effort to not make this review a tutorial, I will simply say that there exist plenty of dedicated tutorials on the web, especially on support forums and the like.At the end of the day, what you get is a great GTA game, with all of GTAs signature crazy storytelling. Ive heard tell that theres a way to still access multiplayer too, and there are plenty of people who have done this. Its the same story here, you have to put a little work in, but then you have a perfectly good game.
