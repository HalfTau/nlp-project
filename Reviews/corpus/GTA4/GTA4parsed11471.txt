The miserable GFWL drags this  port into the ground! Runs like crap. Frame rates all over the place. But the fact I cant get it to save AND load saves kills it. Tried everything I can find on the forums. Keeps wanting to do an update to GFWL, never grabs my profile, and cant seem to load a save. Even in death Games for Windows  Live is torturing us. Skip this monstrosity at ALL COSTS!
