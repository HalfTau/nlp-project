I really loved GTA IV and GTA V but after youve seen everything in the game you start modding. Its a great thing. It lets me keep playing these amazing games.And the reason why I dont recommend the game Take Two killed modding. They basically made it illegal. Its absolute t and a punch in the face of the community.
