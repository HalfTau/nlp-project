Can play the game, but with very poor framerate.My laptops exceeded the system requirements, but still dont understand why the framerate sucks as hell.Plus, managing the GFWL and Windows Live system is quite a hassle. Playing a game dont have to be that hard. Not everyone wants to play multiplayer.The Windows Live and GFWL system is the worst in this world. Someone who created it can just go die already.
