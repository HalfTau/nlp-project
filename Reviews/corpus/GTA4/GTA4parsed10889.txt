A wonderful game, Im sure. However, its completely unplayable in this PC release. I came into this blind bought it on sale, so it was super cheap, so I took a risk. First it forced me to create an account on the Rockstar Social Club. Annoying, but OK. Then it refused to autosave unless I opened a Games for Windows Live account. So I attempted to do that. GFWL then sent me to the Xbox Live website. The Xbox LIve website said Just login with your Microsoft account! I dont have a Microsoft account... HOW MANY PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW MY PERSONAL INFORMATION SO I CAN PLAY THIS GAME?! But fine, Ill start a Microsoft account, strictly for the purpose of signing up on Xbox Live, strictly for the purpose of joining GFWL, strictly for the purpose of autosaving on this game. And... the page to create a Microsoft account was a dead link saying This service not available. Frustrated, I quit the game to cool off. When I attempted to login a second time, the Rockstar Social Club said my account information was invalid. Which was a lie.Thats what I mean by unplayable. There actually is a wonderful game hidden behind all this paranoia and phishing, but youll never get around to playing it. I was cheated. You will be too if you spend money on this.
