Bought this a while ago when it was on sale. PC was low end so I couldnt play it. So I get a pc that I can play it on and its good for the first few hours. Decided to download the dlc.... bad idea game doesnt work. Been looking for fixes but then I find out I cant mod it anymore.... great Ive bought GTA 4 probably 4 times.... only reason I wanted gta 4 on pc is to mod it!!!
