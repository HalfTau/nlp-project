This game gave me absolutely a ton of great hours when I played it on my 360 back in the day. I picked it up so i could enjoy it again with my PC, however, it was all bad the moment I fired it up for the first time. the LIVE integration can be looked over, it really means just one key press to play as I wanted but the performance is absolutely ridiculous. Even after HOURS of troubleshooting I could not get a decent playing experience, hacing stutters, bad performance and subpar graphics as a consequence.Saldy I cannot recommend this game on this platform, it just not worth it unless you have a great PC to overpower the lazy port this came out to be.GTA V is great and all, but this game had a touch no other videogame can match for me.
