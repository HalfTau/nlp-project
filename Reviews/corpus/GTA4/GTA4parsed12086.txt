Broken.Thats all you need to know about this terrible port of a game. Try as I might, this half decade old game will not run above 25fps on my R9 280X.Beyond that, the driving is awful. Aside from the cars handling like youre on the mood, the game constantly stutters which makes the simple task of driving down a street unbearable.If thats not enough, the game has yet to be updated to so much as detect more than 2GBs of VRAM.Do yourself a favour, dont buy it.
