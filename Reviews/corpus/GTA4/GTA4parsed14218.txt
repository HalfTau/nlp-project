Feels like its a scorcher out there today guys. I would recommend staying indoors and blasting the A/C. But for those that do have things to do today, good luck! The radio continues to babble unintelligibly as Tod zones out behind the wheel of his  1980s chevy. Speeding 80 miles per hour down the freeway, Tod isnt your every day content civilian. This mans wife has left him, and his kids think hes a total ing loser. Hes been drunk for most of the day for the last couple months and crying himself to sleep for about 5 weeks. He doesnt really care anymore. Hes broken, and he could care less if he hits the back of a car with a family inside, flinging both cars flipping in seperate directions crashing and destroying other cars on the highway. Tods car explodes, quickly followed by a second explosion, cars are piling up and the bridge supports start to give out. Full panic has now borken out and the bridge begins to collapse. Dozens of cars go into the water. Hundreds of people are being injured and dying. Until this short story can happen in a video game. You can play Grand Theft Auto IV. 8/10
