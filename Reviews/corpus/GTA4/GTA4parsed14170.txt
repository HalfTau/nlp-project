Does not work in Windows 8. Its not Windows 8s fault either. Plenty of other games work. It first started to run, then crashed as soon as I started a new game. Plus the splash screens arent skipable. I tried to reinstall the Games for Windows Live, then once that was running and logged in, I run the game again and get a different error related to SecuROM. I instal VC redistributables again, which doesnt help. Ive paid for it on sale, so I wouldnt mind getting it work, but otherwise, its probably not worth the effort. Your luck may vary...
