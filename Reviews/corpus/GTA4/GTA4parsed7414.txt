This game WILL NOT work on PC if you are running Windows 10 after an update that disabled Securom. The information/instructions at Securoms site and other suppoprt sites does NOT fix the problem be forewarned. I have not been able to locate a working fix even after extensive searching. I am sad to say it, because I liked this game a lot... but just spend your money elsewhere. Time passes, e happens
