Youre fing joking right? ?I had to wait like 3 days for the game to obtain the steam key in order for me to play it. It finally does!.....But the thing is I CANT EVEN PLAY THE GAME, WHAT IS THIS ROCKSTAR?Everytime i load GTA 4 the game asks for my rockstar social account but for some reason it doesnt authenticate even though i tested it out on other browers and my account was loading fine. So luckily there is a play offline option lucky me D but it doesnt even work, yes the offline button still requires you to have a signed in social club in order to play SO WHY CALL IT A OFFLINE MODE IN THE FIRST PLACE. Honestly i cant believe this rubbish, never played gta 4 before and heard its an awesome game but now i cant even try it out, this should be a very simple process1Purchase game2Download game3Play gamePlease fix this major issue rockstar because its not just me who is having this issue.
