Somehow with a little black magic and a lot of luck, I got this game to run on windows 10. I was never able to before, but I did it and dont know how. You basically have to install Games for Windows Live and pray to f god that you can sign in, and if the planets are aligned and its 632 PM on a Saturday, you can log in. If you can, youre good to go basically. As for the game, its pretty good, but it runs worse than GTA V on my GTX 970, i5 4690K PC. I mean it is technically for Windows XP PCs but cmon man.10/10 would go bowling with Roman again.
