Game is alright but I have felling that something is missing from it because every time I start new mission I rush it as fast as I can because firts few mssion is pretty similar shoot, steal cars and chase people, I havent finished game yet but after finishing 1020 mssions I dont wanna keep going till the end because have a feeling that it will be the same and I will be disapointed at ending.
