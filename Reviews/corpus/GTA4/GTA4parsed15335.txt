This game is an amalgamation of many genres Sims, Driving games, Shooters to name a few. Its a pretty vast city and there should be plenty of things to do. For those that worry about the age of the game, the graphics can be brought up to 2014 standards through mods that are free to download around the web.The storyline and characters are both funny and exciting!You can play pool, darts, bowling while on dates. You can drive around and do all sorts of random stuff like hijack a police car then kill criminals on the most wanted list or whatever is going on in the city. You can race cars, trucks, boats... there are helicopters and police AI to chase you around when youve done stupid things.The only bad part about the game so far is that there is a whole lot of driving and the save game convention is the console way e.g. have to start the entire mission over which isnt typical of PC games where you can save at any time. Unless you hate driving, and cant stand a bit of frustration from the rather challenging missions, you should give it a try!Overall, good game!
