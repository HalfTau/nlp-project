Wow, this game is just bad beyond reasoning...First off, the entire game consist of linear, boring and repetitive missions that will have you drive to a point, take a mission, drive to another point, kill a guy, and drive back to the point. Rinse and repeat, never any innovation in the level design. Second, the driving mechanism is just simply not working, all cars feel like they have no weight to it or the concept of gravity and friction were just never implemented into the game. Have you ever seen a car drifting across the street going 3 miles per hour? Well lucky you have GTA IV. Third, the AI in this game is simply absent. While playing many missions where a NPC is suppose to follow you, you will often see them get stuck at corners or doors and not knowing what to do. The NPC drivers follows no obvious driving pattern and smash their cars everywhere. Fourth, it makes me sick that this game lable itself as an open world sandbox game. Liberty City is just a place full of sticker buildings and nothing interesting to do, sure you have a bowling alley and a fake internet cafe, but besides that what else? Even the dating mechanism involves nothing more than just taking your girlfriend to bowling.This game is simply as shallow as it can possibly be.
