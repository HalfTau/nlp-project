This game hits home for me. Its almost like I am Niko Bellic. You know those Top Gear shirts that say, I AM THE STIG on it? I need one that says, I AM NIKO BELLIC. Niko and I share some common traits. Were both Slavic. We both have a good taste in automobiles. We both have cousins. We both have bad taste clothing. And anytime we find a girl, they usually end up being spies for the authorites. I will admit that I didnt immigrate from Albania or wherever hes from. But still, you can see the resemblance. The story was very immersive. Thats about it. You play as a Slavic dude and shoot people. Thats it. SPOILER ALERT People die, and especially the ones that are on the sidewalk because youre too drunk to realize that you cant drive after taking an absurd amount of gummy bear vodka shots. I will also say, that the multiplayer for GTA IV is way better than GTA V. I dont want insurance, or the ability to have my own house. I can get that in real life. I just dont have the money.Overall, I give this game 8 halffinished bottles of vodka out of 9 hammer and sickels.
