Well i gotta say this , i hope Grand Theft Auto 5 is better ported than this... grand theft Auto...No matter what PC you got wether it Surpases its System Requierements... youre STILL gonna Lag to Death!!And No tweaks will not Solve this issue..... no matter how GOOD.... or BEASt your GPU is youre gonna Lag either way... RockStar was High when they Ported this to PC.... Bad Lag .... making the Game unenjoyable at normal speed..ProsThe game is fantasticTheres an LCPDFR Mod that will make your Mind go BOOM!The mechanics are Good every thing is PERFECT! because  you its Grand theft Auto.ConsThe game has GARBAGE porting Enough Said.The lag will come to you for whatever you DO at whatever time you do it!Some times it can make the game Unplayable due to random Acts of LAGAnd this is not a GPU or CPU issue... this is a game issue.Some mods are game breaking... but thats on YOU for installing themNo i will not recommend this game to anyone for PC youre better of playing Grand Theft auto 5 and other grand Theft Autos.... it has better porting and its better... this one was Just to Rushed for PC.
