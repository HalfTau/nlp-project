If your about to get this game dont. I just got it and it doesnt work/open. There are a lot of tutorials and other things you have to watch and download to be able to play it. Also its like 17gb thats way to much for a game that wont even open. Also once I downloaded some of the things you HAVE to have it said my graphics were to high. I tried three times to change them but it would glitch every time and not let me. And then when I would play with the graphics it would freeze my Windows 8 computer. Overall not worth it.
