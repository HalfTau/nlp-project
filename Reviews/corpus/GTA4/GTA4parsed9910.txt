Dont get me wrong, GTA IV is a great game, but the unneccesary DRM and the requirement for a piece of software that does not exist anymore has made this game unplayable. Rockstar wants to charge people 20 for a piece of crap that doesnt work. If you have win 8.1, it would be a better use of your time to go flush a 20 bill down the toilet. I spent 5 days trying to get this to work, but i had no success. GFWL is an unneccesary barrier to playing this great game, and it is stuck in an infinite loop. As a PC master racer, i hate to say this, but the console version is better. I would get a different version of this game. Do not bother with this one.
