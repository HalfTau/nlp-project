This definitely isne the best game Ive ever played. BUT I really enjoyed spending some timem playing this game. It has something unique in it. The graphics did not knock me on my knees, just like the music. The story could be interesting if there were not so many glitches. I think it is more than fair if I rate it 6,9/10
