Another game, same story. One game sorry one masterpiece game, its glorious on consoles and even PC gamers jeaolus because console have them and when the time comes, that game released on PC but it have a lot of problems.Oh, also updates are not helping. Lots of players disscuss the 1.0.4.0 update gives a better performance and quality. You can downgrade the game and play, ive done it on Windows 7 with no problem but Windows 10 wont allow it somehow.And Goodol Windows game thingy. No one loves you m8. I cant register game on GFWL because it not allows my key, keep saying same Hey Bill Gates, Games For Windows Live is a mistake. Just like Windows Vista pal.Some mods can improve performance and quality, its confirmed by me. I have stable framerates with iCenchanter. Also  can help me more, it gets rid of GFWL. But the RGSC still stay. Its not too bad, but its Outdated af.Even after all, im still playing after beating game twice. If you cant handle these, you should grab it on a console. Its worth it. Its better then Grand Downgrade Auto V. Really, you can just compare what they have, and GTA IV should win. Even its has a iest port ever.So, last words. If Rockstar gave this game a shot again and make it remastered its so popular these days please remove that GFWL, RGSC Launcher Not RGSC, the launcher is the one with brain problems and make a better optimization i can give a full game price again.Its your cousin, lets go bowling.
