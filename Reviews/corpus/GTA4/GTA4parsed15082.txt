No storyline, thats weird because characters were really good performed.Game for me was like bunch of random quests.Most annoying thing  always need to move the camera by mouse being in the car. Otherwise you cant see where you just turned.Guns are poor, sounds are poor, graphics 50/50.Waste of time.Rate 2/5
