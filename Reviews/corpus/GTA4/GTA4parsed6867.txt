Oh boy, I sure do love games thatCrash right when I open themMake me install a huge amount of outdated GFWL stuff manually! just to get them to workUse GFWL in the first place... when its already on SteamMake me sign up for an account just to play itOverall, the Steam release is terrible. Get this game on console instead if you really want to play it.
