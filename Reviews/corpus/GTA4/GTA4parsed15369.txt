I am so angry that i purchased this game from game stop and told them that I didn t want a streaming game because I was aware of the problems. I cant get help from Steam because they keep asking me to verifly my browers. Which Ive done so many and still no help. i am going to report this issue to the fraud authorities. Not only do none of my games work professional farming sim 2014 and gta4 but I was trick and signing up for all these third party clubs. Steam, Social Club and windows Live. Please I would like some one from tech support to call me and set up my sytem to make my game work. i have windows8 4Gs with 900 gs hard drive. My number is 9545560035 if any wants to help me with this matter.
