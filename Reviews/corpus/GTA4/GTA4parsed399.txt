This is one of or maybe the worst port in history of videogames.Summarizing everyithing Dont buy the game if you own win8 and over, a good or a really bad graphics card, only the ones recommended, and if you get it only use the preset kbm config which isnt goodTo start off bad, you need games for windows LIVE for the game to get out of the starting loading screen, which is the crappiest thing a game could ever need being a buggy thing windows doesnt even care about anymore.Second of all, you need to avoid having a decent graphics card or a bad one since if the card is too bad you get wrong textures here and there NO FLOOR FOR HEAVENS SAKE and if the card is too good you are stuck with preset graphic options since the game wont recognize it properlyThird part and really important for those who use controllers is that it depends on luck if your controller will work or not, the support for it isnt really good even though its a port. Out of this one, the way the key mappings for keyboard and mouse are pretty bad.After you are capable of getting through al of this nonsense you might get to enjoy a decent grand theft auto game.
