It was a technical marvel for its time, I guess?Awful game. You might enjoy the characters and the story, but the core gameplay loop is go see a guy  he wants you to fetch or kill  go fetch or kill  go back to the guy, get paid. It could be good but the controls are unresponsive, the shooting isnt fun and the driving is boring as hell.I found the city to have absolutely no variety San Andreas had such a diverse environment. Social life hang out with friends, phone, dating, online dating is not interesting wasnt great in SA either.I really dont understand what people saw in this game. Help me? Please?
