HORRIBLE. THE GAME IS NOT RUNNING. I PLAY IT AND HIT PLAY ON SOCIAL CLUB. STOPS RUNNING. TRY LINKING GAMERTAGS, PLAY IT. STOPS WORKING. The game is a total 10. Please get your stuff together rockstar and Make GTA 6 and expect more from you instead of paying 30 dollars on a game and not working. I prefer a refund. The game does not work, slow, laggy, shuts off in the middle of the game. Works once a month.
