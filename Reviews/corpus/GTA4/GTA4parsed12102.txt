I am not a GTA fan at all because it is only sexual and criminal actions with not even a single conversation without F words in it!  i only play GTA to reach wanted level 6 and see what happens then i never play it again except GTA1 and GTA2 which i really enjoyed.About this title if you want to be a collector buy it but if you wanna be a player dont waste your money it work with GFWL and it nearly does not work at all. i never could play an online match cause of GFWL.The GoodMany things in GTA IV is realistic such as people behavior and reaction to your actions and car mechanics and a lot of new stuff you can do here such as dating a girl taking her to any place you want and so on...The BadGFWLToo many sexual conversations with F words inside and this is nothing new from Rockstar, they are kind known for Gaming Playboy!
