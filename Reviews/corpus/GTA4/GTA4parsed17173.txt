San Andreas was a great game but gta4 is bad. it crashes every 15minutes  and rocstars  drm is horrible. After couple of days i got it to run after tweaking many things, the game is horribly unstable . Only reason i still play this game is the mods that the community has done, without them gta4 is a dull game the city is uninteresting, the controlls are bad i tried both kbam and 360 controller.The player moves slowly and doesnt know how to turn around also the camera is very confusing when walking. but you can have lot of fun with it with modding.
