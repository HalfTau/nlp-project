Time to edit my review. Youll want to take 3 things consideration before buying.1. Do you have your PC running Windows 7?2. Do you want to deal with GFWL?3. Will you put up with Roman calling you asking to go bowling? Im the only person on Earth that will gladly go DSeriously though Windows 7 is the latest OS you can run this game on without dealing with the process to make this work on Windows 8.1 and you have to make a LIVE account to save the game and access multiplayer but this game is really fun regardless PIm kinda mixed but here are the ratings anyway      PC 6.5/10Console 9.5/10
