GTA IV is an amazing game but this port is trash. Even with an insane rig its difficult to get 60 fps due to poor optimization. Social club broke the online so good luck gettting thatto work. Your forced to use GFWL to save. And if your Video ram exceeds 2gb expect problems trying to even change graphical options which can be worked around but is a pain in the If you really want to enjoy the game you need to grab it on a PS3 or a 360. Once you get past all the t the game runs fine but the port is complete rubbish.
