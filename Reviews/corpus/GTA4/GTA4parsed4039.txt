The game was patched in 2016 and now runs decently on modern hardware. I get a fairly steady 5060fps on my r9 270x. The game had issues starting but is fixed once you disable games for windows live, which is easy to do. It is basically a 2 step process and there are guides on steam to walk you through it.
