After playing this game on the PlayStation 3 for a while doing the usual GTA tradition of going around in the free open world killing people and stealing cars, I thought that it was time to step up my GTA IV experience by getting it on the PC. I got it at the right time too, since it was on sale with the triple pack EFLC, and original game for 6.74 I believe. But overall, the games storyline is really well done, and I like the things that you can do. Its like the classical GTA but with a new twist to it. Such as having more activities to do and the map being slightly bigger. But however, the downfall to this game is that it isnt properly optimized for my NVIDIA card, the GeForce GTX 650. I have the recommended processor and everything, but the game cant keep a decent framerate. The Contig method usually works to fix that. I highly recommend buying this game, but while its on sale. Dont get it for the full price.
