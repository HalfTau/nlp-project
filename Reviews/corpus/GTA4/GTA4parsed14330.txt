story i am not going to spoil anything, story is about niko belic who comes in america to his cousin and for new life, but it doesnt go well. story is great.gameplay gameplay has few new things and some old from older gtas. new is cover, hiding behind walls. you always have free shooting, not lock target like in other gtas before. other is moreless same as before.graphics graphics are great, especially explosions. there are also some mods like iCEncancer to make graphics unbelivible pretty for game from 2008.problems game is really bad optimized. frames are low even on very good pcs. personaly, biggest problem are accounts, games for windows live and rockstar social club. those two thing are soooo anoying. every time i want to play gta 4 i must sign in social club and games for windows live. windows live are even worse. i cant play game if i am not coneccted to internet and that anoying.if you dont have those two accounts its even worse. you have to make two account and its just too much.but once you made all account and into the game its fantastic.good sides story, gameplay, graphics, lot of things to dobad sides optimization, games for windows live, social club85/100
