After 5 years of waiting they finally fixed it, nice one Rockstar  better late than never!If youre still having trouble after updating, try deleting and reinstalling the game and obviously get rid of your mods.When I first updated the game it didnt actually work. You will know youre running the updated version if you see Niko on the start menu instead of  the news feed.If you cant get the game to start at all, try downloading the GFWL client direct fromOnce youve downloaded it, just put in your normal Microsoft account info. and youre good to go.Also, make sure you dont launch the game through Steam. Go to your GTA IV folder and click on LaunchGTAIV. GFWL doesnt play well with Steam, apparently.In any case, for me anyway, the games pretty much fixed and I dont have to use an old patch or , so thats a bonus.My System i5 6600K  GTX 1070  game installed on SSD
