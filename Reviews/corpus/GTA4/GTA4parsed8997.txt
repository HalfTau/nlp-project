Well, update to this review. Its good, truly but many glitches and modifications needed to get this game working on windows 10. First, what everyone is on about, Games for windows. You can play this game by either downloading the program or downloading something to take off the restrictions. Another big thing is the glitch where you cannot see any buildings, which is fixable but I have no idea where I found that out to do the same with Episodes of LC. Overall, good game but very very very bad port.
