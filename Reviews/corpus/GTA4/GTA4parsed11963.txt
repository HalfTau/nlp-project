Best played with mods to enhance the game in a variety of games. Join an LCPDFR Clan which on GTA IV is unreal with the roleplay and realism. Story that linked in with the DLCS was very good as it all fits together like a puzzle. Would recommend only to buy on PC not consoles as it can get very boring on consoles compared to PCs Master Race so yes its a good game.
