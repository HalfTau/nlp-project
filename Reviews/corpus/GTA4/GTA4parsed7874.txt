My experience with this game so far.Step 1. Start up gameStep 2. Get automatically greeted by rockstar social club and windows liveStep 3. Spend 20 minutes making a windows live and rockstar social club account just so I can fcking playStep 4. Finally got done with the bllshit drm process now its time to start the gameStep 5. Game loadedStep 6. What the fckStep 7. Exit gta4 to go search for a reason why i cant change my graphics settings so it doesnt look like crash bandicoot.Step 8. After spending another 30 minutes trying to fix this issue the game finally allowed me to change my graphics settingsStep 9. Realize the game runs likebrStep 10. Starts crying and going paranoid because framerate is going from 5230 on my gtx970So yeah its fun if you can manage to overlook the bullsht drm, enjoy spending time getting the game to actually work right, and giggle at the fact your brand new gtx titan/980ti cant maintain 60fps on an 8 year old game.Oh and I forgot to mention that you HAVE to make a windows live account just to save your game, and you have to log in every time you get on the game. So yeah. The game itself id give a 8.5/10. Rockstars drm bullsht and poor optimization is what ruins this great game.
