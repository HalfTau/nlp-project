So, i recently bought this game for 6 bucks. all of the gameplay are fine. but i hate it when we must login another accounts to play 1 game. i spent 2 hours. 2 ING HOURS to sign in to windows live. and if you dont sign in to windows live. you cant save your game. so i hate it to say that i dont recommend you to buy this if you dont want put a lot of effort to play the game
