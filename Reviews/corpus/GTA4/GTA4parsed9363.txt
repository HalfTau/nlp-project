Grand Theft Auto IVVery nice game, the world is massive and it does feel like driving around in a real city. Creative missions to complete, some nice characters to meet, and so much to do in this game. A must buy if you like third person shooters. Also the first GTA game I ever completed 8/10Call up one of your friends and go have a drink, its worth it!
