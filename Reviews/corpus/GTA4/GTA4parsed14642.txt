 YOU MICROSOFT! I wanted to play this game on PC but no Microsoft has to be a ing  about it and make the game unplayable. If I want to save myI should not need to create a seperate account for an SINGLE PLAYER GAME.Dont buy this seriously its a waste of money. Unless you want to play the whole game on one run.
