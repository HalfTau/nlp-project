DO NOT BUY. This game is incredibly, incredibly broken.I loved GTA4 on the 360, and was really excited to play it on PC. Steam should be purchaseinstallplay, right?Not this time. GTA4 will not launch even offline without Games For Windows Live not that it tells you why it fails, I had to Google that, and GFWL is no longer properly supported under Windows 8.1. You can still find and install it, however, so I did.After installing GFWL onto a basically fresh install of Windows 8.1, on an i7, GTX 780, 16 GB RAM PC it will run, but all graphics options are locked to minimum and it wont let you change them. 800x600x16, low detail models and textures, no AA, minimum draw distance, etc. It looks like a PS2 game.Im sure there probably is a way to fix this, if I muck around with patches and config files for the rest of the evening, but thats not the point. The point is this is completely broken as sold. I understand that its an old game, but its not that old 2008, and its just not remotely playable in this state. Buyer beware.
