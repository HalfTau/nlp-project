I really do want to give this a positive rating, but I really cant.The reason for this is that San Andres and previous GTA titles were so much better, you would be waisting your time playing this. Other titles had so much meta gaming inbetween, giving you something besides missions to do. In this title its nothing but missions, missions, missions, missions, missions, missions, missions, missions, to get anything out of this game, with the added social calls of contacts to try to give anything of a meta game outside of missions.San Andres was such an epic addition to this title, and I dont know why this has to be so much worse in that it. San Andres had so much more clothing, tats, body workouts, fighting, propoerty, epicness, flying, tanks, etc. etc. etc. so much more than this.If you have ever played San Andres then dont play this. It is an insult to GTA and what it evolved to be to that point. This title is DE evolultion and should not be supported or bought as a testaminet to what GTA evolution should be since it is a step backward from GTASA.TO THE GAME DEVELOPERS stop being lazy and pretending that you can get away with selling a title on the title name alone, give us the quality that your previous developers gave us, and stop depending on IP alone, as well as gfx engines. I would rather play a 2d high quality GTA rather than something that takes a step backward from what previous GTA titles offered.San Andres is the top GTA game, so take note from that so much metagame, it had body building, gang wars, real character custimazation, realy epicness. This game is crap when you compare it to that. Srop trying to milk the public for money and deliver quality s.
