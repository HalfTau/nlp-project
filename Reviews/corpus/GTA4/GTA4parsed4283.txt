I love this game, really. I used to play the pirate version of this game and i thought that i had to buy the game to shown my respect to this dev. But there are some problems,  especially window live and rockstar social club, even i had a account of RGSC and its still using well on Max payne 3, somehow couldnt work on this game. Thanks to some tips of some people on Youtube, i can play this game on steam. I dont know does anybody want to buy and play this game nowadays, but if you want to show your gratitude and respect to the dev, fine, buy it and good luck, otherwise, download the pirate version is the best option.
