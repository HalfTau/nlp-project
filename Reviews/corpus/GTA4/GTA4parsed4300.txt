Im in love with my dogs. Im in love with this girl... But is it possible to be in love with a game? Is it? Because i ing adore this game. F rdr. F the witcher. f tomb raider.... HECK, EVEN GTA 5. But gta 5 has dogs... so that gets a pass... But moving onto gta 4. Its great... The character you play is an ultimate badass... My top character of all time, with Sam Fisher being a close second. The graphics, while not great, still holds up extremely well, even if you dont max the graphic settings out. The fps is not THAT bad... It should still run better, but it itnt the worst. It stays over 30fps on my setup. The story is OUTSTANDING.. It is a huge step up from previous titles, and gta 5 being an absolute downgrade. The world still feels alive..Oh and bowling is in the game too 10/10
