Its a intersting criminal game!You should buy the completed edition of GTA IV, or you cant understand the whole stroy.And you should play the game in accordance with the order of GTA IV  GTA IV The Lost and Damned  GTA IV The Ballad of Gay Tony.I appreciate the story and the graphics. Its better than GTA III.
