Waste of money  0/10 pointsI  had to reinstall Microsoft Visual C 2005 and Windows Marketplace Client to run it without errors. Then create Rockstar accout and Microsft Live account. The Rockstar account worked occasionally. Frame rate about 30 with medium settings, no change with low settigns found out on forums that this is due to badly optimized console port.I tried to play this for 4 hours and then uninstall it. Car feels like im driving on ice. Poor gameplay.
