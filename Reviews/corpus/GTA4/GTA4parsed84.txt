There are a lot of people complaining and giving downvotes simply because they cannot run the game Its all complete rubbish. Stop complaining if youve lost basic computer skills from all that console cuddling. I have played and finished this game with little or no issues and finally got it on the Humble sale... yes Im playing it right now on Windows 10...zero crashes.Lets start at the beginningBefore launch this game installs GFWL so you dont need to download...but if you do go here, click on the green  in the second paragraph to download.Press Home to bring up Games for Windows live and sign inEnter your Xbox live account info and wait for your profile to download...thats itYou can check the auto signin and it will sign you in automatically from now onIf you dont have an account already, then head over toand create one.If you dont have a rockstar social club account, then create one as well by going to.You can link your Steam, Xbox live accounts to your social club.Press Home to bring up Games for WIndows live and click create new profileScroll to the bottom and click So far my only gripe is offline saves will not load if copied to your online profile.If you need your game save / config path CUsersusernameAppDataLocalRockstar GamesNow go have some funNiko Bellic is the most real and down to earth character in the GTA universe. Not over the top like the others, not trying to be a badass because he already is and actually has a working moral compass with real values. Besides looking out for Roman, take any girl on a date and listen to Niko talk to understand what I mean.Great gameplay with a fine balance between arcade and simulation make for a satisfying experience...and awesome gun battles
