Dont Buy, no matter the sale. Its literally unplayable without a live account of gamertag which they dont let you set up with preexisting accounts, not to mention the ing around you need to do even get it to run! the 53 minutes i have in this game are literally from starting and restarting this game when it crashes immedietly and my 10 minute play before i realised you cant use achievments, autosave or save at all without a live account.
