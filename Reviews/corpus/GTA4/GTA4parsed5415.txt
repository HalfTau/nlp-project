Game doesnt work because of Social Club. Its unacceptable to sell game with bug like this. Why the hell do I have to spend time to crack original game. Ive paid for it and it HAS to work. Steam should check game before selling. Why game is in store?If u click play offline nothing happens.If u click play  social club login failed. please try againWhat should I do to play game that i paid for?
