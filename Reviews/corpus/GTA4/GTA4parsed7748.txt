Windows 10 compatibility review.As you all probably know, GTA IV is at its core a great game. This port on the other hand is iffy and needs a bit of discussion. Ill admit I was one of the five smug jerks who had literally zero problems running the game on my modest hardware back in the day. My day of reckoning has certainly come to pass. Call it karma.This time around with slightly newer hardware, and a shiny new OS to boot, it all went the way of the three legged giant sloth. Or was it three toed? Either way it was garbage, except hang on... this analogy makes no sense. To cut a story that is and should be short to its correct length, the game unexpectedly played like crap.On the bright side, I can personally vouch for the fact that it does actually play on Windows 10. The backward plague that is Games for Windows lives even seems to be working. The performance problems were initially hard to deduce, however I eventually narrowed it down to the shadows. The bloody ugly pixelated shadows that somehow only look decent at the very high detail setting were the problem Go figure. The abhorrently inelegant solution was to simply turn them off. That brought my frame rate up to a stable level at least 4050 fps all the time rather than sub 30. This is of course not totally groovy. The game still doesnt play half as good as it should, but at this point I was willing to take any small victory I could get my greasy paws on.Anyway, yeah, 20 hours in, no crashing. I have been having a problem with the character model not showing up every time I load the game. The solution to that is to change the reflection quality in game. Again, stupid problem deserves a stupid solution. Such is life.
