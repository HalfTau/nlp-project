This game is extremely fun and will keep you entertained for hours on end.Gameplay 9.5/10Graphics 9/10 Pretty good for a 2008 gameStory and Missions 9/10Gunplay 10/10Combat System 10/10Very good game, and if it goes on sale for 4.99 or the GTA IV Complete Pack goes on sale for 7.49, its a total steal.
