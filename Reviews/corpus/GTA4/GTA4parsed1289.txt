I bought this game some time ago with 2 decent computers to test it on...it was unplayable on both. The stupid game either got stuck on the copyright screen, game menu, or the loading screen that 4.2 hours on record isnt true Ive never even played it. Apparently I am not the only one who has had this problem. Biggest waste of money ever, I am really getting sick of Rockstars t.
