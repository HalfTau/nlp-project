GTA IV ReviewMy thoughtsI think GTA IV is a great game! Everything is well done, graphics are made in 2008 I think and I think they still look alright. Set aside the countless hours of just setting up the game and the painfully bad port it has, its great! If you have problems with the game Id suggest you search up tutorials in assisting you in your specific problem. Also, the port, I have to admit, it was a shtty port, its well optimised, but you know what? Turn your god damn graphics down, and read the fcking system requirements before ACTUALLY buying the game.
