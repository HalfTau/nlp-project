This is the most unique GTA, which attempts to capture realism and accurate simulation more than Hollywood thrills. Because of that, most of the game can feel sluggish and frustrating, but whenever you do something right, its extremely rewarding to know that you accomplishment took place with little assistance. The story is also very welldone, but a bit too depressing to be a GTA story.
