I was really hoping to play this game and took me 3 hours to download it. once it was downloaded I realized that this is deffinately not a game for windows 8 computers because not only are there many complaints about it, but when i click on the game and it connects to steam and social club, it asks me to put in my cridencials and when i do it says that the process of my password and so on is a success and after that the game never appears, but on steam it says Ive played for half an hour. SO if anyone could help or is having the same problem please help or else i want a REFUND !!!!...STEAM!! !
