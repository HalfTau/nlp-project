Played this on 360, liked it, played it here, loved it! The modding community on pc makes this game worth buying. The gritty, realistic crime story is awesome, gameplay is pretty smooth depending on your computer, and the atmosphere is gripping with life in Liberty City. Now listen, for every review that states, I coudnt launch it or The game is broken Havent done their research. Just search up, how to fix  In GTA IV on YouTube and there you go. So dont give it hate without trying to fix it.8.5/10
