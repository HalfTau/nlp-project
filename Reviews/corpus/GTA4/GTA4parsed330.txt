A very good story. Its very different from all the other GTA games, so if you are expecting gangbanging andlike that, get GTA SA or V. This is more of a serious game, obviously meant for the story. Get it if you are looking for an amazing story and protagonist. Only issues I have with the game are a few bugs, but thats it.
