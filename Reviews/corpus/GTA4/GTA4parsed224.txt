Overall, this is a good game, if you have like an old pc lying around. Then, you gotta struggle abit getting a winodws/xbox live account and run it. Download a patch on the rockstar website and sign in to social club. Then you can access everything else that this bundle has.Honestly, I wouldnt buy it. I bought it when I just saw some stupid memes about. But hey, if you have some spare money and a average and old pc, buy it. Its perfect for that setup.
