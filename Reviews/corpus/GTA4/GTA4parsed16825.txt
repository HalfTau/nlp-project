awsome game, dont think the thumbs down is about the game itself, DO NOT get this for PC it requires you to have a games for windows LIVE account and the client doesnt even work. went to the support chat site for xbox LIVE were the download comes from, ROCKSTAR help desk, and windows/ microsoft help desks and no one knows what games for windows LIVE even is. so no one can figure out why it doesnt work, and if you dont have the client the game will not play. not worth it!
