A single player game crippled by Windows Live. I tried for two hours get the game to take my Windows Live ID. It looks beautiful,but cant save without it. I tried to get techinical support,but cant read the symbols that Steam uses to keep people from contacting support. With fixes and maybe technical support it could be good. Mostly disappointed in Steam at the moment.
