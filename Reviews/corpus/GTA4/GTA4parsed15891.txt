Having played this for a long time on console, now almost exclusively a PC gamer, this remains a must have for the collection. While it has less in the way of RPGlike elements that made San Andreas so extremely replayable, the physics featured in this game are the pinnacle of the entire series. You can easily see how this began the trend towards realistic reactions for npcs, which were perfected later in Red Dead Redemption, LA Noire, and Max Payne. Even the new GTAV lacks the exaggerated nature of impact as experienced here, and it has the best car damage features out of any GTA game.I do think San Andreas has the better gameplay, overall  territory warfare and how you would be left alone if going against other criminals made for a fun experience that cant be beat  but its hard to go back to the days when characters only fall flat no matter what, not after playing with IVs engine. The worst part of this game is how the police seem to roam every five feet, and you cant get away with anything you do unless absolutely silent even in the expansions where you are part of a crew, expecting to be left alone if only attacking rivals and not hurting unaffiliated innocents, but there is an active modding community where you can find ways of reducing the number of cops and their constant interference... if youre like me, and playing The Lost and the Damned, for example, where you want to go after all rival gangs for an immersive experience without constant police harrassment, Id highly suggest some sort of mod to address this issue if you get a kick out that, because the cheat system in IV pretty much sucks to have to use.Also, pro tip turn your phone to sleep mode. I think we all kind of know that particular annoyance, of course. Otherwise, with the cover system, gritty look and feel, amazing physics, and killer soundtrack to back it up, this game is just as good today as anything else out there.
