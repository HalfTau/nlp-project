This games servers were made by either 10 very dumb people, or 1 very smart cat. WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU SHUT DOWN THE GAMES FOR WINDOWS SERVERS? We cant play multiplayer, nor can we even enter the product code without modding the game to oblivion. Screw you guys, dont just abandon what you promised. You can clearly see the tag Multiplayer in the Steam store. I dont see it ingame!
