The fourth title in the now legendary Grand Theft Auto series puts you in the shoes of Niko Bellic a Russian immigrant just getting off the boat in Liberty City, a fictional version of New York City. You were lured there by your cousin Roman who sent you letters bragging about the success he had made for himself in America.Roman of course made this all up and he is really a poor taxi driver with no real success to speak of. Together, you just try to make it in this tough world and because Roman has messed up and gotten involved with more sinister elements, his cousin has to help him out.The game plays as all the other Grand Theft Auto games. You steal cars from people, then plow down pedestrians on your way to your destination.Grand Theft Auto IV changes the tone of the series drastically. The funny parodies of the earlier games are gone and replaced by a much more grim and serious setting. They changed this again in one of the DLC as well as in Grand Theft Auto V.Two expansions/DLC were released for this game. Lost and the Damned as well as The Ballad of Gay TonyFirst off The port is absolutely horrible and will run like complete crap on many systems. Play at your own risk. Always consult PC Gaming Wiki before attempting to play this game.If you do pick this up and miss the tone of the older games, then the second DLC The Ballad of Gay Tony, is a must have. Its story is funny, smart and just as crazy as the games that came before it. You can often pick up the entire game with all DLC during a Steam sale.
