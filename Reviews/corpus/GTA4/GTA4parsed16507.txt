If you play GTA games, then there is nothing not to really like about this game. It lacks a lot of the elements of the famous San Andreas. Except fot that, the content that is there is pollished. In every way an improvement in the series. The graphics are stunning, the cars control a lot better, the action feels more real and... drum roll... you have TV too! Lots of action, lots of fun, lots to do and a lot of cars to steal. Much worth it! 1 for the better graphics and improved gameplay.
