Grand Theft Auto IV is a sad game. Its theme is the missconception of the American Dream, the hope that all foreigners have that they will succeed in America. GTA IV presents this beautifully with an ugly dark tone in the story telling and even the visuals. The dark tone is why I refuse to install bright ENBs on GTA IV, but do on EFLC. The gameplay isnt lackluster but difficult as console gamers have autoaim and the dissproportional mouse controls are all we have. Expect to see the GTA standards in this game like wanted levels and carjacking, along with hillarious glitches. Many complained about how the game is a terrible port and I have not experienced that. I run 60 FPS maxed out on my GTX 760, so I guess I got out lucky? The modding community in this game is wonderful. They just keep finding a way to make this game even better. Superman, Iron Man, The Delorean, all this stuff they add to this already great game.
