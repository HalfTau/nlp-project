To start out with the positives, the graphics are pretty good once you get the game to recognize your GPU  it locks you into the lowest settings if your GPU has more than 2GB of RAM. There is a workaround to unlocking the settings, however the game still nags you that your overclocked GTX970 with 4GB of DDR5 RAM isnt capable of running a 7 year old game higher than on the lowest resolution. The storyline is also good, definitely on par with the other titles in this series. Unfortunately thats where the positives end.The controls are awkward at best. It takes a bit of time to get used to driving a car  operating the camera completely separate from each other. Player movement is also an issue  definitely a step back from previous titles. Even when you do get used to it, the game mechanics  physics leave a lot to be desired.Ive played every other title in the GTA line  I can say with confidence that this is the worst one by far.
