First of all, let me be clear about one thing I loved playing this game on console, its a great game.However, I have to warn anyone picking this up on PC that it is in no way a decent port, at all. First off there is the issue of invasive DRMs, to play online you have to create accounts for two separate DRMs in addition to being on steam. GFWL is also requiered to save your progress ingame, which basically means you cant progress without it. I got past that, after some issues getting GFWL to shut up and just work. What I can not get past is keyboard and muose controls simply not working.Example Im unable to stay in melee combat even though im punching a guy and hes punching back. I damage him, he damages me, the problem is I cannot block, dodge, kick or use the secondary attack on him.I have yet to play using my 360 controller, and from experience that will probably fix most of my issues with bad keyboard and muse support. I will update this short review when I get around to trying it out.TLDR The game itself is well worth getting, if you are able to get through the DRM and work around issues relating to a shoddy PC port. Even so I would recommend getting it for console over PC.
