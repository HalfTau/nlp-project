Its TOTAL Well, ofcourse when you can get through GFWL A miracle and can load your saved position, I can say that this game can be fun, but thats just for short amout of time. When you had finished story mode, theres nothing you cando in Boring Liberty City. So if theres sale on this game, Its even not worth it. EFLC Either!
