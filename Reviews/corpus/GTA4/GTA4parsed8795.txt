It took me sometime to finally fix the issues so I could play.I loved the game, but I felt a bit disappointed at its departures from what I remembered from the old GTAs. How does one get over the fact you no longer have garages and multiple residencies to store your cars? The good ol times when you tried to fit more cars into a garage than it actually should be holding through clever parking methods?I forgot when I got into my first car collision. After that, it was unbelievably fun driving into other people and watching a pristine vehicle be crushed, dented, and torn apart. The combat also became a bit more realisticthough not having those icons to run into to replenish armor/health meant I had to drive ALL the way to the nearest gun shop to restock and armor up, then hit up the nearest foodstand for health.Cops are a total pain in the rear, especially at higher star levelsthen again one shouldnt be able to run over a bunch of pedestrians, kill dozens of cops, and expect to make a clean get away by driving into a paint shop in clear sight of a bunch of cops. It means youll need to put some thought into making a clean getawayI always drive to nearest paint shop, then take a crazy drive around the block while shooting at some cops when I stop to make a temporary roadblock, and try to race to the shop to get repaint before I get sighted again.A feature I especially loved was the police car computer to hunt down criminals and respond to crimes. That was certainly more realistic and a lot more fun than the previous vigilante sidemissions.Overall? It was an introduction into the new era of GTA. A more realistic one.
