One of the only things I could do to fix the game for myself without using XLIVELESS Forums block this word, it is a program to start GTA without windows live was to download windows live and restart the PC, there are also patches you can find, I cant link them unfortunately but if you look up GTa iv PATCHES/GFWS downloads you should be able to find them!Good luck.
