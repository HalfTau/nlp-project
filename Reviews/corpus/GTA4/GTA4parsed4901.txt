I play this on windows 10. The single player works fine. You have to put in some codes to make it run fine but other than that its great! I hope in the future I can fix the multiplayer.Update I got the multiplayer to work. Everything works as it should now.If anyone has questions feel free to message me and I will do what I can to help
