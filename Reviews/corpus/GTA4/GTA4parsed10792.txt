WAITBEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAMEDONT BUY IT FROM STEAMJust go out into the great outdoors or amazon and buy the disk version for pc, because all youll need to do in the future is get hold of a product key  After you go through the hassle of Fing Windows Live BullS sign in.The reason you need a product key is so then you can actually progress into the game with the ability to save.So dont be a pillock like me and buy this on steam for 20.00 and then go and buy a hard coppy for an additional 12.99, just for a Product key.Besides all the Windows Live crap, it is still a mighty fine, funny, game with characters with great personalities, so I would reccomend this game, just NOT WITH DIGITAL DOWNLOAD OF ANY SORT
