This is a great game I just dont recommend you buying it on PC.First off, dont get me wrong this is a fantasic game, its just that other things really let it down.After over an hour of waiting I was ready to play my new purchased game. I hit Play and popped up was a box explaining Social Club. I wasnt really interested so just clicked play offline. Then I realised after 30 seconds the game doesnt launch, so had to look it up on Google. Turns out I HAD TO install a Games for Windows Marketplace Client. Wait a minute... I thought I was playing a game on Steam? After downloading I HAD TO create a Windows Live ID account in order to proceed. After doing so. I lauched the game again. ThIs time it worked. HORRAYY! Then the resolution was bad, so had to go into settings to change it, but then found out it would not change. Im off to Google again to find out what was wrong. It turns out I HAVE TO go through the games files and find the application that launches the game and create a shortcut that goes on my desktop. And then go to properties and add in norestrictions onto the target field. This made it work and after a few hours from hitting the buy button I was finally going to play my game. But as its not technically in Steam and a shortcut, I was not able to enter the GTA IV community in game which kinda sucks. Oh well at least I got the game up and running.
