Has really bad controls and retrying a failed mission involves doing it all over again. It doesnt help either that the game is punishingly hard and not fair. Playing this feels like a chore all the design decisions come in the way of having fun.Many of these problems were fixed in Episodes from Liberty City, so I recommend that one instead.Also the fact that this game has a higher metascore than GTA V just goes to show how broken numbered reviews are. There is nothing better in this than V.
