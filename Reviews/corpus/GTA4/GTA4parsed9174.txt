This port is t. Even after I fixed the bug that makes the game think any GPU with  2GB of RAM is below the minimum specs, I was still met with a crappy and unstable framerate. Even when I lock it, I still get stuttering and it always winds up stabilizing below where I locked it. If I lock it at 60, I wind up playing at 50, if I lock it at 30 I wind up at 26.5.I know it will never be fixed and I wouldnt go as far as to call it unplayable. But its still some t.
