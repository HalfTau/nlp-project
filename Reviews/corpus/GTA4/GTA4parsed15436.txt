I have noticed that pretty much every negative review about this says something like I cant even start up the game because of games for windows live or When i start the game nothing happens and my only option is to shut down the game. That is a valid point for a negative review, but in the beginning of 2016 Rockstar finally fixed that problem and gta 4 is playable again. I know that it is not acceptable that they waited so long to fix such a simple problem, but they did it. The game still have problems. It is poorly optimized and you will drop below 30 fps with max graphics no matter what your specs are even though the graphics are from 2008, so not very impressive compared to what we have today. I have an gtx 1060 and i7 processor and still constantly drops below 30 fps.If you look beyond all the negatives I have just said this is an absolutely amazing game. There is sooo much to play around with in the singleplayer even outside the story. You can for example obly listen to all the different radio channels and you will be entertained.And then we have the story, the story is 2530 hours long with all kinds of missions and very difficult choices. The characters in the story are very well made, nuanced and thought out. And I pretty much like every single character  might be a slight overexaggeration, but still, there are many good characters . The story is also as the characters very nuanced and thought out. You get an really good idea of how Nikos life is and you will experience a lot of different situations, some even in some way emotional.ConclusionAs a conclusion I would say that it is absolutely worth buying this game for 19.99 now when the windows for live and all the other problems that leads to that you cant even start the game is fixed. The game is as I said earlier poorly optimized, but again, it is worth it and absolutely playable even though the situational lag.
