I purchased this game as a part of a challenge that i planned. The goal was to complete every GTA game from the first one all the way up to GTA V. The challenge was really hard because , lets bhe honets gta games dont work well on todays pcs.Gta San Andreas had some mouse and black screen problems and vice city too but this game beat them by a mile. Firstly the stupidest thing that exists is that in the year 2016 Windows Live is still needed for some games. Also the goddamn redmeption codes that need to be activated in order to ghet a real cdkey !!! Thats a complete absurd. For me the game wouldnt launch and the site given to redeem codes doesnt work. So everyone beware of buying this game.HAPPY CHRISTMAS EVERYBODY AND STAY SAFE SHOPPING !! !
