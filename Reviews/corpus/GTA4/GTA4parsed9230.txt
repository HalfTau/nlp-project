complete garbage cant even play it. Setup the gfwl and social club 2 times now. i can log in via webbrowser but not in the game for both. Big waist of time i have about 8 hours of gameplay ing with these bogus services.I have some discs for this game i bought when it was released  never played cause of the pain in thethat it still is today.This game on PC isnt a good deal for a penny. seeing as i cant sign into social club I wont spend a penny on gtaV cause Ifruit  social club login is manditory and stupid. This leads me to belive gtaV will be the same convoluted pain in theas this game.
