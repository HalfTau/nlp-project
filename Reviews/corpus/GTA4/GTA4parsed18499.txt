Driving in GTA IV is nothing like driving in real life or any video game. Its like driving an F1 car on a sheet of wet ice. I dont know how the developers played it and thought it was good. Considering this game is nearly a driving simulator it kinda brings it down. While GTA IV was important for its time and is by no means a bad game it has not aged well. I still think you should play it though.
