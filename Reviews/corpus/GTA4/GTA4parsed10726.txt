My favourite GTA was vice city, the visuals, and the story were amazing also the beaches  lol . But the amusement I had playing that when I was 12 years old doesnt come back with this GTA. It obviously has a huge map like San Andreas but soon enough I found myself doing the same exact tasks.The game is not well optimised for PC i would say  especially this version on steam has some issues with performance and stutering even though im running an i7 with 16 gigs of ram and a 4gb dedicated Graphics card.Other than fulfilling my temporary satisfaction of playing another GTA title, its not a revolutionary game like its predecessors.My overall rating 80/100
