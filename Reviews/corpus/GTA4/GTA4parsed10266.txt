This games drm is so ridiculous that I cant even have process explorer task manager open because it thinks its cheating software. I always have it open, and open it frequently to monitor system information. I can start it without it open, but if for some reason Im required to press ctrlaltdelete and open process explorer, the game crashes.Bravo Rockstar.Im only not recommending this game because theres no neutral option.Just heed my review as a warning. The drm is ridiculous and double layered. Securom AND GFWL.Why even bother.It is a genuinely enjoyable game and I know this because Ive played it on console. I only got it on pc for the mods and lo, I cant even play it and dont feel like spending an hour to get it to work. Buy it on sale for 5 dollars at your own risk. Or not at all.
