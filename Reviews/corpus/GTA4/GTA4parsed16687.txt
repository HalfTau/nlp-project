This was indeed a good GTA game. And I would recommend you playing it if you like to have hours of fun.Ive upgraded to windows 8.1 and that has made the game unable to registre my graphics card and RAM. Not allowing me to play the game at a very high resolution, together with slow loads if they load at all. Unfortunately after much trouble shooting, I am yet to find a solution. Running it in windows capability modes only allows me to run it. But still very poorly.However, the game is good, and you might not have the same issues. In case you can get it to work on a newer system had it working on win7 without any trouble. These games are deep in many aspects. Story, characters and environment is realistic but interesting.
