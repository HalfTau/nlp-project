So..Trying to start the game, Rockstar Social Club login windows popped out. I typed my mail and pass, it was not working. Okay, i clicked on the play offline button, the game has launched. When the game tried to save for the first time, the Windows Live jumped out. I signed in, it downloaded my profile. It said I have to restart the game. When I tried to logon for the second time it said it cant download the profile. So i cant really save the game. 10/10, love it
