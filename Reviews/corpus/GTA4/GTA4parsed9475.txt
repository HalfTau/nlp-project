A very enjoyable game. My favorite GTA. The introduction of Windows Live was horrible however. And linking it to the save system was nightmarish at best. I will admit I miss being able to work out like in San Andreas, and instead they replaced that annoying maintenance system with the relationship system, so I still have to take a break from binging missions because my cousin whines ALL THE GORRAM TIME. 7.5/10 It would be an 8.5 without windows live
