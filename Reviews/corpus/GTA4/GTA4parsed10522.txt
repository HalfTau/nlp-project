I bought this game in the black friday sale last year, I love open world games, especially this series, but especially since GTA V is out now, I do not recommend this game now for a few reasons,1. It is so full of bugs, I have fallen through the ground at some places while just walking around2. The textures do not load very good and glitch a lot, could be my system, but even if it is, that still means it was not coded very well3. It is a pain to mod, and even to install mods and make them work right, that was much easier on GTA SA4. Not very good cheats either, and no riot mode cheat, the riot mode is why i still play SA sometimes, i like to try and survive in the crzy areas where Grandmas are killing people with M16s and RPGsSo thats about it, If you want to play GTA, buy Episodes from Liberty city or GTA V, this one is way too buggyPS It may say I have not played this game much because I play it offline, and it dosent count those hours
