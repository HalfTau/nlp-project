It does take some extra effort to even get it running. I had to do bunch of tweaks here and there since im on Win 8 and have GPU with over 2GB of memory yes, that can be a problem for this game, but the community provided good help, and i was able to get playing the game.Overall, i dont think that the port is really that terrible. My previous experience of the game was on PS3, so the performance of the PC version compared to that was really out of this world.I even fired up the good old PS3 to do some comparisonTechnical stuff asided, i still personally think that the Grand theft auto IV is the best GTA when it comes to the story and specially the characters. The first 1/3 or maybe even the first half of the game is GTA at its finest. Sure it does lose clearly to GTAV when it comes to actual gameplay, but damn! This storyline.Bowling was quite fun too.
