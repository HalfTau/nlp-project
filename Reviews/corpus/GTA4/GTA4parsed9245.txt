I highly recommend this game! Just... not for the PC.PC problemsExtremely UnoptimizedLow Framerates up thebrGames for Windows Live requiredFull of hackers onlineIf you can look past those problems, then go right ahead and get it! If not, buy the console version.PC GoodiesMouse and Keyboard  Controller supportCan connect to Xbox Live if you care for thatModsLooks way better on PC than the console version duhIts an interesting PC version to say the least, not terrible, but sometimes didnt feel worth it. I think GTA IV is a great game, its just this game shows Rockstar doesnt care about PC gamers except GTA V.
