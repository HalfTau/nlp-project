Ok.  changing my review now that I have Game for windows POS up and running.Buy the game.  Downgrade to the previous version and install the graphic mods that are available.  Then this becomes a game worth playing  if your PC is fast.Otherwise, just play it on a game console as it isnt worth the bugs
