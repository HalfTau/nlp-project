Where do I begin?Its was a great instalment to the Grand Theft Auto series and feels like a completley different game all together, the graphics were a huge leep forward in the Grand Theft Auto games and the story line was amazing, it felt like I was in the game whilst I was playing it. The combat and driving was a big let down but you can get mods to fix that problem. Even the small parts of the game made it that little bit more enjoyable, the internet for example at TWT or some of the funny things some pederstians would say as you drove past them at 70MP/H.If anybody asked me if they should buy this masterpeice, I would say yes in a hearbeat.
