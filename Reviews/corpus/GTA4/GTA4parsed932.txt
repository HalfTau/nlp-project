NB, Yes! Well you will know how a swagger should define by him. The Story seems pretty good to me after I playeed GTA 5. I got to know after playing the IVth one that it seems much of a detailed GTA I have played. Graphics are pretty much good according to the timeline. But the Direction  the Story makes it to foucs more by making this game much more Interesting! I like the Characters, the Dialogues and The Gameplay. The Gameplay is far much better and detailed than its successor.This game surely deserves 8.5/10 rating coz I need to finish and the game  rate it the remaining points.
