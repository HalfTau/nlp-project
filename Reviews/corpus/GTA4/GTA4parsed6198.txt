Ive been playing GTA since the beginning, and Ive played GTA 4 before it was on steam, so Im sure Im well over 1000 hours on this. I have completed the story mode a dozen or more times no cheats. GTA 4 has a great story line and is replayable. Even if you dont want to do the campaign, it is fun to just roam, beat people up, and steal cars. I wish there were more games like this.
