Okay. So Im giving this a good review because of the extremely fun gameplay, and I would even suggest this over Grand Theft Auto 5. But its kinda a pain because of the ten other accounts Ive had to slave away at making, just to play and save the game?? ?But thats not all.What happened was, I played around with some modding. Got great results. Then I accidentally messed up my game. Oh well, just reinstall it, right?NOPE. Game reinstalls WITH broken files and WITHOUT missing ones?? ?Do I blame steam, or do I blame rockstar? ?So anyway, YES, you SHOULD play this game. It just gets a bit frustrating at times. Be careful with modding cause theres no solution to a broken file.
