So, i started playing this game and thought it would be something special! But all you do is the same someone tells you to go there and kill a guy and thats all. Ive played 11 hours of this and the beggining looked very promising, but then it just became a selfrepetetive t. Ive also bought Episodes from Liberty City and trust me, the DLCs are way better GTA IV itself. I have only played The Lost and The Damned at this time, and the story has a point, however in GTA IV its just a complete and utter t of a game that repeats its self in every way. I dont know if you need GTA IV to buy the DLCs but if you dont, just buy The Episodes from Liberty City.
