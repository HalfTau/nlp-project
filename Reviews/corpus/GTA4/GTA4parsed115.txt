I used to love this game, I really did, but GFWL has ruined it completely, rendering it useless and a 20 paperweight.You need GFWL to SAVE your game which is ridiculous on its own I tested it on offline mode but it just crashes before the beginning cutscene even starts.There are GFWL removers online, but I believe that most of them remove the multiplayer aspect and maybe wont work to play story mode anyway.Nice to know Rockstar cares about their older games, if you want to play this either pirate it or play on console.
