First of all, take the system specs and throw them out of the window. I was running a GTX 760 with 4GB RAM and I was getting about 25 FPS on low settings, eventhough the game recommended me to play on higher settings. When I upgraded my RAM to 12 GB, I noticed a dramatic performance increase. My guess is that due to the amount of RAM it hogs, you need at least 6 GB.Secondly, this has GFWL baked into it. Because of this, the game is incredibly hard to even start playing and I spent a day trying to get it to work. Im sure that it works fine for some people first time, but for me, no dice. Fortunately, theres a mod that completely strips GFWL out of the game.Lastly, the story line is OK. Its a bit dull. If you want to pick this game up, make sure that you get mods for it, or else youll find yourself getting bored quite quickly. If you want to get this to play a GTA game whilst waiting for V to eventually come out, dont bother. Its nowhere near as good as V and youll be much better off playing San Andreas.
