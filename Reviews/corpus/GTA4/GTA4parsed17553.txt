Fun game if you have nothing else to do/ play.Would reccomend it to someone that gets bored a lot.The story line gets boring and repatative after an hour or two and I ended up just driving round, using the cheats to spawn in cars/ guns and going on a mass killing spree.Still a very good game though!
