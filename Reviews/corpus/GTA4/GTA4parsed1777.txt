This game was the best of all Grand Theft Auto Series games for me. Completed this game few hours ago, well the ending is really sad for bouth sides, but the game and everything is just gorgeous. Even after you completed a game, you still have plenty of things to do... Withought any questions Im going to complete this game 100. Story took me to complete about 18h and there is achievement to complete the game in 20h so I did it withought playing any optional missions, but now I need to complete them till I get that sweat 100. Game is gorgeous Big wide map Best story in GTA series Best protagonist Really good charecters Much bolling  Realistic driving systemFor me Grand Theft Auto is way better the GTA5.Do I recommend this game? ShoreGame review 10/10EDIT well this game is fun, but my PC is bad so I played this game only on 30FPS xC
