I already had gta iv when it came out on ps3, I played it and enjoyed it, then I got gta v for ps3. I then wanted to mod so i bought gta v  gta iv on pc, and actually bought a pc just so that I could mod. After giving rockstar more than  160 they are still not satisfied. For being a greedy company and attacking the best modding group, Open iv, I give gta iv a bad rating.
