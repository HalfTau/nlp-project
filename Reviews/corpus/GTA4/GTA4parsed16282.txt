You would have a higher chance of getting hit by a flying pig than to make this game work. Ive spent 30 minutes trying to make this game work, doing all the compatability, and downloading the stupid Games for windows marketplace, but in the end it was all just useless. The farthest Ive actually made it was opening the game, but soon after it just crashed.My advice to you, dont buy this game, unless youre fine with getting your money stolen.
