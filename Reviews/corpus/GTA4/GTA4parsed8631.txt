In all honesty, this is the first GTA game Ive played and it was a blast. I enjoyed playing it. There is only 1 problem that put me off for this game, to active saving the game by using a micorsoft windows games account. That really put me off. Although there are mods to install, I used the mod for saving the games data.I cant wait until I play GTA 5 on PS4, no idea when Im getting it.
