Although the game is really nice and enjoyable, Rockstar made a partnership with WindowsLive, that just ruined it...You have to download 3 apps for the game to work, not only steam.The windows live game app is always NOT connecting to the internet, even tho we have it.You need have an account on steamrockstarlgfw and have them all connected and blablabla.Also, the game itself crashes in inumerous reasons.
