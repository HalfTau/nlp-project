TLDR Great game, but Just Cause 2  GTA San Andreas  GTA IV Great game with excellent visual variety an awesome sim of NYC amazing graphics car handling i think it might be a lovehate thing very poor shooting mechanics. While not different from the rest of the GTA series, a game with fire fights at the core should have better mechanics repetitive after a while drive to X, shoot shoot shoot, escape to Y lots of fluff side quests that feel tacked on just to give credence to the 100s of the gameplay hours claim
