DONT BUY THIS GAME!!! This is the worst gta game ever, and I am not talking about the gameplay. The problem is that you have to spend a lot of time just to launch the game, you have to create a rockstar account, download and register on windows live, change some program settings etc. And after all that Steam gives you a wrong CD Key, so you cant save the game while playing. So I have to say this game is truly a piece of st. STEPHEN HAWKING RUNS BETTER THAN THIS...
