Now, Im not very experienced when it comes to playing Grand Theft Auto games. I have only ever played GTA III and IV but from I have played apart from long download times and a lot of technical issues I really enjoy this game. I think im weird becasue I feel sorry whenever I run over an innocent person on the sidewalk, it must be just me. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who has played GTA before, Id probably recommed GTA III for first timers. This game includes an immersive storyline and very fun gameplay. Unfroutunetally I do not think you can get online anymore.
