Surprisingly, this is one of my favourite games on PC! This franchise needed to be ported to PC! If youre a GTA fan, this is THE GTA!Pros Funny, looks great, emersive, long game full of awesome newly discovered areas and cars etc.Cons Can get buggy, a little repetitive but thats GTA for you, I reccomend playing with an Xbox 360 controller for Windows.
