To all gamers out thereamd radeon hd 7870 2gb of vram8gb of ram 1600msi 970a g46 motherboardamd fx 6300  3.5 ghz600 watt psuStutters and doesnt look smooth on the medium settings. Crashes on the benchmark mode. Still looks terrible on high settings and stutters. I really love the game but it just wont play well. And when I say it isnt smooth I mean the graphics are worse than the console. Fix your game Rockstar or Steam. Dont buy it. I wasted 30 on this and I made the 30 on selling guns from cases. All that hard work goes to nothing.
