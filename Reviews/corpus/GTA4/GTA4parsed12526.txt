complete crap. This is not a game for pc much less a game at all. I cant even open the game because of Games for Windows Live. Why would RockStar still sell this game if it does not even open. Do not buy this game  for you will not be able to play it. Take my word for it. It used tyo work fine for me but now it is justand nothing more. I hope RockStar will fixt this game so it is at least playable. But sadley, this game is no longer being supported and will not recieve updates. So dont buy it if you think RockStar will fix it. They wont.
