Fantastic story, charismatic characters, the world that is fun to explore  I had so much fun with this game. Cannot say much about the multiplayer, did not play it that much, but the singleplayer kept me engaged for so many months.Too bad TakeTwo made R go against what R always stood for, and that is freedom of creativity.From what I know, R for years supported the modding community, and why wouldnt they, mods add new dimensions to our beloved games and prolong their lifespan.Then people who have all the control and none of the knowledge of the gaming community, the TakeTwo people, stepped in and decided to block the natural flow of gameplay in an attempt to redirect it to GTA Online, microtransactionsbased, loosely moderated and buggy to the core. They assumed that we can be forced to play what and how THEY want us to play. They think we are their fools, their mindless herd.Wouldnt you like us to be stupid, TakeTwo. Youd like that, wouldnt you?
