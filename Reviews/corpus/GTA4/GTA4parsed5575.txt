Took me 2 hours to finally made it work.Cant log in the Social Club even after reset password.Cant log in the Game for Windows Live even after reset password.Cant change any graphic option in game.I remember to play this game long ago in a friends house and it was good all around but the Social Club and the Microsoft just make it impossible to play now. Would ask to be refunded if I hadnt bought the game so long ago...Anyway, not even worth when 75 off
