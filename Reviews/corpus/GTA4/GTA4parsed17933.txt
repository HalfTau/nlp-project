Guys get this game, its really good in terms of gameplay, plot is really dark and dont compare graphics to games such as gta 5 as this was made in 2008 and the later in 2013. If you really want good graphics then get a mod for it. Over a 9/10 for me as when i got it it was a pain to start up as im on windows 8 and you have to change the pack to service pack 3 or 2 as it is made first for windows 7
