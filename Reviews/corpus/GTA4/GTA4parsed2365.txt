This game used to be great and the modding community is extremely upset that Take Two Interactive made modding across ALL their games illegal. For those who dont know, Take Two is Rockstars publisher so I wouldnt blame Rockstar for this. I bought and downloaded this game over and over again across various platforms just to mod. I can guarantee that sales will go down. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR ANY TAKE TWO/ROCKSTAR DISTRIBUTED GAME IF YOU WANT TO MOD IT. Its now illegal and you will find that modding sites were taken down too.
