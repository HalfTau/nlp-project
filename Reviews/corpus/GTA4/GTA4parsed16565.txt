Can anyone tell me how to get into GTA IV? Ive brought and installed the game and ive already created a Social Club account as it tells me to do so. But after im done creating the account and tried to enter the game it kept telling me that Social Club login failed, please try again. Ive already verify my account but no matter how many times i tried, it always tell me the same things. Please help me D
