Grand Theft Auto for the PC is a really good game, but Windows Live almost ruins it for me. First of all, if youre not connected to the internet, you cant load any of your saves, get achievements or save any progress. That is stupid because what other games do you know that run like that? I like to play GTA IV when my internet is down because I cant play mulitplay games like CounterStrike Global Offensive or Team Fortress 2, but apparently you cant resume your game if youre not connected to an internet. If you have no problems with your internet and you can handle creating a Windows Live account, there might be no problems for you. Ive heard people say that the online in GTA IV is a whole different story, but I never played the onlne forver alone c , so I cant give my opinion  about it.All of that aside, Grand Theft Auto is a really good game with a huge world for you to explore, interesting characters, good gameplay which is saying something because driving on the PC can be annoying for some games, and mulitple endings to choose from. If you can get past the almost firewall that is Windows Live, you have a really good game ahead of you.From a completionist standpoint, I dont really know. I guess its possible, but I never tried it because there is some really random things that you have to do to get 100 and I never bothered to complete them. GTA IV on the PC gets a solid 8/10.
