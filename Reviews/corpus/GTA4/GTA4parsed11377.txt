Bought this game yesterday so I could stream it with my buddies, I used to play it a little on my 360 but never got into it. So after installing numerous extraneous third party DRMs I finally got into the game and it crashes on the load screen. I havent even touched the game files at all yet, so i do what i thought i should do and verified the game files. It was still crashing so I got the help of my friend who loves the whole franchise and plays regularily on pc and he was completely dumbfounded by the constant bugs Im encountering. I decided i would google my problem and so it turns out the crash Im encountering is listed under Unkown/Unresolved Problems. FML. I try using some of the other crash fix methods  but nothing is working. Last thing I could think of was reinstalling, this game isnt exactly small so it takes a couple hours per reinstall. After about 45 reinstalls I finally get into the game, but whats this? 3045 fps on a brand new dual GTX980 rig? Seriously rockstar? Even though Im sure its not their fault for that, or maybe it is I dont know, I cant fix any of the problems Im having. Ive got 2 hours playtime while Im writing this and 1.5 of them is me trying to get the game to not crash. If you can help me with the problems Im having go ahead and let me know, but right now I just cannot recommend this game to anyone who isnt very tech savvy because Im not exactly technologically illiterate by any means, I still cant figure out what the problem is.Description of problem for those who might be able to helpGame crashes in the load screen during the slideshow approx after 2 slidesThis happens about 8090 of the timeExtremely low fps fpr someone with such a high end rigSystem specsi7 4790knot OCd2x GTX 980also not OCdASUS maximus VII hero MoBo16GB RAM240GB SSD860w Platinum PSUTLDRLots of bugs that I cant seem to fix regardless of how long I spend trying to fix them.
