If there was a neutral option I would choose that instead of recommended. Its an amazing game, but an awful PC port. On a GTX 960 I can barely reach 100 FPS on the lowest settings at 1080P. But besides the terrible PC port, if you can get it to run well, its a great game that you will definitely enjoy.
