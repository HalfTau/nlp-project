Heres the thing. Ive actually played this game for about 20 minutes. In those 20 minutes Ive found this to be the complete antithesis to the Saints Row series in that instead of fast paced overthetop comedy action mayhem with tight controls, we get a slow, clunky, melodrama with mushy, unresponsive controls. Its just plain not fun. As for the other 50 minutes I have logged, I got to enjoy the real meat of the game getting GFWL, Rockstar Social Club, and Securom to let me EVEN START THE GAME.Unless youre desperate, Id give this game a pass.
