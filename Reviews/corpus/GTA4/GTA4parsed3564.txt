game has issues no more like u read in other reviews, all problem fixed but multiplayer removed, only problem left is gpu limitation, and u can manually fix itas this game is old it has so many memories linked with it.i 1st played it in 2010 in my old pc but used pirated copy, so i bought it frm steam so i can legally have this game.game has story, tht u need in a game and gfx good as of its time when it released and feature open world with better game physics than gta 5.buy it if u r gta fan and want to knw complete story followed by later gta games,
