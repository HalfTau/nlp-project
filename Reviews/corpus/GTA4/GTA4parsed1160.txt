Basically, its a really shtty port but I could run it on max with Night Shadows off from 4060 fps on my GTX 1060. While I know many people found the story boring, I personally loved it and found it so much more interesting than Vs story. To be honest though Id pick IV over V any day because it does so much stuff better than V.
