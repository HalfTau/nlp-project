Save yourself the trouble and turn around. Click the back button, exit, minimize, whatever. The social club sign in is the worst. Why? WHY?! WHY ROCKSTAR DO YOU DO THIS TO US?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? I just want to  around in GTAIV in single player mode, but i cant even do that. Long story short,  you rockstar, I used to love you.
