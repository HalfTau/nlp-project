The story is better than GTA 5, however not that fun to play. The instalation is total garbage. Windows live and social club features are just terrible. After like a hour of trying to make it work i did, and i dont regret it.7 / 10EDIT  wanted to play again but i cant because microsoft live is cancer. almost as bad as windows phone
