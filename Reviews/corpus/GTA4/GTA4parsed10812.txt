This is a great game...... but, 4 types of DRM on one game???It is a real headache, especially as at least 2 of them are sure to cause trouble and inconvenience for you.It took me about an hour today to get GTA 4 working on a new windows install. graphics settings are locked to minimum, applied command line workaround cant log in to windows live games, created some xbox account thing then it worked then the rockstar social club login which had previously been working stopped working stuffed around with their website, confirmed my email address, changed password, still not working after some time it started working again for no apparent reason, probably just too many users sometimes when I start the game the graphics settings are messed up, sometimes ok after stuffing around with this for an hour, its working, but I dont have time to play the gameThis is unacceptable, disgraceful. This game has 4 types of DRM  Steam, Rockstar Social Club, the obsolete Windows Live Games, and SecuROM. I wouldnt mind so much, if it bloody well worked properly. We paid money for this mess, they should fix it to work properly.Im seriously discouraged from buying GTA V at this point, even though it has comparatively good reviews and only 2 types of DRM.In spite of all this trouble, I will recommend the game, since it is a great game.  Just be aware that its a pain in theto get it working.
