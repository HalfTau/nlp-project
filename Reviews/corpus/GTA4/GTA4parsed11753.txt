It blows my mind that I cant find one coherent patch to make GTA 4 steam version run on Windows 8.1 Have an Asus ROG laptop with Nvidia GeForce GTX 860M, Intel Core i74710HQ CPU 2.5Ghz. I have about 40/ browser tabs open with different/conflicting advice how to troubleshoot this game, and keep on making minute progress until reaching another error that either forbids play, crashes the game, or freezes my whole system. Rockstar makes so much money, its absolutely inexcusable that they sell such junk. I have already spent 5 hours trying to make their game playable and have decided Id have an easier time picking up a new programming language by tomorrow or hand solving a couple differential equation problems in complete darkness, than play this game tonight without handicapping the online component of the game with the  mod. Based on this experience I will not buy GTA 5, unless GTA 4 is refunded  or patched, and the future PC title is discounted at least 20 for those who couldnt get GTA 4 to work.
