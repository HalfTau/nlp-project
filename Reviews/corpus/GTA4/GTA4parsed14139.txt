Pros Multiplayer is as crazy, open and chaotic as typical GTA singleplayer. Amazing engines Physics, graphics, etc. Story and characters draw you in.Cons Many elements are awkward, or only decent, leading to frustration. Tones down GTA trademarks in favor of a more serious, and consequently less fun, atmosphere. Takes away many features.My recommendation If the idea of GTA in multiplayer at all appeals to you, get the game for that.
