honestly this is better than gta v it has a few problems but they are very easy to fix anyway i can run gta v on max with over 60 fps lol its a really bad pc port but you can try thismake a new .TXT and name it  Commandline.txt then copy and paste the following into it exactly how it isnorestrictionnomemrestrictavailablevidmem 1.1percentvidmem 100put the .txt into the main directory of GTA IV where the GTAIV.exe is foundand then run the game as normal this already should help performance a great deal on any pcim not having any problems game is runing fine for me.give this game a try it just feel like a real gta game compared gta v its just fun to mess around with npcs and the police i spend most of the time exploring and fighting people than doing missions its just impossible to do this in gta v you die a lot faster than in gtaiv and i cant kill a damn person without bieng wanted by the cops even on a damn mountain this game and i can enter a lot more buildings than in gta v. the only good thing is gta online but i never bought a grand theft auto game for multiplayer but for the singplayer anyway oh wow gta v is next gen who the hell cares how good the game looks if its worse than the last game give me a gta6 with gta iv graphics and i play it if its better than gta v and iv i dont care about the graphics my computer can handle anything gta v had a few cool features but its not enough so many things are worse than the last game no matter how big the gta v map is it just sucks when npcs are booring nothing funny or random ever happens
