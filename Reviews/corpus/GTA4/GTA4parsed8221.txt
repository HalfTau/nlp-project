This is a fun game and worth buying...maybe not for the full price but if you can get it for under 30 do it.To be honest I paid full price and havent even scratched single player yet or even a 8th of the content I just love the free roaming aspect, good graphics and hillarious physics and interactabilty. Sadly to say I have no interest in playing this game at all because it feels like I have already played it before. I will still recommend to those who are new to the series or are thinking of purchasing.3/5 stars
