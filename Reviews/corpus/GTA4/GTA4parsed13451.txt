Even though you can mostly avoid the sometimes forced dating mechanics, theyre so baked in to the story that it generally comes off sounding like a comingofage puberty fanfic.The final mission is bugged.  I had to lock my framerate at 30fps with Fraps to complete it.  What a joke.I never even got to drive a tank.But usually it was fun driving helicopters and cars and stuff anyway.P.S. Have fun dealing with windows live.
