Dont let all the negative reviews turn you off this masterpiece of a game. I played through the main story twice and never experienced a single bug. The only thing i loathe about this game is that it still runs on Games for Windows Live. If you see this game bundled with the DLC content on sale you should definitely pick it up. Oh and the soundtrack is the best out of all the GTA games.
