I bought it, wasted 1 hour of my day trying to get it to work and googleing how to make the game boot up, found a anwser. it said but the dlc key code in the game and the game code in the dlc..... after doing that still couldint make it work because of microsoft live. 100/10 dont buy on pc, get it on a console where you will actualy be able to get the game to start up
