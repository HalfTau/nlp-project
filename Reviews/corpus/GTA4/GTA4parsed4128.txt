Very good Game, just like every other GTA Game. I like the Game but Nikos voice doesnt sound like he is Serbian, it would be better if they used a Serbian guy to be voice actor for Niko, they probably have atleast one guy from Serbia in Rockstar, and i have played this game for over 170 hours with 15 FPS TrueSerb
