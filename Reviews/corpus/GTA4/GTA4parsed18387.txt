Grand Theft Auto IV did everything Grand Theft Auto III did in terms of impact.The shooting system was upgraded from San Andreas, the physics engine is realistic, and the story line is of course A grade.GTA IVs story is quite possibly my favorite out of all of the R open world games. Niko Bellic, a Serbian immigrant fresh off the boat into Liberty City attempts to live a peacful and quiet life after being in a war that left many of his friends dead. Of course, hes in Liberty City, so while attempting to live, he gets mixed up into a whole lotta The emotions and personalities of everyone you meet are absolutely amazing, and it makes the enviroment realistic as possible.The PC version is quitenow a days. R doesnt give a  to update their old games so GTA IV still uses broken Games for Windows Live DRM and essentially most mods dont work with this title update and it can cause freezing at the title screen, social club issues, and of course the classic click play, go in game, then drop right out 3 seconds later issue. All of these issues seem to be fixed if you downgrade but man what a load of schit. I cant even get the game to boot anymore. GTA IV doesnt work for me anymore, despite having a far more upgraded rig than when I wrote this review.Dont waste money on the steam port because all youll get is just headaches trying to get the damn thing to run. Instead I suggest just downloading the original launch version somewhere on the internet because you want even need to run through the DRM work arounds to get mods working on those versions.Grand Theft Auto IV, one of the best GTAs, sadly horribly broken now a days. R has turned into money jews and they dont care about their old classic products.
