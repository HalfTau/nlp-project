Heres the thing, this game is amazing but wont run on jack sht. i have a Nvidia GeForce GTX 760 yet the game runs at a slow as crawl, it also crashes when you save your game. However when the game dosent feel like shttng itself its a amazing experience with such a deep story line and slightly dated graphics.The weird sensoring is because of steams lovely sware filter
