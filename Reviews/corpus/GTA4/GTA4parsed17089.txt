I like Rockstar, really do, everything theyve ever made or at least I can think of right now but this game doesnt stand the test of time AT ALL. Personally, the gameplay is a steaming pile of I couldnt even bring myself to finish the story because it was just so unenjoyable to physically play. Saying that, I put in a fair bit of multiplayer time with friends of a similar opinion because its kind of on its own when it comes to online freeroaming. At least it was prior to things like the JC2mp which has sincerely killed this game off for me. The BOGT was much better to play if I remember correctly but IV just no.Note that I say it doesnt stand the test of time as a nod to anyone looking to buy it and its not necessarily a relative term. I had it on PS3, what, not even 18months after release? and it was still one of the worst games to actually play and remains so. This doesnt reflect the story which Ive seen others finish and know fairly well but on merit as a game to play, just no.It also likes to try overly push your PC?? I have a high end rig and sailed trough everything maxed out usually floating about 60fps but this thing just forces my GPU to crank up for a game which isnt even all that?? It plays fine but it seems to put undue load on the system. Also, Games For Windows Live wasnt great but it wasnt that bad for me Ive heard its dead and gone now anyway?? it at least worked and didnt kick me off to maybe update or for a laugh??? Im looking at you steam  Stop it.
