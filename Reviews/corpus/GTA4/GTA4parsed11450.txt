Apparently in order to use my save files I have to be signed into GFWL.In order to sign into my GFWL account I have to have internet because theres NO OFFLINE MODE.That means whenever I have no internet, I cant use my save files.This was not a problem with the 360 and PS3 versions of the game.I can go play on my 100 save file on my 360 regardless of whether I have it plugged into the internet or not.This is all because Rockstar, with their infinite wisdom, decided to use GFWL with this game.GFWL causes all kinds of other issues as well, with every single game that uses it. Its pretty much cancer in digital form and nobody should ever use it.Basically, you had ONE ING JOB ROCKSTAR! YA DUN ED IT ALL UP! GOOD JOB!UPDATE 6/18/2017Its even harder for me to recomment this game now that Rockstar and T2 have essentially killed the modding scene and have taken up a policy of no fun allowed.
