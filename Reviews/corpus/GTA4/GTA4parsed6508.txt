Got a beefy video card  Windows 10? Avoid this steam sale game like the plague.Once you manually configure the GTA4 files to actually load you will find numerous graphical errors, such as not being able to see your character or random crashes.Oh, and Rockstar wont update this, and steam support is as helpful as a heavy rock while swimming. Cheers!
