This has to be the worst GTA in their whole series after playing Vice City and San Andreas I couldnt wait for my next GTA experiance/adventure but after spending 50 on this game and playing it for a while, it is absolute crap. Ive even spent hours and hours modding the game to try to make it better but nothing could make this game better. GTA IV is my most regretted game ever bought and I get mad just seeing it in my game library because I just see a waisted 50.
