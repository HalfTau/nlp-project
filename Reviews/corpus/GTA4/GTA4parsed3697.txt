Its arguably the best GTA game ever.Its got a huge modding scene, which adds tons of replayability and customization and youre way less likely to be banned for enjoying singleplayer mods than you would be if you were playing GTA V.There is a whole bunch of ludonarrative dissonance throughout the singleplayer but if you can get over it the story can still prove to be enjoyable, though to be fair there are a handful of filler missions, nevertheless if youve enjoyed any of the other GTA singleplayer experiences I cant see why this would be the one you wouldnt like as much.When it comes to the actual gameplay itself, everything is pretty much par for the course. The graphics have aged fairly well, the colour pallet consists of mostly desaturated colours used to portray Liberty Citys griminess and from time to time you may notice that some textures arent as highres as would be ideal, but thanfully there are mods to fix all of that if that turns you off. The soundtrack is what has come to be expected of any game from the franchise, and as such consists mostly of licensed songs which you can listen to on the radio while you drive around Liberty City.. Driving around is fun, though vehicles have less traction than they did in other GTA games and the games physics are comically exaggerated, so if you are driving around on a sedan at 31 miles per hour and you happen to hit a tree get ready to see Niko Bellics best impression of a slab of beef getting thrown across a football stadium. The combat is tight, the weapons are diversified. and you can go on random killing sprees whenever it tickles your fancy. Whats not to like?On average, people take about 28hours to finish the singleplayer story mode according to 400 players polled by, and in my opinion that alone is enough to justify the 20 price tag on GTA IV, though perhaps youd like to know that when on sale this game can be bought for as little as 6 which incidentally was what I paid for it.Sadly this game uses 3rd Party DRM and as such cannot be familyshared on Steam, on the other hand, the software it uses was, in my experience, mostly nonintrusive and the Games for Windows Live bullcrap can be removed by installing this.If you notice any performance issues I urge you not to dismiss them, most can be fixed and the patches are usually really easy to find via a simple google search. I know that it should be up to the developers to make sure that their games run smootly but sadly thats not always the case, thankfully the game has been polished to a mirror like shine by modders, you might have to get your hands dirty to get it running properly, but it shouldnt be too hard. In my case I just had to remove Windows Live.Get it, try it, patch it as much as necessary, enjoy it.
