This game gets a thumbs down due to a well known issue that the game will nto run without work arounds and Valve continues to sell it and the dev refuses to fix it. Low and behold from my googling its becuase of a crap DRM. Chalk that up for another reason why DRMs suck.Thank God steam has refunds now and i though about playing the game before the 2 week window was up otherwise i would have been basically robbed of my money.Simply unacceptable to sell a game that doesnt even load. That reminds me of EAs CC classics. dont get me started on that one.Hey rockstar! Let me know when you atually fix this game and I might considering rebuying it, MIGHT is the work.So muchn for GTA 4 at 4k /
