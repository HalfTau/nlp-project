I loved this game on console and managed to pick it up when it was on sale. Unfortunately the game is just terrible. GFWL is just ing messed up on this game. Im still attempting to get this to work, mainly as there are some interesting mods Id like to try but this is just too much effort. If GTA V is ever released on PC then I hope it is not with GFWL because I just cant bewith having to fix the launch options and then having to sign in but having to update GFWL etc. Plus there is of course the fact this game seems to think I have 0 VRAM so the settings are confusing but luckily Ive managed to fix that. Still I just dont recommend this game for PC, get it for PS3 as I had a MUCH better experience with it.
