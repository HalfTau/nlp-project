Wow, cant save my game because of Windows Live. Hope youre proud of yourselves Rockstar, jipping people of their money for a game that cant be saved because of Windows Live.P.S. I also had to spend like an hour or so just to be able to fix the issue of being able to change graphic settings because the game wouldnt let me, thinking my GPU was Below recommended specifications, even though its an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770, but apparently from what I read, cards with over 2 GB of VRAM are considered Unworthy or Pathedic in the eyes of GTAIV, cause GTAIV thinks its ABOVE high end cards, which is why it wants you to play in 800x600 resolution, and graphic settings set to bare minimum.Word of Advice to All DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, EVEN IF ITS ON SALE OR BUNDLED WITH OTHER GAMES, DO NOT SUPPORT ROCKSTAR UNTIL THIS ISSUE IS FIXED WITH GTAIV doubtful because they only care about GTAV now, and could care less about IV, even though they can still do well with IV if they would frickin FIX IT, and REMOVE WINDOWS LIVE!!!EDIT I think I can understand the reasoning for this, its to prevent people from pirating the game. But does it seem right for a company as popular as Rockstar be allowed to pirate CASH, MONEY, DINERO, OUR HARD EARNED CASH from loyal customers for a game that doesnt even work be legal? I dont think so! We either get a working game, or our money back, and we want to see this game either FIXED or TAKEN DOWN OFF STEAM! STOP SELLING BROKEN GAMES!!!
