Very nice gaming mechanics. Even the detail is good. Such as when a car hits your players leg, youll fall and hit the ground. Nice physics already even for a game this old since 2007?. The Third person shooter element here is so rigid and so slow. I hate that. I would give a score of 6/10. Its an old game anyway. I like the jokes given in the game. The game detail is good you take someone to movie and you got likes . You can have date. Anyway you can also get a taxi, pay money, kill the driver, take money back  car. Can do the same to hookers and hotdog sellers.
