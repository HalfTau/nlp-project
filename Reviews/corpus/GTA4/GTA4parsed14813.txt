Been a big fan of the series since the top down days. GTA IV provides a completely immersive environment and story.The protagonist is someone you hate to like but just cant help it. The game has seen a long life on PC due to the modding community and online play. There is so much to do its hard to get bored.Beat it on 360 but wanted to give PC a go and thus far have emjoyed it all over again. Highly recommend to anyone who wants a great open world game that you will get a lot of mileage out of.
