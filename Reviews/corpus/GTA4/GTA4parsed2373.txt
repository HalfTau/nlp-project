with all of whats going on with Open IV aside, this game still go hard af. Stop giving games negative reviews just because they take the cheats away from us. Learn how to play the game the way its suppose to be played, its more fun that way. I modded GTA 5 and honestly it got super boring super fast. Its more addictive to play the way it was built believe that!
