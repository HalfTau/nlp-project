This game would have overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam right now if it wasnt for the abysmal optimization it has. Hopefully in the future Rockstar does a proper redux version for IV, this fantastic game definitely deserves one.Also, I just wanna mention how much I love the vehicle density setting in this game at 100. This option actually makes a difference in gameplay and scenery compared to GTA V where traffic density doesnt seem to make any difference when cranked to the max. Its not New York City if the traffic doesnt drive you insane.I will not be one of those people not recommending the game just because of terrible optimization. I think this game is good enough to warrant pass it and still is pretty playable in my opinion.
