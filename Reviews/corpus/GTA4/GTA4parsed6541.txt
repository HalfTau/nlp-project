Sadly wont work on Windows 10 unless you jump through hoops with installing random software from Microsoft, Rockstar and the Internet community and writing config file hacks to fool it into thinking it has all needed software and such and not guaranteed to work then either. I gave up trying after a week of failing horribly as it would load most times then hang on start up.My determination to get this working meant that I exceeded the 14 days refund period too. Thankfully only a fiver lost so no biggy.Not worth the effort unless youre running an old set up on Windows 7 or lower. If youre convinced you can get it working give up if youre failing after 12 days and get a refund.
