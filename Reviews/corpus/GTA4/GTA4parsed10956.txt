This game became unplayable. To start it in offline mode, I had to uninstall and reinstall GFWL and sign in to Rockstars Social Club, neither of which should be required for offline mode. The game thinks I dont have enough video memory and none of the launcher codes that are supposed to fix this have any effect. I will NOT be buying GTA V and I dont recommend buying ANY GTA game. I heard they are all FUBAR now.
