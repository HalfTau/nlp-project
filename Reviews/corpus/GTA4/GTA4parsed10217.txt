I loved this game right up until the final 3 minutes. The story was interesting and engaging, the voice work is excellent, and Liberty City was a very interesting place. Graphics, at this point in time, are OK.  Gameplay can be kind of cluncky, considering it is a console port. The variety of missions, characters, decisions, and side stories is impressive. My review would be all favorable except for the fact that the very final mission has a bug in it where high end graphics cards cause a glitch in your ability to climb on to a helicopter, thus causing it to be impossible to compleete the game. I now despise Rockstar Games, and will not purchase another one of their products...ever. They put a ton of effort into the console version of the game, but do a terrible job of converting over to PC.
