This is without a doubt one of the best single player games of all time, and it is even more of a certainty that it features one of the ultimate video game storylines, i mean... its GTA... The plot is so engaging, the characters instantly likeable, and the cutscenes are anything but boring.Some have mourned the loss of the arcade feel of previous games in the series, but this is stupid yes, it is a sensationally fun game. You cant have honestly played this game and not have marvelled and spent hours pushing the limits of the ridiculous physics of the game world.It runs on Ultra graphical settings with no lag or other problems. If you dont have a powerful enough P.C, as I did for a long time, dont be quick to down this game. Seriously, save for an upgrade as this game is worth it. Rockstar admittedly however made a terrible decision to integrate with Windows Live, and the unavoidable Social Club. Hopefully in time these services will improve or be phased out because at the moment they are a pointless obstacle, detracting from what is otherwise a masterpiece.I dunno what all the problems were that people were having with Games for Windows Live or Rockstar Social Club, but I didnt hit any major hurdles getting this game up and running.
