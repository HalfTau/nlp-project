First of all i want to say that the current patch 1.08 is buggy as hell so if you dont want multiplayer and want to enjoy sp and modding, downgrade to patch 1.07 or patch 1.04So than thepros1.Great and strong dark story2.Great Ai,physics3.Beautiful Graphics as a 2008 game4.This game will take 3040 hours at your first playthrough5.I love niko really a funny and cool guy6.The city is living and breathing7.Mp is alive now8.There are many cool modescons1.The optimization is bad2.Still there is bug on the final mission i have to lock the fps at 30 to get on the copper3.This game is not so enjoyable for kids because this game is too serious not so crazy like gta SA and Vice city4.Many downgrades from gta Sa like Gym,Learning new moves,Driving Planes,Country site,no casino,Not that much vehicles like gta Sa,No rpg elements like gta Sa ,not that much weapons e.t.c5.And also the boaling with roman.PStill i will recommend to buy this game beacuse it is one of the all time best game and you will definately love this ,if you dont want to play the bad optimized pc port than play it on consoles.
