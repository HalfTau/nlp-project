I regret that I have played it for nearly 50 hours, even the GTA4 is a famous game, but it should not sell on pc! Many bugs, and a disgusting shooting and driving senationand awkward controlling  Maybe a good game story ,but with many sicknesses, how could it have 90 of metascore on pc? I feel puzzled. This is only my opnion, if you do not like it, please be polite and stay calm.
