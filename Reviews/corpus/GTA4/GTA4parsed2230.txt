Came here to leave a bad review because I do not and will not own GTA 5. TakeTwo Interactive cannot seem to get it right time and time again. They attack singleplayer modders and use the excuse that people can use tools such as OpenIV to hack online which doesnt happen. Maybe they should get their asses to work and solve online hacking in code and not in the courtroom. I will never own another TakeTwo/Rockstar product ever again.
