August 24thYou cant get past ing Social Club login, so you cant play multiplayer, and if you select Play Offline for me it just crashes instantly. Rockstar just fix it.Id love to recommend it, im a big fan of the GTA series. It pains me to give a negative review.September 19thThey fixed GTA IV! You can play it again and its completely briliant!
