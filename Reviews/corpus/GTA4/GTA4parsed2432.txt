With the recent cut off of most modding in GTA V, I am no longer supporting Take Two interactive games. GTA IV was a great release, but the new update broke most mods, and forced users to backdate. Again, Take Two are trying to get people to buy the latest titles and theyre not even letting you mod the latest ones! Theyre almost as bad as EA! DONT BY TAKE TWO GAMES UNTIL MODDING IS ALLOWED!
