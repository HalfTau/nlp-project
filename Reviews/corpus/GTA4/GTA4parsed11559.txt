This has essentially become a series of reviews as problems are solved and more appear. GTA IV is known for having a pretty rocky PC port all and all. With what I originally thought to be 3 forms of DRM running through this POS port it is actually 4. 4 TYPES OF DRM ON ONE GAME ALONE! To list them off it goes SecuROM, Games For Windows Live, Rockstar Social Club, and Steam Steam is the only good form of DRM in the world though, so you know. The worst part is that the online community is essentially dead due to GTA Online and GTA V in and of itself. Today I was finally able to get SecuROM to take the code they give you when you download GTA IV to confirm it as a legal purchase. Then I was able to sign into Social Club, 3 forms of the DRM down as Steam was working fine. Then came the worst challenge of all, Games For Windows Live GFWL for short. GFWL was the worst for of DRM to pass through, it took my Xbox Live account fine but then it had me run updates for the software, restart my PC, and even delete and then add my account back onto it. Then finally, I was in. I could play GTA IV on PC after all of the time I couldnt. If you really want to deal with the DRM on this thing then just wait till on sale and snag it for 4.99. Other than that just get it on the console, at least you dont need to be online all the time on those. To wrap up I would like to cover the online aspect of the game as I am sad to see it go. It is hard to find a server with even 10 players, but if you do it is typically full of people glitching or cheating. So I give the game a 5/10 as the online feature is nearly impossible to enjoy and broken and all of the DRM.
