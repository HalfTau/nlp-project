Disclaimer I played this game just before Games For Windows Live shut down so that damaged my experience.  Also there has been a new patch added during late 2016, which helps with things like not accepting more than 2GB of VRAM.Protip Use taxis to get around when in a hurry.  Way quicker.Also lower traffic density in the settings when traffic gets annoying.  Doing this helps a lot.Original reviewAbsolutely horrible to get running.  Be prepared to put a few hours in to get it working well.After that I made the mistake of playing this for the story. For me it was an atrocious experience.If you want to play around in a city sandbox and are willing to put the time in to get it running then it is brilliant.However I would warn you away from the base game and point you to the expansions instead.  They are much less painful and come much more highly recommended.If you want a GTA game that is pure fun in solo play then Vice City is a better choice.If you want fun multiplayer go for GTA V.
