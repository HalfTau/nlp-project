A really awful game. It is simply too realistic for GTA series. GTA is not about being realistic. GTA is about being fun.The graphics looks good, but its too realistic as well. No more easygoing feeling of the 3D universe. Now its all very detailed, and at the same time as dull and boring as the real world.Vehicles are terrible to control. Just as in real life, you cant just turn at high speed, and crashing a bike will cost you a lot of health. Much less than in real world, obviously, but much more than in Vice City, not to mention San Andreas. And what does it mean? That I should drive slowly and carefully? In GTA? Are you serious?Gunfights became more realistic too. Which means that if youre in a closed room surrounded by a lot of armed guards, you have little chance of survival. Of course, you are quite tough, but the fact that everything around is dull and gray doesnt exactly help in locating the enemies and picking them off.The story is somewhat interesting, but the best thing about GTA always was that you didnt have to stick to the story. In this game, you just dont want to travel around the city between the missions just for pleasure.Ridiculous controls dont make it any better. This is the first game I have played after Doom II that doesnt even have the always run option.If youre a big fan of goodlooking games, then maybe it is for you. But its about the only good thing about it. Oh, wait, its that plus the fact that NPCs signal their turns but dont signal lane changes.
