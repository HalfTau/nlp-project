Hes not cute, hes not really funny, his cab service sucks and women wont bang him. Yet he is your cousin.But theres more to GTA IV than Roman.Whether its just the nostalgia of the late 2000s, or the undeniable fact about it being the most revolutionary game of all time in its genre in terms of physics and graphics, and the plotting of multiple characters stories in one city.Or its infamously bad porting to PC which has been fixed last year for the younger ones since I think Im old as The so lovable city of Liberty and its stories within, its Serbian main characters character haha make you want to play again. and the GFW broken service makes you think twice about that yeah I still play that99100
