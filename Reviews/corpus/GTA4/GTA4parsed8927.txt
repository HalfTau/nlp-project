Unplayable if you dont have an archaic pile of crap computer. I have a GTX 970, a i6600 skylake 6th gen intel cpu. Windows 7 x64 and 32gb of ddr4 ram and i cant play on anything but the lowest settings. The work arounds to enable higher graphics are not working with my setup. Im not sure how/why steam would even sell this to people... Could not be more disappointed
