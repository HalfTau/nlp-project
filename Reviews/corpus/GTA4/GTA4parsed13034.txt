I dont know why or how to fix this..this game is not worth the time to try to fix on a windows 8.1..but i got the game on a sale and it doesnt work at all..so many problems to fix and still cant play the god dam game..first there was the social club error..fixed that..now there was another problem with the xlive.dll..fixed that..then theres the seculauncher failed to start thing..and i tried the steps to fix that and still says the same thing...dont recommend this game if you have these problems on start up..its good on the xbox or playstation though...
