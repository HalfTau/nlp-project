This game for some reason is not compatible with Windows 8.1, that is fine considering the fact that there is compatability troubleshoots. Unfortunatly, I am not a techy and required some assistance. So! being the good customer I am I reach out to steam for help, this is the first mistake. THEIR SUPPORT SUCKS I recieved no answer. So, I contact rockstar games thinking oh! this is great I might be able to get some help here for this issue. It shouldnt take long because its not that big of a deal I just dont know how to do it. 7 days later I dont have any assistance. Rediculously frustrated.
