The base game itself is ok if you play on a consolehowever, the pc version of this game makes Superman 64 look like a next gen game...the game doesnt let me change the graphics at all when i FINALLY got out of a black title screenWhen i finally started the game i realised that the buildings were missing, cars were floating off the ground AND CUTSCENES WOULDNT EVEN PLAY!Now dont get me wrong, i love GTA but i recommend you dont waste your hard earned cash and make the same mistake as me and purchasing the game on the PC For anyone else who did, im sorry.
