DO NOT BUY!!!!!! This game is unplayable in its current state. I have tried all of the so called workarounds such as modifying the launch options and unistalling Windows Live and installing the newest version. None have worked and has prevented me from playing. Until Rockstar releases a patch, AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS, its not worth your hard earned money. You would be better off playing GTA III, at least that will run.
