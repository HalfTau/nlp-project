Grand Theft Auto IV was a good game but if you havent purchased it already I would strongly advise not to do so now.The game uses GFWL Games for Windows Live DRM, which is due to be shutdown completely in June 2014. Any games or products that make use of it will no longer be able to function. Before being able to even play many GFWL games you have to sign into GFWL. How do you expect to do that once Microsoft have shut off all their GFWL authentication servers?Some developers have been actively migrating their games to not use GFWL, the recent Batman Arkham games, and Street Fighter Arcade Edition are a couple of examples. However Rockstar have no plans to do so with GTA IV.
