Worst experience.I have not even started the game.Point is, that when you finally get all the crap done, browsing forums for how to fix the game etc. then you are so fed up and no longer in the mood to play this game. Why one earth would anyone want to buy a game you need to fix before you can play it??So many things wrong before you get to the game.1. It doesnt work out of the box / out of steam. You literally need to fix some sht before youre able to play.2. It gives tips, like you need to log in to some online account to be able to save game and the tip comes when you already start the game, why not before? Idiotic.3. Why would you need to be online to save game progress? I dont need and I dont want to make any account for to play any game. Its likeWasted money.
