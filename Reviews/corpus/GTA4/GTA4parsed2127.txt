Yes, great storyWorth your time?YesMoney?NoI personally think 20 is overpriced just wait for a sale or something.Just a simple big open world city New York to explore with hidden weapon, collectibles for 100 game etc.The gameplay is challenging and intense gun fights. The driving is set with a realistic vehicle handling.Tbh the graphics is good for being 2008 but comparing with gta v 2015 Pc Version graphics these graphics is kinda depressing and dark sometimes.Audio is high quality and the soundtracks in game is great. But sometime for me when you get a call from someone it bruses then it stops. But maybe thats only meThe story is great even today.The game runs a little bit weird, the graphics are set to high.Sometime the frames drop from 60 fps to 50 fps.Specs16gb ramGTX 1070I56500The internet cafe for missions or side jobs.The worst nightmare of them all GFWL Games For Windows Live You need to make a GFWL account to play this game with is a pain in the a.A great gta story you must try8.3/10
