Well, this is disappointing. Apparently, Microsoft and Rockstar punish people who pay for their crappy games andservice. Imoff. After creating MULTIPLE accounts on both Social Club and Windows Live I STILL cannot access online play. Social Club constantly fails to login even after typing in the correct credentials and the Games for Windows Live doesnt even connect. This could possibly be an issue with portforwarding yes, but it takes me hours to figure out how to properly portforward on my computer and why waste my time doing that when there are plenty of other BETTER multiplayer games out there that DONT require it at all? Simply put, Grand Theft Auto IV has failed miserably and I WILL NEVER buy a game from Microsoft or Rockstar again. TO ANYONE WHO HAS ISSUES WITH PORTFORWARDING DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! They will practically steal your money. Plus, the fact you have to even have multiple accounts just to play the game in the first place is absolutely ridiculous.
