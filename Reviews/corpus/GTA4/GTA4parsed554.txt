played for a while and LOVED it, had trouble getting the ding dang thing to start initially and spend an hour or two on that. Couldnt remove the steam key code popup without the game freezing whenever i accessed the steam menu that was my initial problem, the freezing at launch uhh removed the popup without knowing that the popup was my only saving grace. Now the game will briefly run the title credits if the press shift  tab popup comes up, when it leaves, the games soul leaves as well. Cant/dont know how to get that constant key code popup back. Game doesnt run. This is hell.DO NOT BUY ON STEAM if you can get it on console, please do that, otherwise...maybe it will run?
