I played this game for a little bit and my first impressions is that, while fun, the game treats you like a pirate. In order to get it working on Windows 8 you have to jump through extra loops in trying to get GFWL to run. This game has 4 layers of DRM. First, Steam. Then SecuROM, Rockstar Social Club then GFWL. It took about a half hour just for me to get this to work right.
