I bought this game before 2 years on sale i and i didnt like it at all. I started it and i was disappointed with driving and i deleted the game instantly. After 2 years i gave it chance,  driving skills lets see the gameplay and the story. And man, the story is unbealivable, 2nd best story of GTA series only not better than San Andreas. I recommend this game to all if you didnt played it.
