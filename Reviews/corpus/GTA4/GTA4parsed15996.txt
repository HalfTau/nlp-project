DONT BUY THIS NOW!! !Since the Gamespy servers which ran the SocialClub were shut down, GTA IV doesnt work, but instead of it being either fixed or taken off the store, it remains. And SecuROM  As you cannot connect to the socialclub, doesnt let the game start. This means that you cannot play the game. I have tryed all kinds of fixes but none work for me, it can someone else but not some, it isnt worth the risk at the price. I cannot wait for the Steam returns policy that has been rumored to be implemented because I would return theout of this. Which is a crying shame because I played this game on console on release and it was perfect and I wanted a similar experience on PC but to no avail. you SecuROM,  you GFWL and most of all,  you Steam for keeping a possibly faulty product on the store!
