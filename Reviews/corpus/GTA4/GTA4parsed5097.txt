FIX . THE . FKNG . LOG IN . IN . SOCIAL. CLUB.Seriously, how hard can it be? GTA V is out in a bit, cant you fix a simple thing like this? The only way you can play is to spam the play button with the correct info for an hour and renaming a file in gta IV folder so it wont ask for your log in again, this if you can log in after an hour of spamming.I seriously think im going to give up playing this just because of the log in, i just cant run it because i cant go past the social club log in.
