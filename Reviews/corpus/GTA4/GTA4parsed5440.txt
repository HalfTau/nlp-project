My favourite gta game, love the story and the dark atmosphere, love the characters. This gta is less america and is more serious, multiplayer wasnt too bad, yeah it isnt like gta v but for 2008 its alright. Can be buggy from time to time, isnt worth buying in 2016 if you want to play multiplayer, nobody plays it, save money and buy gta v. If you prefer singleplayer go for this one.
