I wouldnt recommend this game mostly because I have Windows 8 and I cant play, unless I reinstall Windows and get the older version of C so that I can play this game. I dont exactly have time for this stuff. GTA IV wont give me option to play and when I play offline it gives me it gives me SecuLauncher failed to star application 2000 so this is proof that I must get an older version of C.
