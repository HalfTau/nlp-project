Just a word of warning first. If you have a graphics card with more than 2GB of VRAM like myself, you need to do some research first in order to get the best possible graphics possible. For some reason, the game caps at 2GB VRAM and if it detects you have more, than it actually thinks you have a incapable GPU and gives you incredibly poor settings. A simple fix and everything was up and running!This game had a few quirks that needed to be fixed, such as having to reduce the framerate to finish the final mission, but overall, this game was worth every single penny that I paid for it! I got this game on sale a few weeks back when the GTA Complete Pack was 10, and I can say that this game is worth more than the 10 asking price for 5 GTA games!I played GTA V before IV, but I have to say that the experience and story with IV was just as good as V.  There are more NPCs in IV and you get to play as an Eastern immigrant. Combat sometimes is a bit odd, such as aiming around a corner, but it wasnt completely terrible. Getting away from the cops in this game is extremely easy compared to V.There are also a bunch of mods you can get for this game that can really pretty it up!If you havent played this game yet and are a fan of the GTA series, what are you waiting for! ?
