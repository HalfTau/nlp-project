Grand Theft Auto IV is a game that you simply have to play. GTA has very realistic gameplay, situations, accidents  I think that physics is really well done. Open world is fantastic! In this game you have hours to try spectacular crashes, looking for hidden easter eggs and finally when you finish the game you can buy DLC and try to blow up other things Of course there are full of violence, sex and drugs... This game is not for kids! Anyway, I recommend this game.
