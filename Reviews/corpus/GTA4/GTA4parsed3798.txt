I actually liked this game more than GTA V.  I played and beat GTA 1, 2, 3, Vice City, San Andreas, then GTA V before I played this one.I see most of the Socal inspired games as more wacky and weird but the Liberty City games are more gritty.The only downside that I see to this game is that it doesnt support steam achievements.Otherwise, gorgeous game, very fun to play.
