Bought it like 2 years ago. Had no Windows, had to play on Linux with wine. Tried, it was freezeing too much. Friend said the game is really unoptimized. Deleted.No I have Skylake CPU with GTX 970 graphics, have Windows 10 installed, wanted to try the game. But it runs only 800x600. Cant change resolution any graphics settings because you run the game on low end hardware. Very funny.And it requires Windows Live which is dead, had to place patched xlive.dll for the game to even start.Dont buy this
