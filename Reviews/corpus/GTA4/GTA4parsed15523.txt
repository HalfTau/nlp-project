Kickgame as anyone will tell you. BUT.. DO NOT... Rely on Steam or GFWL to update it for you. You WILL get memory leaks and the game will be unplayable without manually downloading the patches. Not a big deal... But its a pretty big up in this day and age. See a lot of people online with the same problems I had. Took me a day to figure out the thing didnt patch itself.
