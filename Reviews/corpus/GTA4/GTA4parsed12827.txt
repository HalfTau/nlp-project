This is probably one of the worse PC ports Ive seen. Even on modern, highend systems, the game refuses to run at 60 fps. On top of that, this game requires GFWL, which ruins it. If you do pick this up, get the complete edition because Ballad of Gay Tony is the only part of it thats worth playing. Unless you want to do some modding, I would recommend getting this on consoles instead.
