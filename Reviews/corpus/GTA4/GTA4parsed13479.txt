Do not buy this peice of garbage unless you take pleasure in having to download a 15 gig game only to have to have it not work at all.FIrst i download it, it crashes on startup.I fix the startup crashes, it crashes randomly in game.I fix the random crashing in game, then i go to try and save my progress.Games for windows live wont recognize that i redeemed the product code to my self a year ago and wont let my sign into the account that has the product code.Id also like to point out that when i played this game a year ago it did the same stuff along with just not rendering anything but my playermodel.
