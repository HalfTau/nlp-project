One of the worst PC ports ever. Still struggle to get this game to run at an acceptable framerate 3040fps on a GTX 970? Ok GTA 4 tested it a few months ago. Did have it working somewhat decently on older hardware at the time hence the 50 hours of playtime. Had the game heavily modded all cars were replaced with real life counterparts, used ICE enhancer, etc. Great game otherwise but severely overshadowed by the recently released GTA 5. Just buy that instead. GTA 4 isnt even really compatible with newer hardware anyways on PC unless you download some stuff off the web to fix it. Youre actually better off playing this game on a console instead purely for stability reasons. The mods do really make this a ton of fun on PC though, though I still cant recommend the game to anyone in its current state.Overall this is an 8/10, but on PC its a 4/10. Would mod cars like crazy again but on GTA 5.
