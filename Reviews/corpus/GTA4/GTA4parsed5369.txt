Lets jump right on it!Is the game good? Yes, absolutely. Rich story, great voice acting, good graphics and gameplay.Should I recommend it? No.Why? Games for Window Live.I saw the negative reviews all pointing that they couldnt play online, frequent crashes, black screens and all thanks to the multiple DRM that this games has. I though, well it probably isnt that bad. Wrong. Its was worse than that.There are some guides in the steam forums that try to fix this issues but they are all a gamble, maybe it works for a little bit or not at all. What I really hate about this that there is no official support and they keep pushing the sales like its nothing happening in the back. Bad move RockStar. BAD.Long story short, after massive reading and trying all I could it wasnt enough to run the game properly. And OMG you even need GFWL to save your game locally. Wow!Anyway, stay away or be ready to crack your head in the forums worldwide to be able to run the game properly.
