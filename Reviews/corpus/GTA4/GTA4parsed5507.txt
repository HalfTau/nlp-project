Good Evening Im Brian Williams, This game is great if you enjoy bowling. No, on a serious note, the negative reviews on this game are for the most part not about the game, but rather optimization. The game is TERRIBLY optimized for PC. I can usually play for about an hour MAX without the game crashing this time seems to decrease if you have mods installed. So overall, if you are planning on buying this game for the story only and dont plan on using mods, then I would suggest you just buy it on the 360 or PS3 so you wont have to deal with the game crashing. Obviously if you no longer have one of those then just buy it for PC. However if you plan on using pretty ENBs and mods like LCPDFR, then buy it on PC.I hope this review helped you. I recommend this game only because I like the story.
