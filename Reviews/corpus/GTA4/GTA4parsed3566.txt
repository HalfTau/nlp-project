I r8 8/8 m8I personally loved this game, more so because of the openworld design I never really paid attention to the story PYou play as Niko Automatic Badass From The GetGo Bellic, who keeps whining about how hes not Russian for some reason.Join up with your cousin, Roman Why Are Fat Guys From Europe Stupid Bellic, who says he doesnt gamble anymore, yet he still does.Go on the adventure of a lifetime working as a hitman for people you just met a little less than an hour ago.Listen to the same, generic radio talk shows that  about how ed up Murica really is.Shoot, kill, sell, and bribe your way to victory and ahem TO DA TOP!Overall, I kind of found the recent Grand Theft Auto games a bit overrated. The tone in the story is as always very weak. However, the openworld design is amazing.I rate it at 7/10. Its pretty okay.
