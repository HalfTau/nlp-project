Before playing the GTA IV series, I considered Vice City to be the best GTA ever made. Sure San Andreas offered nicer features including most notably the ability to not DROWN but Vice City was still more fun. GTA IV refined the series in a big way, offering a variety of game modes, a cover system and realistic shooting. Even though the game is not as funny as the previous titles, the gritty nature added a new level of intensity never seen before in traditional sandbox games.The expansions were pretty impressive as well especially the ballad of gay tony, and the inclusion of multiplayer added a nice new touch, even though I dont play it as much.All in all, this is a nice addition to the series and I pray the fifth game comes out soon!9.75/10 GTA IV9.5/10 The Lost and the damned10/10 the ballad of gay tony
