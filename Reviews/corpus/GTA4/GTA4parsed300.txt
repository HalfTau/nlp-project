MY RATING 7.5/10Things to rememberGTA IV has a lot of problems. Rockstar Games doesnt seem to care about that. You just cant fix them all but you could definetely make the game playable in the best possible manner.This game works absolutely fine on Windows 10, 8.1 and 8 but it just isnt optimized for modern PCs. Id recommend to play this game on Windows XP Sp3 or Windows Vista compability mode from properties of GTAIV executable Launcher.exeGame For Windows Live client needs to be manually installed from xbox site.If you dont want to play multiplayer or dont want Game For Windows Live then simply install xlliveleess dll censored by Steam files on the game directory folder.The Steam default version of the game which is the latest version of GTAIV 1.0.8.0 released in December 2016 does not support any kinds of MODs so please dont install any MOD without downgrading your game or it will probably break your game and mess up with your game files.Always create a backup copy for safety. If you want to run MODS in GTAIV then you must downgrade and install patch 1.0.4.0 for best performance that was released in 2008. Some MODS also work on 1.0.7.0 that was released in 2010. Patches are to be manually installed from Rockstar Games official website search on webCheck out community guides for bug fixes, patches, xlivless tool to disable GFWL. Check out awesome mods on YouTube.I hold no credit to any of the fixes mentioned above and hold no guarantee that this would workfor everyone. It just works 95 times. These are just optional downloads.Please do not download or install anything if you dont know what you are doing or dont trust me or the respected authors of softwares because aside from patches everything is made up by the community and fans.Game ON!ProsAmazing StoryStory set in a modern world 2008Improved game mechanics from previous entriesLarge Open WorldClip captureMultiplayer is still active despite a 10 year old gameHD GraphicsAwesome MOD supportFun to play minigamesNo inapp purchasesWorks on a potatoThe Complete Edition is a value for money deal during sales.ConsGames for Windows Live client needed to install fromMicrosoft Account needed in order to play onlineRiddled with bugsTons of performance issues on modern PCsLack of any support from Rockstar Games, Take Two InteractiveNo singleplayer coop modeNo flyable jet planes Feel free to inbox me if there is any error or want help
