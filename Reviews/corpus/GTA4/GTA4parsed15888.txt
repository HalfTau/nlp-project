8/10This game does not dissapoint the series. The storyline is better than previous games and a bit more of a character depth aspect. Like the other games, this ones soryline is a long one. multple hours will go into this just in one playthough. Although the random shooting sprees or running from the cops are fun too. The worst part about this game is the driving. The driving sucks. The way your car handles it is like the ground is wet ALL THE TIME! you slide easily even at lower speeds. Previous games had better driving mechanics. But with that aside it can be overcame. Still a great game to mess around in.
