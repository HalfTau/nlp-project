This game will NOT let you play unless you sign into there stupid SOCIAL CLUB. That is fine I guess. except for the fact that everytime you try to login IT FAILS EVERYTIME. The game is broken and wont let you play unless you go into the files and manually change things and this will not let you play online. only single player. Steam should not be letting rockstar post games that straight up dont work becasue they are too lazy making DLC for gta 5 to fix this issue. Do not give rockstar money for this game until it allows you to login and play everytime. You will never find a comapny with more scum and villainy.
