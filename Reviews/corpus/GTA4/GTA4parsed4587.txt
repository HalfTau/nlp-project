This was the game that sparked my interest in the gta series. I didnt get it until over 5 years after the fact of it being popular, but I believe it is just that that made me love this game and continue to play it.I must first say to those that complain and unrecommend this game just because it takes some work to get it to launch, shame on you. To those that are interested in looking up a quick guide and adding a few files to the directory, youre not making a mistake trying out this game.The story is indeed the best ive ever followed in my experience and will definately bring a tear to your eyes at times as it is just that good.The game itself, for the year it came out, runs fairly well other than that it requires some beefy hardware for as old as it is. So what the hell are you waiting for? Go buy this damn good game right now! You will be sorry if you dont witness the best GTA ever.
