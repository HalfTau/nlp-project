The games great, but Ive had a lot of trouble trying to play it. It really saps the fun out of the game when youre told you cant sign in because either youre missing an internet connection which Im not or the live service isnt working. At that point you cant physically exit the game and you have to restart the computer.The game is a lot of fun though, shame about the PC/steam side of it.
