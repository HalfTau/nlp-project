i have some very found memeorys of this game from when i was younger and playing this on my brothers x box....i thought it would be fun to re vist the game no that im older and play on pc. boy was i happy when it was on sale this steam summer sale. shame the game wont launch and rockstar supports response to what appears to be an issue with a few people is we are looking into it. the game fails to launch because you have to sign into rockstars social club which will say failed to sign into social club weather you use the right email and password or not, i have cheaked and even used 2 other accounts to sign in which work on the website. this game is currently a waste of time and money if you want to buy it wait and see if rockstar at least attempt to fix this.
