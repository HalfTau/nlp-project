Would be great if I could actually play the dlc that I paid money for. Now that the title screen where you selected what you wanted to play TLAD/ TBOGT/ or vanilla GTA IV has been removed I cant launch it. I can launch GTA IV but not the dlc. Dont waste your money just download a pirated version.  You Rockstar!
