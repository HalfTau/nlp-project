In my opinion this game manages to give you lots of unique and thoroughly thought missions. The fun part does not end with the missions as you can always free roam in single player or join a multiplayer match and wreak havoc in your way.Even though its expansions are a separate thing I cannot help myself and advice you to buy them as well. They add many cool missions and the most important aspect is that they intermingle with Nikos story.I can only conclude by saying that Rockstar did an awesome job, as usual for a company so big. Hearing that they have ideas for 45 year to go I can only hope living to see GTA 20 years from now.
