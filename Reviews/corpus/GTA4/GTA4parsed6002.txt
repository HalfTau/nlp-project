The previous time I played this game I had a wrong mistake on reviewing this game. Now I have to review it again1. Social Club, Game for Window Live login failed, Graphic stuck at 800x600, Quality can not render fast, resources Usage low althougt our Video card 2000MB. All that problem now can be fixed in GTA IV Community Guide . Please have a look if you own this game2. When I fixed all problem above I had a very great time playing on this game.3.
