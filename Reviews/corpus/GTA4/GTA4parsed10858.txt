GTA IV  is a good game, nice setting, great open world, nice characters and a overall great game. But do not buy this game on the PC AND NO EXCUSES. Thanks to Microsoft wanting more money, you have to ing sign with a Windows LIve ID to save your game. And when you finally get to the game after wastful hours of creating accounts and changing passwords you get to the game which is a glitchy piece ofthat breaks down after awhile, and after I turned off the game, my progess didnt ing save bringing back to the start. DONT BUY THIS HORSEbr3/10
