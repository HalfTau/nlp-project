Great story and amazing character development. What makes this game different compared to other GTA games is that it is pretty linear for an open world game after finishing the main story I felt I was done, doing side missions or just messing around in Liberty City didnt appeal to me as much as experiencing the main storyline but thats exactly what allows this game stand out so much compared to other GTAs.Also for a 2008 game the graphics still look great plus it has tons of mods which can improve or even entirely change the experience.
