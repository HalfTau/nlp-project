tldr This game is a hit or miss. YMMV.Probably not the best game in the GTA series, but certainly one of the worst PC Ports in existence. Only buy if you have a highend PC. For me, with a FX8350 and MSI R9 280x 3GB, my game barely managed to keep a steady 60 FPS on max w/o mods. Stuttering seems to be a huge issue with this game.Game includes Games for Windows Live, most of the time for me, it works and updates by itself but sometimes it doesnt, so YMMV.Changing settings seem a big pain for me, sometimes the bar doesnt move so Im stuck with 640x480 or sometimes the bar moves, but the max it goes it 800x600.Have an iGPU with shared VRAM? Do not get this. Ive had problems with my laptop on this game where it only detected the dedicated VRAM and didnt include shared and doesnt use it without setting an option on startup, I think it was norestrictions or something like that so it included my RAM.Anyways I have no comment with the story and havent even really gotten deep into it even though I have 20 hours in my account because its boring. I usually just blow up stuff and kill people because its better than the story. Get Grand Theft Auto V instead.
