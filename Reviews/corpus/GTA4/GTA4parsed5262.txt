I bought this game with a grand theft auto pack deal, months ago and I just recently tried playing it and it will not let me launch. it keeps asking fo me to make and sign in on a social Club account which i have done repeatedly and have reset the password mulitple times to make sure there were no typeos. I do not want a refund for the game i just want the chance to play it. Please if anyone has a solution for me Id really appreciate it!
