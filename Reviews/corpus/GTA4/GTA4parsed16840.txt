I tell you what.  GTA IV is a good game, but just that.TLDR If you love GTA get it.  If you want a good game that combines driving, shooting and sex, wait for GTA V.Yay Awesome storyline Characters feel personal Plenty of modsNay Little character customisation  clothes, etc Money has little value. 1 hotdog  a few guns  500 armour is all you need. Small map  little to explore Driving dynamics are heavy, slow and somewhat lacking Shooting mechanics are clunky and the target lock is sometimes confusing Constant, annoying requests by friends to hang out Games for Windows LIVE is Kate wont have sex with you, and is a boring character.GTA IV was a leap for Rockstar graphically.  It brought the franchise into the HD era.  The story was beautifully done, but thats about where the good ends.  A cars that handle like boats and a small map mean exploring the world is not much fun.  Shooting  a core element of the GTA series  is slow and the target lock isnt as effective.  A common GTA trait still shows through  selecting weapons.  Scrolling through a list is ineffective and can often ultimately lead to your death.Games for Windows Live doesnt help either.  Its a major annoyance.Also, multiplayer is boring and lacking.  People are either antisocial by not interacting, or socio/psychopathic who wish to end the lives of all other players.Instead of buying GTA IV now, wait a few months until Rockstar release GTA V for PC.SPOILER At the end, you can either make a deal which ends with Romans death or take revenge resulting in Kates death.  Choose the latter.  Kate is a boring character who does nothing with you.  Roman at least has charm.
