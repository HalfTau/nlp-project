Yep pretty The game runs after installing windows game thing so dont waste your time with the Social Club. I run a laptop more than capable of running this game and yet im waiting a bajillion years for the textures to load. Sort of ruins the whole environment.Past the point of refund so whatevs, just dont buy it.
