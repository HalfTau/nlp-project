The game itself is  prone to frame rate drops, but on a sufficiently powerful computer, the drops are not that noticeable. Im running a 7700k and a gtx 1070, and the game stumbles on the highest settings. I just have everything set to high with the shadows on medium. Those graphical settings allow the game to maintain 60fps most of the time. Not recommended for weaker computers! The experience is much better than the Xbox 360 version on a powerful computer. The story and the gameplay are captivating and deep. Id really recommend it on newer hardware though.
