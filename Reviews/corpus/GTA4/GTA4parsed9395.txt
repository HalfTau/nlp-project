Kind of almost decent game, HORRIBLE support. Doesnt work without downloads and workarounds and doesnt even have the common courtesy to tell you that certain servers are down and the game cant be played, leaving you to spend a good half hour or so trying to figure out why its not loading up.Somebody in an earlier comment said that the negative reviews are from people who dont know how to fix the game  we shouldnt have to fix a game weve just downloaded and we shouldnt have to be relying on a vague review hidden on the store page to do it.
