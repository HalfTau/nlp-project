The game itself is great, but the port is so horrid I would say it even beats WatchDogs in terms of how horrible a port is. Took me an hour just to get the game to launch, 20 minutes to set up a Social Club account, and another hour to sort through the Games for Windows Live trainwreck.I pray to GabeN that Rockstar will learn their lesson and do a much better job with the GTA V port.
