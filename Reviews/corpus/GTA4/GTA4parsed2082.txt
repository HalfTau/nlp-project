You cant save without windows live.Sign in with old profile.After playing 8 hours LIVE stops working.Turns out that I cant even load previous savegames without connection.Around dozen restarts and a reinstall later connection still unavailable.Thanks a lot rockstar, at least I can keep driving Roman to his crib and repeat the first couple missions anytime.Now a pround owner of groundhog day  the game.Would not recommend.
