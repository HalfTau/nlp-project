I played lots of this game back in the days when it came out i remember on my old steam profile i rocked this game more than 34 times and went over and over the story just to see if i can find something new... Uhh i miss those days.. However is it worth it? YEAH it is if you ever played any GTA than you know what you are getting into its a classic GTA story with more realism than usual cause peeps in those days were complaining wanting more realistic GTA and they got it and than they complained that its a bad game and it was too realistic and stuff like that which means they didnt knew what they wanted now i see many people who claim that GTA IV is even better than GTA V cause it was more lifelike compared into the story and physics. I cant wait to get this Complete Edition soon when my paycheck arrives! 3
