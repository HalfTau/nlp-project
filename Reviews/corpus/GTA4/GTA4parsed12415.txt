Pretty good game, but ruined by bad optimisation. I usually hold around 5090FPS in game, and 120300 during cutscenes depending which one. This is with a Pentium G3258, which is at 4.6GHz and an MSI TwinFrozr V GTX 970 not yet overclocked. My graphics card has 4GB VRAM, so when I first booted up the game it was in 640x480. I chanegd to 1080p, but I couldnt change any settings. After research, I found that 4GB cards arent natively supported, as the game only detects up to 3GB. This can be fixed with the following command going in the launch options without quotation marks nomemrestrict norestrictions, but is an annoyance.TLDR Good game, but the PC port isnt amazing, but very playable.
