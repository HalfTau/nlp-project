This game is a mess, honestly.The port itself is bad. Ive seen people with decent computers having a bad time with the FPS in this game, not to mention the AWFUL Games for Windows LIVE thing. Youre not even allowed to LOAD A SAVE without logging into that st, and of course, it is broken as well.The gameplay is slow and annoying, sometimes the character goes in the opposite direction to the one you intended. In bug events, the exaggerated ragdoll ruins your gameplay. Ive experienced crashes using mods, that aint Rockstars fault, but when the game started to crash EVEN without mods and after clean installs... Welp, I cant do anything about that. I was barely able to play Episodes from Liberty City because the simple action of driving a car would result in a CTD.The story is far from interesting, theres no way to really care about any of the characters and the police reaction to any crimes is simply bad, they show up almost immediately for a game that tried so hard to be REALISTIC, and they shoot to kill even when youre unarmed.Im glad I bought this on a sale, because Im tired of dealing with a bad port filled with DRMs and that Windows Live crp. I requested a refund for the first time, and even doubting Valve will accept it, I know Im never going to play this again.
