The game is sort of a mixed bag. On one hand, its great in terms of gameplay and story. But the PC port is just terrible. Firstly, its using Games for Windows Live still, and theres a ton of problems with that. Its not that well optimized for PC either. I found it best to set most things to low/off, textures on high, and shadows definetly off, the game ran better. You will need a few tweaks to be able to run this properly at least on Windows 7. I hope they release a patch.
