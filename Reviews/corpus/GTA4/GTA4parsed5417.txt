When an item goes on sale I would expect it to at least start after installing. After following some community guides to get this to run I am now the proud owner of IE11 and games for windows on my fresh new win10 installation.And is it too much to ask to support a GPU with more than 2G memory?I loved this game on PS3. Requesting a refund for this one.
