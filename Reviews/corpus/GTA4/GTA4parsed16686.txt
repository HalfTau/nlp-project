Another crappy DRM that prevents the game from running at all.With the Social Club not working at all here comes the first slap in the face  apparently no episodes of liberty city, yay!Well, beyond that the regular one starts and stalls after prompting to sign in with a GFWL enabled profile which is supposedly optional, yet it just idles doing nothing after refusing to do so.Well, thanks for slapping your customer straight in the face, Im lovin it!
