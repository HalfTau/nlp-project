Why is this still on sale? Ive endlessly checked forums to make the product key work, so now I cant save without it. It doesnt help that Games for Windows Live has been shut down because the online gameplay was based around it. When I did get it working, 16 GB or DDR3 RAM, Nvidia GTX 950m and a quad core i7 could only make it run on low at 800x600. GTA V can run better! If there is a way to get a refund, someone tell me.
