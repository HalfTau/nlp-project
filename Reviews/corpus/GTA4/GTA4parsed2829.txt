Take two interactive, the publisher behind Rockstar Games, DMCAd a modding tool called OpenIV that has been used to mod the GTA series for 10 years.Naturally, their reasoning behind it had nothing to do with GTA IV and everything to do with their sharkcard microtransaction cash grab that is the online component of GTA V. An online component that the singleplayer only modding tool OpenIV has absolutely no impact on. It would even crash should you try to connect to GTA Online with OpenIV active. But in their greed, Take two have taken down the modding tool used across ALL GTA games, even the ones such as IV that have absolutely no bearing on their cited reasons in the takedown request.To put it simply Take two is trying its best EA impression  and its working.
