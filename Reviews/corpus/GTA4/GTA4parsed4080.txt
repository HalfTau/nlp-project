There was enough talking about the game anyway in other reviews. To keep it short its typically GTA awesome, but in my opinion by far not the best one in the series.But DRM protection is a huge impertinence. I wasted 3 hours of my life to get this game running! Inacceptable!Its actually easier and more convenient for you to pirate this game.Im sorry for the game itself, but I just cant recommend it in this state.
