I didnt even pay for this and i feel ripped off, I highly enjoyed this game on console platform. I expected to relive it in all its glory.. sadly this game for PC is a broken mess, horrible optimisationI get 30fps medium settings although i have way above requirements. and trying to play online is a infuriating process due to Microsoft games live I think thats what its called? being so complicated to set up, I gave up on it after maybe 5 tries. This game ON PC is not worth your money. highly dissapointing, I wish more care was put into making this game for the pc platform, I feel as if it had way more potential.
