Best GTA out there... It has an actual realistic story... In this GTA they also give aabout character.. Physics is one of the best Ive ever seen in any game, way better than in GTA V... Even AI is pretty decent, also way better than in GTA V... And multiplayer was fun... You were free... Big shootouts on airfield and sht... I miss that... Rly much....
