Dont listen to the dumb not recommended reviews that cite GFWL as the reason. Im running this game on Windows 8.1  all I had to do was a simple install of GFWL, log in with my old Xbox user name and password and it works flawlessly. To not recommend this game because of the GFWL implementation is just stupid. First world problems, I say.By the way, I played and completed this game on Xbox 360 years ago, and the PC version is far superior. It looks way better, and I can create a custom radio station from the music files on my hard drive. I havent even gotten into mods yet, but after I complete this game again, I will start modding the sh!t out of it!
