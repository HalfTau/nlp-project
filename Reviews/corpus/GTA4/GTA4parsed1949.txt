To everyone whos saying ya cant play this game because you have a low end pc, listen to me. Im using a budget MSI gaming laptop, 2GB of Nvidia GTX950m and 16GB of ram, and it runs GTA 5 so smoothly. Its even capable of running the game at high settings and holy cow its beautiful. These games however, its a different story. Splendid games, fcking terrible optimization. EWLC however runs with no issues, but it still cant recognize my nvidia graphics card for no fcking reason, but it runs smoothly so i got nothing to complain. But im still mad that the game cant recognize my gtx950m because if it could, the game would look flawless in thousands of computers and laptops by now.GTA IV????? FCK SHT!!!I have no idea why Games for Windows Live one of the main reasons gta iv is fcked up still fcking exists in gta iv. i tried reinstalling, the game launches, but thats it....no loading after that. It gets jammed up and i will get pised. I tried numerous ways, searched for clues in internet, but i somehow cant run it. And when it runsFINALLY, it runs at a fcking 800x600 which i cant change the settings. Even with the latest patchwhich Rockstar removed later for no reason, the game runs like sht. Also when i click play, thats it. Nothing appears after that, and i go fck myself.Will i recommend this game? Yes, then why i would wanna buy it in 2017??Arguably the best story in the history of GTA. Would i recommend this game right now??? Hell no, because it just wont run!!!!!Amazing game, cat pss shtty optimization.
