Guys, dont buy this game!I love every GTA game. I have been playing GTA Vice City, San Andreas, GTA V, I own GTA III...So first of all, my pc meets with minimum GTA IVs requirements, but when I downloaded it, it just started crashing and lagging. Then I optimized ULTRA LOW settings but result didnt change. I thought it is just my PC but when I checked forums I saw that many people are saying this game crashes even on very high end pc! Thats because of its bad PC port. I have never seen that bad port in my entire life! Please, keep your money and dont spend on this game. Buy GTA III, V, San Andreas, Vice City but not this one.
