The game is great. The storyline and characters are interesting, and the graphics still look pretty good. Especially if you install something like the iCEnhancer ENB. Ive noticed that sometimes this game can be more detailed than GTA 5 somehow aswell, which is crazy to me considering how old it is. The map here is amazing, aswell as the atmopshere. The city really does feel alive and its awesome to see every NPC doing something and having their own activites. The only problem with this is the PC port is just awful. Dont except to run it maxed out or anything, even with a 1080. I get pretty good frames with iCEnhancer at everything maxed except for shadows and night shadows with a 750 Ti. And it tends to stutter a lot when youre in the middle of the city while a lot of stuff is happening at the same time. But, except for that, its an amazing game. I really suggest getting it!
