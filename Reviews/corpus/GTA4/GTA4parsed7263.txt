Wanted a nostalgia trip from Niko ing Bellic, so I got this.Need to sign into rockstar... Understandable and easy as it did it with GTA 5Need to sign into GFWL... Oh great, thisagain... Without signing in game wont save, so uningavoidable.Finally remembered details and waiting to play game... Update required or youll be signed out of GFWL and not be able to save game, so uningavoidable.Fine  it, give me the update... Game needs to be restarted for update to be successfullGame closes... GFWL installing on my brand new rig.Finally got this crap running, which also runs like crap... you Rockstar,  you Microsoft and  you Niko  toooff to play anything now.Good old nostalgia...
