The gameplay is wonky, the physics are painfully unrealistic, Liberty City is a pain to get around, friends call to hang out with you and give you an hour to get across the entire city damn near impossible even with the best vehicles and death is needlessly punishing.On the other hand, Nicos story is legitimately fascinating, most chracters are vibrant and well written and make me want to interact with them more, the voice acting is top notch and Lazlo is mothering hilarious. So it evens out well enough.
