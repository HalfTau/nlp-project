I absolutely recomend this game for people of all kinds. Sure its kind of buggy and the graphics are old but its one of the best games i have ever played. an infinite possibility game with the exception of planes which they took out but it is what you make of it. follow all the rules or break all the rules but if you plan on playing the storyline you have to be up to break some rules... the multiplayer is fun and nice beause of the character customization and the obvious fact that you and your freinds can  cause choas in the city... although it can be buggy and annoying. the best gta game on pc until hopefully gta 5 comes out for pc.... 96/100.
