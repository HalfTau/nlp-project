This game is very good, however, the physics are poor, very poor, I have played GTA V now it has been released and the physics are incompairable. The physics are so much better! I was slightly annoyed at the glitches that never were fixed. But, I love the game overall, the graphics are good it is a shame the physics arent as good! 7.5/10 therefore, Positive!
