I can no longer support TakeTwo Interactive, any subsidiaries thereof, or any products produced by them due to TakeTwos recent and multiple anticonsumer activities. As such, I cannot recommend anyone purchase from them, as it only serves to perpetuate this behavior.To put it simply, this is about money. Any money you spend on this ultimately ends up in TakeTwos hands. Money is the reason TakeTwo has made the decisions theyve made. Money is the only way to reach them. Thats why I will be boycotting TakeTwo, and I recommend everyone else does the same. Any purchase of any game published by Rockstar or 2K gives money to TakeTwo and tells them that they can get away with this t with no repercussions.
