great game, intense story line, keeps you on and off your feet, but if your going to mod the game, do NOT go overboard unless your PC can handle it. when it comes to playing to stop all or most of the lag remember to use the settings recommended att first then alter because in the end thesres no point in having good graphics if you cant stay alive because your killed by lag from driving down broker bridge at 100mph in an infurnus then hitting a pedestrian and flying through the windshield onto the street where an SUV runs over you by the traffic lightsoverall 9.5/10
