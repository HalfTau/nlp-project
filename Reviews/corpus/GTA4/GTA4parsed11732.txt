Ive beaten the campain probably close to 10 times between the PC and the xbox 360. This game is nonstop fun, plus with mods the game can be anything you want. The story for the main game as well as The Ballad of Gay Tony are great and keep you playing and interested. The Lost and the Damned isnt that great of a DLC but if youve beaten everything else and want more id give it a try.
