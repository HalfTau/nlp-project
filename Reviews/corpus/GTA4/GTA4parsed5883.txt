I got this game for modding but I ended up getting screwed up with rockstar and there impossible not really but very hard sign in process you cant save without signing and also the mods are hard to get installed until you get used to it. You can play the game regular with no mods but like I said you cant save til you sign in which is really hard. EDIT Once you get the begining stuff all setup you can mod away or play the game how you wanted to
