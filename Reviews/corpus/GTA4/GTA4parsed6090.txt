Poorly optimized, clunky PC port. Uses Games For Windows Live, which is basically defunct now.Modding this game was a nightmare even though I tried for 90 some hours and the world is so drab to me, the boring story notwithstanding. Save your money.At the same time, it has charm. Its a fun game and Ive heard the DLCs are awesome. So try it if you want. With OpenIV broken as of 6/26/17 the time of me editing this review, I think most major mods like LCPDFR probably dont work now.
