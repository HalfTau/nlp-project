At long last a developer has created a game without any censorship cuts such as bad language and sex scenes and loads of violence and a very good story line and loads of action, this is a well crafted game at its best and the best GTA game created so far.This game has loads of missions and will keep you in play for months and is a game that can be replayed again and again also it is a single player or multplayer game and with loads of game achiement badges and is windows live game it is hard to think how the developers can improve on this game as they have released GTA 5 but sadly is not yet on steam for PC but i am sure it will be soon until then i have enjoyed playing this game for many hours as it is adictive, so if you get a chance to buy this game i recomend you do buy it as you wont be disapointed and if you love car chases and you can even drive a police car and hunt down criminals too, what more could you ever ask for...I rate this game 9 out of 10...9/10
