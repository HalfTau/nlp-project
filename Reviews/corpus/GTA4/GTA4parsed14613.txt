This game is so badly optimized that its an insult to PC gamers. Years and years later, its still bad.The online support is shaky and the gameplay is not up to part with GTA San Andreas.The story is quite interesting but if your looking to have good ole GTA fun before GTA 5 comes out for PC, get San Andreas and MTA Online.
