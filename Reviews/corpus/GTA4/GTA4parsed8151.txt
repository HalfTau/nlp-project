Decent game but easily the worst one in the saga , its also a terrible console port. Remember games for windows live? Its here and it will annoy you to hell. Want more? Its your lucky day because there are other issues with GPUs, OS, etc.If you are patient enough youll probably get it running but only after trouble shooting for a couple hours and even after that there is a high possibility it wont run as well as you might like. My game never went past 45fps no matter what graphical settings I played on mind you, my current rig is more than enough to run GTAV at 60fps with everything on maxI frankly cannot recommend this game unless you want to take your chance as it could run fine or not run at all.No es mal juego pero es el peor de todos los GTA. La versin de PC se encuentra adems muy mal optimizada pues tendrs que lidiar con games for windows live, problemas con sistemas operativos recientes, problemas con la grfica y un largo etctera.El rendimiento es muy variable, en mi GTX980 no logre que me diera ms de 4550fps sin importar settings grficos. Slo recomendara comprarlo si por algn motivo no has jugado GTAIV y te pica la curiosidad.
