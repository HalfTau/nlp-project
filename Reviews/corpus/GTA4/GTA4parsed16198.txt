Great addition to the series. Story mode was a lot of fun and kept me interested with the characters and writing. The main difference between this game and San Andreas was the update graphics and physics. There is a wide range of vehicles and the  choose your own adventure ending of the game was probably my favorite aspect. The DLC for this game was great and ties into the main story. I would recommend if you are planning on getting the DLC to play this first, then the biker one, and lastly play The ballad of Gay Tony.
