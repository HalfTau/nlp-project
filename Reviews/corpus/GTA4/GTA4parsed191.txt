GTA IV is one of my favourite GTA games. Its a shame Rockstar didnt remove GFWL when everyone else did, because this game is broken and extremely difficult to get running especially if youre a beginner when it comes to tinkering with files.I post this review since I know GTA IV is being sold in bundles.Avoid this game and get it elsewhere wink, wink, because youre seriously throwing your money away and setting yourself up for headaches with this.Shame on Rockstar.
