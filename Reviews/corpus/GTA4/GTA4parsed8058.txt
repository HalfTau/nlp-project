I played this game first on the Xbox 360 and it was an amazing life changing experience but after I recently bought this for PC to play again it just doesnt work and wont load up properly. The key that steam gives you does NOT work for this game and for GFWL. Dont wast your money on this port.Mote I have spent 2 days trying to get this to work before writing this review.
