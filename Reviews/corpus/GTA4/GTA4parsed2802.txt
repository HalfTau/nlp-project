The publisher of this game bullies the community into using their paid online services rather than free mods which the community create themselves.Seriously, they sent a cease and desist letter to the creator of the communitys most important tool OpenIV. Mods are the best thing about this or any other rockstar game that CAN be modded.Its clearly a financially motivated choice on their part so hopefully it will turn out not in their favor, because screwing people over and bullying them should not be status quo.
