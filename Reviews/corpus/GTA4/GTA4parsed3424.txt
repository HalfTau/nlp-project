Terrible game. First time playing it, no issue. Second time, spent an hour trying to figure out how to even start it. Windows live is essential even when playing it offline. I dont even know what windows live is considering I bought the game through Steam. Third time trying to play it, wants to update windows live, cant log me in after logging in, and then cant load my save game? I dont know. Crap setup.
