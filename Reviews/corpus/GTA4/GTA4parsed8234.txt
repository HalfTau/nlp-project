Still a great GTA game after all those years. It has a different atmosphere compared to the previous installments and V. It has a more serious feel compared to the over the top stories in other GTAs, the addons took care of that part. After having finished GTA V, i sort of missed the more realistic vibe from IV. Lets hope GTA VI innovates on the storyline and the technology.
