ProsHuge, detailed open worldExcellent story and charactersExcellent vehicle handling, physics and damage systemHeaps of replayability in single player. I have poured nearly 200 hours into SP alone.Amazing clip capture and in game clip editor opens up huge creative potential e.g. adjustable camera angles and movements, tracking, filters.Great mod choices and community, even if they are a bit hard to installConsMultiplayer simply does not work for me, which is a damn shame, even after trying everything.Even on a good laptop 3.3 GHz, Quad Core, AMD A8 Radeon Dual Graphics game only runs 20 FPS most of the time, on the lowest graphics settings for a 2008 game which is also a shame, as the game could look amazing on higher settings.Missions can get quite repetitiveLoading times are a bit long for a 2008 game. The older GTAs e.g. San Andreas have very quick loading times.Verdict 9.5/10. Worth buying at half price.If youre happy messing around in singleplayer, you most likely wont be disappointed. If youre largely after the online mode, however, its best not to risk your cash here.
