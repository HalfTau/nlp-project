This game needs better checkpoints!! Thanks Rockstar for making a super good optimised game for PC, except for that last mission. You have to be at least a competent windows user to finish the game to remove multicore, something they easily couldve patched. I still dont understand why the Rockstar Club does not connect more often than not. But those are complaints outside the actual game and though it took me a loooong time to get used to this style of gaming though Ive heard about GTA since GTA 3 Ive never played a game from the franchise.Nicos story is really masculine and the humor is really manly, what I deplore is the atrocious gameplay, he seems to move in a Dpad kind of setting. The story was really captivating though.I give this one 83. Cuz Im an adventure and RPG Nintendo polish freak..
