Wont let you go online without Social Network...thats fine, lots of games have their own account system for online.  I can deal.  Or rather I could, if the thing would allow you to connect RIGHT after you make the account...then theres microsoft LIVE.  Ohh boy.  LIVE wont allow you to SAVE THE FREAKING GAME without connecting to it.  And what happens when you say screw it, I dont care if I cant save?  Nope.  You have to.  You have to connect or it wont let you off the screen where it says autosaving failed.  EVEN IF YOU TELL IT YOU DONT CARE.  Save your money.  This game isnt worth a penny.  Because you CANT FREAKING PLAY IT.
