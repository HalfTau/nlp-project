GTA IV is a very well made game. It has lovable characters aswell as hatable ones. Niko Bellic Protagonist is a bad apple who is very fun to play. The driving mechanics for this pc version are in my opinion way superior to the inferior console version. I reccomend this game for those who cant get GTA V. This game gets a 10/10.RenegadeSniper
