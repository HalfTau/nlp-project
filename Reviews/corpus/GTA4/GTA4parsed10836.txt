A warning to those with multiple graphics cardsThis game can default to integrated graphics when using a laptop with a separate video card. There are workarounds to let you remove limits on graphics settings for the card it chose, but none so far that will make the game switch graphics cards altogether. This problem was never resolved before Rockstar moved on to other things. Its a shame theyre willing to sell the game without a warning for a somewhat common issue.Not to mention the Games for Windows Live nonsense. I would advise against this purchase if you have integrated graphics in addition to your dedicated video card.
