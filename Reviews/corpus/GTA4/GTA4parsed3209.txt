I played this loads on console, I believe it is one of my most played games on console.Although the optimisation is pretty bad for GTA IV, everything else about this game is great.It even has pros over GTA V imo. The physics when you shoot an NPC are a lot better, on some vehicles the handling is a lot better than GTA Vs, except the bike physics, they suck on GTA IV. The games story is great, definitely worth playing through, you cannot play multiplayer as far as I know since they shut down GFWL. There is ways to remove it so you can save your game of course.I also recommend picking up Episodes of Liberty City or getting GTA IV Complete, it comes with 2 DLCs, that show the story from a different perspective, as well as adding new weapons, vehicles, etc. The Ballad of Gay Tony even adds a golden helicopter!
