 Cousin I did not expect this city to be so ing crazy  NAH DONT WORRY ABOUT IT NIKO!! WHY DONT WE GO BOWLING TOGETHER?! THE PHYSICS WORK IN BOWLING YOU KNOW!  from GTA IV Corruptions, recorded in 2014 Anyways, great game overall, id say better the GTA V in some aspects, by the fact that you can pick up objects, and throw them at people, a better unarmed combat system  people dont go down in just one punch , aswell as armed combat  people dont go down in one bullet , driving mechanics are as people say they are, good story, and memorable characters.9/10 A good buy if you like open world games and GTA as a whole
