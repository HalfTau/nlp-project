Its funny because the official version would go out of its way to prevent you from playing, while pirated version is superior in every way. Portable, no DRM.Edit Oh I forgot to mention. This game literally doesnt start on modern computer, and so poorly optimized that only few old computers can run it. Good luck! I gave up on running this garbage after an hour!
