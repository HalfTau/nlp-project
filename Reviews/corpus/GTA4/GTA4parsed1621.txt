Well what can I say about GTA IV on Steam.....Ever since the first time I loaded up this game it has been nonstop problems after problems. Windows LIVE for Xbox asks you to either sign in with your existing Rockstar Account which you have to do EVERY time, no auto signin or make a new one. Even if you signin with an existing account AND you do have some saved game progress, it wont always load or show up from my own personal experience.When you finallly get passed this stage and you finish watching the Intro to the game, you then realise this game runs like a piece of sht. You are constantly changing your Graphics settings thinking is this going to make the game run any better? and the truthful answer is, No. Not in the slightest. It doesnt matter what your computer specs are from what I have read on forums and websites, GTA IV will always leave you saddened at the fact that you cant play the game long enough without it making you feel sick.GTA IV has always been one of my favourite games to play, me and my friends played it a lot on Xbox 360 back in the day and now that I have a computer I can finally play it again. BUT, going back to what I was saying I do feel saddened that I suffer with the problems that I have with GTA IV and if someone out there has any feedback or advice on how to make the game run better just reply to this comment.I cannot recommend this game to anyone looking to buy just on the grounds of the things that I have talked about and I cant say for certain that everyone will experience the Graphical problems with GTA IV like I do but all I will say is, just be careful!!WIndows LIVE login  0/10Graphics, Stuttering and Poor Optimization for PC 0/10
