I did have aton of problems when I was trying to install it.If you had the same problem as me this Your graphic setting are near.... t then ill tell ya.SO basically you just go to the Steam Libary then you right click on GTA IV, go on to properties and then choose the Launch options, then type this in norestrictions nomemrestrict availablevidmem 2048.0Also if you have problems with signing in into Social Club then just download Games for Windows and it wont ask you to log in when you boot up the game.Thats it.Oh yeah its not it, its a great game. I played it on the Xbox so i thought why not buy it for the PC for just 6 euros,Okay now its over.Gerinho out es
