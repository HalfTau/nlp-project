Partial review havent finished the game, you seeThe game runs fine on my laptop, i7 3rd gen, 8gb ram, gt650m 2gb, on mediumhigh settings except for shadows, I dont feel like maxing the shadows, but should run fine i guessa little bit of warning though, if you play IV after playing V, it will look hilarious, at least for me.Whats the difference between IV and V? For meIf you like the vibrant color of V, IV does not have it if you did not mod it, of courseUnrealistic thrownoutfromthecar if you hit something at fast speed, use a motorcycle and hit a car from behind, and Niko got thrown out to the other side of the road, lol This is for me, because I played V before IVIt felt like a toy car when you hit other cars with your car, seriously again, it felt weird because I play V firstVehicle handling is so bad, for some of them, you would miss the V car handling, and the motorbike in IV is hard to handle, you literally go drifting when you turn in one of the motorbike in IVWhat I like in IV that did not present in Vfirst and foremost, the AI is quite aggressive, hit one car taxis, most of them, and the driver will come out and fight you, this is one thing I would like to see in V, YET THEY DONT HAVE IT, AND ONLY SOME OF THE AI ON THE UPPER SIDE OF THE MAP IN V forgot the name, its Trevors region CAN DO THIS. In Los santos, you kick peoples car and they will flee, this is what i felt lacking in VBut, this is a game released 8 years ago, so no complaining from me p10/10 would hit peoples car and run
