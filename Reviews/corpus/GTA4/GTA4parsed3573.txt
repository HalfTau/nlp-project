Let me just start by saying that I replayed GTA4 using the ICE 3.0 graphics enhancement mod, and ohmigod, does it make the game look gorgeous. Its not quite up to the standard set by the sequel, but it comes pretty damn close well, most of the time some of the textures and the shorter draw distance knock things down a notch. In some areas  particularly the AI animations  the game is noticeably superior. Not bad for a nine year old game.The gameplay is pure GTA, with all its strength and weaknesses. The huge open world is wonderfully detailed more so, in my opinion, than that of GTA5. The vehicles control as terribly as ever, and the combat is middling. But its the scale and variety of the world far more than the gameplay that was always the draw of the franchise.The satire and humor, on the other hand, are decidedly subpar too biting and nasty to be enjoyable even for a Rockstar production even for the guys who made literal murdersimulators with the Manhunt games. I did quite enjoy the early parts of the game which focused more on Nico, the protagonist, and his relationship with needy cousin Roman. Nico is a truly broken person and the developers managed some surprisingly deep and satisfying characterization, making him equally loathsome and pitiable at the same time. Unfortunately, the latter half of the game degenerates into broad stereotypes with increasingly fantastic adventures, and this early magic is sacrificed for cheap jokes and overthetop action cliches. I struggled to play the game to the end.Still, revisiting Liberty City in all its newlyfound highres glory and following Nicos wounded journey through the citys dirty underside  at least in the beginning  was a welcome return to one of gamings classic titles.
