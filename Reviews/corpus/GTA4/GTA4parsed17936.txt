As much as I love this game on the Xbox 360, the PC version sucks, its glitchy, laggy, and 90 of the time it wont start up, all I wanna do is play with my friend but I cant play the 360 version with him because I dont have and will never have Xbox Live Long Story. Id like the game if they fix all of these, but I do like the gameplay, characters, and the Comedy, from what Ive played on my Xbox 360.
