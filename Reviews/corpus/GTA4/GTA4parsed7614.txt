Gameplay 9/10Enjoyment factor 10/10Polish/tech issues 7/10Overall, I enjoyed this game a great deal. On par with my enjoyment of GTA 3 and Vice City I wasnt the biggest fan of San Andreas, but it was still good. Its entertaining, has an enjoyable and fairly coherent story line, plenty of sarcastic humor and innuendo my favorite, and of course tons of gameplay and intense action. One thing I really liked is that the side missions in GTA 4 assssinations, vigilante, most wanted, etc. were all fairly straightforward though some were still quite challenging and you didnt necessarily have to go buy a guide or go searching the web to figure out what was required. The previous games seemed to have a ridiculous amount of requirements, including some nearly impossible challenges, in order to get 100.I initially had problems getting the game to run when I bought a hard copy several years back, which it seems is a common problem with the PC version, so I never got to play it then. But I picked it up here for super cheap on a sale event, and loading it via Steam I was able to get everything to work. There are some minor ingame graphics glitches in a few areas of the game, as well as some questionable NPC/AI pathfinding at times, and there are definitely some cutscene graphics issues here and there, but overall I didnt experience any issues that broke the game for me, and in many, many hours of gameplay, the game only crashed back to desktop once.
