10/10 would go bowling againAnyway, this is a great game. Poor performance on pretty much every system, but that can be overlooked. The campaign is a little bland and repetitive compared to V and San Andreas, but I liked the story more. Still, you cant go wrong with this game. The mods are awesome. IV with ICEnhancer looks better than V on max settings and runs much worse....
