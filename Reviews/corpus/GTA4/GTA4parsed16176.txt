EDIT 6/15/17 Take Two made using OpenIV illegalMy review of GTAV can be seen hereHere are some screenshots to set the moodSorry Roman, I cant go bowling GFWL and Rockstar Social Club of old arent having it.Oh and this is how NOT to do a PC port. One of the Top 10 bad PCs ports for sure. You may have noticed that I graded the list of bad PC ports on stability, compatibility and performance down below as well to compare. And yeah, GTA IV takes the cake as at least LBCS runs a tiny bit better since GTA IVs inception. This is the game that reminds you why you waited longer for Grand Theft Auto V to come to PC. Oh and you ever played Arma? Yeah this game also needs launch commands too which Ill leave below.Before I get into the bad Primarily the port lets talk about the good GTA IV has an interesting story even if one could argue a bit of ludo narrative dissonance and is a fairly accurate and pretty impressive recreation of New York City Dubbed Liberty City. The characters are memorable and diverse and were well performed by their actors in addition to even the general NPCs inhabiting LC having a lot of personality which brings a lot of life to the citygenerally doing a good job as they move about on an invisible schedule. Euphoria was really used well and theres a lot of mechanical and technical depth beaneath the surface even if the realistic car handling is a love it of hate it ordeal. What Im trying to say is the game part of GTA IV isnt the problem.I have Windows 7 but if you have Windows 10 youll probably never see past the Steam library. Windows 10 is a bad OS dont get me wrong Shots fired but there are games from 04 that function and easily work 10 times better No illeteration intended on far older than this trash from as recent as 08. The game its self is fine but youll jump more hoops than a stallion for nothing. And it runs bad. Real bad. Its hard to play not because of how it controls, or because of difficulty but rather because of the many layers of DRM covering this game like maggots on roadkill. Its such a bad port Im surprised its even allowed on Steam these days.Further more Im shocked that even a publisher as distinquished as Rockstar is allowed to sell this on Steam or hasnt made a GTA IV remaster already for next gen systems so they can have a monetary insentive redo the PC port that they should have done right in the first place or fixed via patches years ago.
