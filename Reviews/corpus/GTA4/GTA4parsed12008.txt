so so....if u dont own an controller. dont buy it. oh and be prepared to suffer from a ing plot stopper bug in the last mission. camera is horrible too.despite that, decent game but tbh the story and the atmosphere was kinda , compared to the previous gta. therefor i do not recommend this.... feels somewhat weird. but hey.... and might not b very objective, sry 4 that.
