I dont get all this mixed review stuff. GTA IV is great once you get through the simple process of bypassing GFWL with two files you drag into GTA IVs directory. Now  the. Is it good? Yes. Does it run well? Not exactly. I always get lag on my GTX970, but this does not affect the gameplay IMO. The only problem is that Multiplayer doesnt work unless you do things toit work. To be honest, you should play Singleplayer BEFORE Multiplayer  especially with GTA V. The games modding community is still alive today and can change the game in many different ways.However, with all the stuff you need to do to get it running, GTA IV should have a lower price on Steam. Unless Rockstar decide to fix this, you should get it cheap during a sale, or buy a cheap CD key on the internet.
