Dont waste your time.  I bought this as a part of a very cheap GTA package, and I spent over two hours just trying to get it installed and no dice.  Lockups, hangs, freezes, Not Respondings, you name it.  Its really a shame because I love this game so much, and after quite a few years, I wanted to relive some of those old memories, but Rockstar, and GFWL have seen fit to prevent that trip down memory lane...dont bother.
