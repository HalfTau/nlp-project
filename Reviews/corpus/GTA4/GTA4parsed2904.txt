Hello, Customers of steam, I suggest you do not buy this game, because it is broken to where you cant save at all because you need some Xbox Live trash which costs money or a windows live acount which im pretty sure is a dead website. Other than that the game is amazing wonderful story, graphics are alright. BUT I WARN YOU. You can not save and I wasted money that steam willl not pay back.
