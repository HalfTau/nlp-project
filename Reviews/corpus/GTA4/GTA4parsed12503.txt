ok  so yeah i got this game and let me tell youBEWAREthis game is a horrible pc port and even with high end systems youll still lag. Countless of tweaks must be made to get this game running at a constant 55fps and thats not a lot.  GFWL is crap. If youre looking for a fun multiplayer this game is not for  you. Might as well wait for GTA V.2/10 becuz lag and gfwl4/10 with rice
