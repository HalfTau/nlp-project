I was initally hesitant about purchasing GTA IV for PC because of the reviews complaining about GFWL. The game, in my opinion, is great. I think the story is pretty good, gameplay is fun, theres some fun mods I want to try out, and theres just a long list of things to do. I decided to go ahead and purchase the game, along with the EFLC DLC, figuring that I could probably try and fix the GFWL issue as there are multiple resources online that help with fixing it.As it turns out, there wasnt too much of a problem for me after installing both games. Sure, I had to fix it so that they both ran in Compatability Mode with Windows 7 an error comes up when you first start the game, as it initially runs in Compatability Mode with Windows Vista, and I have 7, but GFWL actually wasnt as big of a threat as the other users made it seem. I signed in using my Xbox account and it worked. Granted, it had to update, which didnt take too long, and voila, the game worked. I can save my single player progress and enjoy the game.The game itself, in my opinion, doesnt differ too much from console version I also own IV and TLAD on Xbox 360, so theres little to no complaining from me on the game. Its definitely one Ill spend a lot of hours playing.TLDR It should run fine as long as you can successfully sign into Social Club and GFWL using any kind of Microsoft account, like Xbox or Skype, should work, updating GFWL, and making sure to run it in the correct Compatability settings. The game is great and I have found very little wrong with both IV and EFLC.
