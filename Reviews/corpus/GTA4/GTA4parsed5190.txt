Offline doesnt work, because why would it? So I created a rockstar account... But I didnt want to give them my birthday so I just clicked through the defaults. The system thinks Im 10 months old and locks me out of of their site. Well, this is one 10 month old baby that is going to throw a tantrum. Seriously you idiots? Get a lot of problems with diaper wearing babies  using your site do you?
