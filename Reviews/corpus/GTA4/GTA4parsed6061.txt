Spoilers well, no sht there are going to be spoilers in this review It is an ok predicessor to GTA V, yet I only have one issue with it... UNLESS YOU USE A RECORDING PROGRAM like Fraps, THE LITTLE SECTION OF THE FINAL MISSION WITH THE HELICOPTER IS FCKING IMPOSSIBLE! The camera goes all frantic when you at least attempt to repeatedly press the space bar. Thats why you need to be recording, or else it wont work. At least the DLCs are sort of fun. I do recall beating it on my Xbox 360 back in 2008 when the game was first released. I think I chose the ending were kate got shot instead of Roman. So in conclusion, for consoles, I suppose Id reccomend it. But for the PC, Ill leave you with this one last bit of advice YOURBETTER BE PREPARED TO RECORD WHEN THAT HELICOPTER ARRIVES!Sincerely,The Magnum Dong Lord X3P.S., I doubt anyone will or want to read this hefty paragraph explaining this oldgame.
