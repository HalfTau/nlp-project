It takes you forever for the intro logo and loading screens. Literally unplayable without a proper mod. Do me a favor Buy a Saint Rows game instead and you have a well optimized and funashell game.Edit My computer is Asus gaming laptop with Core i7, 12GB of RAM DDR3, GTX 960M 2GB and SDD 128 GB. The internet connection is good, I normally download games from steam with 12 MB/s.
