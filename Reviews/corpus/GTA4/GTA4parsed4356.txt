So Take Two just killed off openiv, pretty much killing the modding scene for this and gta 5 in an attempt to push us into multiplayer. Dont buy from take two.Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time I bought gta4. i boot it up and games for windows live asks me to sign in. I being a normal human being ignore it. Play for about two hours, go to save and gfwl pops up again, and again i ignored it. boot it up today and all of my saves were gone. Who on Gods or your spititual equivelent green earth thought that that was a user freindly feature? I now have to pirate the game for the ability to save. Really Great. Fantastic.
