a big disappointment for me.. the colors in the game are depressing, the character respond some kind of slow to the moves, the camera behind the cars works with huge delay.. must register windows live to save the game..  saving the game is still a big trouble after all.. bad optimalization of this game for pc is well known.I wish my money back, playing this game makes me feel i am wasting my time.. After watching some youtube videos, i see that gta 4 would irritate me even more after playing longer..
