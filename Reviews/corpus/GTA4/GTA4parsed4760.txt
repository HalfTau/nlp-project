Nice physics, I just love to drift on the narrow and large streets. The story is interresting and the 3 endings..that was a nice touch, I just had to try them all Really good game with high end graphics I needed an PC upgrade before I could think of playing this, I still play it from time to time just to rememeber the old NY and the mayhem Niko can do in this city.Recommended ? Of course !
