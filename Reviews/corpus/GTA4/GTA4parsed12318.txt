This game is a total piece of crap. Couldnt play the game on a bootcamped Windows 8.1 in a baseline iMac 2013. First the game wouldnt start. Upon googling a bit I found I had to reinstall something called Windows Live Games. I did. Then the game started in an awful 800x600 resolution and for some reason wouldnt let me change it in the Graphics Settings. Then I found the game automatically locks whatever graphics settings it thinks are too high for your hardware, and if you want to run it with no restrictions you have to add some flags to the shortcut you use for starting the game, which I couldnt find, since I installed the game through Steam. Then I tried to play at the default 800x600 resolution and it hanged on the first loading screen. Then I gave up. Spend your time and money on something better.
