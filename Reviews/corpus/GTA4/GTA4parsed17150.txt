A classic the moment it came out. Now that GTAV came out we get to feel nostalgic about it. Rejoice. Run, Drive, etc around the streets of a beautifully, amazingly rendered immitation New York City, See what this concrete jungle has in store for you as you step into the shoes of one weary Niko Bellic, a lovable eastern european war veteran turned professional criminal/mass murder/instrument of armageddon. A Game that so much hype and history surrounds its hard not to play it, and harder not to enjoy every bit well, almost, hehe. But most of whats in this game is up to you. So be sure your choices dont come back to bite you in theor perhaps worse, the conscience.
