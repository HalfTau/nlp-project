Niko starts smalltime, he just drives a taxi for his cousin in order to help him with his business.Throughout the game, Niko will find himself involved with several peculiar beings, they are bad guys of all types gang members, killers, drug dealers, corrupt cops, s, anything you could imagine. Personally I like this game better than GTA 5.
