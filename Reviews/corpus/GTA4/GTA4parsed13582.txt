This game has some big performance issues and i have experienced a ton of bugs.Despite these complains, the game is very satisfying and the story is relatively enjoyable with some memorable characters. Who doesnt want to go bowling with Cousin Roman? The game is still kept alive by the modding community and should inspire more games to allow mods in their games.
