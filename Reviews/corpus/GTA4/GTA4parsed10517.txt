Well, what can I say? I cant even play the game because of Social Club. Selecting the option to play offline does nothing either. Once you click it, nothing happens. Im not sure why this is happening. Even launching the game from its local files doesnt work. Apparently, this is a known issue thats existed for a few years now. I wonder why its never been fixed though? I highly recommend against buying GTA IV over Steam. Trust me, it isnt worth losing your money over. Now I know how that feels...UPDATE 6/1/15  In order to get the game to work, you need to download the X Liveless mod, which disables the need and use of online functions Social Club, Windows Live. However, because Rockstar shut down their servers for GTA IV 2 years ago, that shouldnt be a problem. My stance on buying the game is unchanged, however. Players shouldnt have to download thirdparty content just to get the game to work properly. If youre looking for a clean, working install of GTA IV, I suggest buying this game separately from Amazon, etc..
