While GTA V might be out now, GTA IV is still an extremely good game. Great story, great gameplay, and not to mention, there is so much to do... fly helicopters, go to strip clubs with people, take out a line of cars with a rocket launcher. Im having so much fun with it right now and for those who have not tried GTA IV yet, this is probably a good place to start.
