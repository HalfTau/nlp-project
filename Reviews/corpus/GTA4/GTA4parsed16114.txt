EDIT Will remain as not recommended due to OpenIV.1. Story There are many great, welldeveloped characters. The length of the game is great enough to entertain you for long periods of time. 10/102. Gameplay The missions are repetitive and the freeroaming experience may get boring after a few hours of gameplay. 3/103. Graphics and Performance Poorly optimized. Bloom effect is overused and the games performance in most setups is terrible. 1/104. MultiPlayer Pretty interesting, although it relies on GFWL. 8/105. Car Driving Lacks realism. Driving a car is like riding a bathtub around the city. 5/106. Physics The Euphoria engine has proven to be one of the best physics engines. 10/107. Map There are details present in every single corner, every single alley. Exceptional quality. The looks of it match New York. Grey and dull, may be quite depressive and boring for some. 8/108. Activities There are many activities across LC. You can call your friends and hang out to enjoy them. Its a pretty interesting feature. 8.5/109. Reality Rockstar managed to do a good job balancing fiction and reality. 9/10.10. Modding Support It once was a thing. Then came TakeTwo Interactive to ruin everything. 0/10Final Score 5/10Originally Written in 2014, Edited in 2016Reviewed in 2017.
