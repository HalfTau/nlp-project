Lets start by saying this game has its flaws, but earned my approval.First off, this game is everything you expect from a GTA title, but with a little extra. For example, improved graphics, better vehicles and better gameplay. I really found the extra things to do more fun than just going through the story until it is complete, like doing side missions, etc. The story is basic, but enjoyable, as Niko Bellic is one of my favorite characters in GTA behind Carl Johnson from San Andreas and Franklin from GTA V.Now for some flaws. First one and a major one is that this game has one of the worst ports out of any PC game Ive ever played. Even with my AMD A10 7700k 3.5ghz, GTX 650 1gb, and 4 gb Ram, I can still barely run this game on medium with 4050fps. Now, this is managable, but for me performance plays a good part in gaming, so if you have a poor or only decently average PC then dont buy this game or you will be unsatisfied. Another thing is the constant badgering of the side cast to go drinking, bowling, etc. with you throughout the game This can happen at anytime. Although annoying, this isnt that big of an issue to give it a negative rating.Overall, this is definetely worth the money I spent on this game and if you see it for sale for 510, consider trying it out if you enjoy car chases, chaos, nice cars, and fun!
