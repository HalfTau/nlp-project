Before I begin I want to clarify for the Not recommended vote.The GTA series were always about having fun, reliving film/tv tropes and poking fun at everything, even the game itself.GTA IV was like a bucket of cold water after experiencing the GTA 3 series/arch.A grittier and realistic approach coupled with unrelatable characters/plot, three different signin services, a lockdown on easily modifiable content and technologyoversubstance mentality made this game become vaguely entertaining rather the hits its predecessors were. Not to mention that parachutes, airplanes, customization garages, tanks, tattoos, haircuts were removed, all for the sake of realism.I could have overlooked all the previously mentioned issues if it wasnt for the most infuriating feature in this game, the driving.You had a better chance at surviving an attack from a grizzly bear while tied in a burlap sack than you had of not sliding into a wall during a high speed chase, cars wobbled more than the doublechins of a portly patron at the allyoucaneat buffet, road friction would convince you the pavement was made of teflon. Supporters will fanatically defend the new driving mechanics, but I saw it as taking the Auto out of Grand Theft Auto, whenever I needed to get anywhere Id call a cab.Seems Rockstar realized their mistakes and reverted these issues on GTA V.I played this game a lot, and will probably continue to do so thus this may make me a hypocrite, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to a GTA fan who loved the GTA 3 series.P.S. Keep in mind GFWL is kicking the bucket in 2014, and Rockstar hasnt issued any statements regarding updates which many other developers in the same situation have addressed and resolved, GFWL is latched like a parasite to this game, especially the multiplayer.
