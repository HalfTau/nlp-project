What a waste of my precious money. I have a social club account and when i put it in to play my game it does nothing. Wanting to play offline without the social club account is also a disaster, as that does nothing as well. How about you guys take this s off of the market and trash it once and for all. Or how about this? Go out of business. Make something other than what you call games. Or maybe stop existing as a whole!
