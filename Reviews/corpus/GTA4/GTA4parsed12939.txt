After about 7 or so years since its release and with GTA 5 to keep us company, the quality of GTA 4 has of course diminished since 2008. However, I will say that this is still an overall positive experience, even if some aspects of GTA 5 are greatly superior. The story takes on a much darker tone than usual GTA plots, and some people would consider that a negative point. Though, in my opinion, the interesting narrative and loveable characters more than make up for it. And theres still a ton of humor to go around. The story is one aspect of GTA 4 that I would consider better than GTA 5 Sorry for comparing the two games so much, but it just seems necessary. This is also the first GTA game to feature online multiplayer I think?. The multiplayer is a blast with friends, and if you both use mods, then its even better. Gameplay overall is somewhat of a stepup from past GTA games, but there are some things you will miss. There isnt as much to do in the overworld as, say, San Andreas. The combat controls on the other hand are significantly improved, with a new cover system implemented, and refined gunplay. Now, the biggest complaint about GTA 4 and my personal least favorite thing about it is the driving controls. Most of the earlymid game cars are super stiff, and when you try to use either of your brakes to compensate for that, youll likely just spinout. Even the best cars in the game dont feel as comftorable as San Andreas midtier cars, at least in my opinion. This is a huge blemish on the game which can really make the experience frustrating at times. Thankfully, the missions themselves are still super fun to play like the other GTA games, and the different morality choices were actually kind of fun. Were they needed? Probably not, but I still found them fun.Overally, I honestly find GTA 4 to be very enjoyable, even after so many years. Would I recommend it? If you havent played it, heck yeah! This game is definitely best during the first playthrough.
