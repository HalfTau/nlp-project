I bought this game off Green Man Gaming and now I cant get a refund from anybody as they keep pointing the finger at someone else as to why this product doesnt work. I have Windows 10 and I did call rockstar customer support. I probably got one of the  from the department to answer my call because he vocally acknowledged in our phone call that it is a broken product and doesnt work for everyone. They will not give you a refund and they wont provide any help besides telling you to try and run the game a few different ways. The guy told me that since its so old they cant do anything about it. THE GAME IS NOT EVEN A DECADE OLD.  Its sad that Rockstar just discards their support for older games as with better companies that support their games no matter how old they are. I mean, I can play the classic Doom game on my computer on Windows 10 with no problem and that game isnt even from the 2000s. If you cant suppport your game after a few years has passed by since its release then you dont deserve the respect that you have from the gaming community. Honestly, until yesterday I truly believed Rockstar was one of the best game companies as they have always made quality games but seeing as how they cant support their games after a few years pass, I cant say I have the same level of respect I used to. Ill be looking forward to any of Rockstars future games to be released but never with the same level of respect for them again.
