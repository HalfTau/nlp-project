This game is kinda good but at the same time is bad.It has a great story line,great audio,great graphichs.But the problem is that is poorly optimized.I have a GTX 750 Ti,8GB DDR3,Pentium G3250.And at high speed on a car i get 5040 fps...Im playing on medium settings.But this game is a very nice game even if its running quite bad
