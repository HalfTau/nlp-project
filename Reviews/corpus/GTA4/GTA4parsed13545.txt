Fun, yea. The most horrible optmization of all time, yea. But that doesnt make it a bad game...at least most of the time. But all in all if you can actually get this game to work its definatly worth the money and everything. If you get bored there are endless possibilities of mods and other configurations to try. Also some the graphics mods for this game if you have a supercomputer can make this game look almost like reallife its insane! If you have the money for it definatly pick it up and if its on sale get it right away.
