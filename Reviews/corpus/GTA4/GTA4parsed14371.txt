The game does crash for no reason when launching or after loading, but the solution to this is, no joke, to keep launching it until it works. So if crashes/errors or some weird graphical glitch like people becoming invisible when youre near them happens, just relaunch the game. From my experience you only need to launch it once or twice if you encounter another crash/error/graphicalglitch.GFWL shouldnt cause any problems if you choose to install a certain mod that disables GFWL. just google Gta 4 disable GFWL if you want itOther than that, this is an amazing game. Just try it, and you will not be disappointed.
