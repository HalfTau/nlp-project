Upon hearing about the new patch for Grand Theft Auto IV I wanted to replay it on PC with glorious settings after first playing it on xbox 360 at the time of launch. However the game does not activate and the option to activate manually on SecuROMs website comes up with a Invalid Serial Error. Nothing but silence from Rockstar and SecuROM after firing a few Emails to the both of them.THANK YOU SECUROM FOR STANDING IN THE WAY OF ME PLAYING YET ANOTHER GAME, YOU UNWELCOME OVERBEARING DOUCHEWAD.
