GTA is my favorite franchise but this version of the game is The biggest problem with it is performance. It does not run well unless you lower some of the settings which is laughable since Im running it on high end hardware. I get way better performance in GTA V.GTA IV, to my knowledge, will not run at a smooth 60 FPS on any config in existence. At least I havent been able to find someone with a computer capable of doing that. The port is an abomination and R should fix it. They have the money but they dont care. ing s.
