I love this game, I really do. I still do, and I do recommend it, but not on PC.Ive done everything in my power to try to log into this god forsaken Windows Live thing, and no matter what I do I cant save my game. Ive tried everything, but after making a straight shot of 4 hours of progress, I lost everything. Stick to the consoles kiddos.
