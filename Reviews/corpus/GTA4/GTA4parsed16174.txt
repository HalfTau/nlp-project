I just finished GTAV and have come back to GTA iV for more... 5 is a great looking game but IV has more realistic physics and extra little details like you have to park up PROPERLY to trigger a cutscene, its the details that make IV more like a sim in the driving part of the game. The acting, storylines and graphics are as good, sometimes better, than 5, but what puts the icing on the cake is the two extra games The Ballad of Gay Tony and The Lost and the Damned mean you have three times more game than you get with GTAV. That may well change.. I think it probably will, if R want to milk their product well see addons like Episodes from Liberty City come along in due course. Until that time, GTA IV wins out, IMHO.Frank Cook
