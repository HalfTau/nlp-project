Ok before i begin, let me stress that GTA 4 itself is a good game.  I got it on the xbox originaly and thouroghly enjoyed it.  However, the PC port is basicaly broken.  Constant bugs and errors occured throughout my time playing the game.  However, the biggest flaw is games for windows live errors.  A considerable amount of uninstalling of various software needs to take place in order to be able to play the game due to the constant gfwl errors.  It is a terrible piece of software that causes constant inconvinience to those using it!  Overal,l In the state that it is in i would not reccomend it for PC.   However, on console it is a much better game.
