The reason why I think this is not only the best GTA ever made but one of the best games ever is the unbelievably well made atmosphere .It has such a dark sense of humor and some content is heavily critical about our modern society .I just think that the other GTAs are only about messing around and having fun and this isnt the right thing for me .If youre looking for a melancholic open world game dont hesitate and buy it now !!!
