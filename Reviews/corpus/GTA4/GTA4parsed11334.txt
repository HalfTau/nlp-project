This game is brilliantly amazing. Ive probably spent too many hours in Singleplayer and Multiplayer. This is an accurate review as Ive done everything there possibly is to do in the game.The Singleplayer is so great, its serious, its full of references, and its funny. The atmosphere is incredible and so accurate, as is the city which is Rockstars take of New York City and New Jersey. The vehicles handle very realisticly, have cool deformation, and are generally fun to drive/fly. The pedestrians are incredibly diverse in culture and filled with a lot of stereotypes as per Rockstar release. The storyline is really good and the missions are fun as well as classic Grand Theft Auto sometimes.The Multiplayer in this game is also pretty great. There is a leveling system that goes up to level ten, you unlock character clothing by leveling up and can customise your character/player model. There are fun and repeatable coop gamemode/missions that can have up to four players playing together over the internet or lan. The other gamemodes include Race, GTA Race, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Mafiya Work, Team Mafiya Work, Turf War, Cops n Crooks, Car Jack City, and Team Car Jack City. If you want a further description of these gamemodes, you can clickEach one of these are amazing, fun, and rewarding. Theres also a gametype called Free Mode, where you can do whatever you want with very little to no limitations. My only complaint with Multiplayer is that there are sync issues between players sometimes. This could just be me because I play with friends in Europe and such whereas I currently live in the U.S.A.I highly recommend this game as its one of the best games Ive ever played. If you were thinking about buying this game, stop thinking. Buy it.
