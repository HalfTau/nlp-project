I only give it a good rating because its fun with friends, and free roam is pretty awesome too. Otherwise, I hate it. Why do I have to progress in a horrible story to get to other parts of the city? Why am I stuck with crappy clothes until I unlock another part of the city? Maybe the story/missions gets better in the future. But in the begining its way too repeatitive, and no fun at all. So fun free roam, and fun with friends. But otherwise, bad game.Also, doesnt always work on peoples computers. Sent a friend this as a gift, and it doesnt work and dont say well maybe their computer isnt good enough, because it definatly is.
