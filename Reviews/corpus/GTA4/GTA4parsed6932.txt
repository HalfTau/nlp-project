This hopefully is a wakeup call for the company who is making this game. I have both GTA 4 games, none of them is working because of the social club.  I finally went to the website and then I get the message my account has been locked because of wrong or bad logins  lol. I didnt spent 100 bucks to become a member of you social club and already have been verified through steam. I wasted money before but if your think i am going to throw anymore your way with GTA 5, keep on dreaming and please do enjoy your social club.
