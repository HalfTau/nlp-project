If you looking for Online Gameplay..... Look ELSEWHERE... Games For Windows Live, disconnects me and ALOT of other ppl after 510 mins of online gameplay. Ive spend 2days so far trying to no avail fixing it........... ALSO. Games For Windows Livegfwl will be shutting down on July 2014.... Thanks Rockstar and Games For Windows Live for  on half the populous and never bothering to remedy it since before 2008 when ppl started having issues......Otherwise, Gta4 is a good game for the most part
