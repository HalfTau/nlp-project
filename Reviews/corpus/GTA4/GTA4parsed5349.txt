 this game on steam. first of all thedont work unless you delete some software on your computar to install a new one and even then the game wont let you change graphics and its full of glitches. this game had better graphics and ran smoother on xbox360. DO NOT BUY!!!! i bought it on sale and i still want my money back. you steam for selling a ruined game!
