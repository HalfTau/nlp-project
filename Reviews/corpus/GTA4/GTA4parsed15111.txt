When I first got this game I wasnt super into it but this game quickly grew on me. The graphics in the game are great and all the missions keep you excited. the one thing I dont like about the PC version of the game is the controls for the helicopters, but that problem is easily fixed by just attatching an Xbox controller and play with that. Overall though this is one of the best games I have ever played.
