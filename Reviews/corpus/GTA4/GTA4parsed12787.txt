Bought this game at the last holiday sale, hadnt been able to start it since. The wonderful mixture of Social Club and GFWL gives you the joy of seeing the launcher crash over and over again. Im glad to see Steam keeps pushing it on every occasion and Rockstar does nothing to fix it. Especially since all you have to do to play the game successfully is crack it reportedly. Because why bother to give customers what they paid for...
