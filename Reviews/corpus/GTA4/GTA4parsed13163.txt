TLDR Bad when relased, updated to even worse. Dont buy.I have had a copy of this game from the time it was made. And it didnt run well the with that old computer. I thought that I will give the full version a try with my now much more powerfull computer. Guess what? It still doesnt work, even with all these patches. I actaully remember it running and working better with that old computer!!!First of all, the game doesnt even let me change settings from low, since it is thinking that I dont have enought vram on my 4gt R9 290. So to even make the game work I need to google and use launch settings nomemrestrict norestrictions to be able to make it 1080p. After that I got to the game only to notice that it has huge lag spikes and very noticeable inputlag even with vsync off. Just that the game is almost unplayable with hardware that is many times more powerfull than anything when it was relased. Tuning down the settings only makes things worse, with even more lagging and handbrake button magically starting to spin the camera.And then we will get to the business with Windows Live. So you new cant even make safes without Liveaccount? WTF is this I could make safe on the orginal version without any live crap, so why cannot I now? Just that this game always horribly broken on PC, but the updates have made it even worse. Just dont buy.
