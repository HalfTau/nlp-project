It requires a series of hacks to run on Windows 8, and its full of graphical glitches. Still fully playable though.Unfortunately, theyve removed all the sandbox elements that made the previous games awesome. Ive played for 7 hours hoping to unlock something that will make the game fun, but it feels more like I got a second job as a cab driver.
