Compared to the console version Xbox 360 in this case, this port Does not offer Steam achievements Forces you to use Live for Windows if you want to save the game So basically to play the game Needs you to mess around a bit to get the multiplayer to workBut compared to the console version, this port offers Mods And... I cant really say any other real advantage the PC port has over the console versionThis game is still great. Is it meant to be played on a keyboard? Fk no. It isnt the worst I have ever seen but once you have played GTA V, you know what I mean. I went to try this out on the console after a few years of not playing this game at all and I found that the gamepad is not that great either. I mean it is way better but it did not feel... natural. After GTA V, it did not feel that fluent. But I guess you can get used to it.The storyline is great, the characters are well written, the cheats are fun to mess around with and alot of small details give this game a unique feeling. Like throwing trash at people, the friend system The Lets go bowling thing, the hand combat feels great, the cops are amazing Not necessarily smart but do you want the cops to catch you every time when you bump into a trash bin?, being able to crouch GTA V plz. being able to go into the fast food joints and the Vigilante missions are a great bonus. Oh yeah and the music is awesome too.If you have interest in GTA IV then I suggest you just go grab it.
