I spent several hours on several remedies to make this game run on Windows 10, but there is no way I could get this to run. Now I have torrented it and the torrent works fine, but the licensed produxt I paid for doesnt? I know it is an old game, but I have played older games that run just fine on this same computer. If you cant get it to work then do not sell it, or at least put a disclaimer somewhere.
