Amazing game. In my true opinion, after playing both GTA IV and GTA V, Ive concluded that the GTA IV game and its EFLC downloadble content is far more enjoyable than GTA V.The physics, the cops, the handtohand combat, melee weapon combat, firearm combat, vehicle handling and collisions, and many other things make Grand Theft Auto IV a far better game than Grand Theft Auto V, although Grand Theft Auto V is still an astounding and amazing game.Dont get me wrong, I just think Grand Theft Auto IV has a far better storyline, and experience to the game rather than Grand Theft Auto V.
