I remember not being able to play this game when it was just released because it was horribly optimized.It still is horribly optimized if you are wondering. But PC hardware has become stronger. So if you have a somewhat half decent PC then this game should easily do 60fps.As per the game, as opossed to many people I have talked with, I actually quite liked the story line, driving mechanism and crash damage. I have played some multiplayer in this game and honestly its bad. Worth it just for the single player experience.
