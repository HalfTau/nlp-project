You start by watching an intro video, introudcing you to our character. He has gone to the US to meet his cousin. He goes to his cousins house, and then the game tries to Autosave. You are forced to make a Windows Live Account. When you sign in, you need to download an update that forces your game to restart, losing your place. You then need to connect a gamertag to the account. This means that, for me to do nothing more than SAVE MY GAME, I need to create an Xbox Account. I need to sign up to a dfferent platform entirely to play this game on my PC.Good game. 0/10  Microsoft.
