Well I bought this game, and it wont even launch.  After a SMALL amount of investigating... I wasnt the only one with this problem by far.  You sell a non working game.  And pass it off as fine.  How dare you.  Dont buy this.  It wont work.  See for yourself if you dont belive me.This was a complete rip off.  Why did you do this steam?  I thought you guys were better than this but I see how wrong I was.
