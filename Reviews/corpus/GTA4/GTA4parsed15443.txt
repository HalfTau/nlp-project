This is a normal review, I am not upvoting this game just with COUSIN LETS GO BOWLING like everyone else does.GTA IV is one of my favourite games of all time. I played this game hundreds of hours on PS3 and completed every single mission three times until the infamous YLOD wrecked my console.ProsAwesome storylinePerfect humour and action combination, just like in the old GTA gamesThe best rendition of Liberty City by farVariety of cars to buyConsThe Steam version includes an outdated version of GFWL which will make the game unplayable. Can be fixed by uninstalling this version and installing the latest version from MicrosoftThree accounts needed to play one on Steam, one on GFWL and one on Rockstar Games Social ClubMost vehicles handle like trucksOverall, this is a masterpiece in the whole series, even though many say it is a bad port.Untill GTA V comes out on PC, this is the mustbuy in the series.Rating 9.5/10 will play again
