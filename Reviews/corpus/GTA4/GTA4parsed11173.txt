Once you get Games for Windows live working its a great game. This game isnt very well optimized so you need a dedicated machine running it, anyways its great. Especially with all the mods built by the community. My favorties are the first person and the iron man mod. Get this game while its 4 if youre willing to get this game to work, otherwise wait until GTA V comes out on the 14th.
