The game doesnt work! !It might have been fine but after 3 accounts, games for windows live is simply outdated and ignored toward 2016 standards. So the game is playable, but saving is blocked. Currently the game is no longer being sold, so hopefully rockstar is fixing the issue, for now it was a 5 waste that Im not going to have back. Hopefully in the future, like Gta 5, a rockstar account will be the only limit.
