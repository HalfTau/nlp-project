The Windows Live s.u.c.k.s, no really, s.u.c.k.s. Windows Live is shut downed and you are unable to create Windows Live account, well, you can still play singeplayer in offline Local profile, but you be unable to play multiplayer. Im glad, that I have Windows Live account, because I created it when Windows Live was live and usable. Now, if you only want to play multiplayer, dont buy this game. Well, theres multiplayer mods, but its not the same like the original multiplayer.I give 0/10 for multiplayer.Okay, now about singeplayer. Its nice, physics, car physics, some fun and nice bugs, its really nice, its not like Grand Theft Auto San Andreas or older Grand Theft Auto games. You dont need to wait for load when you get trough doors. Okay, some new featuresPro.stit.ut.es  you can have sex with them, but  if you pay them for services etc. 50, and you kill them, you dont get 50, you get 20 or other amount of money. But, thats okay  Because you can have fun with first person mod New akcent  new akcent, its kinda funny, its Russian.And the things, I didnt liked itNo parachute  no parachutes, on the Grand Theft Auto The Ballad of Gay Tony there is parachutes, but why it was removed on Grand Theft Auto IV?No planes  no planes / Well, you cant do some stunts without planes.I can give 9/10 of singeplayer, if you want just to enjoy the singeplayer, buy this game
