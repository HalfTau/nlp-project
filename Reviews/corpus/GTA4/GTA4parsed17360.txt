Excellent openworld action game. The driving is amazing and the plot is incredibly wellwritten.Theres one caveat to my recommendation The final mission is ridiculous. It is broken due to a bad port technology that assumes you can press a button incredibly quickly. The developers have never repaired this bug, as far as I know, and its still nearly impossible to complete this mission on a modern PC.The game is worth enjoying up until that point, though. Especially if you can get it at a discount.
