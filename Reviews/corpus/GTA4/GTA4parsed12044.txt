Grand Theft Auto IV is a solid 4/5 for its outstanding lightweight graphics for modern day cards, worth less than 200. Though its recommended card is in fact Nvidia, the AMD counterpart works just fine. The actual gameplay is slow, you might not be able to be hooked into it for more than four hours at a time, but its definitely worth it. I would only purchase this game on sale because it is an old game, and cutting off some of the money is beneficial.
