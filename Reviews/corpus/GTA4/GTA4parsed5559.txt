First off, this game was great back when no one messed up the game with mods. Of course, you need ot make a backup before installing mods into the GTA IV game folder, simple. If you mess up, well too bad. I had to reinstall the game about seven times already and will never even play it again. Why will I not play it again? Everytime I try to uninstall then reinstall the whole GTA IV game, I click on Play after it finished downloading, but it says Seculauncher Failed to Start Application 2000. Ive tried every single method there is on the internet and forums on Steam. Nothing has worked. I tried using the xlive.dll or .dll method, nothing worked, either. Very disappointed to see that no one even plays this game now, and the moderators on Steam do nothing about it! I paid 20.00 for the game to see it crash and not work?!?! I cant even get a refund on it because Ive already put in 36 hours which is above the limit of 3 hours if you want to get a refund. I bought it two years ago, didnt play it that much, though. Steam denied my refund request, because Im over the limit of hours played. Im so disappointed and will never be playing this game ever again.
