Good game overall when it comes to gameplay and storyline.However, it feels like the character is too moneydriven and it doesnt develop enough. Also some of the story encounters seem random and not cohesive at all like in the previous titles.Pro enjoyable missions funny dialogue rewarding encounters in terms of gameplay experience solid shooting/aiming system the phone feature is a great one decent driving system graphically appealingCon i really feel like the radio stations lack the good/enjoyable music like in the previous titles sometimes the camera and camera control is awful poor port that makes the game seem stuttery even at 4045 FPS poor monetization management the collectibles and rewards are kind of missing alltogether GFWL is total bullAll in all GTA IV is a great experience. Sometimes frustrating as hell, but mostly fun as hell.
