Do not buy this game from Steam!after paying and downloading, the game doesnt work. So you, without Steam ever mentioning it, will have to go to the steam forums to find out why. Only then will you be informed that you have to download another program from the xbox website.then you find out that you need to create an xbox profile, followed by a rockstar games profile, and finally a windows live profile.After doing all of this, you will attempt to login to all of these various services only to have the game crash every time.Rockstar games, Windows, and Steam should all be ashamed. I love Steam and spend a lot of money here, and this treatment of customers is absolutely unexceptable.
