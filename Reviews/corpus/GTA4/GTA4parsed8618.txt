While I Do Not Hate This Game, I Highly Recommend Not Buying It Anymore! One Of The Main Reasons Being That To Play The Game You Have To Have A Windows Something Account, And That Within Itself Is Complacated. And Since Its An Outdated Software, All The Servers Are Down, And You Need To Be On That Account Singed In To Atleast Open The Game! You Know What, Just Take My Word For It, If Its This Complecated To Explain It To You, Imagine How Youll Feel Trying To Open This Game!BUT! If Im Wrong And You Can Still Open The Game, Id Give It A Try, Overall Its A 7 Out Of Eleven For Me...
