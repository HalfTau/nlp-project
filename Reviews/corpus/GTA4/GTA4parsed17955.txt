GTA IV is an amazing game to play... if you could even play the game. Due to GFWL shutting down, any new purchases of GTA IV will be blocked from online play and saving on singleplayer. Do not buy this game. I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It will not work and you will be throwing money at Rockstar for a game with broken DRM.
