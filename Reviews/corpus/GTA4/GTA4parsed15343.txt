I got this game and the Episodes from Liberty City for 6. However, even for such a low price, this is still not worth it. My computer exceeds the hardware requirements for this game, and yet it still lags on minimum settings. Also, saving requires a Live profile. When something as basic as saving the game requires an account, thats just horrible. Its a hassle and playing a game shouldnt stress me out like that. Why should saving require any sort of account? Why cant I just save my save game to the computer like EVERY OTHER GAME? Overall, Id say that if you want to get a Grand Theft Auto game on Steam, you should get San Andreas.
