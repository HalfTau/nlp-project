Grand Theft Auto IV is my favorite game from Rockstar games. Period Now, if we talk about the story it starts off weak but funny, with your cousin roman and Bruice, you start doing this small drive jobs where the action and fight lacks off this missions, but you always have the cut scenes and dialogues to make it interesting, as you progress through the story you realize what a good soldier Niko is and why he wants revenge of those who betray him and the campaign jumps from driving simulator to Vietnam simulator, with explosion cinematic kills and a lot of action scenes.But enough of the single player, now MULTIPLAYERThe base of the whole game with Rockstar first time introducing an open word to the online community with a lot of game modes and 16 player capacity, back in the day this game was flooded with players around the whole place where you can either make friends or enemies, but it didnt matter a lot back then if you got killed since the weapons are scatter around the whole map almost in every corner so you didnt had to worry about losing it all, and also there wasnt money, since money was your XP to level up instead of buy things, the player was granted a lot of freedom if we talk about the free mode, with everything unlocked, being able to for anywhere in the vehicle you want, but most of the time people would hang out at the airport where  modders would log in mostly on the weekend nights to blast a party there, back then there wasnt a lot of cheaters, where people abuse the power to level up and kill people instantly just to be jerks, there was people but it was really weird to find them, the most common people was the modders, that kid at your school who was form another country  and he was the most popular for coming from the outside and he got everything, games, money, and he always shared to keep his popularity levels growing, that was the modders on GTA IV, spawning a lot of vehicles in the airport with different colors, neon lights before they were something in GTA, colors that you wont see in the game, even vehicles that only where available in the campaign, sometimes even the modder would let you get in his car and start flying around just to show off his skills but it was amazing and funny.
