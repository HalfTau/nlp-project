As a game, it is flawed in many aspects, but as an immersing experience, GTA IV is simply unparalleled. Its problems cannot and should not be overlooked, but none of them break the game, and there is just so much charm packed into the thing that you cant stay mad for long. Sure, just clipping a police car and having it turn into a chase that takes you far away from your intended target is an abominable frustration, but soon, like a puppy thats justin your shoes, the game will do something completely adorable to make you put down your beating stick and take it out for a walk.
