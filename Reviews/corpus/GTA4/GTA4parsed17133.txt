This is the hardest handling GTA ever. Its hard to walk straight, impossile almost to drive, difficult to fist fight, and awkward to shoot. Let alone that getting into the game after you have bought it takes an act of congress. GTA4 is a franchise killer in my opinion and I have bought and played every game in the GTA series. I also bought L.A. Noire but have never been able to start the game. Im done with Rockstar games.
