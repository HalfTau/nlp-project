Got this on sale for 5 with EFLC, and I have to say its not that bad as people say it is, but its still bad. Not only is it badly optimized the audio stutters like crazy when driving really fast listening to the radio. I dont know why but EFLC doesnt have this issue. Actually I notice how Rockstar added patches for EFLC, but not GTA 4! Hopefully Rockstar learned their mistakes and not mess up GTA 5.Id still recommend it to anybody who doesnt mind some issues, but rather just try and enjoy the story.
