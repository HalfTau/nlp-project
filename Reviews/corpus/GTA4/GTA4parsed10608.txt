I give up. Ive spent too much of my time just trying to launch the game. LAUNCH the game.Its unplayable. Absolutely, undoubtedly, entirely unplayable.Maybe the loving hand of God graces you and you can get past every barrier this game throws at you. What do you get?Lowest possible graphics settings that you cant change, and no textures! None! At all!I swear to God, how can such a heaping mess continue its blasphemous existence on Steam? Yeah, sure, theres other games that contend for the title of worst of all time on here, but at least you can play them. This game...this game is a joke.I know the review section is for reviewing the actual game. However, when you cannot even imagine getting to a state of playability, and numerous others are experiencing the exact same problems, you can only present what the game presents to yourself.
