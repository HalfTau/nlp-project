Firstly let me say I love this game and I think it revolutionised the franchise and had an incredibly moving story.However the PC port is awful and has been even known to lag on highend systems running gtx 970s. However it is possible to modify the game to run but can take some time to adjust.The story in this game is incredibly moving  and emotional and probably is one of the best in the series. There is even a number of choices that can affect the outcomes of the ending. Which was a first for the series and made the game more replayable.The gameplay of this game hasnt aged perfectly ranging from the gun mechanics and driving. Dont get me started on the driving the driving is awful in this game and was awful even back in 2008 and still frustrates me till this very day. Another flaw in the gameplay that feels very outdated is the fact that there is no checkpoint system meaning you must restart the entire mission if you fail.However these are only small gripes with an overall awesome game which I love very dearly and could play for hours. However the multiplayer community is very small and dying as the game is moving on to 8 years old now and is full of hackers and cheats.
