I cant say the new update helped windows live or the performance of the game... But I can say it IS playable. The downside is if you cant make a profile via windows live or you try and sign in, it wont let you sign in... Basically meaning you cant play multiplayer. So dont buy this game expecting to play this game with friends. I do recommend you buy it for nostalgia on the other hand. The single player campaign is still extremely enjoyable. Running over predestrians as you hear their bodies make contact with your car going over 100 miles an hour... Ah... Great times.Edit I dont know whats been going on with the game lately but suddenly it doesnt want to launch at all now. Itll load for about 2 seconds, then freeze, tabatl to come back into the game.... Freezes again. I really want to find a fix so I can finish this game but I just cant find one. P
