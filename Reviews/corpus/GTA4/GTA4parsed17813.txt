WORST PORT EVER!3 DRM Systems1st Steam which is awesome and actually works.2nd RockstarGames SocialClub which works sometimes3rd Games for Windows Live which wont work!As soon as I got the game to work I couldnt change my graphic settings!After 1 h of googleing I found my solution!Then I finally wanted to play but Rockstar Games Anti Social Club cant connect to its own servers....5 Minutes later im finally beeing able to start the game but then GfWL kicks in and suddenly refuses to log into my account!In my opinion get the console versionThis game is not worth the effort to get it working on your PC
