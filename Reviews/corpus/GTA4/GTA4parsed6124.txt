UPDATE Ryzen 1600, RX 560, still runs like crap bwahahah.PROSBetter story than GTA V, which just felt like infinite heists.Despite mediocre graphics, the game has aged really well.As is with every GTA, you can waste hours at a time on it.CONSDespite aging well, it needs third party visual patches bad bloomYou need a DLL XLiveIess to save your game nowProbably the most horribly optimized game in modern PC historyI need to expand on just how terrible the optimization is. It doesnt have many glitches and the glitches that exist are your typical funny GTA glitches, but the performance of this game is dreadful. My GTX 650 is above and beyond even the top GPUs of 2009 and the game struggles with high res shadows, which still look blocky and overall like crap. Without shadows the game is almost unplayable, as if everythings made of mold.GTA 5 runs better than this, and thats really saying something.
