Im so glad i bought this game for pc and not  consoles. The multiplayer. What can i say. I have some great memories from back in the day. Just download simple native trainer and go have some fun with ur friends. If you are looking for a 3rd person shootter where you can deathmatch and do boringlike that then buy this for ur console. Game doesnt really have that good graphics or they were good back then, but its the color world they decided to use for this game brown and grey that makes me hate the graphics.
