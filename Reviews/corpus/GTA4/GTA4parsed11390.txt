The story here is great and tells it well  but this is only an okay port of the console game.A game where you spend most of the time driving through boring streets, doing repetitive quest. This game regulary gets 9/10 and you have to wonder why. Quickly decents into a grind after you marvel at the beauty and scope of it, then you get bored and rarely come back to finish it.Oh, and they made another one....
