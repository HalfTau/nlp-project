I highly recommend everyone to NOT buy this game for PC. Waste of 20 for a few good reasons...1 Doesnt even run most of the time. 2 It is mandatory to make a Windows account and Rockstar account. 3 Even IF you get the game working, you will have to sign in during the loading screen, causing the game to be locked on the loading screen. Same goes for Episodes from Liberty City.
