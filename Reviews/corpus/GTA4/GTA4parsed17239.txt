Great game, horrid port.The game runs slowly on my PC which can run a game like Far Cry 3 on max settings, and the multiplayer is downright the worst multiplayer ive ever had trouble with.The hour and a half ive put in this game so far, is JUST FROM TRYING TO MAKE THIS GAME WORK ON MULTIPLAYER.Buy it on PC for mods, at least.
