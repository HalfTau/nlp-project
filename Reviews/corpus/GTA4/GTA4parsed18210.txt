I played this game to completion, but it was boring. BORING.I am comparing this to San Andreas.GTA4s missions are standard openworld boringness.In San Andreas, you had to steal a motorcycle while wearing a clown suit and then chase after a enemy on another motorcycle on top of a moving train. At the end of the train, you crash your motorcycle into a helicopter and killing your enemy on the way down and landing in the water.In GTA4, you drive to point A to point B. Then you steal the bosss car. Then you drive it back. Dont make a dent!GTA4 is boring. Get Saints Row 3.
