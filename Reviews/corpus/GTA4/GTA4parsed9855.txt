Having put 4 ing hours trying to get GFWL working and having to skip it which means my game does not ing save and then the game not ing working well at all  trying on one Intel and one AMD with one time it ran at about 5 fps on high on this PC I was able to run Skyrim at 60 fps on high and it wouldnot let me turn down the ing graphics because PC ports and another time only the fucing props loaded in I can safely say that this is the worst ing port ever!!! You want to play a good sandbox game, go play any other ing GTA game or a Saints Row game because this ing port is t!! !
