First off, I just want to say that I love Grand Theft Auto IV. Truly a great game and an enjoyable experience. However, I cannot recommend this game on PC. If you have a PS3 or XBox 360 I highly recommend that you purchase a copy of this game for your system. Its almost a decade old so you should be able to find it for cheap, especially if its a used copy. The PC port is awful though. Its literally impossible to play without a mod called XLive. In order to save in GTA IV you need to sign into Games For Windows Live. That shouldnt be a problem, right? Well it turns out that Games For Windows Live isnt even an available service anymore. You cant sign into it because they discontinued it. You would think that Rockstar would update the game to not require something thats impossible to log into. You might not think saving is too big of a deal, but GTA IV is a big game. You probably will not want to finish it in one sitting, especially if youre going for 100 completion. I hope you give this game a chance, but definitely avoid it on PC.
