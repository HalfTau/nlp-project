For me, before the release of GTA5, San Andreas was the pinnacle of the GTA series. While this wasnt bad, it stripped away too many of the fun, customization elements and crazier freedoms that SA had. The smaller city was also a bit of a downer but the massive jump in graphics and sound made up for those negatives.But... I cant recommend this game for the PC. Not a good port of the consoles version at ALL, consistently slow, glitchy, poor code optimization, crashes, apparently has bigger issues with Win8. Just, if you really want to try GTAIV go with either console version.
