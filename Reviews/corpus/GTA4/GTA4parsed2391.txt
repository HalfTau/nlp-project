a 9 year old game only worth playing still because of the extensive mod library, except the creators of the game dont want you to mod their games anymore, because theyd rather nickel and dime you for their future paid mods setup, no doubt.If you dont own it already, skip it, there is nothing here that you wont find in another game.
