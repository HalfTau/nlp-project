I really like this game it is almost best GTA i have ever played! I dont have Money or Computer to run GTA V so i have stay on GTA IV! I have only 512 MB Graphic card NVidia GeForce 9500 GT So i cannot run it on maximum but can get from it low details and textures normal! Recommending this game to everyone who Loves Simulators Because GTA IV has the best physics of all time and it has better fighting system and logic than GTA V! Wow Rockstar! For some reason i cant run app on steam so im running it trough Games For Windows Live and trough launcher that is not started trough steam so really i have i think some 180 Hours played! WOW! It will be fine if they will add all the physics and logic from here to GTA VI Or in update to GTA V! RECOMMENDING TO EVERYONE!!!! !
