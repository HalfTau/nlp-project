BROKEN GARBAGEI bought this game since it released on steam and straight off the bat, this game was riddled with problems. From memory card being misread, to not even launching the game, this has been a handful trying to get it to work. Unfortunately, Rockstar doesnt give any s about this game because GTA V makes them more money, so there is no way to ever play this game properly.
