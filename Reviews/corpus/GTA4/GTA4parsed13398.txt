I bought this game a long time ago for the xbox 360 and immediately loved it. The game is a little deaper than your average GTA game, but still retains the humor which is signature to the franchise. Unfortunately, you will not get that from this version. This is the worst port of a game ever. It is not optimized for PC, and additionally, even after to tweak the INI files and settings to unlimit the game on your GPU, it will lag and freeze to roughly 519 fps. It is likely you will not be able to play this game, and more so, you will not be able to get you money back once you buy it. STAY AWAY! SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR WALLET. NOT EVEN WORTH IT WHILE ITS ON SALE. LEAVE!
