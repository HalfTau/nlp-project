This game has a long great and vast storyline! Unfortunatly i never played the whole thing I do recommend this game to users who like having fun control in Grand Theft Auto, such as being able to edit people, vehicles, buildings, textures, etc. This game is perfect for creating/adding mods! you can act like its roleplay with mods that give you tickets when you speed or go through red lights, you can have HD Graphics, The WTC, Tsunamis and so many more. If you dont know if you want to buy this game check out this websiteit is loaded with over 1000 playable mods created by others like you. I personally love the modding community and love this game for its capability of modding. Without mods the game i would rate is about 6/10 with mods I would say 9/10. Yet again not 10/10 cause i believe no game is perfect and has flaws. The reason 6/10 is because the handling is not the best and needs to be improve same with the graphics. Overall I would say purchase this game as it is worth every penny!
