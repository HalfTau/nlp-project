Okay, so heres the deal. GTA IV is an awesome, epic, great game. The problem is just that its showing its age.First of all, after installing on Windows 8 it refused to move past the Rockstar Social Club signin. Then, after I figured out that the problem with that was GFWL and fixed it with an updated GFWL client, I found myself locked at 800x600 resolution and low textures, despite having a brand new, good gaming computer. So, to fix that requires a couple of command line arguments, and then BAM GFWL needs an update that crashes, too.So, I got all of the technical issues sorted, and was actually getting down to enjoying my time Nico in Liberty City. After about five hours of gameplay, a new issue arose. Random crashing to the desktop during driving sequences. After spending literally hours trying to get this game to work, I called it quits. Go play the game on an Xbox or PS3 and enjoy it, but if unless youre rocking a system that was topoftheline when GTA4 came out, Id stay away from this Steam version. Its just not worth the hassle.
