People complaining about Open IV being shut down and Take Twos modding policy  Rockstar talked Take Two out of being idiots, and OpenIV is freely available once again.People complaining about GFWL not working on Windows 8 It works just fine if you grab the latest installer from Microsofts website.  Ive used it on Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and currently on Windows 10.Its a fantastic game, and more recent patches have vastly improved the optimisation on PC.  If you like GTA you should absolutely play this.
