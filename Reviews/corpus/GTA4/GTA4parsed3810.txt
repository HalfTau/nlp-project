Grand Theft Auto IV is, in my opinion, the best entry in the entire series.  The storyline is well thought out and emotional, with rich dialogue.  The game mechanics are also incredibly realistic.  At some points throughout the game, you will find yourself genuinely caring about some of the characters, which is rare in most games today.
