Games for Windows Live? COME ON! This is including only save your last checkpoint and play with ur friends. If you didnt enter to Windows Live acc. for a long time and forgot ur password you wont get a new password and enter your account. Cuz directed website blocked by the GFWL so you can not change/remember etc. your password. It needs invitation system on Steam and much better saving system. SUCKS!
