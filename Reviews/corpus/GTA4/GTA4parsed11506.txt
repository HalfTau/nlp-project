I cant play it because it uses games for windows live or whatever rubbish. And I dont want to be in the Rockstar Social Club. I hated the story that I gave up with the narrative side of this game about 4 hours in when I played it on the tation. I did enjoy just blowing stuff up with the cheats enabled though. I think thats why I bought this game again.
