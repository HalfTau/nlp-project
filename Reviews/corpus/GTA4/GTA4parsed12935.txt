Gta San Andreas was the first Gta game i played ... with 15 DNow i played Gta5 on PS3 its super awesome but i write a Review over GTA 4 so ...I love Open World games, Driving cars, Shooting peoples for no reason Just in games PSo i think the Story could be better the Grafiks are super good and the Gameplay makes fun but to control a Car is so annoying in GTA 4.The Multiplayer is fun doing Missions Or CTF DM games vs Players is really funny 8/10
