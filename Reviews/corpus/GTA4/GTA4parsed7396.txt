Wont play on windows 10 no Games For Windows Live support on windows 10 but from what Ive played on previous versions it ran pretty good. Fun, compelling storyline.Very choppy gameplay if youre running anything nvidia cuda or under. Had to turn the graphical settings to super poor just to get 20fps.Now I have a new laptop and it cant even play it due to windows 10.But not the fault of the game at all. I love this game!
