This game was released quite a while ago, and for the PC Release. It didnt go down so well. First off wer have some pros and cons. Generally the pros go towards the story and characters but the cons go towards the gameplay. In my opinion I really like this game. It really does bring out GTA but since I like the play GTA with friends and what not, this game brings the whole multiplayer down. The multiplayer is really just plain boring unless you try and make it fun which is possible since there isnt anything to do as you cant use money its not in the Multiplayer meaning the there are no shops or anything to spend your money on.But HEY! Its still fun!
