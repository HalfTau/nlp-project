If I had known I would need to create an Xbox LIVE account to play this game on my computer I never would have purchased it. To make everything even better, the process to try and create an account does not work, links are broken, it even uses Microsoft Edge which is, frankly, a joke. Would not reccommend, thanks Steam.
