Really nice gameplay, not so easy to run on my dual core laptop but... Still, when I run it on my desktop, its a very good game with nice graphics and very realistic in my opinion. Only bad thing is Games for Windows Live, but once you get that working and this is difficult might I add then its one of my favorite games.
