Yes, this is possibly the worst PC port in the history of mankind. And, yes, your cousin will contact you at the most unfortunate times to go bowling  though never on a mission. And, yes, the story is a bit more muddled and the protagonist  grumpier and less focused than usual for GTA games.But the city is big and full of interesting places, the cars are fun to drive and even more fun to steal, and there are lots of weapons to cause havoc with. It has a whole bunch of really engaging missions, and a lot of side stuff to waste even more time very entertainingly stunt jumps! killing pigeons! assassinations! stealing cars!. Particularly for people who know NYC, the version of Liberty City here feels like a real, living city.I spent 120 hours on my first playthrough and only wanted more Ive been back for another 65hour visit where I got to 100. Even with the popins and low frame rate, this is a real gem of a game. And, weirdly, Romans being so annoying just makes it feel more real  dont we all have that one friend/relative who wont take a hint?
