I really love this game over all the grand theft auto series. Even though the story was kind of cliche, there was something about it I always loved. I had to fix it though because of windows 8 which takes a little bit of patience. DONT GET WINDOWS 10 IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS. It just completely screws it up, why bother updating anyway.10/10 would bowl again.
