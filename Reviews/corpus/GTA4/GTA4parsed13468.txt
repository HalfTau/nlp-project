The worst GTA ever made, not fun at all  and runs terribly even on highend modern pcs. If you like sandbox games, get Saints Row 3/4, Just Cause 2 or Sleeping Dogs, those are infinitely better on every aspect, especially story and gameplay.Plus, Rockstar just updated GTA San Andreas to TAKE OUT content from that game, that now has less music, worst graphics they took out the 1080p resolution option and ERASED all the savegames from everyone, plus introduced a lot of bugs. As theres a chance theyll do this to other games, its definitely not recommended to buy anything Rockstar on Steam imagine you buy the game and then the developer takes out content from it after you already spent your money  thats illegal, every country has consumer laws against things like this, but thats exactly what Rockstar did.Also, this is one of the last games with GFWL on Steam, and Rockstar gave no word about replacing it  when that service finally closes, this game will be unplayable.
