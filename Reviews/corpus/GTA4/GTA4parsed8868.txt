I will not recommend this game at all.At first u need to download xlive files from internet as it does not comes with game itself.Then their is a bug dedicated video memory.Even if you have a heavy system the bug is their.Then the problem that i am having is that my game starts but i only go till menu and i wont load.Its like loading but i waited for 30 minutes but it didnt load.I reinstalled the but still i had the same problem.....Hey Rockstar either return me my money or help me run my game.
