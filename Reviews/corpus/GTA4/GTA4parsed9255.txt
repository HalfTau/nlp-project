Autosave feature of Windows XLive is a disaster, it keeps corrupting itself, so it fails all the time. Apart from that, it is so clear that this game is designed for console players not for pc gamers. Thats why, you have to lower down the graphic settings to play this game smoothly in 2015! on medium end pc, I wish this game was ported to pc slowly so that we could play nicely, sorry Rockstar, this is your worst GTA game for me.
