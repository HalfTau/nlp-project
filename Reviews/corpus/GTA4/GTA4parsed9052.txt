I found GTA4 an absolute nightmare to set up and get to work properly. First it wouldnt start at all, turns out downloading Games for Windows Live fixes that. Then it wouldnt let me change the Graphics options  800x600 when youre running GTAV in HD just looks wrong  it wouldnt let me do that, I need to go to Properties and add the line norestrictions to solve that. Then it wouldnt let me sign in to Windows Live in game, which means you cant save. Turns out there was an update to the terms and conditions since I opened the account which I needed to agree to, but there was absolutely nothing to tell me that, until I logged onto the account in a web browser and started clicking through the tabs one by one.It finally works now and Id say it was just about worth the hassle. I spent ages on this game on the XBox 360, and the grahics in HD are a lot nicer, and the game is still as much fun as when I first played it. But before you buy, ask yourself if you want to spend a good ammount of time fixing problems before you play it hopefully what I wrote will save somebody some time!
