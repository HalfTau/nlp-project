tried to do it the right way and link a rockstar account.  the site said it had issues with linking some windows for games crap to it, so ok ill just look up some way to overright it.  tried that and for some reason i cant copy a specific new launcher because i cant give myself admin privlidges despite telling the system that i want to run as admin.Seriously, if you want this game look online for some torrent of it.  Chances are the guy who put it online already deactivated the social club, and even if he didnt its better you start from there rather then give Rockstar the satesfaction of pocketing your 520.
