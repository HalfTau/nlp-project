The game is great, fun and all that, but the very bad optimization for PC makes it too clumsy, with stutters everytime, lag, low framerate and so go on, i hope they do some patching to solve all those issues, but to be honest? i doubt they care, with GTA V coming next year they will just let it broken as it is.Dont buy it until it is fixed.
