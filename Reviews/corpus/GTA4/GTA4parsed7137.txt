Loved the game on PS3...had to play again. People kept saying how broken it is but Im not seeing the problem? I have had absolutely no trouble getting the game to run without having to download any extra patches and Im not exactly running a topoftheline rig, here... The ports a tad glitchy, but nothing that renders the game unplayable. Still a favorite. 3
