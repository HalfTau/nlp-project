Doesnt work anymore, Social Club doesnt work now so no mulitiplayer. Rockstar nor Steam seems to care its broken now. Garbage, Ask for a refund as I got one, or better yet dont bother spending cash on it to begin with. Left a real bad taste as I hear horror stories GTA5 is just as bad support and Social Club issues, No thank you...
