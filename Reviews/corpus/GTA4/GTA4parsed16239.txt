The brand new video editor will offer tons and tons of extra gameplay and makes up for a lot of the waiting time the PCgamers had to endure. Gamers that still arent satisfied can wait for the hundreds or so mods that will appear after the release. And with that enough gaming material to last at least until Grand Theft Auto V shows up.I highly recommend who have the game or want to buy the game, to have graphics enhancers on, it make the graphics looks so good that it surpasses GTA 5s graphics, you can for on this information on YouTube, just type GTA 4 graphics enhancers.
