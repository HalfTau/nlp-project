If you just squeal with glee from stealing cars and attacking nameless, soulless people on the streets, and thats enough to keep you entertained, then buy this game. However, if you dont like the feeling of being completely alone in a massive world full of people, then you may want to pass on this title. What I mean by that is that NPCs are everywhere in this game. It has the highest population of most any kind of game around, but there are a tiny number of characters in the game. This game isnt that fun for me. Unless its extremely fun, I need a really good story and likable or even interesting characters to keep me on board.The characters Ive seen thus far in this game all range from annoying to jackasses. I hate almost every character I see in this game. I stated playing the sequel, GTA V, and Im liking or at least somewhat amused by almost every character, so its not the series as a whole having a problem, so much as just GTA IV seems to have terrible characters, at least early on. I have zero motivation to continue playing this game because I dont like any of the people my character interacts with, I dont like my character, and I just dont give a damn about the events taking place in the story so far. Criminals should be interesting and exciting to watch in a work of fiction you are to be on the side of not boring or annoying. Just pass on this game. If you really want something like this, just get GTA V when it goes on sale.
