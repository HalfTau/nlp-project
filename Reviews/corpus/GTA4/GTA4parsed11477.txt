Harasses you on startup for some social account, can skip to play single player  then forces you to get a windows live account in order to save any progress in single player. Account requires your email, some personal information, validation, an update, and an install of some windows live bs which also requires you to turn off the game so it can install.I cannot remember the last time it was such a lengthy, unnecessarily frustrating ordeal to just get to play a game. I feel like Im being punished for bothering to buy a legitimate copy.
