Crappy controls, poorlyplaced checkpoints, a nearlyimpossible last mission, and just a generally not fun experience. What was Rockstar smoking when they did this game?Controls are slow at best and infuriatingly clumsy at worst. Nico takes too long to figure out ladders and cover. Both mouse/keyboard and gamepad controls are shifty and unreliable.If you fail a mission, youre lucky if you get a checkpoint halfway through. This makes things irritating games should be FUN, not annoying and repetitive much like the mission structure kill a horde of guys, advance to next point, kill another horde of guys. The Elder Scrolls has had a quicksave feature since the NINETIES. Why cant other developers figure out that this is a superior system in every conceivable way?The finale involves a humanlyimpossible button spam event that amplifies the above issue. Im having to resort to a Logitech macro to spam the spacebar fast enough. GOD DAMMIT DEVS one keypress should be enough to do ANY action sitting there having to spam a button to do something is ANNOYING and makes the character seem physically weak.And to top it all off, the mood is dark and depressing, unlike previous titles with their overthetop action and energetic mood.If you want to experience the new Liberty City, I advise you to check out the standalone DLC Ballad of Gay Tony. A much better mood, and most of the missions have more forgiving checkpoints. It also has a tank. Dont bother with the base game the story is not worth the frustration.
