Grand Theft Auto 4 is simply one of the most amazing games Ive ever played. Although GTA 5 has since been released, when GTA 4 was released, it was a significantly improved game in comparison to main GTA that was released being San Andreas. I have personally completed the story on both the PS3 and my PC multiple times, and it is really good. However, if you play any GTA game, its ovbious that youre not only going to play for the story. You will certainly freeroam and honestly, the freeroam of this game is better than any other game. However, the general feeling of the game is also relly good and personally, I find it to be better than the latest version of GTA GTA 5.In conclusion, I fully reccomend this game to anyone who is intersted in buying it. However, if youre still in doubt then just google GTA 4 Gameplay / Walkthrough and I believe that youll have no more doubts in buying and also playing the game.
