One of the best Grand Theft Autos of all GTA Series.Storywise,its my favorite.The atmosphere,the Characters,the backstory is nicely done compared to GTA V Story which feels a Hollywood Movie.Especially the Cutscenes are somehow better than the one in GTA V.I played the game back in 20082010 over and over again but it never got boring.You play as Niko Bellic, a former teenage soldier who fought in the Yugoslavia Wars.His main goal in life is to find the only person that betrayed and nearly killed him during the Wars.To find that special someone he have to work with the Irish mafia,the russian mafia,a couple of Italian mafias,the FBI and manyGTA V you just jump from heist to heist without deep inpact.From a Gameplay Perspective, GTA IV is also my favorite of all GTAs.I love the clunky car handling and the physics,the sound effects,the AI and the way how NPCs hobble away if you nearly kill them.If you hit someones car with a bat or something else they get out and attackGTA V people dont give a damn about their car.One of the few things that GTA V did better is the Multiplayer.The only negative thing is you need Games for Windows LiveGFWL to save your game, which is ridiculous in my opinion.I had to retrieve my old Xbox Live account and after i logged in 10 times it finally worked.
