Utter.This is 17GB worth of bugs in the form of a game.Doesnt launch at first, requires manual upgrading of GFWL. Once done with that, theres a huge chance it wont detect neither your GPU nor the integrated graphics processor  and would start running on the AMU i.e bad, bad, bad.If you do some reasearch, youll run into many hacks and weird methods of getting it to think theres more memory available to it, but that wont work either. You will also run into patches released by Rockstar, but guess what? These fail to even install.Conclusion dont waste your money/time/bandwidth on trying to acquire this piece of youll regret it.Complete disappointment.It may say I have 5 hours on record, but believe me when I say that I did not spend ONE minute actually playing the damn game.
