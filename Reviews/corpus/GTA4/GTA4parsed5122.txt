The game itself is amazing, but dont even think about trying to run it on pc. This game took me forever to get running, after countless x live less downloads and modifications to shortcuts but none of them worked. Social Club is the reason for this in that you have to log in to play online, you click play offline and it asks you to log in, not so bad, but Social Club shut down........When you get it to run, the game is locked at 800x900 and you have to change properties to get it to run right, then it keeps freezing and crashing for me. Pirating the game seems the only option for me to play this game. Get it if you want, but if you do, youre in for a headache or two trying to run this game properly.
