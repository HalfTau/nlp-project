One of the best sandbox games out there. Its like a Just Cause, but better JC is awesome too, dont get me wrong!ProsTypical GTA styled game, this style works very well!Many quests with a pretty good storyBig map could have been bigger thoughGood level design streets feel like streetsGood graphicsGood multiplayerVery enjoyable gameplay  many things to do, considering how old this game isConsThis game wants to drain all your time, and this is what made me stop playing the game, and come back to it later. The story could be good, but when you have to do useless missions for the new characters, or you have to wait half hour for a goddamn phone call to progress in the main storywhich again could be really good, it can make some people sick of the game for a timeBuuuuuugs not a big problem either, them bugs are more like funny then annoyingOne of the worst consol ports poorly optimized, and sometimes the textures decide to disappearOverall id recommend this game, but it has some really big mistakes.
