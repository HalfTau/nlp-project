One of the best games ever.Horribly optimised but runs good on LOW.Very immersive. The EFLC DLC is completly awesome.I already own two retail copies. BUT had to buy another one for steam account! Really!The movement and cover system work great. The gameplay time is INSANELY long. This game lasts forever. Until you complete the first campaign  then it last for ANOTHER story! And THEN there is another story!Gooooood stuff. Have to recommend. Feel free to add me for questions and help.
