This game wont run for me no matter what i do. I have followed everything and anything i could find on steam and around the web. Social Club starts up no matter clicking play offline or play it goes away and nothing happens. This seems to be a major problem with this game, not just on steam. Anyways I would recommend picking this up for the ps3 over the PC version. Game play itself is just great. Loved it for the ps3. Dont throw your money away when it just wont run.
