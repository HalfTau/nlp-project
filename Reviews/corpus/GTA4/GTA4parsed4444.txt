Not worth it in my opinion, doesnt run well even with the latest patch. Huge fps strutters with a modest rig GTX 960, i52320, 8 GB RAM.Would have loved to play it through for once, but really cant even at its current state.Cant really say anything about the game itsefl, if played on a another platform. Might be fine.20 hours of playtime by my cousin 34 years ago, messing around with cars.
