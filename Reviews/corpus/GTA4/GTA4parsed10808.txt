So I played this game before on the PS3 and wanted to see how it runs on a gaming PC. But then I havent even started the game and already I got bombarded by Rockstar Social Club and Windows Live login screens! Game wont even let me save unless Im logged in to that Windows thing Jumped through hoops just to play, but in the end I say  it, Its not worth all the extra hassle to go through. The game itself is great, but all those extra stuff just makes me want to break something, so no thanks, bye! P
