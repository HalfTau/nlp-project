This game is poorly optimized for PC. It WONT work on Windows 8 or 8.1. You need a Games for Windows Live GfWL to just be able to save your singleplayer game and also to play multiplayer. You will also need a Rockstar Social Club to play multiplayer. Plus, the game only gets about 3040 fps on most good graphics cards. Dont get me wrong, GTA 4 is still a good game. It has a great story line and its a lot of fun, but for now, getting it on PS3 or Xbox 360 is a lot better than getting it on PC.
