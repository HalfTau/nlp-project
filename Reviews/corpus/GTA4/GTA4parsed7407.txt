First I was unable to login with the correct password and email to the rockstar social club, so youtube video to find a fix. Then it did not start so youtube video to find a fix download microsoft live Then I was able to run the program but I was unable to change the resolution from 800x600 because it exceeded my computers hardware potential, so youtube video to fix it. Then I need registration to windows live to be able to save so I ing removed this ing crap from my computer.
