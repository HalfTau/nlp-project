This is the worst PC port of all time. And believe me when I say Ive seen some awful ports. At least with those, you can see the ground!Seriously, half the time the road is invisible. And dont say I just have a bad system GTA V runs perfectly on my PC. I am honestly baffled. Half the textures are missing, the other half looks like the LOD textures that you see from far away. Id rather play the console version. Rockstar really dropped the ball on this one. No wonder this game got mediocre to poor reviews. This is not getting a thumbs up from me. It says Ive played for over an hour, but thats just how long Ive adjusted settings, read guides, and other things to get the video part of this video game. This was a waste of 20. Burning the cash wouldve been a better use of it. At least if I burned 20, itd catch some attention.Dont let this review turn you away from GTA IV, though. On the 360, its one of the best GTA games Ive ever played. Entertaining physics, enjoyable gameplay, and mindblowing graphics for 2008. So you should still get this game if you wish! Yes, after a paragraphlong rant and a thumbs down, Im defending it. Thats how great GTA IV is, and how terrible the port is.
