Update This game doesnt even run anymore. Waste of money even if you like it.A tedious sandbox game filled with unlikable characters. The plot moves along so slowly that its essentially impossible to die in the first two hours unless you try. The car handling is irritating and the shooting is never satisfying. Cases of mechanical consistency being sacrificed in favor of a few tedious lines of dialogue abound, and youll find that car chases often have a designated end and you cant ever catch up. The developers seemed more interesting in telling their plodding story than engaging the player in interesting gameplay. Its clear that Rockstar does not like its userbase.Niko, despite at the beginning expressing a desire never to be someones tool again, falls into the trap of killing scores of individuals right out of the gate.It comes with a stunning three different forms of DRM attached, andFor fans of sandbox games, consider the Saints Row series or Sleeping Dogs, and for meaningful plotbased games, consider a game like Spec Ops The Line. GTA 4 brings nothing worthwhile to the table.
