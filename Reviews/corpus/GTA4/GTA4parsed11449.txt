Game was good, lots of missions and side missions to do, map isnt to big so you dont need to spend ages driving around however the gps can be a bit dodgey at times and you end up getting pretty loss. The tutorial is probably the worst part of the game, i almost quit trying to just dodge a knife attack but once you get pass  that you dont have to do hand to hand combat anymore and the game becomes fun. Not many weapons to choose from but they have the basics and vehicles are pretty crappy as are the radio stations but the option to listen to music on your own computer is a bonus. Graphics are not the best but didnt bother me as it was still really fun to play. It does have some performance issues on pc which i noticed when i first installed but look on google and steam forum their are quite a few fixes so hopefully one will work for you.
