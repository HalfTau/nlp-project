Great games, though I did have a issue running it on my new windows 8.1 had to go change me account to a windowsLive to get access to the steam game, just a heads up. It confused the hell out of me, but it worked, just have to remember to put my LIVE pw into my pc login instead of the old one lol dang technology pNeeds some mods though after playing gtav  LOL
