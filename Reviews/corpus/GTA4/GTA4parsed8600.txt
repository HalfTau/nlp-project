Grand Theft Auto IV is in my opinion, the best GTA game so far. The city seems to come more alive than in any of the other games. The story and characters are a lot darker and a lot more gritty than previous games, giving it a more realistic feeling. All the characters have a lot of depth and backstory. I do recomend getting a console port of this game though because of constant frame rate drops, and the requirement to use Windows Live.
