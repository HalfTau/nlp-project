Installs fine but then completely unplayable due to various combinations of Social club and Microsoft Games Live sign in BS.Everything says I have accounts on my email but never will complete the reset password processes as its says accounts dont exist. You know what, its not worth it.Supposidly I could still play without saving or achievements but after all of that I was left with a hard lock up due to Ms Games Live requring a Task Manager shut down.
