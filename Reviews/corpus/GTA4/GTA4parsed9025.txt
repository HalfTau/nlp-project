GTA IV is a very sad example of a PC game.Since building myself a new computer, I decided to download it again to see how well it runs.Heres my specsIntel i54690k  3.5ghz, OCd to 3.9ghz, quad core.16GB Corsair Vengeance Pro RAMNvidia GTX 960 2GBNow, youd expect a seven year old game like GTAIV, even a pretty intense one, to run flawlessly at 60FPS?No such business. While at times I had no issue reaching 55fps, generally in less intense areas like cutscenes or near trh beach, the game stuttered all over the place in more detailed areas like Romans house at the very start. This is pretty terrible.Now, I hear tell that GTA IV is probably a prime example of the worst PC port from a console game in existence, maybe besides Saints Row 2. Im inclined to believe that.Even after tweaking settings and telling the program that yes, I did have a lot of memory and a good graphics card, and feel free to use it all instead of constraining yourself, the stuttering did not go away.Now, all this would be irritating, but playable. The games certainly still playable, though the stuttering affects enjoyment. The storyline is pretty good, albeit darker and grittier than previous and future GTA installments.The best thing everWith the demise of Games for Windows Live, it is now nearly impossible to save your game. You must jump through hoops in order to get it to save offline, which means the online community is totally dead. Coupled with the fact that it uses FOUR methods of DRM Steam on its own, not an issue Social Club notoriously  Games for Windows Live  on release, dead now and unusable the much maligned SecuROM, well known and unstable.Youre gonna have a bad time.Four DRM systems all running at once, coupled with poor optimisation and a shoddy PC port, as well as serious issues with saving the game it asks you to sign into GFWL, which doesnt exist anymore  you have to use third party tools to even get the game able to save progress means that I would absolutely not recommend this once great game. Its too far gone to be worth buying anymore.
