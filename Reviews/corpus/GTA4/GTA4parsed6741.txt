The game doesnt even start. Social Club pops up, i press play, and nothing happens. A friend bought me this game which i realy wanted and i cant even play it. Why?Edit the issue was resolved after restarting the computer, which is still not acceptable. Even more so unnaceptable is being forced to go trough the crappy social club live service to even play the game, AND login trough Windows Live, yes, THAT Windows live, that nobody wanted and nobody uses, which is making its comeback as MicrosoftXbox app currently. Why isnt this cripple effect removed from the game like it was for Red Faction Guerrilla is mind boggling, or why Rockstar hasnt fixed Manhunt or released the sequel here as well, too busy milking GTA online I guess, ers.
