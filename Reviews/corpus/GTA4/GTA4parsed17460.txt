Great game, lots of hours worth of story mode, and cop chases of course. This game has a alot of moddable features such as custom vehicles to replace to stock ones and you can also add your own ones, but thats harder unfortunately. You can also change the map or find some maps to extend Liberty City with other places as well, also the GTA Online is fun. Playing with a friend that is.The bad thing about the game is that there arent really any extra missions you can do apart from the side missions once you finish the game, the only thing you can really do is do a cop chase or use LCPDFR and also there are a lot of hackers using trainers on the multiplayer part which is why I recommended playing online in a private lobby with friends. Most of the people play GTA 4 Online on the XBox 360 partially because of the hackers if that makes sense with you guys wondering where everyone is as well as playing GTA Online on GTA 5.So yeah, on top of the disadvantages and the advantages, this game is definitely a must buy. I recommend buying GTA 4 Complete so you can get the most fun you can, with GTA IV and the two DLCs, TLad The Lost and Damned and TBoGT The Ballad of Gay Tony. If youre aiming to get GTA 4 Complete, I recommend you wait for a deal like I did as its 30.00, especially if you want to buy the game at a cheap budget. Also one thing I recommend is that you dont crack the game as its not going to be as fun with the game cracked or pirated, especially when youll probably wont be able to play online but thats all for this game
