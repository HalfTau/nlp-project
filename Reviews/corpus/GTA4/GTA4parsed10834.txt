Id take Saints Row above this game anytime. Its not horrible, but SR is just better in every single way.Radio is funny, the rest of the game not. Missions are rather boring after a while. Hardly any way to customize your character. The aiming reticule shifts every time you lean out of cover and can hardly be moved for the first 2 seconds after moving behind cover. Driving! Oh, the driving is,,,, realistic not fun, you get used to it a bit, but you have to drive slowly most of the time or you will smash into a wall on every corner, especially if you dont have a very rare sports car which can not be saved to your garage or something like in SR so you have to find a new one if you have to leave it behind on a mission/die/blow it up.And most of all you cannot save the game unless you install Games for Windows Live and create 2! accounts windows account and xbox profile yes, on PC. You need a third account social club if you want to play with others or earn achievements. In case you dont know it yet GfWL is...wait, the guidelines say i have to be polite, sorry.Well, there are worse games, but i cannot recommend it, thumbs down.
