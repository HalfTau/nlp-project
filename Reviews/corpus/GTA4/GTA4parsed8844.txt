I downloaded this game and it forces me to make an account on social club. I do that then when i try to log in it says invalid password. I thought to myself fine I dont care I will just play offline. Nope when I tried that an error just pops up and closes the game. This game does not work... I just wasted my money I demand a refund from steam.
