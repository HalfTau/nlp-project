This game is not well optimised at all. I am playing on a gtx 950m 4gb laptop dedicated graphics card. This laptop is also equipped with an i76700HQ cpu, which is running at 2.6 GhZ, so its actually a gaming laptop. I am barely running at 30ish on 1080p, with medium graphics. This is not ok at all, because I am running GTA 5 on this laptop at 1080p, maxed out, at 3040 fps.You should not get this game on a laptop. I recommend a pc graphics card such as GTX 970 to run this demanding game 60 fps on a 1920x1080 resolution, highest settings...
