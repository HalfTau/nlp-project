I always liked GTA series. But this game pretty much ruined it.First you have to fight with Rockstar Social Club, everytime you launch the game. Then theres Games for Windows Live, that was also obviously put in there only to make life of paying customer miserable.After you get through all this, youll only discover, that controls react weird, melee combat is absolutely horrible and the way police works sucks too. NPCs are annoying and needy, and obviously have nothing to do, except for annoying you to go play darts with them. The only thing I like about the game so far is story, lets see how long that lasts.But in overall, this game is great example proving that piracy should be legal, because asking 20 bucks for it is almost like stealing.
