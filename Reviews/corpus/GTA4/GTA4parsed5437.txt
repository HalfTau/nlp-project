This game has unfortunately one of the worst PC conversions, ever.Wherever you touch, you will face with a problem.Rockstars Social Club is a nightmare. You will feel exhausted after multiple attempts to work things done.When you feel you handle the Social Club, then the disaster comes with your graphics. No, I mean even if you got the latest GPU, youll be getting low frame rates, sturdy game engine etc.Please buy yourself a Playstation 3, if you really want to play this game.
