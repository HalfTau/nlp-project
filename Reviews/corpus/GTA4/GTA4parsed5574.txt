GTA IV is an open world game of the popular franchise released in 2008. The game is set in Liberty City, which is clearly inspired by New York. You play as Nico Bellic, a Serbian who fought in the Yugoslav Wars and is still struggling with his past. Good beginning Good gunplay Some characters are interesting You can date some whacky people GTA 4 is a long game with a lot of different activities to discover. I felt that the protagonists lacked depth which could have been solved by good character development. But there wasnt any, sadly. The final mission is buggy due to being a console port. Some say that using Fraps fixes the issue since it caps the game at a stable 30 FPS rate. I have never tested it though. Story needed a twist. Bad radio music with mainly hip hop and rap songs. Missions consist mostly of driving and killing. The developpers could have been more creative and give us more choices. You cant fly an airplane. That was even a thing in older games of the same franchise. GTA 4 requires GFWL and Rockstar social club. If you are not interested into the multiplayer, you can skip the rockstar club registration. Its still annoying though.Id recommend buying GTA 4 if you are into these games and if its on sale. Still, I feel that they burned themselves with their average story and a lack of any remarkable character development.Replay value LowaverageRating 8/10Recommendation Yes
