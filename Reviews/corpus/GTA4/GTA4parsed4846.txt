I have updated this review to include the latest patch December 2016.The story of GTA 4 is incredible! Niko Bellic, who was living in the Yugoslavia and is unfamiliar with huge cities and the american way of life, visits his cousin Roman in the US and suddenly has to face the dirtiest, most criminal and most corrupt city to ever exist. Of course the story evolves out of this setting, driven by an experience Nico had during the Yugoslav Wars and by the decisions that are necessary to make a living. The writing, the protagonists and the art style fit perfectly and create an atmosphere, I have never experienced before.The missions arent made artificially difficult in any way. If you have to take out a single guy, you can approach or snipe him and shoot him in the face. Done, easy to take a life, no big deal. This greatly contributes to the atmosphere. What makes it difficult are the consequences of your actions. Hell, maybe you even liked the guy.If you have finished the main game, there is the Episodes From Liberty City expansion, which is on par.On the technical side, the game is old and it shows. It was a console port and came with framedrops, no multicore support and several detection issues 1GB GPUs for example. To get it to work with WIN 10 and without Windows Live, you had to invest 30 mins. In December 2016 however, Rockstar surprisingly released an update, which fixes those issues.I enjoyed GTA 4 more than GTA 5, because you get to know more. You play a single character, with friends, foes and family. You play in a city that you know by heart and almost feel at home. Its a bit scaled down and I think for good...which doesnt make GTA 5 a bad game by the way.
