Game was wonderful on the 360, but simply will not run on my PC. Definitely have the specs for it. Finally figured out how to bypass the problem many people have with the game not launching after the Rockstar screen...but now when I begin to change the graphic settings, the screen goes black permanently. Too much hassle to play, too much of a hassle to get a refund.
