As much as Im recommending this game because it is a great game and all, it has massive flaws.Social Club is avoidable, GFWL is not.Horribly optimized. Dropped all the way down to 10 frames per second in areas that werent busy.Clunky controls. Driving is slidey and hard to turn.Good parts, howeverGreat story and acting.Great characters.The game will manage to immerse you in the city as if its a real city.Good sandbox quality. You can grab an arsenals worth of guns and shoot up the nearest hospital if you want.NIKO, EES YOUR CAZAN! WANT TO GO BOWLING as I had a 5star wanted level.
