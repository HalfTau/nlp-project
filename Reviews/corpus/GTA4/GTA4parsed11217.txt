The DRM almost ruined the game for me. I spent hours, upon hours, upon hours, and finally FIXING yes, fixing the issue of G4WL and Steam, I was able to play GTA IV.Its the best game Ive ever played. Never have I been so satisfied with someone getting shot when theyre in the back seat of my car, me speeding away from the 50.
