The game itself is okay, I guess. Not really my cup of tea. Normally I wouldnt bother reviewing something like this, but this particular port is just awfully optimized for PC. Theres no other way go about it. Simply abysmal. And I still havent mentioned the ridiculous DRM. Dont purchase this. Dont even look at it. I wont bother with the specifics  this review just exists to lower the rating on here since by some travesty its still overall positive.
