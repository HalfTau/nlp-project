My overall feelings for this game are mixed, but slightly more positive than negative. If youre a huge fan of the GTA franchise, then you should definitely buy it. Great story, fun gameplay and a very detailed and interesting map for the low price of 20 dollars. I would even say that this game rivals or possibly even overcomes GTA 5 in the singleplayer sense. But when we start exploring areas outside of the singeplayer story/freeroam experience, the game gets pretty bad. The worst part of this game is the performance. Initially, I purchased this game because I wanted a GTA game that I could achieve good fps at I feared GTA 5 would be too much for my pc. It turns out I wouldve been better off trying to run gta 5. With specs that should be able to perform at 30 fps with normal graphics, I barely achieve 2530 on the MINIMUM SETTINGS. This is one of the most poorly optimized ports I have ever played, and it really takes from the experience. And of course, the multiplayer. Without any announcement, it mustve been shut down or had most of its functionality removed. I tried to make several accounts, tried to sign in to the social club several times to no avail. My friend has the same issue as well, at his house on better internet. Which is a shame, because this game actually had a pretty good multiplayer mode, and it seems like there was absolutely no reason to shut it down.My final verdict If you have a pretty good gaming optimized pc and you want a great GTA singleplayer experience, GTA 4 isnt a bad use of 20 dollars. Want to play multiplayer or have a below average pc? Play the newest game.
