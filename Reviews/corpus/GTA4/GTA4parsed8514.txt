If you had a windows Vista PC or a Windows XP PC. Fantastic you can play the game but experience the  glitches that happen. What i dont like about this game is that when you download it, you have to make a windows account to save your game? Why cant it be like JC2/JC3 and just save the game wthout any account? We paid aproximatly 14 for the game and yet have to make an account to get all the features that it provedes? There are certain updates that are needed for GTAIV that the user must download manually. The UPDATES fix NOTHING but make the game worse and unable to play. If you are like me and currently have a new version to windows not XP/Vista or older models then you might as well say good bye to the game unless you want to go into the game files and fix it, but that takes up time and it does not always work. The PC port was the worse build for this game as it seems like they have not thought about low end PCs and the comebackls for the near future. All i can say is 14 clearly well spent...
