Pretty hard to get mods working without doing a lot of setting up. Its easy to replace models, but installing actual useful and fun mods takes a Lot of setting up, and can be pretty rage inducing, especially when you end up having to reinstall the game because you messed up the original files. Also games for windows live, other than that, the game is pretty good by itself.
