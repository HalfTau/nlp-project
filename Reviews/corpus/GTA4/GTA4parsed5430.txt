Please note The game does not work out of the box but the fix is simple. I have written a detailed guide on how to make the game work hereReviewThe game isnt as pretty as a game like GTA V, but remember this game came out on Xbox 360 in 2008. For the age, the graphics work well. If the graphics bother you, there are a plethora of mods available to up the graphics on various sites.As with every GTA game, there is a lot of things to do in GTA IV. If you count for 100 completion, heres the breakdown60 the 90 story missions2 assassinations2 street races2 Chop shop collections2 Car thefts2 Drug deliveries2.5 Vigilante missions2.5 Police Most Wanted hitman missions5 Random Encounters5 Activities5 Special Activities5 Competitions2.5 Pigeon Hunter2.5 Stunt JumpsSourceI played this on 360 when it came out and I averaged about 90 hours by taking my time with the main story. Id estimate 2040 hours of additional content remains not counting story missions depending on your skill and time invested.Overall, the game can be fun. The initial setup issues are what cause 99 of the negative reviews on Steam. Social Club also does not work as of September 2016 when I write this post, so just ignore the login prompt for it on launch. However this also means that the multiplayer aspect is sadly inaccessible. Rockstar made a post on their support forums saying they were looking into it on 6 Oct. 2015 Source so its likely that it will never be fixed as it currently looks.Still, if you never played the singleplayer, thats completely working. Several of the characters from GTAV are in GTAIV and further expands on their original context in the series here.If you have any additional questions or concerns before buying the game that I have not answered here in my review, please leave a comment and I will append my review with the answer to your question.
