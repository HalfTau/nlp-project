Worse than V, Vice City, San Andreas and 3, but its hard to compete with those masterpieces. Ive logged countless hours in both GTA IV and its expansions on PS3, and while I knew the PC port was horrendous, I still bought it. In order to play, without loggin in to GFWL, just download a simple .DLL file and put it in the GTAIV directory. The optimization on the other hand is horrible, and I have to play on medium setting in order to almost maintain 60 fps, and Im using a GTX970 and an i5 4690k 4.0 GHz. Still, amazing game with great graphics, fantastic driving physics and good story line. I would recommend this if you know how to fix a broken game and if you have a computer better than mine.
