 Liberty City is quite large, nice to explore in! So many hidden Easter Eggs and features. Has tons of guns to use, and vehicles to drive! SemiDecent Story. Cousin, lets go bowling! Cars handle like boats. The Physics engine doesnt like to agree with the player. Niko doesnt wear his seatbelt. No Planes, and the Choppers dont work too well. Glitches out a fair bit. The game is just a pastel of Grey, and faded colors.7/10Yes!
