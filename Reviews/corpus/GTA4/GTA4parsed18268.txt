Dont buy in SteamTheres a conflict in the DRM between games for windows live, steam and Rockstar. The CD Key is incorrect in the steam version so you need to go to games for windows and trade the cd key for a valid one. In my case the games for windows live doesnt give a correct CD key so i cannot start the game.the PC version is terribly non optimized, random slowdowns, physics glitches. Geforce Experience suggests low textures even in a i7 and a GTX 660 Ti while Sleeping Dogs run beautifully with everything in maximum and HD texture pack, Saints Row 3 runs with eveything in maximum and both games looks better and runs smoother than GTA.Rockstar could solve the CD Key problems look at the Steam forum and in the Rockstar knowledge base, they know there is a problem and remove the Games for Windows Live DRM.The game itself is a great sandbox game. Play it in the PS3 or in the Xbox 360 cause its broken in PCUPDATE After Steam changed my serial number and the proper version of GFWL I managed to get the game running. Still not recommending due the bugs and the effort needed to put it running.now i can go bowling with my cousin
