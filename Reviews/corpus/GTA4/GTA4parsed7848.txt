I would love to be able to say what a great game this is but I cant as it is unplayable. On purchase you recieve a game key for the game which is invalid. After contacting steam support through numerous messages, they say that they cannot help and I need to look through forums for help and contact  the publisher. This has not yet been solved and with all the problems with Games for Windows Live around, it is looking unlikely to be solved soon.Really disappointed, as Ive wanted to play this game for ages and before starting the newer game.The game should not be for sale while it is unplayable and people who have purchased should be entitled to a refund. I will update this review when IF the problem is resolved.
