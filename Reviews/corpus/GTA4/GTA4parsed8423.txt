played it 2nd time after years .. still enjoyedtook me around 37 to 40 hours to complete the game main story missions and little bit hanging around,,, no side jobspros 1. good story and good ending .. there were some points where it got really slow and boring but it was good overall2. city looks good3. the best car mechanics in the series .. i feel its better than gta v .. its more on the realistic side4. overall gameplay mechanics is good .. shooting running etccons 1. very poor optimisation .. its poorly ported to pc .. so you may get less fps than u expect even though its a 2008 game..  i get more fps in gta v than gta 4 with almost same settings lol2. it may not work properly in windows 8 or 10 .. iam not sure .. just heard .. make sure you do some research before buying .. but it worked absolutly fine in my windows 7 with zero bugs crashes etc ..3. city does look good .. but its not even close to sanandreas .. theres nothing much to explore .. just buildings every where ..overall i recommend to try it if u didnt .. get it on a sale for a cheaper price because theres only single player .. i dont think anyone plays multiplayer at this time
