A few weeks ago I gave this game a positive review. It was already rather neutral back then, but I changed my mind. Just for the sake of being fair Ill list the good things nice storyline rather good graphics for a 2008 game well animated and great fun if your computer is too bad for GTA V  like mine...But now the gamebreaking stuffYou need 2 accounts to play it. One for the Social Club SC from Rockstar and one for Windows Live GFWL. The latter one isnt actually essential if you dont care about multiplayer though.GFWL is way too outdated and not really supported anymore. You use a microsoft account for it and for this you need a phone number. I really dont like to use my actual one, but then I found out that you can play GTA without confirming the phone number but just the email. So I didnt confirm the number and could play for a few weeks.. And then my GFWL suddenly got blocked because I didnt confirm the number.  The message said that I spammed junk mails. Of course I dont...The SC is a pain too. The login doesnt seem to follow any login, sometimes it works and most of the time it doesnt.But thats not even all. Installing the game takes a few hours depending on your confidence, how well youre prepared and your basic computer knowledge. Many people fail at this point and thus dont even get it to run. A real shame if you paid 20. Luckily I got it for 5 during the summer sale, but all the trouble it causes is really not worth it.
