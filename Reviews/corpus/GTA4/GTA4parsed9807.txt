I keep getting the same error code  SecuLauncher failed to start application. 2000 I have spent dozens of hours trying to fix it I have all the requirements and have spent of 3 hours of watching videos to fix it I tried them all none worked I tried deleting it and redownloading it and nothing works on gta 4 and Episodes from liberty city.So I either want a refund on both games or some way to fix this that actually works.
