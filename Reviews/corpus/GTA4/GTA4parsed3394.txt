A great game ruined by an abysmal PC port. Horribly unoptimized, and to play the game you need a Social Club account, and to play multiplayer you need GFWL.The only issue I have with the game itself is that sometimes the driving can be like trying to jerk off with sand paper. Yes, its as uncomfortable as it sounds.
