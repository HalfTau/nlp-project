This game is a technical mess. Games for Windows live, constant framerate issues with a large variety of different computer setups and crashes make this game a large pain in the rear for many people. Only buy this game on steam if you see it on sale for VERY cheap. It is not worth much more than 15 dollars at best even for the game of the year edition.
