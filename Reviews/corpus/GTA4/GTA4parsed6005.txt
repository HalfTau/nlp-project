Like most of you, I had to deal with the nightmare called GFWL  Rockstar Social Club. The second one is not fixed yet but at least I can play the game and GFWL works you need it to start the GTA. How to do that? Follow thisBasically I had to reinstall most of windows applications, make an xbox account, update GFWL in the game a few times and sign in. Its crazy that Rockstar thought it would be a great idea to include two online services in the game...However, it seems to be a cool game, something like GTA V Lite, though I have spent more time fixing it than playing so far.
