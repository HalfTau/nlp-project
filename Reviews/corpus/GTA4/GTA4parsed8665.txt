I love this game. It is fairly difficult to get the game to run on a lot of PCs, but once you get past that, its a pretty good game. Here are a few of my tips to get the game to workNow with all that out of the way, lets talk more about the game!Grand Theft Auto IV is very fun. The missions can become rather repetetive, but for this reason, you may want to do some other things around the city, like hanging out with friends or girlfriends, going to strip clubs, just driving around or taking rides in taxis, going on massive murder sprees, or just taking breaks from the game.Something great about the game is that, kind of like games from Telltale, choices you make tailors how the game will go. I wont give out any spoilers, but lets just say, you should have a backup of your save just before the end of the game, because the ending choice you make makes a huge difference.Although, there is a point in most games where it just gets boring. Say you didnt buy the DLC, and the base game doesnt have the spark anymore. To have some more fun again, you can download mods! There are many great mods from the game. Some of my favorites are the First Person mod, and the Traffic Load mod, which gives traffic more variety, and stops the annoying taxi bug, which occurs when you mod other cars in. There are also graphical mods to make the game look amazing, even almost real, if your PC can handle it.Long story short, its a very fun game, once you get it working. I would only recommend to buy this game when it goes on sale though, considering how much of a pain it is to get the game working, and that its not for everyone. Then, if you cant get it working, you only spend a couple bucks, rather than 20.Have a good one, everyone! If you have any questions about the game not working, feel free to message me or comment on my profile. I cant make any guarantees to help you, but I will try.
