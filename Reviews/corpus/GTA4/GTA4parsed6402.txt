You cant buy anything but hot dogs, weapons and clothes if I remember correctly. This is a GTA game ffs, the goal is to become rich in order to buy stuff, to live the dream. All other game had completely understood that since GTA III GTA  GTA II are different.I didnt even bother to finish the game when I understood that there was nothing that would happened after the end that make me able to use all that cash... Like, you know when you save your game and go kill everything for fun ? Well, dont save, you dont give a  cause you dont need your money. Go kill and kill again.Oh, I forgot, sometimes youll need money cause your character is so stupid hell drop his weapon forcing you to buy it again if you use the last bullet. Like... OhI dont have any rocket, this bazooka is useless.But even there, 15.000 is nothing.Well, if you only enjoy the storyline and dont give aabout money and buying cars or house or stuff like that, its not that bad of a game. But imo its the worst GTA ever made.
