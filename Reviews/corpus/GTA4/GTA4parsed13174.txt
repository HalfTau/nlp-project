this game was a wast of money i bought it and when it finaly downloaded i launched it and then it had a lancher so i clicked the thing to get in to the game and the window went away so i thought alright its loading the game but nothing was happoning so after 5 minuts it still would not load and then i went back to the lancher and it had a space to sign in to rockstar account so i thought i had to do that to launch the game so i made a account on the rockstar website and signed in on the launcher and pressed launch game and it did the same thing meaning the game would not work i even tried re instaling the game i dont know if its my computer or what but i want my money back.
