Requires some Microsoft gaming software crap, but both the games online features as well as Microsofts service have been updated, so now playing GTA4 is unplayable  you NEED to log in to 3 online accounts to be able to SAVE, however you cannot sign into ONE of those because Microsoft has updated its services. Thus, the game is unplayable, and makes me wish that I had pirated it instead.
