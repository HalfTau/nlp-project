GTA IV...Now, I know I am late by about 7 years, but better now than never!When I try to play the game, it says unable to open lang.ini . Apparently, a lot of other people had this problem and got it fixed. I have surfed through the files, but I cant find lang.ini. at all. This isnt so much a review but kind of a complaint about the purchase. ThanksAPeX
