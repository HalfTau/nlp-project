I love me some GTA, I have played all the games but this one, and as it did begin fun, about 30 hours in i find myself wondering if this game is ever gonna finish, skipping story lines just to progress further and get close to finishing it, and one of the most frustrating things about thisgame is having to restart the missions all the way back to the beginning no matter how far you have gotten in the mission. after the 1015th time i have finally called it quits, i wanna finish the game, i wanted to enjoy it, but it just dragged on for what seemed like forever. rest of the GTA series was much more entertaining.
