DO NOT BUY THIS FOR PC, It wouldnt even launch for me, first there was an issue where it said my system couldnt handle it 16 gigs of ram, a 280x toxic and an I5 2500k and 4.3ghz Than after I finally fixed that it wouldnt load past me pressing start, finally got it to load to that point after reinstalling windows live games. Than on the loading screens you know the artwork it crashes. So I restarted my pc like it told me to and its back to it crashing on startup. Waste of money on such a good game owned it for 360 before I sold it
