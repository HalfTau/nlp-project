Its unplayable.Starting from the Windows Live to the horrendous optimization for the game. You have to spend over 2 hours figuring out how to make this game work and after all that, you will be lucky to even get in the game without crashing. I managed to get in the game with horrible framerate on the lowest setting. It actually played better when it was released back in 20082009. Rockstar has completely abandoned this game.Rockstar basically said ! you to everyone with GTA IV.Do not bother with this garbage.I suppose customers werent the only ones being annoyed by roman. Rockstar basically Rage quit on GTA IV as a whole.
