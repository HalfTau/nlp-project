Started playing Gta series from first one, I was in highschool, spend too much time on it though .. GTA IV in its time was unbelivable, graphics were awesome, physics are relativly realistic not XD, but the biggest plus of the game is the story..In search for better life, Nico goes to America to chase american dream and a revenge on some people that caused him severe internal torment. During his stay with his cousin his path is crossed with russians, italians and many other antagonists and he is forced for some hard life decisions..PRO gameplay graphics, music, attention to detail story, missions, weapons..CONS really not much, one of the biggest flaw is Nicos speech.. Well, Im from Croatia and it somewhat bothered me that his talk isnt either croatian, bosnian, serbian or any other baltic language.. They should have really use someone native for narrating or atleast consult.CONCLUSIONTo make this conclusion short, this game is must play , even in 2015 hehe
