I like Grand Theft Auto IV because its offer me some amazing and good missions... Its look like a real life and you can have a girlfriends, do some criminal, and my favourite thing in this game is the final mission in this game is so cool... After you complete the story in this game, you can do some activities with your girlfriends or find some easter egg in this game... I really love this game so much and i think thats all my reviews for this game... I recommend you to buy this game... Thanks and enjoy this game...
