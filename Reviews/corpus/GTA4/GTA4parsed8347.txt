Grand Theft Auto IV has been a game that has been quite frowned upon in the Grand Theft Auto series, reasons for this may be because of the driving mechanics, lack of planes or another reason.However, Grand Theft Auto IV has a great storyline, which in my books seems to be one of the best storylines that Rockstar has ever made, I think that Rockstar spent longer creating story mode than creating multiplayer, which may be why the story is so action packed. My overall thoughts on Grand Theft Auto IV are the game is fun, however I am quite disapointed which the lack of activities available compared to previous Grand Theft Auto games.Good ThingsExcellent StorylineAction PackedGreat GraphicsFun OnlineBad ThingsLack Of ActivitiesThe Use Of Windows LiveLack of PlanesHorrible Driving Mechanics.Although the game has some quite important factors in its flaws, the game is still enjoyable, however if you are into games which you want to be perfect within all factors, this game is not for you.
