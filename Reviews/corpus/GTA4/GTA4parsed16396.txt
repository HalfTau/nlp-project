I bought the games a few weeks ago when it was on sale. What I didnt realize though, is that the game is full of errors. After you download it, you have to sign in to social club, and that malfunctioned 40 of the time. Then my games for windows live account was rejected, saying I had to close the other game I was playing I wasnt playing any other game. And now the loading screen is stuck on an endless loop, I havent even been able to play the game yet! My suggestion is to buy GTA 5 when it comes out for PC for the love of god Rockstar, either fix this game or make GTA 5 for PC!
