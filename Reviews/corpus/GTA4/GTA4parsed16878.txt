Well we should all know that Grand Theft Auto IV is the very best GTA game ever made and the best RPG ever created in the history of man kind. This will always be my favorite video game on the planet. GTA V in my opnion really sucks. I was expecting much more but GTA IV is still an amazing game so I have faith that Rockstar still has it in them to create another really amazing GTA.
