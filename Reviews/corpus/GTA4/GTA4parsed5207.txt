An amazing game even in 2016, especially when modded. It is a great open world game and a great GTA game at that. Windows LIVE can be annoying and might not work on Windows 10 I dont know because I have Windows 7 But on 7 you just make an account, sign in, and it works perfectly. I really do enjoy it.
