Please do not buy this game. What. So. Ever. Take Two has made a horrible decision in banning the ONLY modding tool for GTAV.Between GTA IV, GTA V, and FiveM I have put a lot of hours into playing the Grand Theft Auto Series. Almost all of those hours were used playing mods. Now with the loss of OpenIV that entire community is at risk for destruction. And that makes me, and hopefully all of you angry.PLEASE, I beg you dont buy this game. Dont buy any of Take Twos games. Dont buy their t microtransactions. Dont support them at all.
