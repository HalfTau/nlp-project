An excellent game, with an enjoyable storyline. Granted, The main character isnt my favorite in the GTA universe, nor is this the best story. It however is a fun and enjoyable game with good graphics for its time, even if they are slightly dated nowadays.This game takes you back to a larger and grittier Liberty City than you might be remember. The city feels like a living and breathing city, with so much to do. You can visit amusement parks, go bowling or any number of other activities. Then of course theres the shadier activities.The game however while good is a PITA when it comes to the installation. The game requires GFWL, which also in turn requires you to sign up for an xbox live account. Im sorry, if I wanted to play GTA4 on Xbox, I would have bought the dang thing on Xbox! Then the game does technically have Achievments, but again Those are only posted to your xbox live account. Its just stupid. This is the only game I own that requires GFWL, and the very fact that it forces me to sign up for 2 other servicesRockstar Social and Xbox Live is insane. Im fine with the rockstar social club, but the other is just overkill.Another thing that irked me, was the controls just felt clunky. They didnt seem as fluid as the console version. I assumed the xbox xontrol would be flawless since the game SEEMS to want to be an xbox gameEven on Steam, however these controls left me disappointed.Still, its an OK game, and fans of Openworld crime sagas should definately check this game out, despite the hassles.
