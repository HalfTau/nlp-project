This is the best GTA game I have ever played after GTA SA. The story is so immersive that I stopped playing other games. The characters had so much emotions that you would care about every character in the game. Graphics are still good and were the best in 2009 but Rockstar really messed up with the PC port. Game was badly optimized, aiming is difficult because it was made for controllers, glitches, bugs, running poorly on good PCs and the worst thing is Windows Live. I couldnt log in and had to look on the internet to remove it completely because it was so annoying and couldnt let me play the game... also had to install patches to optimize the game and started to get 90fps on high settings. Without Windows Live and bad optimization, this game would be better and most people review this game negatively just because of it.In my opinion, GTA IV has a better story than GTA V... probably the last best story in GTA games, looks like Rockstar stopped caring about singleplayer when GTA V came out. I dont know if multiplayer is still alive. And people should stop reviewing the game negatively just because of Windows Live... you can remove it and play the game without any problems, well... you will need to install a patch from Rockstar to fix the fps issues but thats not a problem.Worth to buy this game even when its 20euro on steam.
