Waste of 20 i cant get back poorl optimized graphics errors so it wont even run and there are ways to fix this but they unfortunately didnt work. The fact i have to sign in to windows live to save is even worse. If something can be fixed with this mess of a port then i will reinstall it otherwise do not buy it
