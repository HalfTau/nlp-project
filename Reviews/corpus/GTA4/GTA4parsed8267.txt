I just purchased gta iv for the purpose of playing online and now all i get is cannot connect to games for windows live. when i connect to windows games market place it will not connect. when i try to go multiplayer all i get is you can not connect to windows live. I have reinstalled GTA IV then reinstalling Games For Windows Live and have gone through all the steps multiple times.. still isnt working
