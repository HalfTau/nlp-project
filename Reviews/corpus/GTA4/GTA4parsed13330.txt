EDIT  12/24/2016So I wrote this review with a No recommendation for the reason that GFWL is a broken piece of Rockstar games recently updated GTAIV including TBOGT/TLAD and it actually works now, so you can save the game and the multiplayer is up and running as it is intended.Buy the game its worth the price and its a steal when its on sale, multiplayer is great fun and the story is outstanding.A few key points as to why this game is amazing Great cast of characters Hilarious, dark and crimeridden story Missions are great fun Multiplayer is so much fun with friends Mods are plentiful Heaps to do and explore Radio stations are all just ing outstanding
