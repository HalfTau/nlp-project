2 words Windows LiveBetter than GTAV thoughUPDATE Why theu dislike this review?? what dont you undestrand? i cant play multiplayer thanks to windows live and rockstar social club!!! i tried every fix i found on the internet even from rockstar, buying a game you need to do fixes to play or cant even play at all, is unbelievable and its definitely a reason to downvote. I cant play , i cant like. Single player is good , its a good game but i cant enjoy that much without multiplayer, where is all the fun and action.
