If you are skilled enough to log into GFWL with out commiting suicide, then this is a great game. There are a lot of annoying glitches, like you cant play with two screens and if you have a GPU with more than 4GB of VRAM you have to do some annoying advanced stuff that I wont bother complaining about. But the story is amazing and pretty long, If you download shaders and other mods, the game is fantastic9/10
