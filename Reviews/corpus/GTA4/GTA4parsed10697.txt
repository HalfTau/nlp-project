This game is really fun. There are lots to do in game as well as the mods. Mods change the entire game. GTA V is out as of this post but it is harder to find mods, make mods, and you can possibly get banned from GTA V if you mod it. The best part of GTA V is the coding, scripting, and just the way the game is made. With GTA IV, it is badly coded. With mods and even just playing the game unmodded, it lags, glitches, has problems, and other things. I do mod this game and it is fun if you can find a way to make it stable and if you know what you are doing when moding the game. Another downside of this game is the Windows Live program. I have no idea why Rockstar added this into there game. It just made more problems in the game. As I am talking about the bad things, you may wonder why I recommend this game. I do recommend this game because it is such a fun game to mess around with in sandbox/open world with mods. You can be a cop, be a superhero, make the graphics look better than GTA V, have simple mods like stop lights, turn signals, and more.
