I have wanted to play this game forever and finally got a good enough computer to run it only to find that Windows Live is required to save any game progress and doesnt seem to work. Im not interested in playing a game like GTA without being able to save progress. The performance seems very slow as well. I have a 2016 laptop with an i7 and the framerate makes the game unplayable. A game that is almost ten years old shouldnt have that kind of problem. Other newer games run fine.
