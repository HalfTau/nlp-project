Lol what the  rockstar, I loved this game but its outdated now. Obviously becuase the release of GTA V. What am I mad about, well instead of rewarding the people that already bought the game on consoles, maybe you could give a discount to the people that bought your previous games! Im not going to fork over 60 for GTA V because I dont have that money to spend. Maybe you can help out your fans that have been loyal before your masterpiece. Not only me but all of the longterm GTA fans not only here for GTA V. Just please consider it, it would be much appreciated.
