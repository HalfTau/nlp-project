Dont buy this. If you want to play it, do so on console. Windows Live has completely ruined it. Rockstar has no idea how to make a game for PC. It gets past the Windows Live signin and then does not work. Anyone that says they have a fix have only a temporary fix. It may work once after the fix, but never afterwards. This game is trash. Im on my 4th time reinstalling it now, hoping that it will maybe work this time.tldr Dont waste your money, buy it for console.
