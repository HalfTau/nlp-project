Have I really not written a review for GTA IV yet?Maybe I just thought no words were necessary...Niko Bellic, a Serbian with a complicated past, has come to Liberty City to live the American dream  To take what you want when you want from whomever you want however you want. The formula that made the original Grand Theft Auto a golden PC classic return in GTA IV.A seamless map, good driving physics, a deep and beautiful story and as always, the entire franchise mocks conservative American values in their totality. GTA speaks about the great American myth, it lays bare the greed and corruption of capitalism, and it does it with cheek.There is no reason not to get this game, if your computer can handle it. I definitely suggest meeting the recommended specs.Those that are easily offended by violence, truth, drugs, or antiauthoritarianism should not purchase this. GTA has always been about one thing Anarchy. It spits in the face of authority as you mow down police and servicemen, it jokes about sacred American values, mocking them for what they really are.This is the game you shouldnt have let your children play. Too late.
