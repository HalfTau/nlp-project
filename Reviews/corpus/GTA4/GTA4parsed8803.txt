So this is my first GTA game and I must say, this game is pretty awesome, sure it hasnt aged well and all, but this game is just so awesome and fun, I found myself smiling from ear to ear when I was about an hour into the game, its really fun, unique and enjoyable! Now say what you want about the GTA franchise, but listen to me on this this is a must have game, just play it, its an experience and a good one, Niko Bellic our main protaginist is a likeable character, a serbian immigrant that fought in a war and now he regrets his decisions. You will learn more about Niko as the game goes on, and you will learn to care about him and his cousin Roman Bellic, please do yourself a favor and get this game!
