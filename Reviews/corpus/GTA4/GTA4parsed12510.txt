Ive always liked the GTA games and IV was probably my favorite up until GTA V. I have played it on Xbox 360 before but since I sold that I decided to buy it on PC even though Ive heard alot of bad things about it. But to my suprise it works pretty good! Yes Windows Live is a little bit of an issue, since I had to find a new version to install for the game to even start, same with this Social Club, wish these things could be removed.But the game runs no worse then it did on my 360, plus it looks better on PC and I only have a budget rig. Perhaps a little lower specs work better for this? I also have WIndows 8.1 and see no problems with the OS for this game. So I am very happy to be able to enjoy GTA IV again! I like the characters in the game and the story is good. While I like the driving it does become a bit more tiresome faster this time round, as I found it much more fun driving around on GTA V, It probably has to do with the nicer graphics and more to do/see in the City. But overall this is a great and fun game!
