Im very satisfied with this game, this game totaly different with the San Andreas episode. I like the missions, its very quite challenging. This game has 3 version, the first one is GTA Original, second is The Ballad Gay Tony, third is The Lost And Damned. Although therere 3 version but the story is still connected each other. The multiplayer is good I like it, so many kind of jobs we can play it in multiplayer. The graphics, the style, the places totally different n also theres a phone we can use it.
