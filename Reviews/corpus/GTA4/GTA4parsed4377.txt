OMG it works again.Thank you Rockstar for releasing a patch to fix this old but good game.Ever since I retired my old laptop with windows 7 and gtx660 2gb card over 2 years ago, I could not play this game on my new gtx980 sli rig, now with windows 10. Now the game works on anything, old and new.Out of most of the other gta games I find IVs story to be the best and one I dont mind replaying.ProsIt actualy runs faily smooth on new hardware, dispite its poor ports.It actualy runsIt actualy still has some people in multiplayer, for a 8 year old game thats impresive.ConsNopeWell, actually online has inrresponsible modders once in a while PTipsInstall Games for windows live BEFORE you install the game. If you dont, it will not work.I can now waste another 900hrs of my life in this game P
