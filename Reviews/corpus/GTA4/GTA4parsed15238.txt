Not a whole lot can be said about GTAIV that everyone has not said.  The PC version, now that gaming PCs are able to make up for the games horrendous coding is the absolute best version of the game, with mods like ENBs, Texture Packs, reskins to transform Liberty City into New York City, and even the ability to drive a piano.  If you enjoy GTA IV theres no reason to not pick up the PC version.I do wish it didnt rely on Games for Windows Live.
