Why buy a game if you cant even play it offline anymore ? I bought it today and i have a login on Social Club, but when i try to login to play it says that login has failed and tell me to try later. When i try to play offline it says im not logged in Social Club so i cant play the game. Im so regret that i spend any money into it, if i have downloaded it on the internet i would be already playing.
