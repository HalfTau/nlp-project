Ive only put in 6 hours, so this isnt a full game review. Go to metacritic or something if you want a full review of GTA 4. I just wanted to comment that this DOES work on Windows 10. Im playing on Windows 10 with a 1070 modern setup. I was able to set up games for windows live just fine, and Im playing the game and games for windows live is working in game. I can save, quit out and come back. No problems. I have also seen no other problems with this version of the game from a technical standpoint. Glad I picked it up and gave it a shot even though some other reviews led me to believe it was unplayable on my setup.
