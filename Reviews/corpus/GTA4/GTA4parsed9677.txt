Good game, but problematic. There is an easy to find workaround to get past the GFWL problems, but it disables online multiplayer. If youre looking for multiplayer hyjinks, break down and get GTA V. If you want a cheaper way to get into the series, and a good story, play this instead.If you have Windows 10, the GFWL thing can break the game, so assume no multiplayer. Some have gotten it to work, but not I.
