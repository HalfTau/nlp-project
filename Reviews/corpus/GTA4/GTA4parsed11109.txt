I was very excited to get this for my Steam account. A game I very much enjoyed on my PS3.Well what a disapointment on the PC. Requires games for windows live which is no longer available to save the game or play online.Basically this travesty is unplayable in its current state  this is the only Humble Bundle purchase I have ever made that I regret, and I will be asking for a refund.What a shame.
