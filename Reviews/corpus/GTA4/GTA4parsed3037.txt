Beware for updates to break Open 4. Be sure to set the game to only update on opening. Rockstar is likely to send an update to break mods for this game. Oh and on top of that, the community HAS TO MOD THIS GAME just for it to work properly on PC. Also games for windows live was never removed so youll have to dig up  mod. This is my only reason for not recommending at this time.Other than this its better than GTA 5 to be completely honest.
