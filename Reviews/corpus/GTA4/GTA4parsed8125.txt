DO NOT BUY. You need GFWL to be able to play online or save your game and GFWL has been discontinued and theres no other legit way of making it work. DONT EVEN TRY MICROSOFT SUPPORT ive been on for hours transfered here and there then back here no there and in the end they blame steam and they were not helpful at all. DO NOT TRY ANY OF THE SOLUTIONS THE ARE OUTDATED AND WILL NOT WORK.
