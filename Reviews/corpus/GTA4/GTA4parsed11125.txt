Pretty good game, but the port quality is sadly just so low I have to say no. The game lags terribly, has the worst FPS issues Ive ever seen Worse than Unity, controls terribly, looks terrible, has useless online DRM, and far too many technical problems to list. Took me 2 days to get it to launch in something resembling a functional state.
