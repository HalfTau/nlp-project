I throughly enjoyed playing GTA IV on my PS3 console.  I was hoping the same experience on my PC however I have to play on the lowest graphic setting on order to play smoothly. Its difficult to enjoy the game when I have to play at the lowest setting. At best I get 2035fps on lowest setting and 715fps on max setting.The lowest graphic setting will always look better than the console version. If you have a good rig then I would recommend getting it especially with vast amount of mods that can enhance the experience of the game.
