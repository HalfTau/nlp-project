This game will have you on the edge of your seat for days wanting to play it. I would also say that this game looks very great and the graphics are outstanding themselves. You will be playing for hours, It deserves more than Mixed reviews. I liked how they have a HUGE hub world that allows you to explore the world of Grand Theft Auto. Its also interesting that you can choose what missions you want to do or follow the storyline. Which makes me give this game a fullon 5 star rating. I enjoy the storyline, and how well put the storyline is. Overall, continue to make great video games.
