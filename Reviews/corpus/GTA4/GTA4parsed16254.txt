First of all, here are my specs2011 21.5 iMac2.5GHz Quad Core i5 I52400S4GB 1333 MHz512MB GDDR5 Radeon HD 6750M500 GB 7200 RPM Serial ATA 6 Gb/sWindows 7 Ultimate via Boot CampIt was really hard to review the game. I loved it. It was super fun to play. Here is the issue. As it is well known, GTA IV is the worst port anyone has ever seen. My computer is 3 years ahead of the game and has triple the required maximum specs of the game. Still, the only way I could run it is with everything set on absolute low.I know I know, I shouldnt give a good game, and yes, it is a good game, bad rating because my hardware is not good enough, BUT, this is plain ridiculous. Like I said, compared to what the game requires, my computer might as well be super computer. Besides that, I can run more graphically challenging games such as Mafia II, Metro 2033 and EVEN Metro Last Light on medium to high settings. So, yeah, GTA IV is that bad of a port.That being said, when I will get a new iMac, I would definitely replay GTA IV, hopefully with better graphic settings.
