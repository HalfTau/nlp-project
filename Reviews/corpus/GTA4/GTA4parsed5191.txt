It is an older game, no longer supported by the developer so one has to put a tiny bit of an effort to make it run, the pinned discussion articles right here on steam are mostly enough yes it runs on W10  for the bowling game issues disable mouse acceleration in windows config panel. To create an offline profile in the GFWL popup, just click the create button, scroll down and there is a link in the text that lets you do that.Other than the obvious technical flaws its still a great game that doesnt deserve the low score and well worth it on a sale. The storyline is interesting and gameplay really good  many small details are even better than in GTA V, the NPC reaction, the Police intelligence etc.
