Its not a bad game but there is so much to not like about the game.  First your character doesnt move fluidly.  He cant even turn around without moving forward.  The sheer amount of time you spend on your phone is dumb.  You have to manage girlfriends if you want perks and that requires you to call them, set up a date, pick them up, take them out, etc.  I would have much rather loved more quests...speaking of, there arent that many quests.  There are certain quest lines that I would have thought would go on forever like the assassin quest line or whatever its called.  Let there be like 10 main sniping/assassin jobs that get harder and harder.  Once those 10 are done give me random people in random places.  I go kill them and you give me a certain amount of money depending on difficuluty.  Same goes for racing jobs.  I love racing in GTA4.  It is very fun, but at some point brucie stops giving out racing games....seriously? How hard would it be to set up a random racing sequence...pick a random starting point, plot out 515 checkpoints, give a random amount of laps, pick the cars from random for your enemies and tada...but NO?  Forget that.  The only replayability is seeing the different quest lines and that isnt that fun.  I would have loved to see more flying.  I wish they had property purchasing like in prior games.  I am sitting on 600k and have nothing to do with it. Let me buy cars or property or business that make me more money.also, biggest pet peeve, it is a dang console port...it is not optomized for PC.  I can play skyrim at full blown settings with 2k textures and not dip below 60fps. This game frequently dips to 30.  Not cool. You can easily tell the difference between 60 and 30.There is a lot to like in this game.  A whole lot.  The driving, the quests are fun, the graphics are ok.  The peds have a life of their own and respond appropriately to things going on around them.
