Good fun game ruined by the fact that you have to jump through hoops to play it  layers of DRM and accounts you have to createI cant seem to find anywhere in the options where you can locally save the game. Im not interested in the online stuff I just want to play it single player, so why do I need an online account just to save the game? I mean it does warn you that the game requires you to do all this, wish id read more carefully as I probably would have given the game a miss.Like I initially said the game is real fun but just ruined by all the stuff you have to set up to play it. I recommend the game but not buying it unless you have no issue with setting up accounts and the drm.
