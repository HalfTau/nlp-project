I just bought the game and i spent 23 hours just trying to make it work. It has graphics problems, once i solved that i got really happy thinking that now i can play the game and i waited like an idiot 10 minutes in front of the loading screen when i realised that it is stuck. I fixed that problem too and when i started to play the game it was stuttering. Like every time i moved the mouse it stutters. this game
