This game is fun, or rathera lot of fun.The amount of hours I have in this game were only possible due to mods.In my opinion, Take Two has declared war on SP mods by sending a CD to OpenIV.GTA IV in and of itself already lacks a bunch of basic features one would expect, e.a. no vehicle customization.The near endless amounts of fun you can have in GTA IV is only possible due to the sheer enormous amounts of mods that exist for it.I sincerely hope that you decide against purchasing this game.Resources1.2.
