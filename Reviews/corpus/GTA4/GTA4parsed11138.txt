Motorcycles, Lambourghinis, Ferraris, Guns, More Guns, Bigger Guns, Robberies, Bank Robberies, Cyber Hacking from online sites, Carjacks, Bowling, the list goes on!I definetley recommend this game, Its really interesting. The character Niko Bellics life is really emotional for the player, and as the player, you can see how he changes/progresses throughout the story.This is a quick review, so heres what I thinkStory 10/10Gameplay 10/10Missions8/10Multiplayer 9/10Robberies 8/10Overall 9/10Would recommend, I bought 2 copies 1 for me and 1 for my bro since it was 4.00, and its totally worth it! Can easily get over 500 hours of gameplay, maybe even more! Me and my brother really love the multiplayer, although sometimes it doesnt recognize your steam hours you play on it.
