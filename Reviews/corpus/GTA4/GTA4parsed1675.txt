This game does not work on windows 10. Solutions are supposed to exist in order to sidestep the issue, but none have worked for me.And STEAM REFUSES TO REFUND ME FOR A GAME THAT DOES NOT EVEN WORK. Just because I didnt test it right away after buying it and waited a month. Fing crooks ! Seriously pathetic on this one, Steam offering no easy fix to the issue and selling you the game without warning you that you wont be able to play it on windows 10....
