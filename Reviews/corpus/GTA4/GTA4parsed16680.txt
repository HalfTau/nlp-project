DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, it makes you sign up for a bunch of bullcrap such as windows live and rockstar social club which just always f up in the end. Basically you will be spending about 12 hours of your time trying to get it to work only to be dissapointed by the multiplayer greatly because all of the modders, it also makes you sign up anyways for windows live just to save your game progress so if you dont make an account then basically you have no game.
