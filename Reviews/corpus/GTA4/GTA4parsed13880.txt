GTA 4 and GTA 4 EFLC would be worth buying if they were devoloped by anyone except rockstar, both GTA 4 and the ballad of gay tony have great stories with the lost and dammed not be so great and all 3 have immersive gameplay with brillant graphics to go along with it, the driving of cars and trucks while feeling quite heavy is still leaps and bounds better than other games and boats are also quite good. Now the bad stuff first off theirs the part that made me stop playing this Rockstars absolutle fking terrible, utterly usless, plie of steaming st that is the social club launch thing just to boot this game u click play on steam, then offline of the social club, then confirm you want to play offline, then u press on either GTA 4,Ballad of gay tony or lost and dammed and then you click play to finally get into the game, Next theirs the GFWL game for windows live intergration is fking abismil in order for you just to dave the game you not only need a steam account that would have worked fine but you also need a GFWL account just fking fantastic, then inorder to play online with friends you need to friends with them on, steam,social club and GFWL why who the fk though that was a good idea how ever it was needs to be fired in fact who ever made social club is an absolute fking ct and so is who ever was involved in ruining this game. Dont buy it for 60 dont buy for 6 either rockstar deserve nothing for this game and cant reccomend you buy jc2 over this enough.
