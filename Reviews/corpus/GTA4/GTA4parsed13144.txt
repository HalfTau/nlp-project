GTA IV is amazing. I can tell you that. I played it on the Xbox 360 and beat both original and episodes from LC. So I see youtube videos of people doing all these mods on GTA IV for PC and I am dying to get it. So I bought it for 21.99. Big suprise, it doesnt work. 22 tooken away from me. Heres my problem Windows 8.1 I Click play and it says Im playing the game, but they bring up a Social club sign in so I signed into my social club account I use for GTA V. I click the Offline play button and it says Its invalid or something like that and when I click the other play button Online the social club Sign in dissapears and then it says I exited GTA IV. Ive watched videos on trying to fix the game and quite a few of them. Ive followed step by step from the Windows live to the Property files in GTA IV where I gotta change some things around for files. So I try it again and it hasnt changed and still wont cooperate. So I restart it and tried again, Didnt work. I tried Shutting it down and starting it up again, Didnt work. Im left clueless. I need help getting this fixed or I demand my 22 back.
