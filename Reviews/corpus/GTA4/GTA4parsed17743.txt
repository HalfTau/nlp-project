I used to find this game boring and not at all interesting, with the release of Grand Theft Auto V for PC released, I decided, hey, why not go back to GTA IV and compare it to the newest GTA? I ended up playing the whole game and loved every minute of it. I would recommend this to people who enjoy a good story, freeroam, online and hidden secretsEaster Eggs.
