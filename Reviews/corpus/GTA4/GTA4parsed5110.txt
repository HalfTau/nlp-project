Dear Rockstar,No, I am not about to buy a 300 kiddy box just to play your games at 25fps and have to shoot with a controller on aim assist, all while paying monthly subscription for basic functionality like multiplayer and social features. If you wont make your games available on the PC, and do so in a timely fashion, I simply wont buy them or bother with them anymore, and neither will millions of others who play exclusively on the far superior platform.Regards,A consumer.
