i loved the game on ps3 epecaly the blad of gay tony. i did like it on pc until i found out it used securom and gfwl and it doesnt work on windows 10. rockstar please release a version without securom and gfwl and sell it for a discount for people who already have the game. but until then i cannot recommend this game. if you want to play it get the ps3 or 360 version they actualy work but run like crap
