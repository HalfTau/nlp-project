This game is one of the best games from Rockstar, after GTA V, in my opinion. It has good graphics, a little too dark in the day time, but at night is very realistic. The system requirements are not really the ones specified, but I can run it in lower settings because of my crappy PC. Good price to buy when its in sale at 5 euros, but instead of paying the normal price better wait and add 10 more euros and get GTA V. 9.5/10
