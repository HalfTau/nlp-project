The game itself is simply amazing, it has good story, great graphics, lots of dialogue and plenty of side missions to keep you busy for hours. I never got bored by the game even though I finished the game twice on PC and once on PS3. Of course the game is not perfect, it suffers from kind of jerky controls when walking and weird driving model, but its really not a big deal. The true problem is unoptimized and resource hungry engine, which even on very powerful rigs can be slow and stuttery. I myself was lucky and had no problems playing this game on pretty mediocre PC with details set to medium/high. I can easily recommend this one.
