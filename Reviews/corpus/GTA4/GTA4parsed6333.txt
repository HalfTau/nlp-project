New graphics and physics make for a fresh and better world, if you can actually get it to run. Probably the poorest PC optimization for a game I have ever witnessed, and Games for Windows Live is just a steaming pile of camel dung. Again, these are PC issues, just play the game on console, because it isnt bad. But for PC, dont waste your time, skip to GTA V.
