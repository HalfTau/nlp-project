If you have Windows 8 dont buy this! Its a horrible port. When you got a graphicscard with more than 2GB it wont let you change any settings or it will crash. There are some fixes, even known by Rockstar, but nothing has been done to patch it correctly. BAD PORT! !The game is great. Finished it on my PS3.
