Read the reviews  I wish that I had. Like many others have stated, the game has many problems, such as having to sign in to ridiculous and obsolete websites in order to play with no explanation on how to do it. You have to have a Windows Live account same as a Windows account and an account with Rockstar Games, which Steam doesnt mention. Here are some links that took me hours to discover that may help some of you. I finally got the game to work on Windows 8.1.1, with the stuttering graphics that everyone complains about... You can set up a Rockstar Games Social Club account here Games for Windows Live was shut down in 2014, but it is a requirement for playing. I found a link on a Rockstar Support page on where to get a copySign in to both of these, try launching the game. Use your log in information for both. Very tediously, youll have to enter all this log in information for all 3 versions of the game, so check off the boxes so it will store your  username and passwords.Once a game launches and is actually running, click on ESCAPE and go to GAME. There you can link your Windows Live account and register the games Registration Keys.I find it unethical that Steam continues to sell games without letting clients know that they may not work at all or very poorly I am sure that I am not the only unsatisfied customer.Okay, good luck to all.
