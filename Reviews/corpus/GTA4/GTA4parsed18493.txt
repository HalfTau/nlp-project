. THIS. DRM. I am absolutely ashamed at how useless GTA IV is right now. I have dealt with Windows Live before Looking at you, Bioshock 2, but as of right now, my CD key provided from Steam is not working. Yes I redeemed it on. Yes I installed windows live. But no, the damn thing still doesnt provide me with a key to play the game. So seriously Rockstar and Microsoft. I bought a product and you are not providing the service. You both can go  yourselves. This is the last time I ever buy another one of your products. No wonder so many people download cracked copies.0.0/10.0
