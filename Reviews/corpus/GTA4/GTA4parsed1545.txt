OLD   The best gta for story imo. just wish i could play it.. worked fine for a year, come back and cant play. load in and wrong res and graphics so i change it then kciked out. fatal error Why rockstar?? tried everything to fix this.. fmlSo i changed my mind from negative to postive, why you ask? well thats because i fixed it. with no help what so ever from rockstar, just the community that helped make the game great.NEW This game is by far the best Grand Theft Auto Story told imo. i state this as the game genuinley brought me in and kept me hooked. many many factors contribute to why the game is so good, these include the massive and highly detailed Liberty City New york, the many awesome characters you come across during the story and lastly the fantastic gameplay. I left out graphics as the game hasnt aged all too well in that department but dont let that stop you from picking it up. Its still a decent looking game!ScoresGameplay 8/10Story 10/10Immersion 9.10Graphics 7/10I left out multiplayer as i feel no need what so ever to go near it. The mods kept me feeling like there is always something to do!
