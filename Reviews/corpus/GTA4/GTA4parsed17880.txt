I highly not recommend this game for only one reason. If u have less than 6GB of RAM the game is absolute crap. Everything is extremly laggy. Also me being a windows 8.1 user found it extremely hard to get the game running. It took awhile to find out how until I stumbled across a forum. Otherwise the game is amazing but I would stick to xbox and ps4 for this game.
