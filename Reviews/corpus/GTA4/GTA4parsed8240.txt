Bought this game during steam winter sale 2015. The cd key provided was not valid at all. Then steam pulls the game off market due to key errors.So after waiting 6 weeks a fix was finally made and i was automatically provided a working game key. Game still runs very poorly due to GFWL drm and its a bad port. But i can technically play it now which is good news.
