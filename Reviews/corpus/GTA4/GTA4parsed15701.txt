Real nice game,brings out the fun,altough i think some more elements are needed from EFLC,this game has lived up to the expectations as it was like you know first released before EFLC.Being myself from Balkan , and slavic this game is that more enjoyable because of the story and everything else.Multiplayer is also good,even better than the EFLC in my opinion i mean The Lost and Damned,and Ballad of Gay Tony.Price range is totally atm okay considering it is on sale,but i would recommend buying the GTAComplete Pack in which you get all GTAs starting from GTA3 all the way up to EFLC.ConclusionThe game is excellent,graphics too considering it has been released long time ago  ,story is entertaining.The only thing i cant stand is Roman your cousin in the game who calls you on every feckin mission and wants to go bowling.So i would definately give it 9 out of 10.
