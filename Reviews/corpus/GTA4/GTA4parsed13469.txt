Grand Theft Auto is great. No doubt. But the port they made of this game to PC was nothing to be proud of. They require you to log into some sort of windows live account to play online, and the modding community had to make a fix just so players could boot up the game. I would link people to youtube video I found for the startup crashing fix... but the link is in my other computers internet history. I do recommend visitingif you intend on playing this after completing the main story line as modding this game gives it soo much more replay value.Rockstar you make good games but for godsake... a billion dollar company... And you cant fix your game making indenpendant users do it for you. And then you wonder why you get complaints by those who dont know how to use google to find the fixes...
