Why is it that some of the most fun open world games are plagued with issues? This game is 100 unready for play after downloading and running through steam. The game wont launch till you realise you need to manually uninstall GFWL and reinstall the latest version direct from Microsoft. After you finally get the game launched after hours of trying to figure out what the frack is wrong with it, youre presented with oh hey! you only have 24mb video memory although you know you have a 2GB DEDICATED gpu, we certainly dont realise that!Thats when you give it the finger and go yet on another search to realise you need to create a txt commandline file that adds no restrictions to the game. Once you FINALLY get in, the game runs likeuntil you dial down the settings despite having a much more powerful machine than stated in the requirements. Oh boy! Funn.solid 60fps and then the most random drops to 1920, then back to 60. This im pretty sure is the result of twoDRMS already sitting on top of steam. SecuROM more like fck you ROM, and GWFL which require you to be signed in just to save your progress. Did I mention you also need RSC to have the game working too?all in all, the game is fun. It was more enjoyable when I had it on Xbox because i never had issues with all this 3RD partyi had to go through just to get the game working. Rockstar, please fricken go back and pull this game to 100 steamworks or Rockstar Social Club. Well all be much happier. I cant exactly recommend this seeing as its broken from the moment you press purchase and download. Yes you can fix it and make it work but its really not worth your money unless you get it on sale for like 5. Yeah its a great game but it would be better without needing 4 extra pieces of software apart from the base game to just have it run. I feel like i just plagued my PC with a bunch of crap you will too.
