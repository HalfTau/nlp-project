I love this game to death, but the GFWL kinda kills it...Big time GTA fan since Vice City. GTA IV is my most favorite GTA game to date. Brilliant story, memorible characters, great graphics for a 2008 game, and the music is so much perfect to me. Unfortunately, I cannot continue playing this game. I use to play this on my brothers Xbox 360, but PC does something so dated, that I think it deserves another update, but that probably wont happen.Games For Windows Live was a thing back then I think Microsoft gave up with it as time went by. Their website puts up Xbox and sometimes give me an error saying that the page cannot be reach. I kinda made an account, but when trying to login in, the thing says that its invalid or something. I dont know whats wrong, but because of this, I cannot save the game nor play online. Not sure if this is a Windows 10 thing, but I really dont know what to do.At the end of the day, this is a great game, but GFWL is confusing and tedious to get through. I wish there a way to go around it but it looks like I cant. So be warned when dealing with GWFL.6/10 10 if I could get GFWL working for me.
