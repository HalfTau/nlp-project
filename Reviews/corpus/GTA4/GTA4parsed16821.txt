I recommend this game. Single Player campaign is epic. BUT... In order to play multiplayer, Rockstar Games Social Club and Games for Windows Live are required. Both of these are buggy and annoying platforms. I am sick of this. I am sick of Ubisoft because of the UPlay requirement of every Ubisoft game too, but at least UPlay works fine. RGSC and GFWL even do not work properly. Rockstar, Ubisoft and Microsoft have to understand something. If I buy a game via Steam, I want to use it through Steam, and only Steam. These ing companies must not force me to use their lousy platforms. This is very simple.
