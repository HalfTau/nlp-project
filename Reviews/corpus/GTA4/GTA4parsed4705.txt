Valve hasnt pressured Rockstar to patch GTA4EFLC to remove the cancer that is Games for Windows Live from the game. You have to create a Windows Live ID in order to play the game essentially.Additionally, you have to create an account with Rockstar Social Club in order to save your game.If you have a Geforce driver newer than 370 and a GTX 10series card, youre going to run into major performance issues. I cant even run the benchmarks without them crashing on my 1060 3GB at 1080p, and rarely get above 75FPS on my 144hz monitor other games that are newer run a lot better Max Payne 3 is a good example.Possibly the worst port Ive ever spent money on. Avoid.
