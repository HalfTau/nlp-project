it might be a good game, but the poor optimisation makes it unplayable on windows 10 or any modern computer. i can only run it in windowed mode because it gets stuck at the copyright screen. it only reads 512 mb or vram when I have 4 gigs and makes it run really . the story is interesting and the characters seem fun, but I could never get into it because of the crappy engine. dont buy this.
