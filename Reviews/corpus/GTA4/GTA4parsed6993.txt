GTA IV is a great take on a more down to earth with a parodic twist of a modernish New York city in 2008. It is a great third person open world sandbox game. You play asa russian immigrant with the name of Niko Bellic, cousin of roman bellic, promised a new life and a chance of greatness in Liberty City. You find out that life isnt so great and your cousin is a failiure and a slave to gambling debt, so you do what you did in the old country, lie, cheat, and steal. Have fun!
