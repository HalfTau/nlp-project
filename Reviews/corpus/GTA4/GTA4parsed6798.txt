I dont know why everyone is saying the port is terrible, its really not that bad. The only issue I had was Windows Game  as it requires you to make an account. But guess what? YOU DONT HAVE TO, YOU CAN MAKE A GUEST TO SAVE YOUR GAME. This game is my all time favorite GTA and it is worth the money. I have felt so much nostalgia playing this.
