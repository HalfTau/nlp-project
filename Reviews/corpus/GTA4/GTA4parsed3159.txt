I love this game, I really do, I remember back then in 2011 when i used to play it nonstop, But as much as i love it, I do find some bad things in it1. Games For Windows Live2. The game is really slow, And you can sacrifice good graphics and slow framerate With Bad graphics and fast framerates3. The game crashes often, Specially on cutscenes, Like execution cutscenes4. Hey cousin!, Lets go bowling!5. The driving physics are horrible, When you do a sharp turn while speeding, There is a chance you might flip your car upside down
