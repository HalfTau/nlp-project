Started to play this game back in 2008 when it came out and i have played story complete seven times probably and this is the best gta game when considering about story, characters and atmosphere. Niko Bellic being errand boy for big guys and he is killing people with cold feeling because what he saw in his old country broke him totally inside and his cold and very dark feelings covers this story perfectly and also dark atmosphere of Liberty City with full of cold blood and sins gives more density for the story. its all you need to know seriouslyand i were drunk when making this reviewheheh
