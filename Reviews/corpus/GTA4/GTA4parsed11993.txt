I tried reinstalling this on my new computer  and it was absolutely unplayable.  It still uses Games for Windows Live on top of Rockstar Social  so after trying to sign in to one service I was prompted to sign into another. . .  It didnt allow me to change my display resolution above 800x600 even though I have a  GTX 980.  The menus were a giant mess and didnt allow any optmization.   To put it simply this is a horror of an experience.
