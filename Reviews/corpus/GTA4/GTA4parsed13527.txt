10/10!I really like GTA IV or the other GTA series. The problem with this one is that it pushed me off the storyline to killing, wiping people of the street and nothing more. It makes me sad that my interest felt so hard that i cant pull my self together to get it over with this game.. Even so. Its fun in multiplayer and you can make more fun out of it, with mods that is shown at youtube.
