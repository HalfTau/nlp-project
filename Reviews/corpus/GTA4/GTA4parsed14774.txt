This game should be moved to steamworks, and I believe we should be all set. The game isnt bad, Multiplayer is fun, and enjoyable.I think its bad that it uses games for windows live, but thats not rockstars fault, thats microsofts fault for NOT fixing Games For Windows Live.Rockstar if your reading this, Please plus this game on steamworks, let us players keep modding this game. Its fun enjoyable, and its a classic that should never be forgetten.Final Verdict for Right Now 9.5/10Until this game comes to steamworks, I would suggest still buying it anyway, and keep sending Rockstar a clear message, but please be respectful, and dont be rude to them. Just remember that you want them to bring it to steam, because they clearly can get more sales of it from steam anyway.
