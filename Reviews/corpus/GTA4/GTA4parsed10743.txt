Not an awful game, but not a great one either. GTA IV is probably the worst of the non2D GTA games. It eschews the series trademark over the top tone for something a little bit more serious and is almost universally regarded as being worse for it. The scope of the city is impressive, and it offers plenty to do, but the story is bland and silly feeling, and the game rarely manages to actually be fun. The problem with GTA IV isnt really that it tried to be a more serious GTA game, its that it never figures out how to make a more serious GTA game actually be fun. While youre as free to cause destruction as ever, but its so discordant with the tone of the game that I never found myself wanting to do. Combine that with moderately shoddy porting and a mess of multiple different 3rd party DRM solutions, including the poorly supported and slated to be discontinued Games For Windows Live, and GTA IV just does too many things wrong to warrant a purchase. Even at sale prices, this one isnt worth your time or money.
