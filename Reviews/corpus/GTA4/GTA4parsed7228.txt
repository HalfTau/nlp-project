Grand Theft Auto 4. Sadly plauged by preformance and optimization problems on the PC port. The online in this game barely works due to games for windows live, but when it did it was fun and the gamemodes like cops and robbers were fun. Despite this games horrible optimization and preformance, there is a huge modding community. Anyway, You take the role of Niko Bellic, who comes to Liberty City after an unnamed war for hope of making it big. The game starts out slow, but you quickly get into the swing of things. The cars drive much differently than in the latest installment GTA 5, much more deliberately and less arcadelike. Things like shooting, melee attacks etc all feel great and weighty. The story tries to be a lot grittier than previous games. And moostly hits the mark on that.  in a very Far Cry 3 way.. read my upcoming review if you dont know what i mean  In the single player, there isnt a whole lot to do besides your main missions, which are decent but can be repetetive at times, but this is true of many, but not all GTA missions.The story in this game isnt the most captivating, but still probably one of the higher ranked in terms of GTA game stories. If your a fan of the series this games a must own in my opinion. But the PC port is atrocious. So i have to give this game a 4/10 for the PC port, and a 7/10 for the game itself.
