Hi,In my modest opinion, Grand Theft Auto IV seems an interesting and crazy game with multiple missions main and secundary missions to do all you want and when you want.The best thing, as I told before, is the possibility to do all you want from steal a car, helicopter or plane, kill criminals, police or peolpe in general, to visit all restaurants, bars and striptease locals of Liberty City.If you dont have anything to do with assassinations or murders and you want to change your chip to be able to do something different, you can simply and dedicate your time to explore all the city with car or by foot.To sum up, awesome game for awesome people Regards,Bovinoid
