This game has contained a game breaking bug in the final mission SINCE IT WAS RELEASED IN 2009.  Seriously this seems like the sort of thing that should be patched.... but...  whatever.  I am aware that it can be bypassed, but there should be no need to install 3rd party software to make a AAA game function.  LAME.For a Company that make such exquisite games, Rockstar has terrible support.  Also, I will never forgive them for not porting Red Dead Redemption to PCOther aspects of the game.Graphics  Great for the time, have aged decently.Gunplay  Average, better without aim assist, using the over the shoulder POV.  Surpassed by GTA V.Story  Very good.  The events have a very believeable feel.  Tragic and morally gray.Setting  Absolutely superb, Rockstar build great cities, without a doubt, their strongest skill.Controls  Walking  Average.  The movement and interaction feel slow and awkward.Controls  Driving  Sluggish.  GTA V was a huge step forward. A game based on driving should be more refined.Major issue Apart from the game breaking bugVEHICLE PHYSICS.  Horrible.  Spongy.  The suspensions must be make of slinkys.  Tires have no traction. unbelievable.All this aside.  It is good.  The DLCs are even better...  a fact that makes Rockstars decision to skip single player DLC for GTA V even more mind boggling.This is the game that brought me to Steam.  purchased via Amazon3rd favorite in the series due to DLC quality.Get it on Sale.
