Love the game! Love all the GTA games but this one has the best characters and story in my opinion. The cops are very funny, nikko is a god and Little Jacob is a good guy. It didnt work the first time i got it on steam, it kept crashing, BUT I got it to work after looking up issues but it would be great if they could fix that!
