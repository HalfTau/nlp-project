Good Game Good graphics for its time but EFLC has better graphics even when i have a graphics mod on this oneEDIT After a few years of not playing, the  over at Rockstar, ed us over with 1.0.8. Outdating scripthook knowing nobody is going to update it, making all of the mods for this game no longer work, Native Trainer completely broken. Do not buy this anymore unless you are going to play it how it was originally released with no mods or cheats. Dont even think about being able to save your game either, with GFWL being STILL IN THE GAME, but completely shut down. Good job rockstar, you ruined GTA5 with pay to win, and Ruined GTA4 even though it was perfect already.
