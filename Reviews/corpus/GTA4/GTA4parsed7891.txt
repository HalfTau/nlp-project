Is Grand Theft Auto a bad game? No. Was it extremely poorly optimized? Does it need a now defunct service to even run?  HECK YES.Having played it on PS3, I can say that the game itself is good, maybe even great. But what I recieved was not a game but a headache, a 14.3 hour headache to be specific. Most of my playtime was trying to get the game to work, which I eventually did do. After I finally got it running, I experienced a very slow framerate, and audio/visual lag, with audio playing before any action was shown on screen. The peak of this was driving, hearing a crash, and seeing another car pull out in front of mine and get hit.My conclusion from this is dont buy it unless you want to give it to someone who gravely wronged you. It is that bad.
