I would have loved to play this game, but first it wouldnt play on my old PC a texture issue of something and now when I try and play it on my new computer I keep getting this Social club login fail. Please try again..I tried all of the fixes mentioned in the sticky and I appreicate the worth that went into writing them but nothing had worked. This should be a huge embarassment for Rockstar for ignoring the issue and for Steam which has allowed its userbase to waste their money on a longtime faulty product.0/10
