This game is amazing but Windows Game Live or whatever the  you call it just ruined the multiplayer. You need to fix this STEAM but the way to make an account where you can save the game is you go to create a profile ingame, you scroll down and click on CREATE A LOCAL PROFILE. Enjoy saving offline.The story mode is hella fun lez go.
