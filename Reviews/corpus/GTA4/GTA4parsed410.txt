Im on the fence when it comes to reccomending this game to anyone with the wits and nitty grits to know how to fine tune it for your machine... Although there has been a new build release, I still suffer from graphical setting problems on New and Old Computers, Modifications and with none. And the fact that this game is pretty ahrd on hardware even the newest on the market, its a huge CON for such a game like this one... BUT like previous Grand Theft Auto titles, it is worth the money and most of all is a gem.With the most recent update that came out of no where, people can finally play together online with no real hassel like years before in the previous builds. But most of all, you get a game that has a really breath taking environment, simple subtle attentions to detail that can go unnoticed, DLC worth playing and an easy to get into game even without playing previous titles. All in a game made in 2008... I think. Dont quote me.But, truly this game is wonderful and cant say it enough to do it justice. Vice City was my first GTA Game, But GTA IV was the first GTA Game I finished. Despite the hardware issues this game can reside, it simply is a momento from the past that revolutionized and lead the way for Rockstars success. A Flagship of brilliance like other titles before and after.
