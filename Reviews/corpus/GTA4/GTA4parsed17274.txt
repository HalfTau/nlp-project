The game was a disappointment for me. It just isnt even near of what it actually could be.Still, after completing the game I had some kind of feeling that wasnt absolutely negative, amongst the negative ones.I mean1. The PCport is horrible. The lag is just something I cant stand.2. The plot is ok, but nothing compared to the plot of GTA SA3. The best things from GTA SA were left when creating this game.The game wasnt absolutely awful, but as I said, it couldve been a lot better than it actually was.
