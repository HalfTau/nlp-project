Amazing game, its endlessly fun, the campaign is brilliant not even mentioning the vast realm of Multiplayer. So many mods to immerse yourself in, plus the great LCPDFR. Im glad to see that after 5 or so years the game is still running well. My only down point is the multiplayer service, GFWL is crap and doesnt even work that well anymore. Also the game is a little bit crashy but can be fixed using a script,Altogether a great game.
