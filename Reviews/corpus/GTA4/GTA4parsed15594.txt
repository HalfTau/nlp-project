This is one of the best sandbox games i have ever played. It has an uncountable number of mods and can look beautiful with Icenhancer. Although the pc port is rubbish and even high end pcs run it horribly, i get more fps on crysis 3 on ultra than this with icenhancer. The DRM on this game is horrible, Games for windows live is just a pain in theand causes problems with modding. Rockstar Games Social Club adds nothing and also there is Securom. The mods is what keeps me playing this game since 2010 when i first started playing it, the multiplayer is also pretty fun.
