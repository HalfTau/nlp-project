5/10All about the gameplay is very awesome, but if you want to play multiplayer, it was doesnt matter, but there was some problems about the windows live. It will be more better if Rockstar remove the Windows Live in this game to allowed people playing multiplayer without Windows Live. And this game more awesome if there was many gamemodes of the servers like Cops n Robbers, Roleplaying  the most awesome gamemode , Gang war, etc.I recommended to Rockstar to remove Windows Live. Many people have some problems with windows live, i saw not many people playing in multiplayer session. Maybe if Rockstar remove Windows Live, it will many people want to buy and play this game.
