Turning on the modding community Take Two? Not cool. Uninstalled both GTA V and IV after purchasing both again on PC specifically for mod support. Will no longer be supporting any future Take Two published titles and will be directing anyone I know away from their products as well until this policy is reversed.This is what greed gets you.
