Im torn about this game.On the one hand, it brought me 40 hours of entertainment at the time of review most of that time was driving around, which never ceased to be fun.On the other hand, performance is terrible, merely enabling shadows cuts the frame rate in half, its riddled with bugs, some even gamebreaking. It frequently crashes and I probably spent an additional 45 hours fixing issues of the game in WINE on Linux, but Im happy to report that after several adjustments, it works flawlessly through it.These adjustments includeSome other consIt was only 5 bucks though. Cant say that I regret my purchase.If you enjoy driving through times square listening to some music, driving over pedestrians, then youll love this game. I sometimes fired it up just to drive around. That mechanic and the huge world are the two biggest strenghts of the game.
