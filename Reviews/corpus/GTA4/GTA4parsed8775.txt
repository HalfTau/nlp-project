First of all I want to say that I have played this game on PS3 many times and haved enjoyed it very much. Since the game was on sale for PC I decided to pick it up. Soon after the game downloaded I started it up and it gave me an error screen. I then decided to watch many tutorial videos to try to fix it, none of them helped me and im still stuck with a broken game. I dont recommend picking up a copy of this game for PC.
