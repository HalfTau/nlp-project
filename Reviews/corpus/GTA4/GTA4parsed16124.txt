This game will not start. F1 2013 starts. BioShock starts. Tomb Raider starts. I am running a Razer Blade 2013 GTX 765m so there is no issue with the system. In 2014 I expect blockbuster games and big titles to just work. I am new to PC gaming so maybe this is common but after multiple attempts at log in I have not been able to even see the start screen of this game.Does Steam do exchanges? I am cool with them keeping the money for a game that works.
