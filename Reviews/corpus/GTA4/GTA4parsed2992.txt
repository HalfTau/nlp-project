Do not buy this game. It is completely unplayable. Why? Because the port was terrible, and it still uses Games for Windows Live DRM, despite GFWL being dead for over four years. Mods had to be used to even make the game playable, but now that TakeTwo has banned all modding for not just this game but also GTA V, its now dead and unplayable. Do not buy this game, or any of TakeTwos other games.
