I really wanted to be able to play this game, but I was unable to due to something going wrong with the Games For Windows Life integration.  Not only was I unable to change any of the video settings the game would instantaneously change back anything I wanted to modify screen resolution, graphics detail, etc.  Then there was a screen before I could even start that had a defunct Games For Windows Live page up that I could not get passed.  For all I know it could be that this game is not compatible with Windows 10 Anniversary Edition, but for whatever reason, I could not get this game to work on my current setup.
