If you can get the GFWL working, then this game is absolutely worth it. That said, GFWL took me about an hour to get working so not too long. However, as a port, it isnt great. Theres some glitches that I have come across not sure if it is the same on the console versions. Anyway, worth the cash.One issue that I have had with it is that I apparently dont own EFLC and have to buy the two episodes seperately which really annoys me. Im not sure if thats just me failing somewhere or if anyone else has had this issue. If you have a fix, please let me know.
