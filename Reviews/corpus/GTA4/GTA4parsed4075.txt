Yeah, there are some serious problems with GTA IV on Steam, even with the new update. But theyre manageable.First, youve gotta download the mod that started with an X that Steam wont let me name in this review what?. Every guide will direct you towards it. Its the one that neuters the Windows Live feature. Its a pain that its even necessary but the download and installation itself takes 30 seconds.Then go to the library, GTA IV, and properties and set your launch options to availablevidmem 2048.0 percentvidmem100 norestrictions. Just copy and paste that.I have pretty terrible luck when it comes to these things but those settings worked for me.Once its up and running, Grand Theft Auto IV is a classic.
