Always loved GTA games more than any other game. GTA IV is a classic. Now most of us say its not what GTA SA was, of course its different. This one is very serious game and not much comedy in it. It does have a lot of crazy things to do like we all do in GTA SA! This game has awesome physics....very very realistic physics. The graphics are amazing. If you got a high end rig you can try ENB mods and make it look like real life. BUT......its optimized like SHT for PC which makes me go crazy. Even a high end rig will suffer with this game. Full of glitches and bugs. I think Rockstar was drunk while they were making GTA IV for PC. But still you can enjoy this game at even medium settings. The story is great. A big map to explore. Not a lot of good side missions though. Its a great game. Its GTA so no one can argue about anything. I give it a 8/10. I really enjoyed this game a lot!! Must play!
