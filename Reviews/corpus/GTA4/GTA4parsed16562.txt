Maybe in 2008 I would recommend this game, but its been 5 years that Rockstar dont even lift a finger and make some game fixes via patch!1st of all IV is famous of its bad port... Yes at start R did try to do something BUT they left the game hanging in half way! Port itself was bad and is still bad!Year 2008 game on 2014 gaming PCsixcore i7 3.6GHz, 16gb of DDR3 ram  GF GTX780 shouldnt even be a micron problem, but in reality game on max,mid or lowit really dosent matter is still lagging and performancing very poorly with many fps drops! And why? BECAUSE OF THE STILL LEFT BAD PORT!And company  R dont give a sit! They only advertise their newest games and this title is totaly forgotten...Physix was somewhat good 6 years ago, in nowday standarts it is like playing in some kind of cartoon... for example if you drive in decent speed over a broken on the road street lamp car will automaticly flip like 5 or 6 times... WTF?!??Yes I know in world marketing standart its a old game, BUT it is earned much bigger love from game devs and should have some patch fixing current problems which already exist 5 years and aint anything new BUT nobody cares... Except when they want our money from our pockets and thats why they are interested only in their new projects where they can profit doing nothing!I DONT RECOMMEND!Game should have a standart retail price of 5eur then mby
