Ive had this game for roughly a year, with a total playtime of 6 minutes. I have seen multiple threads pertaining to this subject, but I will repeat it one more time.Upon loading this game you are required to make a Social Club account in order to play online a window which will pop up every time you load this game. Upon loading it and following with their system, the window closes and you are magically not playing anything. Steam stops registering the games activity and you are left with nothing. The same result happens even if you choose to play Offline.I have no idea what the developers of this game and Valve, as a hosting company, are thinking but I havent been able to play this game at all. I would never recommend this to someone utilizing Steam, since apparently my money was wasted in its entirety.
