This game is very good, in respect to its very engaging and well written story, but the gameplay and certain mechanics I cannot help but note.PC PORT, is abysmal and unoptimized for PC, you have to fiddle around with so many arbitrary settings when you should just be able to buy, download the game and play. Fingers are crossed that GTA V will not have this complete up of a port.NO CHECKPOINTS FOR MISSIONS, I swear to God, some missions need checkpoints and are very lengthy that if you die or fail a mission, you have to start all the way from the beginning, thats been an issue since GTA III, I only wish that could have been implemented, because I know I am not the only one that frustrates with this issue.BUGS GALORE, the most noteworthy one is the final story mission where Niko must jump onto a helicopter in a QTE, BUT CANNOT CLIMB IT DUE TO THE CAMERA ING SPAZZING OUT EVERYTIME YOU REPEATEDLY PRESS SPACE, I mean really, did Rockstar not test the PC port to actually make sure that the game can actually be played? Of course not, because seems nobody cares about the PC players that more so than ever we get  ports.This game has an amazing story with a varied amount of memorable fleshed out characters, but theres more wrong than right in this game that almost breaks it to the point that I would rather this have been executed into a film rather than a video game due to thepoor port we have recieved.CONSOLE SCORE and overall score 9.8/10PC PORT SCORE 5/10 GET YOURTOGETHER FOR GTA 5 PC, WE EXPECT GOODWHEN WERE PAYING 60
