Simply the best GTA game out on the PC I would say ever,but GTA V is baws.Positive1.Great storyline.2.Characters are amazing realistic movement,lipsync,voice acting....3.Nikos from the same country as me IDC its a plus for me.4.Moral choices a couple throughout the game.5.MP is really fun to play.6.Movie making.7.You can save clips of your death wich can be useful at those WTF death moments.Negative1.Niko and Roman his cousin talk Serbian sometimes during missions and those moments are horrible.Simply cuz they totally missed the Serbian accent they made it more Russian than Serbian,but that probably wont affect you,cuz you speak English.2.A lot of people say that they have errors with Rockstar Social Club and Games for Windows LIVE,I dont have any problems with these 2,but just wanted to point this out.order to play GTA IV online,you need to have 3 platforms online Steam,RSocial Club and GFWL.4.People think that the GFWL the main platform for GTA IV will soon be shut down by Microsoft.The problem is that GFWL stores your saves and if the GFWL shuts down,your saves are gone.9.5/10Update this to Steamworks,dammit.
