I used to play this game back on my xbox then afew years later i bought this game on pc. Well the game worked but it took like a week to fix the launch error. This is a good game but it just dosent work anymore windows live ruined the game your better off playing this game on the last gen console or unless they come out with a remasterd version of this game on next gen that be a dream come true but until then gta4 on pc either dosent work or you will only be getting 20fps.
