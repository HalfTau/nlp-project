GRAND THEFT AUTO IV isnt for younger players because of its graphic violence, sexual themes, and coarse language. Yet the game will be extremely popular with adult gamers because this sequel lives up to its hype in the gameplay department. Grand Theft Auto IV lets you play as Niko Bellic, a toughlooking character who arrives on U.S. shores from somewhere in Eastern Europe, expecting to live the good life with his American cousin, Roman, who lied to Niko about his posh lifestyle in the New World. In fact, Niko is a scheming loudmouth who owes money to loan sharks because of gambling debts and lives in a cockroachinfested apartment the size of a walkin closet. Nevertheless, Niko decides to help out Roman with his rundown cab stand and keep thugs off his back until he can figure out how to make money and connections in Liberty City, the same town as 2001s Grand Theft Auto III, modeled after New York City and New Jersey. Plus, youll discover a few hours into the game there are other reasons why Niko left his homeland.
