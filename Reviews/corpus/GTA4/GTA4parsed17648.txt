Great game, love the open world , chaose , killing , and choose what kinda person your going to be, whether your a nice guy who plays by the rules , or a badass who kills just from getting the wrong look or cheesy comment from a pedestrian.Only thing is multiplayer at times can be conflicting with Live. otherwards than that get this game , its a must have for game collections.
