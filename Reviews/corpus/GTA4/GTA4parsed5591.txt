I purchased the game. I installed the game. I CANT PLAY THE GAME?! I HAVE A ING ACCOUNT ON THE SOCIAL CLUB AND I MADE SURE THE PASSWORD AND NAME AND EVERYTHING ING ELSE WAS CORRECT, THEY WERE! I EVEN WENT AS FAR TO MAKE A NEW SOCIAL CLUB ACCOUNT FOR IT.. AND THE STUPID  STILL DIDNT WORK. FOR SOME ING REASON I WASTED MONEY ON A VERY GOOD AND FUN GAME. WHAT A ING WASTE THIS WAS.. I DONT GIVE AABOUT WHAT ANYONE SAYS! I WANT A REFUND! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
