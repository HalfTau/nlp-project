This game is a masterpiece, in 2008 this game blew the minds of many gamers. The story, pacing and characters are all memorable and excellent. I would highly recommend this game to anyone interested. But, keep in mind that the PC version is a direct console port and may require alot of tweaking to get it to run smoothly. Whenever there is a sale, go buy the game, you will enjoy yourself!
