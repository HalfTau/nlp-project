Perfect Game.The Perfect mix of story and gameplay that blend into a spactacular experience you simply can not find in any other open world game.The Story is written wonderfully, the characters are constructed masterfully, and with the way the game is developed it really makes you feel as if youre living another life. the games length coupled with the ability to do casual activities with your friends adds to this feeling, while also causing you to care about the characters in unique ways other games really cant accomplish. This tpype of serious drama is something you just wont find in GTA V, and is one of the main reasons i prefer this game over GTA V.The Gameplay is spectacular. The shooting and cover systems are nearly flawless, although i do admit leaving cover can be difficult at times. The driving in this game is better then any other game ive ever played. The cars have actual weight to them, so it feels like youre actually driving a car and not a floaty mess like in GTA V and many other games. There are tons of side things to do, although not as much as San Andreas, and i do wish there were more side missions. But with the side content there is, it stills provides tons of extra content to do outside of the main story.The only major con i can find is that there are a fair amount of bugs in the PC version, but not NEARLY as much as there were in the past. In the past this game was unplayable on PC because of the bugs. many people literally couldnt open the game, including me. But Rockstar has sinced patched all these major bugs. The ones that still remain are fairly minor. Getting stuck at restaurants, police computer, ect. But these bugs are all far and few between.Overall, an amazing experience and hundreds of hours of laughs, as well as tears, which is an experience other GTA games cant provide.9/10
