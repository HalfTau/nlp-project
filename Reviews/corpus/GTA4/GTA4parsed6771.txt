Instead of buying this game, buy a deep fryer. Fill it up, heat it up, and dip your genitals into it... This will be much less painful than trying to get the game to work. If you finally manage to get around the rockstar club glitch, the Games for Windows Live glitch, and the infinate loading glitch, and actually start playing the game you will find it very addicting. Nice graphics and good storylines. Get used to having to answer the phone about a billion times from all of Nicos apparently emotionally needy friends. Getting around Liberty City is a navigational nightmare! On top of it all, you cannot really buy anything in the game except weapons. By the end you will have all the cash in the universe, but nothing to spend it on. You cant buy businesses or houses. This really ruins the game! The music is not that great, the commercials and chat stations are not really that funny. All in all, very disappointing... Save your money and get Vice City, San Andreas, and GTA V.
