Its just broken. That sums it up best. It is not immpossible to play. If you put in the hours a fix is out there, I know one is. But for anyone who bought this on sale like I did and never had any intension beyond playing through a decent story for something to do, the work it takes to fix it is just too much to really be worth it. It is a game I loved back in the day on my console, but for PC the work doesnt make it worth it.
