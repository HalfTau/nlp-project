Addicted, but disappointed.This game is something ive played for years on consoles and never got tired of, however, this PC Port is awful, the only reason people should get it is because of mods that make the game run. Also the fun mods, however this is the weirdest thing, this game runs on my Laptop with a few preformance mods on and some frame drops, however Garrys Mod can barely run on it. weird right?However if there is a sale I would advise you to pick up the game, im not blowing 20 bucks on it.
