I purchased GTA IV and I was interested in killing hookers when bored, but thats when it all started. I got on the game besides the social account their are many reasons why this game is worse then Sarah Palins speeches. First, this game is bad because it requires a high graphics card for this game when Rockstar should take consideration for those people who dont have alienwares or super jewish quality computers. Second, this game is the size of Team Fortress 2 which is understandable since its normal for Grand Theft Auto games. Third, may I say for this game being only seven years old it shouldnt be so unorganized and crudy looking its as if the menus were copied and pasted MySpace and they changed the pictures to that Dirty Russian/Itallian looking fker on the title screen. Finally, if your looking to purchase this game Id just suggest you go buy Grand Theft Auto V because its more up to date and Rockstar has their sht together with their game.
