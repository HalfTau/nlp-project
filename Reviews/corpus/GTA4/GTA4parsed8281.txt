If you have any newer OS that is above Windows 7, this game will not run for youI have Windows 8 and even through all the t with other programs that i had to deal with, such as Games for Windows Live and Rockstar Social Club I think thats what the name was I find out that it doesnt want to run on my computer due to some error that I kept on getting, and looking through the internet i find out that yes in fact this game is not able to run on any newer OS other then windows 7.Hopefully my purchase that i made even though it was around 3 years ago, I do not want my cash to go to waste just because i have a new computer with a new OS in hopes to finally be able to play GTA IV well, RIP GTA IV.
