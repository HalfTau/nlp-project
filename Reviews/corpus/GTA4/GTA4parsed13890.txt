Its a tipical GTA series game a fun and deep free world for you to discover and mess around. You wont have much to do once you finish the story mode comparing to GTA San Andreas, since you cant purchase assets or businesses.In my opinion the story is good and youre able to make your own decisions, affecting how your game will end. Some say the controls and the driving on this GTA its clunky or bad I disagree the handling seems more realistic to me comparing to previous versions.Regarding the PC version its not the greatest port out there its quite bad, honestly, since even with a current midhigh end platform you may find some problems trying to play it 4060FPS at 1080p with max settings while having your GPU and CPU working at 50 for some reason. You also cant play this game currently because of GFWL being offline, which doesnt allow you to save and load save files, but its not so bad since you can fix it see.
