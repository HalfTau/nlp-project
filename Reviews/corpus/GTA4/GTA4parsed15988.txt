This game had so much potential, but alas, Rockstar managed to mess it up so bad.The good stufThe city and its scale and detail is just aweinspiring.Excellent story, atmosphere, voice acting. Plenty of humour.Shooting mechanics are pretty good.The bad stuffGets repetitive.Poor/bugged AI.Most cars handle like fat whales on rollerskates.Often unclear mission objectives. Take out some guy, means chase him for a while, while you naively spray a fortunes worth of bullets into him, until you realize hes invulnurable until you reach a certain area of the map.No quicksaves.MORONICLY placed checkpoints. What mindless designer decided it was passable to start a 1015 minute mission with a 5 minute mandatory drive across town while listening to the same friggin dialog?!? Omfg.And the cherry on top is all the bugs and glitches. Late in the game, I failed to climb aboard a helicopter by repeatedly pressing space for the fifth time after replaying the first tedious 10 minutes of the mission. I then checked the forums and learned it was a commonly known bug, and that youd have to hack your framerate down to approx 30fps using FRAPS etc.  otherwise it wouldnt properly register the keypresses. Mind. Blown. Game uninstalled, plans to play my already purchased Episodes from Liberty City dropped.
