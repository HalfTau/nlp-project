The worst thing that happened to the gaming community.The game launches on consoles, a year, maybe later, the PC version shows up, with no support for ATIchips wow....BUT if you got your hands on the game, you can for sure say that everything will  you so hard in the you might want to order new just to fill the hole.Before you can start the game, and enjoy the menu for 3 seconds, you have to tolerate making 3 new accounts for a game that is older than the YouTube comment section. and for sure, if you still arent lying in anger and frustration on the ground, digging a hole to the middle of the earth just to forget, Games for Windows needs some updates.Great!!! I love me some updates, I love them so much, I will name my kids Update and Cancel... anyway, going insane here...So after you figured out that Games for Windows is no longer a thing apparently it was a thing? !, and you restarted your PC for the 5th time, cause the thing that does not exist anymore, is needed to save the game...Can I get my money back or what?! Seriously, there is no way to play and save the game, thats so ed up...
