Gameplay Story Graphics Soundtrack As with every GTA game, the story is just an excuse to go on a criminal rampage. Steal cars, kill whoever you want, visit stripclubs, get involved in gang shootings, etc. Its fun as hell.The best part about GTA IV is the fact that you can mod it, cheat like crazy and itll just get better and better. Youll have to do some tinkering before you can mod it, though.Performance is below subpar, sometimes it wont open correctly, Alttabbing can break the game, forcing you to close it, frame drops here and there. A charming experience.As if the crappiness of the port wasnt bad enough, they shove the worlds shtiest DRM up your throat. Dont wanna use GFWL? Ok, but your game wont be saved. Dont want to use R Social Club? Ok, but no online multiplayer for you. Dont want to use SecuROM? What are you, a filthy pirate?As they force you to use Games for Windows Live, youll unlock achievements on Xbox Live. Isnt that exciting?! Now your peasant friends will be able to see your achievements and laugh at you for buying such a mediocre port of an otherwise great game!
