my system specs are higher than the minimum recomended and yet even with all the settings at minimum its fairly unresponsive, not completely but fairly, i tried applying one that lowered the graphics even more to like gta 3 looks and that made it worse, i recommend people either have and keep their system top end costing thousands a year to play a pathetic game or just get a xbox 360 or xbox one and play gta v
