This game was so fun and had the most hilarious physics that sometimes made cars fly and the multiplayer is put in nicely without pesky menu screens all you have to do is select it in your phone. One problem I had was games for windows live and rockstar games Social Club, they just didnt work. But still without those problems I give this game a 8/10 because GTA SA did a bit better in the gameplay department and you can still get graphics mods. I hope this is helpful but anyway its 8 with the summer sale so who gives a flying .
