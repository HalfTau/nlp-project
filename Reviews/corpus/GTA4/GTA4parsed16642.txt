If you are planning to buy GTA or ANY Steam game that was designed for console, READ THE REQUIREMENTS! I cant stress how much time   some people have lost on games that they cant play because of overlycomplicated requirements. I just lost about 8.00...and Im lucky it was on sale. It always asks for things that I already have or cant seem to get. Its just been a burden with all of the software that is required youll run out of storage if youre not carefull! Just take my advise, READ THE REQUIREMENTS! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR!
