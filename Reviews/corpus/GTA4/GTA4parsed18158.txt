This game knows nothing about graphics, it looks like the old san andreas. More like a phone game than a PC.Whats more silly, the game doesnt run because my GPU is too powerful for the game. Luckily, there are mods, but not much to talk about.Textures felt terrible, models had sharp edges and animations were robotic.The game seems to have physics from outer world, the car just flips and make a barrel rol when I steer it.Driving a car is much pain in the and cops dont have brains at all When NPCs shoot, cops dont show up. But when Niko shoots, the whole goddamn PD comes to fight himStory is fine, though. But not that interesting.I really dont see why people are making fuss about it. Rockstar should invest more on PC version of this game as it is really out of the standards, even for a game that has been released in 2008.
