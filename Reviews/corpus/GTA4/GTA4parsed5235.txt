Took me about 3 hours to actually get this to start working. Had to delete, install, delete, install so may things it wasnt funny and I was about to punch my screen.But game is okay. Please friggin dont do this to me again... I cant deal with this stress when wanting to play some GTA.Overall I recommend getting this game on Xbox or PS3 since it wont take this et to start.
