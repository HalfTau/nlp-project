An extremely good game. Very underrated, possibly one of the best games in the series, and that includes GTAV. Its darker than previous games in the series, and Niko Bellic is one of the most memorable characters in video games.However, the PC version is a trainwreck of a port. Therefore, I cant recommend this.
