As much as I love this game on the PS3, the PC version is just horrible. Even on a really good gaming system, I still continue to experience lag even on the lowest settings that make the game look worse on PC than the PS3. This game is amazing, but I would rather get this on a PS3 or the Xbox 360. Not recommendeding the PC version of GTA4.However, the PC version is still a complete game. But the PC version of GTA4 is not the definitive version. 5/10
