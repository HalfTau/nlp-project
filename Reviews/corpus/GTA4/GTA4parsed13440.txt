Playing GTA 4 takes alot of time if you like it, because there is so much to do. When you are not playing the missions, there are sidequests, achievements and well....gta 4 stuff...like driving aimlessy around, killing random people or doing stuns. I spent alot of time to get the game done 100, and then there was some more! Its like it never ends, you keep going and going and going till you get sick of it, even if you love it. I know I have played myself sick of it, but it didnt take much time before I went on with the DLCs doing just the same. Completing everything possible.The only thing I wanna complain about is how few people that are actually playing ranked multiplayer. Its kinda sad to spend so much time doing for example all the achievements, and then going on to mulitplayer...but then see noone playing ranked. I am glad I have a friend to play with MP with me or else I would have been more or less alone....But this part actually pisses me off. Whenever you wanna play ranked with a friend...it wont work. The game designers made the game so you cant play with people on your friendlist. Luckily for us ranked worked when I removed myfriend, and we communicated through skype...and he easily found the game. A bit too hard for 2 or 3 people to finish off achievements, mission timers or doing something bigger, when there are so few playing.Anyway. GTA 4 is awesome!
