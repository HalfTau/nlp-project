Very badly optimized, PROTIP Turn off shadows, they make the game run at least twice as slow, also bump your resolution to the highest you are comfortable with, it makes the game run faster, like the storyline but got tired about halfway through because the missions became impossible and repetitive. Very bland color wise.
