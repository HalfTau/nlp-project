everything that gta v does wrong, this game does right, and vice versa.The storyBetter than V. It feels like you are really living out as Niko, and te story is slow, which gives you a better grasp of understanding the charecter. Also, subtle changes to him over time really show charecter development.The visualsTechnically worse than V, but the shadows are better at the hit of performance and the art style is very different than V. GTA IV goes for a muddy, gray, city art style. I recommend the simple ENB for natural and realistic lighting to complement the vannila lighting without totally destroying it like icenhancer does.The combat and walkingVery much worse than V. You have to spam the run key to run at max speed leftovers from the console port which is annoying and tiring. the hand to hand combat is terrible, with slow, inconsistant controls. The shooting is average, and really nothing special, but the guns feel kind of weak. However, I do enjoy running and pushing people, which gta v lacks.The drivingBetter than V by a mile. The driving feels realistic and your car wont be able to handle corners at 100mph like it can in V.the engineoverall better than V. V had many visual upgrades to the RAGE engine but it suffered from bad ragdoll physics and car deformation that made GTA IV a classic. In this game the cars will bend and twist with ease like in real life. Also, when you bump into someone they wont just fall over and splay out, theyll stumble around, and possibly regain their balance.Overall, this is a great game, that you should definitely pick up.
