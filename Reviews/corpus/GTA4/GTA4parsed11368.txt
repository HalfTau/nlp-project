After a 7 years i finally got my hands on this game. I must notice that i am a really huge GTA series fan and for me there is no better game then GTA VC in the whole world. However i cannot say same thing about the GTA IV. Comparing the IV part with the previous, this game is a disaster, and the point not even in the poorest video game optimization ever talking bout the famous games, point is that all mission are similar to each other like you go to some place, scope the dude who owns some other dude some money you yell at him then comes a chase which, this is boring and ridiculous. I remember every mission in GTA VC, and whole lotta missions in SA and GTA III, and i cannot retell a single mission from the IV , and this is really gets me down. The city itself has no soul, you just cannot enjoy the night ride through the city like you did in GTA III, VC and SA. My beloved Rockstar fed up this time and they did it real bad. Even music dont seem so awesome anymore. To sum it up, the game is a pile of ST, the only thing which saves the game its a plot, it is rather interesting but still it is much worse then it was in previous chapters. I only can hope that GTA V will be a better game to play.
