The game is wonderful and is one of my favorites, but the damn thing is so hard to get going that i have 60 minutes of play, that is,trying to get it to work, the game not even starting up. And nobody seems to know how to work it. So you need to install some games for windows live to get it to run, then it will force you into settings that remind me of a fever dream. Funny thing is i can run Battlefield on ultra with no problem at 60fps. This is not worth the money or hassle, just save up and get GTA 5, honestly.
