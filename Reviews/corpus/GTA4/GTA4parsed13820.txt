Steam needs a refund policy for this game alone. Took me 2 months to activate thanks to the garbage that is Games For Windows Live, and even after I got it running the game is a truly awful port. I originally bought it for the mods, but the game runs horribly on my core i74770K/R9 270X rig. FPS drops and random crashes everywhere. How a game from 2008 cant run on a machine from 2014 is beyond me. Inexcusable this product is still for sale.I have this on Xbox 360 and thats where this game is better off being played. With GTA V on the horizon, theres no reason to buy this game on Steam. Its bad. Very bad.
