Installed, reinstalled, reinstalled again, deleted paul.dll file, started and then locked up with an error message. This sucks after paying 50.00 for this game only to find out that you can only play it until the developers come out with a new game. I hope you use that money wisely, because you can rest assured that you will never see another dime from me!
