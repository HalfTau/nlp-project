Note THIS GAME IS GOOD!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME HOWEVER!!!!!Due to Windows Live IDS no longer being supported, I recommend buying the complete version on PS3, or XBOX 360.Not only do you get the DLC quests Ballad of Gay Tony, and The Lost and Damned but you dont need the windows ID.R.I.P. GTA IV PC. you Microsoft!
