After beating 5, I remembered that I had never beat GTA 4 all the way. I absolutely devoured 5 and still play it to this day, because it is such an awesome game. However, going backwards and playing 4, I now remember why I didnt beat that one.There is just way too much traveling. Driving in 5 is pretty easy due to there being a lot more straight shots. Driving in 4 is ridiculous because they built the city as a real life city with all these dead ends, weird corners, and just overall, frustrating layout. My biggest peeve is that there is that stupidtoll booth on one of the bridges. Either you stay in line and pay the toll, or you blaze through it and get a wanted level. Both are inconvenient.Also, the side quests of either dating or hanging out is tedious. Lets go to the cabaret! No, I want to do missions and make money. 1 to your friendship. Lets go bowling! No, I want to do missions and make money. 1 to your relationship.One other thing that they really corrected from 4 to 5, is that whenever you fail a mission in 5, you can replay a part of it. You are right there, back into the thick of the action. In 4, if you die, you start all the way at the beginning. And heaven help you if you need a car to get there because you restart the mission without a vehicle.This game is no longer fun, it feels like work. Games shouldnt feel like work. Also, going backwards has really dulled my thoughts on going back to Red Dead Redemption. I absolutely loved that game, too, and I dont want to do the bit where you rewatch or replay something and it tarnishes the memories you had. Same with why I wont rewatch certain cheesey 80s movies, too many have been spoiled by What the hell was I thinking?
