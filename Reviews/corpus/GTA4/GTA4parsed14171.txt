I have been playing the Grand Theft Auto series since it came out with GTA 3. The GTA series is some serious FUN! Come home from a long day of work or classes and you got some anger to release. Cause Timmy was a little  all day. Now you got GTA IV up and running, where you can release all that anger into killing hookers, beating up pimps, and getting a bite to eat from your favorite hot dog stand! If you have thoughts of killing people all day, while the world around you pisses you off, GTA will change your life. You will be so much happier.
