9/10.Ill focus on the biggest cons. Windows Live  most annoying thing here, getand dont worry about this piece ofbut lose multiplayer. not best graphics  I understand this is a game made in 2008, but hey, they could at least give higher resolution textures. friends  well, its annoying when you get involved in the story, and friends call why do you not like me? CCCCCCCCC Call me pleaaaseee!. Annoying. pretty long load times  I dont own a SSD, I know GTA4 has very big world, but waiting 2 minutes for start is too long.Pros everything else. Seriously, I like this game a lot.I actually played it 40 hours, but I prefer to launch it using EXE files in GTA4 directory.
