I am a Chinese,I bought it in University.This game has gotten a lot of bad evaluationsat least in China,and l found the reason is that these people cannot enter the game normally,Game For Windows Live has already broken down,but the game uses this account all the time.So people who cannot connect the GFWL have to play offline.Meanwhile the game dont have Chinese edition,dose R Star look down upon the the power of consumption in China?Or you scorn us from mainland of China as you did historically before?As a result,weChinesed better get a piece of pirate.In this way,why did I still give a favorable evalucating in the end?Because the game ifself is absolutely a masterpiece.GTA gave me an unforgettable childhood,and growing with me together,although I played an officious one then.
