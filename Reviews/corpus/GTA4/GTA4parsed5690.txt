This is more a review of the assorted windows bloatwear bundled with the game that is preventing me from playing the game than a review of the game itself. In the last twenty odd minutes, Ive been trying to get a windows live account to register with this game...it hasnt. I click the create account button, it launches a IE window Sin enough, honestly that leads me to some form of 404 page when I put in my email address.Apparently, if I dont create and sign in with this account, I wont be able to save my game...but it still continues to load the game to the intro, when I try to exit to go fix the problem again.In short? Never buying another rockstar product, never buying any game that requires windows live, and  steam not having a giant flashing warning label about this bloatware garbage next to the buy button.  They are selling a game that, apparently, you cant actually create accounts to ing PLAY anymore.
