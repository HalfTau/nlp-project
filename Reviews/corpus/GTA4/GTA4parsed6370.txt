If your computer can run the witcher 3 well at high and it happens to an  extra beafy cpu this game will run at about 40 fps maxed out. There are fixes for GFWL and the rockstar social club problems so if youre used to PC ports than its nothing you cant handle. The game itself is good, the levels of enjoyment to be had in it depend on your preferences. Its very different from your typical GTA, its more, for lack of a better term, gritty. Personally the open world isnt nearly as good as any other GTA game but the storyline and the characters as well as the events they go through are different enough for it to  be interesting. Also, it doesnt matter what people say, the driving in this game is worst in the series.
