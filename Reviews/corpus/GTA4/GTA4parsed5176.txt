Im giving this game a negative review not because its a horrid game if anything its absolutely beautiful, but because the port and execution is just unacceptable. Games for Windows Live is a dead service engine which you need in order to save your game and the port is so bad that I can run GTA V on highest settings and get a higher FPS than this game on highest settings. I personally went through all the BS just to get this game to work, and yes its a great game but its just not worth spending your money on. or even your time to get it working I truly never thought Id say this but if youre gonna play this game, get it on console. Itd be a much better experience. So in short GOOD GAME, BAD PORT.
