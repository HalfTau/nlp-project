Ignore the mixed review, the only reason that people are downvoting this game is Games For Windows Live. People are whining for basically no reason, since Games For Windows Live it is a mild inconveniance at worst.If you ignore the kinda awkward interface, underneath you will find one of the best open world games from this generation. Sure, this game does dumb down some of the things that made San Andreas so goddamn good, such as the RPG elements and the storyline/characters are pretty weak, but it takes things that San Andreas didnt do well, like the shooting and driving, adds a little realism to them and amplifies them to a near perfect level.8/10  Not the best GTA, but at least its better than GTA 5
