Now dont get me wrong, I have been a fan of GTA since 97 when I first played it on the PS1, but something about bad controls and top view games really annoy theout of me nowadays. I have dedicate a lot of time to these games and all I can say is, Rockstar is finally getting it right. Although I have yet to play GTA V, this GTA game outranks all previous GTA games. The controls are way better then any previous GTA, plus it works great with a wired XBOX 360 controller. I am no longer stuck walking in circles and shooting at random targets! My drunk driving has gotten waaaaay better. Vice City and San Andres are fun, but I do not dare play them with out proper controller support. Episodes from Liberty City is also recommended because of the added base jumping. 10/10
