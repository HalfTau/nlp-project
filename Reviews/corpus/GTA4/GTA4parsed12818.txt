The worst GTA. There are no colors on this one, its like theyre trying to be more Gears of warish, or something like that. The missions are boring just some are cool like the heist four leaf clover I think and the one in the big ship. GTA V is way better, and also is San Andreas.Aaaaaand we got rockstar social club and ing gfwl. Why god, why.
