Let me first start off by saying GFWL CAN BE REMOVED. All you need to do is find a source on the internet preferably a GTA forum asking how to remove it, and do as instructed. Or you can make one, which I already did for some reason.Now that GFWL is out of the way most of the negative reviews, lets get into the actual game.First off, I bought this game after playing GTA V due to people saying howGTA Vs story was to GTA IVs. So, I solely bought this game for the story and that only.The story, after about 8 hours into it, I saw was nothing like the GTA V story.This game is about the dark, gloomy and depressed Liberty City New York with the story of a Serbian Immigrant who has done atrocities in war. After the war, he falls into crime in Europe, and finds himself fleeing a mob boss in Europe for being falsely accused of owing money to him. Because he has too many connections for Niko to take on an army, he boards a cargo ship to be smuggled into Liberity City. While GTA V is all about the good vibes, bright colors, and the upbeat tone its trying to provide. GTA V 3rd ending, cough, this game starts off dark, and ends dark.I dont like adding ENBs to this game just because of that. The oversaturation of most ENBs completely ruins the mood of Liberty City.It really depends on what youre looking for in a GTA game if you want to compare this dark, gloomy game to something colorful and upbeat like GTA V.In all honestly, this games story went way above my expectations. Unlike GTA Vs characters excluding trevor, I actually cared about the characters involved in Nikos buildup in the crime business. Roman, Lil Jacob, Pckie, and all the others, you can actually like and care about.Rating 9/1010/10 if GFWL didnt exist
