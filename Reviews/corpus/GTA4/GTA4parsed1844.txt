Great game so far. I am really enjoying it but Games For Windows Live is attached to it. Steam should not be selling anything with this defunct service included. GFWL was removed from Dark Souls. Once it is removed from this game, I will recommend it. My game freezes too often at start up because of this Microsoft garbage. If you want to play multiplayer, better get a Hotmail account and buy an XBox! Never had a Hotmail account or owned an XBox? Maybe you can go find out more about those two worthless pieces of crap by searching them on Bing!Games For Windows Live  Stay Away!
