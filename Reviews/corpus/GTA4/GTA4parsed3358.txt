Do not waste youre money on this game i downloaded and played for a couple of good hours but after day two i logged onto steam to play gta iv and i hit play and nothing happened it sayed it started but nothing ever happens i tried everything to get it to start but it would not so dont waste your money on a game that you cant even play.
