This is curently my most played game on Steam. Somehow beats Grand Theft Auto V in some cases. I really enjoyed the story of the game. Despite the fact that this console port is a mess on PC, has loads of issues and problems  it is still really fun to play.Why you should play GTA IV Great story, interesting characters City full of activities and adventures Fun openworld experienceWhy you should not play GTA IV GFWL Games for Windows Live integration and no SteamWorks Even on highend PCs it is difficult to maintain 60FPS QHD, UHD, game is not smoothOverall, if you did not play this game yet, I really recommend you to try it.P.S. Game got an update on 2016 November and it have passed 6 years since last update 2010. This gives a hope, that the game will have SteamWorks integration, removed GFWL and maybe even port to SteamOS/Linux. This 2016 update is a small bugfix for some major gameplay bugs and minor optimizations, but anyway it shows that this game should not be burried yet. Hope this update was not the last one...
