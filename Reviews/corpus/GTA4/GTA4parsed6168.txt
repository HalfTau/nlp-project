I recently downloaded GTA IV again. I already bought it ages ago. But now it will not show up in the library, but when I go to the steam store to the GTA IV page, it says I have it in my library. GTA IV was in a category before I installed it, but now it dissapeared. Anyone know how to fix, please help?I tried fixing it by restarting PC, then it shows up temporarily in the library but then it is gone again. I tried removing all the categories but that doesnt work either.I also have problems with the graphics being too low and the game then tells me that my card or hardware cant take it having it higher. Even though I can run most games in maximum graphics with 60 fps.I have it working on the PS3, and had lots of fun with it. The driving can be a bit awkward but it is more than fun.If you watch any of the GTA IV compared to GTA V videos on the internet, you can see that GTA IV is indeed better.I do not recommend thise game for the PC, because there are so many bugs if you want to begin to play this game.
