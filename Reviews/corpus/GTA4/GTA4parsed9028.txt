The amount of hoops you have to jump through to play this game is just too much. First off, the game had me on bare minimum graphics settings and refused to let me change them stating y raphics card couldnt handle it. At the bottom it showed i was only using 300 of my 4000 Mb. To change that, I had to add a command line file to the steamapps folder. Then, it wont let you save your game, or recieve achievements unless you have a games for windows live account. This game is good, but not nearly good enough to deal with all the t required to play it.
