Ive just finished the game and after some time reflection this is my reviewThis only applies to the main story and not the multiplayerPros Gameplay was fun overall Nice graphics  even in 2017 Large and detailed area to explore Nice atmosphere Npcs walk around doing their job they talk to each other and sometimes you can witness some random events Fun and Interactive phone and Internet computers There were a lot and different side quest or activities to do The characters were in place, they represented well what they were supposed to do Great voice acting Amazing story Choices have some minor or major concequences  thats up to you It took me 32 hours to complete the game and I have not done all the activites and random encountersCons I felt the driving was a bit odd and it can take a bit of time to learn how to The radio station was a bit dissapointing compared to the others Gta Since you get all the houses for free you will end the game with a lot of money that you cant really spend Some minor glitches  sometimes the dead bodys would move and some Scenes would not display right Driving fast on the bridges would make the drivers really unpredictable for some reason Social club can be a pain for some playersI give Gta IV a 8,5 / 10.I enjoyed the experience of the game and I belive you wont regreat buying it.
