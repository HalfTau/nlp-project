This game was fun. On xbox and ps3, but here i cant even load the game its SO ing frustrating with windows live. I read reviews and downloaded windows live, it told me to open it then said it wasnt working. Tried it 5 TIMES and still the same thing is happening. It worked before, but now I had to redownload it and if i could But i cant because steam wants to  me over I would more than willingly get a refund and use that 20 dollars for another game.
