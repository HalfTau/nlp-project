My first review and its a warning for everyone, dont waste your money or time with GTA IV, it will not work. I tried every workaround from various forums and have just spent aroud 12 hours doing so. The game freezes at the loading screen and trying to find a definitive answer/solution to the problem is damn near impossible. Im so dissapointed in this as it is the only GTA game I havent played, I was going to buy GTA V today as i only have an xbo360 copy but I dont think Ill bother
