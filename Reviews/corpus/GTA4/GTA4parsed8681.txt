Due to issues with the Games for WIndows Live service, online mode does not work for, based on various messages boards Ive seen online, about 50 of players. some players are also reportedly having issues with basic game functions, like saving, not working if you arent connected to the online system.Feel free to buy this game and see if it works, but keep the Steam refund system handy.
