Cannot stress enough how bad it is that this is available for purchase. You need to overcome several hurdles just to play the game and even when you do get the game working it is just a buggy mess, with floating cars, rubbish textures, missing video and or sound for cinimatics and to top it all off missing saves. I thought there was a way to fix this game myself.. I was wrong...
