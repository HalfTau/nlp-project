     Now to start with its a pretty bad pc port but all in all id say still worth grabbing it on sale.If your have more than 2GB of dedicated memory Gcard then youll have to go in your steam library to the game and right click it, then go to properties in the drop menu and on the first tab click set launch options, norestrictions nomemrestrictand it will unlock the suspended graphics options ingame. NOTE becareful tho your cpu/pc can run the game fine or theres no safety guards to keep the game from sucking up too much juice from your system, but with a Gcard holding more than 2GB of dedicated memory it would be safe to say the rest is good to go.Still uses GFWL to run multiplayer options, a lot of people say they hate it but i loved getting a free login account for xbox live on my pc, so whenever i go to play a game on steam that uses Games For Windows Live i log in the same account and add my friends xbox accounts they made the same way i did so we can invite eachother, and also ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY THE MULTIPLAYER WITH STEAM GAMERS AND XBOX GAMERS. so i got to play gta races with my brother while he was on his xbox at his house and my steam friends. So in my opinion the 5 minutes it takes to link a GFWL account to your email and check the msg in your email to enable it is well worth it to play online with xbox players and steam players.Other than that i didnt have any problems but i hear some people say they have problems with the version of GFWL that comes with the game, again when i bought it the GFWL was the current version and worked fine, but if yours doesnt work then you just have to uninstall the GFWL you get when you run the game and go to the website and download the current version and your good to go.So im aware the game has some compatibility problems but none which ive seen ever keep anyone from being able to launch and play, so if you love GTA then my personal opinion is to grab this pack when its on a 50 sale or more.This game has all the graphics options to change so you can set things low, but still be careful cuz open world games like this one, where the world is constantly rendered in front of you as it dissapears behind you, always suck up a lot of juice so make sure your systems good.
