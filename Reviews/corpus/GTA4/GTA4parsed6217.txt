My review will simply be one for the statistics.It indeed does not work on windows 10 because of rockstar online issues. There is a fix for this, but it disables online play and even when you get the game to run you cant increase the resolution, texture quality or adjust any graphical settings for that matter. I was stuborn and thought to myself all these negative reviews mean nothing and it will work fine for me. I was wrong. Dont make the same mistake I did by buying thia game if you run windows 10. Thank god for steams refund policy I already requested my refund.
