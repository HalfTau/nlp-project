Good story and gameplay. Dont expect anything better than GTA V except more indoors, but worth it during a sale. IMHO modding doesnt add much to whats already here.Performance with IceEnhancer3 max settings Windows 10/GTX970 ranged from 3045 fps. Experienced 2 crashes during 35 hours of playing. Required a seperate download of Games for Windows Live before working, but can be played without an online GFWL account i.e local accounts.
