I dont recommend this game. And it has nothing to do with the game. GTA 4 requires GFWL Games for Windows Live. And if you know anything about GFWL, you know it is the worst ing pain to deal with. The game crashes so much because of GFWL it will drive you insane. Not to mention any time you update your drivers you end up messing GFWL up and you have to go through a ton of different forums to get your game working again. Steam should never allow another game access to this community if it requires GFWL.
