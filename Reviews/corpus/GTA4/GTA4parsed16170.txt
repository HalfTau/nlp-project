Despite the bad conversion for pc, probably just copy and pasted the game code, the enforcement of being logged into windows live is unacceptable. Of course there is some magic workaround to that but well, I didnt find that yet.Should have just downloaded a cracked version.BTW I currently cant play because the windows servers are down, and there is no offline savegame, yay.
