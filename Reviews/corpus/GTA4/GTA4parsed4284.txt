GTA IV brought the series, and gaming to a whole new level. This game follows Nico, an immigrant from Yugoslavia. He comes to America to start a new life in pursuit of the American dream. However, his journey brings him on a path of violence, drugs, betrayal, and corruption. In earlier titles, the GTA franchise was more comical, filled with more over the top scenarios and situations, However, this title brought about more of a realistic tone, probably due to the games more realistic visual style and mechanics. The Steam version of this game has been updated, but I had to fool around with the games files before to get it to run. Since the update I havent been able to even play it, which is unfortunate since this game is great. If anybody could give me a hand I would appreciate it The PC version is also great, since the community has released some pretty fantastic mods. I give this game a 10/10, a must buy for those who love a good story, open world games, and fun multiplayer.
