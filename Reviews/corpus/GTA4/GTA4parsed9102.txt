I really love this game  I really do, Ive finished it twice on PS3. Its one of the best games to ever be released.But why in gods name cant I play it on PC. I have the ability to play Borderlands 2 2012 on highest graphics, but I cant play GTA IV PC Release, 2008!.If you want to play GTA IV, get a good pc. Like the one I have. And make sure it works.Thanks, Rockstar.
