I want a fing refund.  The reason is is beacause the stupid games for windows thing is broken and when i enter the product code it takes like for ever and it wont confirm it and the game just gets stuck in an infinite loop on the character screen and wont start.  If that is normal and will eventually load please tell me and if not I want my refund.  I payed about 10 during steam sales.
