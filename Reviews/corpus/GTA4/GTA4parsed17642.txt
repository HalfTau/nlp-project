So after the 48 hours it took Rockstar Social club to recognize that I made and activated an account. The game crashes upon launch, Im assuming because of some conflict with Games For Windows Live. A Program that was unpublished along with the Microsoft points program. Why? I have no idea. But if you buy this game, prepare yourself for migranes and urges to smash your laptop and deactivate your steam account. I want this game either to be remotely playable I hear it is not optimized properly for PC so asking for it to run well is a longshot. Or I want my money back, because I can not launch this game. 5 out of 5 stars.
