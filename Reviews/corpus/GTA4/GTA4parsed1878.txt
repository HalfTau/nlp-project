 Actual review, not just more rubbish about modding I cant explain how disappointed I was by how poorly optimised this version is. I tried everything to get this running smoothly and consistently, spending hours in the attempt. More than happy to fiddle with nonoptimised games to improve performance  Fallout games, other GTA games  but I had to give up with this and get a refund. Changing settings, Windows version compatibility, Video card config, turning off Steam overlay, turning off monitoring software, etc  nothing worked.Sudden large drops in fps and wildly differing results from the ingame benchmark tool. A shame, because the actual game is brilliant.For comparison, specs Win10, i76700hq, GTX970m, 16GB RAM.
