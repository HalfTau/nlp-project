Total blunder. Glitchy cutscenes, no AntiAliasing options, and Games for Windows Live killed it for me made me install 3 bull microsoft software to bloat my PC and I STILL COULDNT LOG IN, without doing that the game wont let me save.Instead of getting a crack, I just uninstalled, and purged my computer of all the bloatware. Would request a refund if I didnt wait so long to play after buying.Stay away. Bloatware should be illegal. Find another way to play.
