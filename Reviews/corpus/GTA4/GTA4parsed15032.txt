A fantastic open world game with a heavy emphasis on reality and making a mockery of it rather than in past games or other related games. There are no jet packs or parachutes except for what is in the expansions but for me the exciting fun is still there particularly in the form of physics. The physics in driving are the closest to a realistic simulation as you can get without it becoming a simulator and get in the way of everything else in the game. This can create some really interesting driving and car chase expereinces. Running people over with Euphora engine never looked so good! The game can get boring over time as the shooting isnt the funnest thing in the world and the cover system isnt very good most of the time but there is plenty of small nuances, settings, and scenarios aswell as the stor y keep the gameplay interesting instead of just putting you through a meat grinder shooting fest.ConsCould be boring to those with short attention spansStory can be a bit difficult to follow at some pointsGTA4 on PC is poorly optimized so fiddling with settings to get a stable or even bearable expereince is required even more so on older or lower end machines.Something to be desired in terms of side missions when comparing previous gamesProsPhysics are top notch and add to the fun and gameplay tremendously. Playing other free roaming games without equal physics  is like going back 10 years in some ways. Seeing people react accordingly to physical stimuli bullets, cars hitting them is entertaining by itself.Graphics look good and detailedSound sounds good. Radio stations appeal to just about everyone.Large variety of actionsNico is a very likeable character. You can only hate him if you hate yourself. You probalby do because you play bad games mostly but think good ones like this are bad. That is all.
