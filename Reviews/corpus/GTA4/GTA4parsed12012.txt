I THINK I FOUND A FIX! I RECOMMEND HAVING THIS GAME!Before, I had problems running this game OFFLINE and ONLINE. I COULDNT PLAY THE DAMN GAME. I was really stressed out. But. After looking out for answers from friends and forums, I was able the figure the fix by myself. The fix is somehow tiresome if you have slow internet cause it took time for me to connect to GAMES for WINDOWS LIVE. I know. You STILL NEED to connect to windows live. Whether you went offline, you are logged in WINDOWS LIVE. I dont know if the log in thing when offline from Social Hub of Rockstar does that with the others, but it does in mine. Ill show you how I figured it out.Link to the video tutorial
