RockStar Games has done it again! GTA IV has been an awesome experience so far, and the graphics are great, I tell you. I love the characters and how they play out. Niko does everything for the money. Now, THAT is a good characteristic for a protagonist/antagonist. It is amazing how the story plays out going on adventures and doing deals with other people, and trying to survive in the world of LC Liberty City. Overall, this game deserves an 8.95. I recommend this game to people who like action and shooting and dealing with the life of a criminal.
