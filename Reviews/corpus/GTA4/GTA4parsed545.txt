Definitely better than GTAV. Saw a lot of negative reviews regarding this game, which postponed my purchase by around 2 years. But when I finally wanted to try it out myself, it was amazing. All the negative reviews are targeting an issue that was prevalent in the old version of the game, but Rockstar went on to fix it, leaving most of the negative reviews incorrect. When comparing to GTAV, it is amazing. It has 3 storylinesincluding Singleplayer DLCs, which GTAV does not have, it has no paywalls and microtransactions, and has a plethora of vibrant characters. Also, Rockstar doesnt ban you for using mods in Multiplayer, allowing you to do roleplaying or anything you please with your friends. The graphics also arent too bad considering it is reaching its 10th anniversary. This is an amazing game, 10/10.
