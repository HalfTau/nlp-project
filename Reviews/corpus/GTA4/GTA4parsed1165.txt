this game is a mess on PC but if you go to microsoft and download games for windows live executable it should work, this isnt included with windows 10 so its required if you want to play i use a .dll mod that just kills GFWL at the start so no problems, they fixed some of the optimization actually recently so the game runs a bit better on high end systems, but its still the infamous mess of GTA 4great game, maybe pick it up for your old xbox 360 if you can
