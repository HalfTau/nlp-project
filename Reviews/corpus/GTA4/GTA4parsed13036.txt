3rd time i have finished this game and it never gets boring. The game does is exactly what its aimed for put you in the mind of the crinimal underworld. You play as Niko Bellic fresh of the boat from Russia visting your cousin Roman in Liberty city. The game starts out pretty slow and the first 10 or so levels will a feel like tutorial missions but once you get through them and get your first gun the game turns into a massive hollywood style crime/thriller. With hours and hours of missions and many side quests and extremley fun mini games i give this game 10/10 Three Leaf Clover
