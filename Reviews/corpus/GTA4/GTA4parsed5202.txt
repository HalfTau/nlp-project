Quite a hazzle to get this game running. Took me 2 hours... Problem seems to appear to everyone purchasing the game and is long known. Rockstar doesnt do anything about it, but Steam still sells it. I will avoid Rockstar from now on.Aside from that I played the game for one hours and it wasnt fun to me after playing GTA, GTA2 and GTA5.I wouldnt even recommend to buy this game on sale.
