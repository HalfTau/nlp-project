i dont understand why people like this game. it looks, runs, and plays likeits a terrible pc port, with GFWL which you need to download seperately for it to even work on windows 8, it runs like crap on high end machines, and it looks aweful with this nasty blur over everything even after turning definition on and max settings on. supposidly mods make this game good but installing them requires you to go to sketchy websites and download several mod installing programs. unlikeable characters, unfun missions, and how long can you really have fun just turning cheats on giving yourself all the guns and fighting cops? being a pc gamer i havent played gtaV but it looks a lot more promising story/character/driving wise. if you want a gta style open world game look elsewhere, such as gta san andreas, sleeping dogs, and saints row 3/4.
