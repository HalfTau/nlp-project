I will never again try to play any dumb game from GTA series,to hell,not even a Rock Star game. I installed this trash again after some time,and I was like bored and wanted to finish gay Tony part wich I played a little bit. First of all I cant login to social club... Ok,I made new social club account. Then I run damn game,oh,now I have to login to Live account. Well it worked before... I try to login with my Hotmail account,and it says that my password is wrong... How the hell can my password be wrong on account that I login to almost every day?! I just unistalled game and was so frustrated that I punched my screen... I will most definitely never again try to play some stupid Rock Star game again. Beside tons of bugs and other stuff,Niko and Lost have interesting story,but thats all that is good with this game.
