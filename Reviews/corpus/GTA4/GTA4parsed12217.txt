After playing it for more than a few months, on 2 computers, i have a lot to say.ProsStorylineRoman Bellic yes, he gives the game value.Doing whatever you want, which is what GTA is.ConsDriving is not realistic at all, too boatyPoorly optimized, even my GTX 760 cant handle it at ultra at a steady 60fps. not even 50 fps. too unstable.I recommend this game for those who is interested, but i dont recommend it to those waiting for GTA V coming in 23 weeks.
