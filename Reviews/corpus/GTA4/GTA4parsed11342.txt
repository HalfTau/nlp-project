Grand theft auto iv, oh where do I start?Well, I bought this game two years ago thinking that my 400 gaming pc could run it. Long story short I was wrong, low got me around 1320 fps and sometimes lower. With the port issues aside, this game is brilliant.Why?Well, the game itself is rather plain and serious however with the help of mods such as the iCEnchancer mod you can make the game look brilliant and feel brilliant too.Information about my setup  how it runs on the gameIntel core i54690k  3.6 Ghz8GB DDR3 1333mhz RAMGTX 760 SCMSI B85G431200w power supplyAverage FPS In game benchmarking  60CPU Usage  54GPU Usage 488/10
