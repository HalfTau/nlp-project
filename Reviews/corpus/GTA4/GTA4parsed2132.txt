The hatred over the banning of OpenIV is unbelievable. First off, it wasnt Rockstar games, it was TakeTwo that made the mistake of banning the modding software. A lot of people are directing hate towards the wrong ing company. Second off, nobody is thinking ahead. All of these nonrecommendations arent going to go away ever. Hell, they even reallowed OpenIV after their mistake, but nothings going to be able to fix the terrible rating that GTA IV and GTA V have now.The two ways this t could be fixed is if the people who put a negative recommendation removed their reviews/changed them. Which is highly unlikely. Besides that, the only other way to fix this is to have an influx of new customers recommend the game, which is even MORE unlikely, because that was the point of all the negative reviews! To  up the sales and deter people from buying the game!In attempting to  over and show your guys hatred to the wrong company, youve done irreversable damage to these two amazing games, and have given a giant middle finger to Rockstar, the company that has given you critically acclaimed game after critically acclaimed game.Now, with that out of the way.GTA IV is an amazing game that was ahead of its time. The physics and NPC reactions are incredibly well done with the Euphoria engine. The graphics havent aged well, but are still acceptable. The story and characters are good, too. Niko comes across as heavily scarred from his past, and his main motivations in the game are morally understandable.Only other problem with the game is the optimization for newer hardware. It requires a lot of patience and time to get this game running, meaning few are able to actually get it going.Overall, good game that doesnt deserve the hatred dished up by its own fans, and unfortunately its going to heavily suffer from that.
