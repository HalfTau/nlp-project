Grand Theft Auto IV has one of the most interesting and hooking storylines and its not one of those games that feel like its taking forever to complete either!When youre bored of singleplayer, multiplayer steps in with a variety of online game modes such as deathmatches, races, turf wars and more! If youre not into following such missions and just want to hang out with friends online you can just play in free mode where youre free to mess about and do whatever youd desire to do along with your friends.When the game becomes completely boring you can take the advantage of having this game for PC which is mods. Mods overhaul this game massively! Mods allow you to mod cars, mod weapons, mod your character, mod maps, install scripts, overhaul the game graphics and more! The modding community is still alive and will stay alive to deliver lots of mods so you do not ever get bored of this game! Modding may sound great and all but some mods are fairly difficult to install and others may crash your game.Over all Ive enjoyed this game since release and I still do! I recommend buying this game!
