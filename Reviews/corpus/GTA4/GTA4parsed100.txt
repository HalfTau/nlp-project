Graphics sucks obviously. Story sucks almost. Controller support sucks I feel pity for those who played it on consoles.Game is much better than GTA5. Better in everything, choices GTA5 only had heist plan choices that did not change anything, taxi why theres no such thing in GTA5?? ?, Radio why there is no podcast radio stations in GTA5? I sometimes dont want to leave the car cause I listen to some debate, music    4lyfe. Also, main theme is cool as .I feel like its the best GTA after Vice City. However, maybe its even better than Vice City, but nostalgic feelings tell me otherwise.Anyway.10/10
