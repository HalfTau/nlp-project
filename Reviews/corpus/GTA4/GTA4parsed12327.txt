There is no gym for growing muscle, there are no hats except 2 Russian hats from the first ever cloth store in the game. All cars slide like they are on the moon or something. very clunky cover system. A very small selection of weapons. No real relationships with anyone except Roman. No military. very clunky flying controls. Only perverted and boring radio posts. You cannot change haircut or facial hair. there are only 3 shops for clothing. With a very small selection or cloths. most look like Grandpa cloths. Most character look like they have the same mother because they were very very very very lazy with making unique faces. You cannot melee fight without getting punched back. No way to get better at melee fighting. They took all the good things from San Andreas and threw them out of the window. Using Laptops and internet cafes is cool but they could have made it a lot better and again they didnt care too much. They give you no way of buying cars or new safehouses. You cannot even choose your colour at paynspray. You have no way of customizing any car and even if you find a car you like, most mission will make you lose your car because it disappears. you cannot drive more that 1 minute before an NPC bumps into your car  bridges are nightmares . On bridges the NPCs just change lane without signal and for at least 4 times in 300 yards, very unrealistic. The Story is fine but even Vice Citys STory beats this one. This is just better in terms of graphics and thats about it. PS. you can escape any wanted level by using subway tunnels. The AI cannot follow you there for some reason. Do not bu this game unless you are a fan. It is not a good game by any means. It is just there and takes a place in the average games list. Ridicilously overpriced. Buy it when its on sale, but I would not recommend this for hardcore players or casual players.
