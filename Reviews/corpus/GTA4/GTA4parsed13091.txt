I just bought this game thinking it would be nice to play it again but on computer for once. When i launch the game, it asks me about the social club. I click play offline and the window goes away completely. It is almost like it wants me to create an account for online play when I only want to play story mode. What am I doing wrong? I bought, downloaded, and installed this game through steam thinking this would be easy.....
