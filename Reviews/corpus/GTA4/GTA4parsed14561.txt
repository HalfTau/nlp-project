Despite some issues I have with being put in the shoes of such a character, this game is excellent. The characters are the most believable ive ever seen in a game with topnotch voicing and animation, the story is good, its hillarious at times, the city is incredibly immersive and the game has a HUGE amount of content.Technologically the game is a masterpiece  the city almost seems alive and its a pleasure to drive around its openworld and take in the sights, or just watch the traffic drive past and pedestrians go about their business  it is all overwhelmingly good.The amount of attention to detail is astonishing  the game even has fully functional Pool, Darts, Bowling and even a tetris like arcade game. And getting drunk isyourpants funny.One thing that got annoying very fast however was the saving system, which doesnt save just before the action sequences but when you get the mission  so you often have to backtrack 1020 minutes. Dying in difficult missions can get frustrating fast.I also wish that there were some way to keep Nikos bodycount down  he is a noble soul and I just wish that the game realised that I was shooting cops in the leg instead of killing them  it would be nice to steer Niko in a slightly different direction.And one last thing  some kind of realism or hardcore mode would have been greatly appreciated, with cops enforcing traffic laws  things like that, its all a little too easy.Overall though  8.5/10  Recommended big time.
