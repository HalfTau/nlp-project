i know this game ive played it and its a fun game but for rockstar to neglect it like this is ridiculous DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! it does not work and even if you can get it to work you cant save it... ill bother giving it a DECENT review when i can actualy play it. im just glad i got it in the bundle with gta 3, vice city and san andreas witch all run perfectly btw...
