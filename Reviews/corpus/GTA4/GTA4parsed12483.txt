I havent try multiplayer yet, so I cant say anything about it or problems caused by Windows Live, even though I see that you need to reigster. Well, I did register offline you can do it on game and its very wuick, like 10 seconds just to be able to save your progress in story mode. And I have to admit that singleplayer mode is great. A lot of fun, a lot of action, interesting, well written story, and of course huge freedom. Liberty City is full of life, you can even watch shows on TV and have fun while watching. Defienetly worth playing, even though there are some thenichal problems and as far as Im concerned you cant play multiplayer because of some GFWL problem. Well, to sum it upPros Nice graphics, and great audioHuge, realistic, living city with masses of stuff to doFreedom, freedom, and again, freedomSatysfing missionsGreat story and characters you can make decisions that affect storyline and your contacts with other charactersPacked with noncheap action also very good fighting systemConsSerious problems with multiplayer Games For Windows Live...You have to make at least offline account to be able to save your progress even in singleplayer. Its really easy and quick to do, but still...Poorly optimized newer games with better graphics run smoothly on my computer, but this one sometimes lagsAll in all defientely worth playing, its real fun for hundreds of hours  in single player alone. Though the multiplayer is unavailable, form what I know... Buy it anyway, and enjoy Liberty City that is full of life even without internet players, and dive into great story of Nico! RATING 8,5/10
