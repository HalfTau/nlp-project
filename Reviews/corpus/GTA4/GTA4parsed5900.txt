THIS CURRENT VERSION IS GLITCHY AND MESSED UP! The game wont start properly. Once you started, the graphics are all screwed up. The cars float in thin air. The roads and buildings wont render. Its a shame Steam is selling this in their store. I only paid 4 for this, and it was a complete rip off. They wont give me a refund. Take it off the store.
