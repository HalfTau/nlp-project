Great game. Fun game with great graphics and every detail of the map invested. There is no end to the possibilities of the open world is great for me. The only thing that I really liked this game weather. Looks bad. Every time the rain and dark and dim. Almost no light at sun. And color quality is not really good.But I personally recommend the game
