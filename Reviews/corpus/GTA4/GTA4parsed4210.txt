Doubted if this game would actually work, I bought the complete pack with GTA 4, TBOGT and TLAD, and they all work brilliantly out of the box.However for the best experience nvidia users open the Nvidia Control Panel, go onto GTA IV and its expansions and set the FXAA to on and the vsync on as well as triple buffering.The in game vsync caused some pretty nasty frame drops.I look forward to completing this game 100
