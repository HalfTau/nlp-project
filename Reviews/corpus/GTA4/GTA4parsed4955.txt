Great game, though there can be issues regarding the installation process. I myself had to completely wipe my hard drive and start over to get a few games working, this one including. A decent sized campaign and plenty of free roaming, with a darker storyline than the other gtas, id definitely recommend it along with the expansions. 8/10
