dont bother, its like they are trying to prevent you from playing the game.1st line of defense Rockstar Social Club, after you log in and press play the game closes itself down and doesnt reopen again. If you are ever lucky enough to make it past this point, then you are met with...2nd line of defense Games for Windows Live, no log ins work, even if you are sure if they are correct.Bottom line is, if you can get the game to open which is pretty much impossible, then you can only play singleplayer and im pretty sure you cant even save. But the game itself is actually very good.
