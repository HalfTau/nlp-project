So I loved playing the game when I had an xbox and didnt need live to play it. I buy it here, you need live to save. I cant even ing save. Havent had live in years. Thank you microsoft for ing this up too. Its nice that they jacked up GTAV prices before the sale so when the sale hit, it wasnt much of a change, too. All companies involved in the GTA series via steam can rot for all I care.
