So i bought the complete edition and because of Windows live it wont let me play episodes of liberty city.A lot of players agree with me.Only the first campaing with Niko is available.Windows live ruind everything.IF someone managed to find a solution in which windows live doesnt says that he could not retrieve info from marketplace live il give all my respect.until then i can only advice people not to buy this game.REMEMBER STEAM DOESNT REFUND! !SO DONT TRY YOUR LUCK
