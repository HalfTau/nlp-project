I would reccomend this game if you generally like the GTA series or games like it. Keep in mind that youd need a half decent PC to handle this game. It is not the best ported game ever though. Expect general lag spikes/FPS drops. Its annoying at times but the fun of mods and the gameplay make up for it 100.
