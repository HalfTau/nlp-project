I would not recommend this game for the following reasons 1. The graphics seriously suck.2. The Lost and Damned and Ballad of Gay Tony didnt even work for me? I downloaded it and I couldnt play it. I searched everywhere on forums to find how to play it but It didnt work for me and my requests for help still doesnt even have a reply.3. Your Money is unspentable you can buy all the weapons and refill all the ammo of them and still youre rich enough to do this   ten times again!4. The cars suck. Like seriously! There are only like 7 Nice rides and the other ones are scrap, Its just not fun to ride in such a car.5. Gta V is out6. The multiplayer sucks too, I thought about replaying the Campaign but then with a friend or something cool but there are those crappy Gamemodes where you have to shoot against other players
