This crap does not work! My computer characteristics are way better than requirements and it is stuck at 800600 resolution with low settings. And as I have found with google, this is not exceptional at all, this is pretty common issue and still, after 6 year from release isnt fixed?! Dont give any money for that, this is fraud.
