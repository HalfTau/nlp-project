so if you are reading this review and you have not lived under a rock for your entire life you obviously want gta4 and dont want to pay 60 on gta5 but while this game is cheaper this will give you nowhere near as much fun as gta5 this has nothing to really to do in it just wait until gta5 goes on sale but it will give you some entertainment but eh
