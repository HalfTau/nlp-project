If you have liked the previous ones, its hard not to recommend this one as well. More of the same, but with prettier graphics. The production value really shows, and I find the main story quite entertaining.In short GTA IV is mandatory for fans of the franchise and should keep you happy for dozens of hours. Highly recommended.
