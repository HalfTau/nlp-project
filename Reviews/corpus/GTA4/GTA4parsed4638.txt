Unfortunately, in its current state I cannot recommend the game. Personally, I was not able to login to either GFWL or the Rockstar Social Club, making it impossible to play online.The game itself is lots of fun. The story is good, the atmosphere is insanely good and, to me, the physics feel more realistic than in any other game of the Grand Theft Auto series, including GTA V. However, the multiplayer brought me many more hours of so much fun, just driving around together in this beautiful world, screwing with the NPCs and the world or just having death matches. This games multiplayer is just awesome  if it works.There are many more quirks, like the game not recognizing more than 2GB of VRAM but you can easily work around those issues so those arent the deal breaker for me.Unless Rockstar fixes the multiplayer though I heard it still works on consoles, I can not recommend this game.
