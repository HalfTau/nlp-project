Game doesnt seem to work. The first few pages of the Steam forums are filled with people saying it doesnt work. 2/3 of the time when I click play, nothing happens, the other third, the game launches, but doesnt work because of something called games for windows live, which is required to save my game, apparently, but I cant use it for whatever reason. So I hit escape to cancel, but nothing happened, tried altf4, nothing happened, had to alttab, right click, close window.Nonworking piece of garbage should be fixed or given a refund for.Always check the forums before buying games
