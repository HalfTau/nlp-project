I wont give this game a bad review, because its one of my favourites  but it doesnt exactly work as expected out of the box.ON WINDOWS 101. Right Click  Properties  General  Set Launch Options  norestrictions nomemrestrict availablevidmem 4096.02. Install Games for Windows Live from Microsoft Website, then ignore it forever. Im not sure if signing into it once is necessary  but it needs to exist on the PC somewhere apparently.3. Launch Game, select Play Offline even with correct details you will struggle to get online features working4. When Games for Windows Live pops up ingame, select Player 1 and dont bother trying to sign in. Just hit Esc and things will be just fine.5. Adjust resolution, max out settings etc. Dont try benchmark or it may crash.6. Enjoy some digital entertainment that finds a great balance between story and gameplay, with rich male characters that you can invest in while absorbing yourself in a uniquely fed up and melancholic interpretation of New York City atmosphere provided by the miserable weather, the hilarious radio, and meanspirited pedestrians/drivers.A huge leap from San Andreas as far as characterisation and visuals go, and a more memorable story arc than any other major Grand Theft Auto title... although the driving feels very slow at times to be fair, it is a congested city to drive around in and takes a little while to get used to.
