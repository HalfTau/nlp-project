Objectively this is a really bad port of GTA IV. With GTA V being absolutely incredible unless you have asystem on the pc, there isnt much purpose in getting this game for pc unless its for mods. Mods really do make the experience in GTA IV much better and more fun on the pc, but if you are scared to get mods and already have an xbox 360 or ps3, you probably should just get it on either of those platforms. Subjectively, this game is a lot of fun, even though it runs like crap and has a lot of errors. From what Ive played, Ive had a lot of fun with this game, especially since you can import your own music and save replays. In conclusion, only buy if youre morbidly curious on how not to do a pc port.
