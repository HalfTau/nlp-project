I have found a way to downgrade the version of GTA to 1.0.7.0, thus, being able to install mods, this vastly improves my overall experience with this game, and I enjoy it more with mods!There is a community guide available to tell you how you can downgrade your version of GTAMy original review is below.Social Club, and GFWL work pretty much flawlessly for me, I didnt run into any problems, I would play this much more if I could get mods working!If you cant run GTA 5, and you can get social club and GFWL working pretty much instantly, and also have mods installed, then this game is the next best option, in my opinion!
