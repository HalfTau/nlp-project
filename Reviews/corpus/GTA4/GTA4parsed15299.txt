I think Im far enough in to write an informed review.Everyone knows its kind of a bad port. Its optimized badly, uses GFWL, and from what I hear some of the graphics settings are labeled in a misleading way for example, midhigh on the night shadows bar loads 4k shadow textures or something. Im currently running it on an asus g60j, which runs most games on high settings with no issues I am also running ICEnhancer, which probably contributes to the problems somewhat, but most of the time it gets just below 30 fps. Generally lowering the distance sliders helps, but I dont think I can get it much better than this. Also, default lack of AA is pretty ugly.This game does better than a lot of ports in certain regards, though. For example BUTTON PROMPTS. HOLY IT SHOWS WHATS ACTUALLY BOUND ON YOUR KEYBOARD INSTEAD OF ASSUMING A CONTROLLER. That legit makes the game so much more playable for me.As far as the actual game goes, its a pretty good open world experience. Theres a couple flaws in the mechanics that bother me, but the game holds up where it counts. Not a bad story either, though not a particularly great one IMO.Overall I do recommend this game. If you have a good enough rig and know which settings to tweak, you can get this game to look and run pretty good, and like I said, its a pretty good open world experience.Plus, the mods for this game.
