Never have I ever gone through so much crap just to play one ing game. A friend and I bought steam cards on the same day to purchase this crap. Allow me to tell you why you shouldnt buy the ing game. I had to immeditetly make an account with rockstarThe game wont load on either online or offline when you buy it In order to make thiswork you need to download a patch and go through the trouble of going into steam files and installing the files after you download 7zip or winrarIf you do manage to make the game work, only offline mode will properly launch Connectivity issues to rockstars multiplayer networkWhen I did load up the game the initial loading screen stood like that for over and hour before I decided to close ittrouble connecting to the xbox live account that you must haveHowever... Despite all the trash I had to go through, the end result was glorious. Maybe others wont have to go through what i did. I spent over 8 hours attempting the fix all issues before i found and worked out the solutions. Even though the game doesnt appear as me playing it on steam, i can still do multiplayer and single player fine. Im glad I was able to solve each problem. After you get past the issues of the game you are thrown into and immersive open world game where you can do what you want when you want gta style. 11/10 though i wouldnt go through all this again...
