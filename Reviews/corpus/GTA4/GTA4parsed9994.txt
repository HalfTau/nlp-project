I totally recommend this game, however the GFWL is really irritating. It is normally easy but my live account wouldnt work so I had to make a totally new one. But once that is over and done with you need to go to the games files and make a file called commandline.txt without the quotes. Open it and type nomemrestrictions norestrictions also without the quotes. Then go to the launch parameters by right clicking the game in your library and selecting properties. Then type in the same thing for the command line file you made earlier. After you get everything sorted out with GFWL when the game starts, set your graphics accordingly. It may say that your computer cant handle the settings you have, but just use trial and error with the graphics. Once youve done all that, youre good to go! Play to your hearts content. Or mod to your hearts content. Whichever you like best.
