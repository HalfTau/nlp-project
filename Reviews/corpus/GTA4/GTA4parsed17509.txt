THE SINGLE PLAYER IS OK BECAUSE SO FAR THE BEST MISSION IS THE 3 LEAF CLOVER  I THINK THATS WHAT ITS CALLED  AND MOST OTHER MISSIONS YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE JUST DOING CHORES FOR PEOPLE. I ENJOYED THE GAME GAME IS VERY FUN WITH FIRSTPERSON MOD. THE FREEROAM IS FUN BUT STORY IS BORING. WINDOWS LIVE IS ANOYING AND NEVER WORKED FOR ME. SO THE GAME JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER GAME HAS ITS PROS AND CONS BUT OVER ALL IS A FUN GAME FOR PC PLAYERS TO ENJOY WHILE WAITING FOR GRAND THEFT AUTO 5 TO COME OUT ON PC
