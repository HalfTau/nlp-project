Pros  Classic GTA gameplay,what could you ask for more ? Really nicely written storyline Amazing graphics for the game from its year of release A lot of side missions worth playing A lot of cool mods from the community Tutorials available on Youtube to run the game on Windows 8 and up. Legal cheats on single player mode even though it locks certain achievementsCons  Poorly optimized for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.Spent 2 hours trying to resolve seeminglyendless errors I get when I launched the game on Windows 8.1 Pro Has framerate drop issue that you need to repair manually,no patch has ever been given to fix this Dead multiplayer Requires you to have windows live account to fix the launcher error Social Club server error has become a weekly,or even daily routine Random crashes frequently happens not only at Windows 8 and up usersAfter I went through the errors,I enjoyed my time playing this game again,though.I only bought it for collection.Its better to wait for GTA V PC release.This game has been abandoned.
