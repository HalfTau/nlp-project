I got this game as a future investment to mod when I get a better PC. I make mods and play with mods, its how I like my open world games. So why would you think its a good idea to kill OpenIV and set a precedent that mods are somehow a bad thing, especially in a game thats nearly 10 years old. Get yourtogether take two!
