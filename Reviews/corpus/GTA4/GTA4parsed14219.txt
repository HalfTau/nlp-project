Do not buy this game it does not work periode.I REPEAT DO NOT BUY IT DOES NOT WORK, HONEST IT DOESNT READ ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS NO ONE CAN GET IT TOO WORK AND THERE IS NO ONE TO HELP YOU SO TO ALL THE SINGLE MOMS DONT GET IT YOUR WAISTING YOUR MONEY. If I am wrong than I will glady change my comment if anyone out there can tell me what to do to get the to start.
