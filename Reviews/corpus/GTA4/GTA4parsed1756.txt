I can deal with the  verson of socail club. I can deal with the  driving mechanics in this game. I can even deal with the ed up cop mechanics in this game. What I cant deal with is the ing long missions. Even in GTA SA, you ed up on a long mission and you can Skip the ride. or even skip to the part you messed up. Not this game... nope. That mission that just took you 15 minutes to do and then get killed last second? Youve got to do it all over from the start. Enjoy wasting another 15 minutes. Another mission makes you get a truck. It takes 5 minutes to get to that truck. It then takes another 15 minutes to get that truck to another location. Afterwards, youre faced with 1015 guys with guns who gun you down. Thats not all though... that Autosave that has been bugging you is completely ing worthless. If your going on a mission rampage and get about 1015 missions from your last save, pray your game doesnt crash like mine did.Ive owned GTA IV since it came out. I have yet to beat it yet because everytime I try to play it, I get sickened by how  it is. The story is good, the cops are annoying, the missions suck Roman keeps asking me to go bowling, the radio stations are not to my liking, and the game annoys the livingout of me. Will I ever beat it? I honestly dont know.
