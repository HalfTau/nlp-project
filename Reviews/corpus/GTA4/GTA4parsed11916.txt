Rockstar social club is stupid, Windows Games Live is stupid... That being said If you have the PC to actually run this poorly optimized port and are a fan of open world games or the GTA series and havent played this, it is a must buy. For a game released in 2008 this still holds up better than anything the competition has to offer as of late Sleeping Dogs, Watchdogs and is a testament to Rockstar as a developer. Im running it fairly dumbed down on medium settings and the game still draws you in. Great story, amazingly detailed open world and laugh out loud crass humor throughout. Not to mention the extra polish and an entertaining variety of side activities this game set a new precident for the open world/sandbox genre. Again, the arbitrary Rockstar social club and Windows Games Live are a pain in the.. this game is definitely worth it. It is definitely one of those I should go to bed, but just ONE more mission type of games. 9/10
