I hate to say no, but there is one feature that ruined the game for me. It runs with GFWL games for windows live. The ONLY problem i have with it to be exact. Why is this a problem? GFWL sucks its the LAST thing that i run Ride to Hell through! that shows how bad it is. Not even Airport Simulator deserves that poor excuse of a game runner. Nevertheless, i downloaded it, got it running, and to my sarcastic suprize! it ran like I have a Beast of a computer mind you. Now, dont get me wrong, its a good game, but i didnt like what it runs with. Just like Driver San Francisco and Ubisofts stupid DRM... grrr
