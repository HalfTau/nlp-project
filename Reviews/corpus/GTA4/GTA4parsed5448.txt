Some people are DUMB. To get rid of the social club error when you first launch the game you need to enter your social club log in then spam the Play Now button a few times when it works itll go into game. After youve finished go to your GTA IV Directory and delete paul.dll boom problem solved.Good game though much better than GTA V. I dont have GTA V for PC but I have it for xbox one and honestly I prefer GTA IV on console as well as PC. Although around christmas time I shall be buying GTA V for PC and hopefully notice differences as on PC your able to mod. GTA IV is still the best in my opinion, defiantly worth the buy.
