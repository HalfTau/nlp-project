This is a great openworld game and lives up to the Grand Theft Auto name although there is a few things that could be better.1. More stuff to do outside main story line and multiplayer In openworld in both singleplayer and multiplayer there isnt much to do, just kill people and evade the cops sure its fun to mess around with friends although new life can be breathed into the game with mods.2. This problem is not a massive one, if you find a nice car or vehicle you can save in front of your house BUT when you go on a mission it gets put back there and who knows how far away you are, the best fix to this is just find a nice car that can be cheated in, get one then spawn one when you need it its not cheating, you can do the same legitly in GTA 5 just GTA 4 doesnt have that featureMost gameplay problems can be fixed by mods which is why most people say this is the best GTA untill GTA 5 PC comes out probably there are many, many mods out there so you can put new features into the game.All in all this is a fantastic game and if your a PC gamer that wants GTA 5 but cant get it yet this is your best bet even if you dont this is a gfreat openworld game.P.S. CAUTION THere is a problem with Social Club that makes it a REAL BIG HASSLE to play online. But it can be fixed check the internet and on the steam community page and theres a fix there as well.
