Game refuses to launch through its own DRM software.  Launches from Steam, goes to its Rockstar DRM program, and then hangs.  No processes start, the DRM process doesnt stop, just nothing.  After many internet searches about missing C packages, incorrect permissions, bad installs, etc, game still refuses to run and theres going to be 0 support for it in the future.Dont buy this game.
