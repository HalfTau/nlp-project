Ive liked the whole gta series, But ive never felt compelled to finish the games. Thus i cant review it based on the story, I do however love to just drive around and start chaos. Its good for single player cheats and wasting time. Ive spent more time playing it on console than PC. I really loathe getting windows live to work/sign in, But what can ya do.
