Heeeeeey ! Niko Bellic , my cousin !Got the game on sale but its worth the full price too, seeing how long it is.Selfinstalled automatically.Had to create a Windows/xbox Live account, which is mildly annoying but not a problem.Great game. Long. Awesome characters.Less geared towards plain outrageous fun than San Andreas and GTA V.Which is a shame but not a deal breaker.
