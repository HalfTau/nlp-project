WatchDogs is a very good sandbox game. GTA IV is a better sandbox game. Rockstar Social Club and GFWL discontinued, I think are a pain in the first place, but the game was well worth it. Played the story through at least three times, enjoyed it every time. Pretty decent length. Drivings great, not too easy, not too difficult, even with mouse and keyboard. Gunplay is definitely not the strong suit of the game, but I still enjoyed the fighting when it occurred. Characters are awesome, each one being a parody of a certain clich.Like many others said, its a hardware hog and wouldnt run well on an OCd Phenom II X3 720 and a GTX560, which could be expected from a 2008 game. Never tried multiplayer, not interested in it so far. Havent even modded it yet.
