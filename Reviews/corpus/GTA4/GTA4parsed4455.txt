GTA series has always been great. Main character was played well. Only problem is  graphics when playing on the computer. Oh, also missions. Some missions will crash your game, my game stopped at Mission 38 Three Leaf Clover when Niko robs a bank with a group of Irish guys. After taking the money, it would load forever and ever. You also cannot play online with an account, you have to play offline for the game to load.....Whenever the game DID work, I somewhat enjoyed it... but to be fair,
