This game is Soooo fun to mod, and its really good on its own, nice story, and really cool multiplayer ideas, I reccomend buying the DLCs for it, and it looks really nice on higher settings. Its pretty fun alone, but I suggest playing with friends, and trying to igrone the s of this community, Rockstar is famous for that though.PS Im still waiting for the PC version of GTA V Rockstar, get on that!
