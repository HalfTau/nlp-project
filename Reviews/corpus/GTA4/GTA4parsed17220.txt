I bought Grand Theft Auto 4 and waited for it to download for almost 4 DAYS, all to find out that I have wasted my money and my time because as soon as I opened it, I created an Social Club account to play it apparently, I needed to otherwise I couldnt play it and I logged in all to find out that I couldnt play it. It said that I entered correct details Email and Password but that window went away and no other window for GTA game up for me to play. HUGE disappointment. Do not get this game if you have a laptop it is a waste of time and WILL NOT WORK! I dont know if Im doing something wrong or it just doesnt work.
