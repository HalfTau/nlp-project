Another piece ofgame on Steam.Like many of the games of Steam that dont work, this is one of them, game crashes 5 min in the game after thousands of tries to make it work. Steam support doesnt help at all and as with every  game that needs 3rd support software, this is another one that does not work. Its because of games like this that piracy is still around, because the pirated GTA 4 actually works, unlike the Steam version. If Steam Support answers me one day and I actually get to play the game, I will update this review.DO NOT BUY, EVER.
