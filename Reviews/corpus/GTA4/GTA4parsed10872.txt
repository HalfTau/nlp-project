Worse than unplayable. A combination of Windows Live and Rockstar Social makes this game not load. Furthermore, it creates a black box over my screen that prevents me from using Task Manager to close it, so I have to do a mandatory system restart. Afterwards, my system is still very slowly after trying to use this. Im sure its a good game, but this port is horribly awful.
