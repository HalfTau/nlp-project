The fact that this game is allowed to be sold on the marketplace is ridiculous, not to mention that rockstar games puts it on sale even though it isnt working for anyone thats using a windows version that isnt from the dark ages.If you dont want to spend 2 hours setting up the game to work once, and than having to keep changing stuff and relaunching, as well as tons of crashes  than dont buy it.Windows doesnt even use GFWL anymore, so you have to go to the microsoft site, download some old version of games for windows live, spend 30 minutes logging into that with its horrible UI and false invalid password prompts.Following that, you have to make a socialclub account also has false invalid password prompts on occasion, log into THAT. Then you launch the game and have to choose to not play the DLC that you dont even own. And finally, you get stuck in the loading screen half the time and have to relaunch! To put into into perspective, I have an hour played on this game and I havent actually gotten to play it once. Simply because that hour was spent trying to launch the game and get it working.
