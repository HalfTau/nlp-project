This is total fcking bullsht.I, like everyone who bought this game, where unable to launch the game after loggin into social club.I iritates me, because steam knows damn well, that everyone has problems oppening the game.But of course, steam is all about money, and they dont have time to fix problems like these.I think the time has finally come. Its time to say goodbye to steam client.
