As a New comer to the GTA Series i cannot recommend this game enough, Best 15 i ever spent , I was expecting to hate it or Dislike it but i was totally wrong. Liberty City is amazing, its a Huge City Sandbox filled with loads to do, My Favourite thing to do was go Bowling with Roman or take Patrick McReary for Comedy shows. The story is absolutely Incredible, i was hooked and those 80 hours of playing the Story and Free Roaming was so worth it, Incredible.Niko is an Awesome Protagonist, he is incredibly badass, funny and his Story was a Tragedy and even after Completing the game im still really upset On just how Bad of a Life he had, he just never got a Break and i was rooting for him the Entire Game to get his Happy Ending and American Dream with his Cousin, The Voice Actor was Amazing as well.As for Characters GTA IV Has a Lot of Hilarious, Interesting, Hateful, Mysterious or just Annoying Manny.. Grr And they were awesome to Socialize with and do Missions for. Roman was Hilarious and I liked him a Lot, Jacob was Hilarious and was Really badass,  was Badass and Freaking Brucie, That annoying voice but Hilarious Quotes and Lines.However this Game for Most people has an Awful PC Port, Your game May not Launch or even Function Properly, i highly Recommend following this GuideIt Worked for me and i have a Windows 10 PC, if that Guide doesnt work try an Online Fix, Sadly until Rockstar fixes GTA IVs Port Probably wont Thats what you got to do.An Amazing Outstanding Experience, GTA IV Is Incredible.
