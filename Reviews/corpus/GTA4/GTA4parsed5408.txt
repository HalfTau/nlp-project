I dont know why people complain about this game being a terrible port Sure, its not as easy as hitting install and then play but its definitely not unplayable. All you have to do is uninstall the GFWL pack that came with the game and download an updated version for it, as for the graphics being terrible all you gotta do is set 2 commands for launch options and that is it. Havent tried the online mode, nor do I intend to, but single player works fine on Windows 10. No crashes, no stutters, no freezes, just pure bliss.If you really cant be bothered to try to get it to work which honestly doesnt even take more than 5 minutes, then go buy an overpriced copy for your console of choice.
