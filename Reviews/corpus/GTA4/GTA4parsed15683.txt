Grand Theft Auto IV returns to Liberty City from its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto III. However, youre fresh off the boat, rather than fresh off the prison.This game is full of memorable characters from big mouth Roman, crooked Vlad, crazy Dimitri, Rat Boccino, or outofthisworld Little Jakob. Everyone has their own stories, and their own purpose.As you would expect, Liberty city is a concrete heaven, but a very lively one at that. Its alive to the point where you could remember what some of the pedestrians might say when you cut them off in traffic or pull out a gun infront of them.The story in GTA IV to me is the best in the series. Ill leave it to you to experience it yourself and have your say.
