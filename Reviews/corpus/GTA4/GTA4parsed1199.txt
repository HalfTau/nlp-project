It was a long time coming for me to finish this game. Ive played it before, the first 23 hours but never went further mostly because my PC was not so good. Now I have a proper gaming PC so it was time to play it through. And it was really fun. Its a GTA game after all and they are all fun.I can only compare this game to the previous titles and the evolution is obvious gameplay, graphics, game mechanics etc. but not just technically. The story telling is also much better than before multiple endings, moral choices etc. but its up to debate that the story itself is actually better than what we have seen in the earlier titles. Well I havent played GTA5 yet so I can only compare GTA4 to the older titles. And I think San Andreas was better. The story and the characters too. GTA4 is not bad either but a bit too generic maffia story. I enjoyed it anyways.The biggest con of the game is the technical side. It doesnt crash but you have to work around the GFWL service thanks there is an offline mode at least! and the engine itself. What I mean by that in 2017 you cant get stable 60 FPS on maximum graphics. Keep in mind thats an almost 10 years old game. Also at the very end of the game, the very last mission cant be finished if you are playing with unlocked FPS. You either have to limit the FPS to 30 or just set the CPU affinity to 1 core. Otherwise there is a gamebreaking glitch.But all things aside this is a really enjoyable game with an awesome soundtrack didnt mention that yet! Good game, worth playing!
