TLDR Waste of money, protected by Windows LIVE account that you NEED to have, otherwise your progress wont be saved. Controls are unusable, aiming is slow and laggy. The game has annoying glow that you cant turn off and if you are for some reason offline, you are fcked...3.5 hours played, of which 2 hours was just wasted time trying to get the fcking windows LIVE account to work with Social Club account. Windows is slow as sht, Rockstar is slow as sht. It took me multiple tries, and long time until i figured out what else I need to do to have mu LIVE account accepted.Ingame LIVE password field takes only 16 characters, my passwords have 24, the game was repeatedly just saying Some error appeared, figure it out you stupid user. Big fck you from Rockstar and Windows combined. After half hour of trying i finally figured it does not accept the rest of my password.The game by it self could be good, but camera movements are headache, movements of character are worse than in GTA 3, cars are floating too much on the road.Dont buy this game, its not worth the money.I asked for a refund, explaining that most of the hours played was the menu and me trying to make it work so my game progress will be saved. All i got was rigidWe are unable to refund this purchase to your Steam Wallet at this time. Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours our refund policy maximum.So go fck yourself too Steam.
