This is a nostalgic game for me and I used to enjoy it very much. However, this game falls massively on functionality and performance. It was very badly ported to PC to start off, and since Rockstar never repaired the game after Games for Windows Live shut down, the game is rendered unsavable and Multiplayer cannot be accessed even after the fix this is not an issue as Rockstar shut down Multiplayer regardless. Also, if you are a fan of dull, flickering textures then this game is for you. Dont forget the unforgivable lag on highend PC systems.Looking past the appauling amount of technical faults that this game has, I still enjoyed the plot of the game very much, and I think that the variety of things you can do and access is creditable. Just dont expect much content in terms of weapon types, and unlike GTA 5 there are no weapon or car modifications available.To conclude, I think that youre infinitely better off getting this game on console, as you will be able to void the bad performance, glitchy textures and the inability to save without a fix which you can find on the Steam forums thankfully. I was one of the unfortunate that bought this game only months before the GFWL termination.
