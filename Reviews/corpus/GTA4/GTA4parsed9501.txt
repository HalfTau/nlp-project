I have played all the other GTAs but this one is boring as hell, I had even more fun in GTA San Andreas or in Vice City. In short, the game itself is grey dark colors everywhere, vehicles handling is terrible like driving on a soap, also cant modify your car, no buyable properties and most of all there are no flyable airplanes. I have tried two times to finish this game but I couldnt becasuse the story is boring, main character is boring stupid immigrant, most of the side characters are boring and actually the whole LC world is boring. I think that even GTA3 has more interesting world than GTA4. Oh and did I mentioned Windows Live. Only good thing in this game is graphics.
