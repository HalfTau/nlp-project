This games GFWL is not too much of an issue If it crashes try to download GFWL manually and reinstall it, worked for me but the optimisation is quite bad, the modding scene and generic gameplay however need to be experienced and give GTA a much more mature tone if you can look away from the Internet cafe called tw either way good game. Youll be shouting at Romans bowling requests within minutes of gameplay.
