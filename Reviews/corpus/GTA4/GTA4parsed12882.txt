I am a latecomer to the GTA series, with this being my first real timetaking play of any of the games.I love the open world, and freedom you have. the ability to see a vehicle you like, just shoot the driver, and its yours... after dealing with the police.I would say it takes getting used to if you dont know already.I am not a fan of the way you move as a character, but get in a car or on a bike and I forget about it.
