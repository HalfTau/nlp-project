A story about an immigrant from Serbia coming to the U.S.Just like in other GTA games, you get the same deal killing, robbing, heists etc. The story itself is an amazing novel indeed, however the game is not perfect, as there are other aspects of it.The GameplayShooting and driving cars will be the main thing obviously youll be doing in this game, and they are quite smooth such as the cover system and the hitboxes are great. However the same cannot be said about driving, its not the worst but couldve done better.The GraphicsDefinitely some top notch graphics for its time, a shame that the game has portability problems with PCs, but theyre endurable.The Customization and MultiplayerNow this is where GTA IV let me down. There are no jets, no tuning for cars. There are a fair share of costumes, but thats the main part. In Multiplayer youre very limited as to how to you look, and thats kind of a shame. Now since GTA IV is using GFWL its obviously not the best multiplayer as it could be. Lets hope in the future it will be removedThe verdict9/10 would go bowling again
