Even tough this game solo campaign is pretty fun, multiplayer is even more fun. And the main problem of this game is that the social club, the thing that you need to play MP, isn,t even working. Furthermore, you have to register on Games for Windows Live to play the solo campagin, and its just so damn cancerous.I cant recommend this game if I cant even play with my friends.
