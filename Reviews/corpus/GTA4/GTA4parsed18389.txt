Heyyo, a game massive in scale that does everything right.. minus maybe Games for Windows Live.... but the game is tons of fun. Most games with this big of a scale usually fall flat on their faces Jurassic Park Tresspasser, Ride to Hell Retribution but in GTA IV? Everything you do is fun. Rockstar definitely perfect Open World Sandbox games... this is just one of the many titles of theirs that serves as proof.
