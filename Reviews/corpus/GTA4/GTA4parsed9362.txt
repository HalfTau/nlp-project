Im suprised Im having to leave a negative review for a GTA game, its a good game overall, but its a really badly optimized port, even on minimum it drops below 30fps, and I can run GTA V maxed out at over 60fps on my i5 3570k, 8GB ram, and a GTX 1070. Even when maxed out it still looks terrible.Yeah there are tips and tricks you can do to get it running a little better, but you shouldnt have to, it should be optimized right out the box.Suprisingly, Id recommend playing this on console rather than PC.
