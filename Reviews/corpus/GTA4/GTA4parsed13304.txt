What a waste of time. This game needs 3 separate accounts in order to play and save game files. Whatever, I set them up. It took me an hour, because it doesnt actually tell you that they are required so I had to go searching for them. After I got all three set up, the game keeps telling me I need to update one fo the accounts, which I try to do, and the game freezes, and when I try to close it, it freezes my computer.I havent gotten to play a single minute of the game, as even if I try to bypass this process so I wouldnt be able to save, the game still does not load, and freezes.Really its just been a complete waste of my time and money, and I would not recommend it to anyone.
