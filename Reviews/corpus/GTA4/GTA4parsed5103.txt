I own this game on both PS3 and PC and have been playing it for quite a long time. Looking through the reviews its obvious that because of both Social Club and Games for Windows Live this game has been plagued with playability issues. This game does work as of writing this Oct 2016, however Multiplayer no longer works. I wanted to put together a list to try to get the game working for those who are have playability issues...
