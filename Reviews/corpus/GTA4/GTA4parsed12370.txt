love this GAME !  I am not sure what everyone is talking about. This game works great on 8.1. ...Im also not sure what everyone is talking about with live not working game saving worked just fine. I just recently purchased this game after many years of playing on the PS3 console and it still feels the same to me. Graphics are not A1 on this game, but they were never intended to be or so I think. I have a GTX 980 and this game looks just as good as it did when it  first came out. Its fun to go back and play it again on PC. Its not GTA V, but this was one of my favorites from back in the day. Worth the purchase FIVE STARS!
