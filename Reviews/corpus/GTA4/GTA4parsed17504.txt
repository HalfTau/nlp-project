This game has one of the worst cover systems in any game Ive ever played, Everytime I try to get in a cab, I end up hijacking it, and everytime I try to cross the street I get run over.That said, everything else about the game, the open world, the story, the characters, and the pure fun completely make up for its shortcomings.not to mention all the mods.This game is completely worth it, sale or no sale.However, its a good idea to mention that you might have a lot of trouble with the CD key, so heads up.
