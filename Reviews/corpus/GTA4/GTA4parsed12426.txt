Forget what I said about this game. I EVENTUALLY found a way to pry open the game. Find the file that says paul.dll and change it to paul.dll.disabled. Overall, the games not that bad. I could play a few hours and get arrested about 5 more times, stand up and say, This game is actually pretty good considering... and sit back down.After all, still a ing good game.
