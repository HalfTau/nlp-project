I do not recommend this game as the PC Port is ing terrible as well as GTA IV, the game is great and beautiful only when Rockstar ing releases actual patches that fixes the FPS and the PC Port, on that note, I have gotten this new computer with 8.1GB Of Ram and Nvidia Geforce GTX 950M which is decent and the graphics card is Intel HD Graphics 4600, not the best but runs the best. But oh ing hell, gta iv. Nope Rockstar. 20 bucks for a 5 years game? Why not 2 due to your undonegame.
