Cant play the game without an account, terribly optimized for the PC, I really tried to play this game, but after fighting against a tracherous opening bug with multiple workarounds, Ive given up. It was so buggy that, even on the lowest quality settings, I could barely drive around properly.Fans of the series would be better served buying this game on console, unless theyve got a very beefy computer and lots of patience/luck fighting against gamebreaking bugs.
