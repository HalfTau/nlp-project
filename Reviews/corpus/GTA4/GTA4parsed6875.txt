In my opinion, this is GTA with depressing ending, yet the greatest story.Like a visual novel. At some point in the game, you will be given a choice. Your choice affects what will happen next, and some choices will affect the story as well. As the game progresses, you might symphatize with the protagonist.Other than that, the gameplay offers some new mechanics which are absent in GTA 3 era. Finally we can driveby properly without mod/mission. Some more minigames are also nice. Last but not least, I am happy that rockstar still features user track player in this game.Man, this game is so cool.
