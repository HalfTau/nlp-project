Many things from previous games are missing, for example fast foods, vehicle customization or airplanes discutable topic considering the map. On the other side, there are new elements, like cellphones, ingame internet, new minigames, taxi rides or brand new wanted system.After a few delays, this product is released for PC. In this time, HW requirements are quite high. However, even recommended HW cant prevent FPS drops, stuttering and texture problems at low settings. Optimalization is nonexistent.Game gets an update to support new HW. However, some time before, GFWL gets shut down. This update does not remove GFWL from game, players are still forced to make offline accounts. Optimalization still not found, even 2016/2017 HW cant hold the game at stable framerate.R gives us a brand new characters, different from protagonists of the other GTA games. Our character tries to escape from his dark past in Eastern Europe to Liberty City, USA, where his cousin is living The American Dream. Soon he finds out, there is no dream and things get even worse, when his past will catch on him. There are some points, where player can decide between two scenarios, however their effect on outcome of the story is mostly minimal.R is trying to set up a new universe HD universe, where are the cities Liberty City, Los Santos in GTA V and history reformed from 3D universe GTA III, GTA VC, GTA SA. It is also crossovering with stories of DLC Episodes From Liberty City protagonists and some characters appear in later game, so this game works as a good foundation.Despite the problems with optimalization, GFWL and some features e.g. vehicles handling, it is a good game.
