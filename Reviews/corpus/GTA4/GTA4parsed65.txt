Its a pretty good game, after the latest patch I can actually get the game to boot on windows 10 without doing anything extra so theres that. Theres really not much else to say, its a fantastic open world with a great story and Id definitely recommend it. If you do buy this though, make sure you get the complete edition to get both the dlc.
