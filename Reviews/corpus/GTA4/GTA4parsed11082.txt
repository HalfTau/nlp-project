DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!IT IS CURRENTLY BROKEN. YOU CANNOT SAVE YOUR PROGRESS AND THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE IT WORK IS TO YOURSELF AROUND IT ONLY FOR IT TO CRASH.SPENT 6 HOURS TRYING TO FIX THIS ING BROKENThis Piece of competewont even let you lauch the game. Id love to be able to review the game however rockstar has ed up its launcher yet again. Forcing you to log into their  online service and even once logged in it doesnt allow you to launch the game.0/10.You cant even play the game. Dont bother purchasing. The windows live site is down to make a profile and you MUST have a profile to even save your progress. Why? Because  you thats why. You have to sign in onto two seperate services to even play the game offline. Why? Because  you thats why.Refund this ing purchase.
