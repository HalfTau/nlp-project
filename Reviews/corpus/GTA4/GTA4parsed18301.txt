its a great game dont get me wron but i am disapointed that you cant purchase buildings and buisnesses thats what i loved about vice city. and they took it out. the only thing this one has is a decent story and better graphics. dont exspect to much if you r buying this game. its fun but disapointing, once i beat it i dont plan to play it again. i would recomend buying it for ps3 or 360 so you can trade it in or sell it once you beat it.
