Great game! WHEN ITS ACTUALLY WORKING.I constantly have to look up whats wrong with my godamn game and fix it then play for 5 minutes and run into another problem then repeat. The game is COMPLETELY broken now, the resource usage limit is suddenly at 60mb and YES I tried to do the command line thing and that did not help me in any way. I cannot play this game as of right nnow and I am going to reinstall it and hope for the best since hope is all I can do anymore.
