Oh, gta....Lets just say that what everybody Maybe even the 5 star reviews, shockingly said about this game was all true.Upon booting up the game, theres absolutely no sound whatsoever, and neither is there music. Funnily enough, in the Credits, some guy was actually credited for Sound.Anyway, you have only two gameplay options Custom Race and Random Race. Custom Race allows you to select your semitrailer truck and the course you race in. There are only FIVE tracksNo wait! Scratch that! FOUR tracks! One track isnt even playable, as loading it crashes the game! Anyway, all the tracks overstay their welcome, and last around 5 minutes. On top of that, they have absolutely nothing to offer and they do not stand out from each other in any way. Oh yeah, and Random Race automatically selects your truck and track So you may have a 1/5 chance of crashing the game.Now that I think of it...The game is not only extremely bland, but borderline broken. Youre supposed to deliver cargo while being chased by police. The questions are Where are the police? Whats this truck doing here? Why wont the truck move? Wheres my cargo? How come my truck controls so stiffly? Why do I move so freakishly fast in reverse? Why do I stop dead in my tracks when I stop reversing? Why can I go through all the objects as if they have no substance? Why can I drive up and down mountains? WHY IS THIS GAME SO UTTERLY BROKEN? !Overall, as long as you stay away from this game, Youre Winner.
