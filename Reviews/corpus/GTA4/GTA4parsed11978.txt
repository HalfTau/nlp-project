First off, never played the actual game, as much as Id wanted to. Given that, Im clearly not in a position to write an actual, critical review of the gameplay, which is renowned by most as great. Shame, because I was genuinely looking forward to several hours of fun gameplay and a positive review.Ill cut straight to the point.Depending on your setup and operating system, especially if you have a newer Windows 8 computer, this port could quite possibly, be practically UNPLAYABLE. While some report being able, through obscure methods, to run this on their Windows 8 machines, its not common, as the myriad of other negative reviewers here will tell you.This is largely due to Games For Windows Lives closedoff and hard as turd hold on the game. Ive seen a multitude of others, who got somewhat further than me in getting this to work, claim that their save files were not even able to be preserved.I spent upwards of three hours trying to get this to work, and while Im no wizard when it comes to computers, Ive had my fair share of ametur experience with ITstyle work, including a certification class. My efforts were, nonetheless, in vain. A guy shouldnt have to download foreign, esoteric patches from shady websites in an attempt to make the game he already paid 20 for run.This is disgustingly, disappointingly bad service/marketing at its best, people. Dont buy this game until and if GWFLs hold over it is dropped.
