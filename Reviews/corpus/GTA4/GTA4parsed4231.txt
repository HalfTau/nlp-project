I will forever love this game11/10 the childhood memories of this game...EDIT Why are people still hating on this game, if the games not launching try reinstalling it. For windows live I dont see the problem with it to be honest. When you download the game atleast for me it automatically makes you download the games for windows live id assistance or whatever its called and the game will launch. For the people complaining about how they should remove windows live, honestly at this point if they still didnt remove it its probably just not possible for them. And for the people still complaining about how bad the pc port is. The game is a bad pc port, yes, but atleast for me the fps barely drops and when it drops it goes down to probably 30fps but goes right back up.
