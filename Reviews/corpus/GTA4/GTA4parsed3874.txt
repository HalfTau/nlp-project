Aight this may take a while but here are the details. This is one of the best games I have ever played, definetly top 15, amazing story and characters, also BOWLING!!. But if you wonder why it has soo many bad reviews here it is... Windows live, that torm that dosnt exist anymore. This game uses this and it causes soo many problems for trying to play it, hence why people give it bad reviews when its still one of the best games out there. Same with me, I thought I would never get it to work, but after doing stuff with updating windows live or whatevers left That helped, that at least gave me something to work with when trying to launch it. After some time though I hopped on it and it actually worked. Im not really sure what I did but after soo long of searching hundreds of guids to fixing this game it worked. And now playing it I have to say it was all worth it. So I say you should totally get this game. And with enough patience you may get it to work as well . Dont give up, if I got it to work in 2017 you just need to look hard enough and you can play this incredible gta game.
