GTA IV and its 2 major story addons are a great part of the Grand Theft Auto series. Sure, the PC version could have been optimized better, and Games For Windows Live integraation needs to be shut down ASAP, but its still worth playing through at least once.Dont like GFWL? Itll be shut down by the middle of 2014 and this game will likely get complete Steam integration. Achievements, trading cards, cloud saving, the works!
