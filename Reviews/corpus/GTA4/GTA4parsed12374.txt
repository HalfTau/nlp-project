This game can only be played after multiple hours of messing with Games For Windows Live and Rockstar Social Club, two extra programs you have to download just to get into the game, and then, all the settings have to be turned all the way down in order to get a decent, playableish expirience.As for the story, its a really immersive and emotional plot.  No matter what throughout the game, the choices you make determine the fate of the protagonist, Niko Bellic, providing a number of memorable experiences, even with the crappy graphics quality.
