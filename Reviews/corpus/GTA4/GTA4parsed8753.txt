Even though I reccomend this game, Ive got more negative things to say about it than positives.First off, you cant play multiplayer. I have all of the stupid little programs installed, like directx and GFWL, and the social club login glitch is still there.Next, the system requirements are full of I should be able to run this game at 60fps medium settings. SHOULD. I struggle to hold 30 fps on low settings. Makes zero sense to me. The game has a button that reccomends you settings and when I pressed that, it gave me high resolution and high texture quality. Why does it struggle to run the low setttings?Also, youve gotta spend like 20 mins tweaking the settings and prelaunch commands just to be able to change your graphical settings. Funny huh?Oh, and  GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE. I dont even think i can get any steam achievements because they all just go to my xbox account. Would it have REALLY been that difficult to release a patch to remove that rockstar? Because of it I dont even think I can play offline.But I did recommend this game for a reason. Once you bypass all of the t and get the game to work properly, its a masterpiece. So much to explore, a really well put together main quest, its just an amazing game.But lets not forget the modding community. There are no limits to what you can do to this game whatsoever. Its AMAZING! You can be Iron Man, Hulk, Zoidberg, or even Mario. You can do all sorts of things too, like change the map, the graphics, the textures in general, add things like the time machine from back to the future, or even turn the map into ing gta 5.If you wipe all of theoff of it, the amazing game hidden in games for windows live t will show.7/10
