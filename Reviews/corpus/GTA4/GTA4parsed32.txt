The GTA IV series is what made me notice Rockstar, then i realized it was it has been one of the best gaming series I played and it will always be what I consider to be Rockstars best products even with its bugs and what not.Even though i bought this game 3 times, they say 3rd time lucky, and so far, it has been working on steam, So if you are tired of mucking around with CDs, then use steam. it is a good alertanative and actually works...
