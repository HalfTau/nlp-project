Great game. I put a lot of hours into it, poured out my heart into this game, fixed and updated so many things that made me really frustrated about, but it was worth it and i enjoyed the game.Until i updated my PC.GFWL does not even work anymore, the client doesnt work, and Rockstar just doesnt give aanymore. Ive lost 30 HOURS of gameplay and now the resolution and everything went to I couldnt even log in anymore, and microsoft does not care either. MILLIONS OF BUGS, AND AFTER 7 YEARS, NOTHINGs CHANGED.If any of you are planning to buy this game, for the love of god, get the console version. ing piece of Great game though.
