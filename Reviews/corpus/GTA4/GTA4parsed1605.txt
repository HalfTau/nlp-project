This is a really good game, I only wish I could play it.First off, its a hassle to start because you have to sign into a games for windows live account, dont have one? Well the game is gonna force you to make one. After all that the game crashes. Then when you launch the game again nothing loads. In my case, the only way to get past the opening rockstar logos and disclamers was to press the windows key to load the next disclamer. Then you start the game and it crashes. Starting the process all over i go to my graphical settings and change it all to low. Im well capable of running this game So after I change the settings I start the game and i begin the first mission. Suprise the game crashes again! I boot it up again and do the windows key thing AGAIN and i get to the main menu. My mouse doesnt work. The cursor is stuck in the top left. After trying many things I found out that when i go to the desktop and and back i can move the mouse for a split second. So after some attempts i move the move the mouse to the bottom and click start. The game begins to load showing me two characters from the game then a black screen. About 15 more times of trying i give up. It doesnt load. The game doesnt work. Rockstar shouldnt be selling a broken game. In the five hours of trying to just START THE GAME ive tried multiple fixes. None of them work. From updating my mouse drivers, updating steam, restarting my computer, updating GFWL, changing the video memory, windows trouble shooting, READING EVERY THREAD ON STEAM AND MORE, and even forcing the game to run in windows vista, 7, and eight. Nothing works. The game doesnt work.TLDRIts a great game. Dont buy it on steam though because it wont work.If you have a xbox 360 or PS3 buy it for that, not this.
