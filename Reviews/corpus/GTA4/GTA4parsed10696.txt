go buy it on a console. Chances are that it wont work on PC. Im normally fairly tech savvy, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how get the game to let me log in and play. When the game went on sale, 3 friends and I all bought it in hopes of messing around in free roam. Not a single one of us could get the game to work. Both Windows 7 and Windows 8, on 4 different computers. We got windows live and rockstar accounts, got slightly farther using random files from google, but still nothing. All 4 of us spent good money on a broken game. The rockstar and steam forums for GTA 4 are full of posts just like mine, and neither valve nor rockstar have done anything. Even though I want to play GTA 5, I will not be buying it because of this experience.
