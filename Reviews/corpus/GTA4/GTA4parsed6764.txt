I used to play this nonstop back when it came out on PS3. The story is more mature than previous titles. The graphics looks amazing and the city feels full off lives and things to explore.I was a big fan of the added multiplayer but looking back at it now it probably lacked a lot of features but so did the main game which I never understood. Why wasnt there any airplanes or more stores to visit like the previous games.Well... those are minor complaints compared to how great the game is if you have a powerful enough PC to run it and the patience to endure Windows Live.10/10
