ConsI was kinda disappointed. I dont really get why Niko needs so much money in the game? You cant buy nothing but weapons, clothes and other misclike burgers or something. I really liked the mechanic in Vice city where you can invest money to buy hotels, businesses or more safehouses. The funny thing is that Niko always complains that he doesnt have money and he wont do a task if he doesnt get paid, but he doesnt even need that money to begin with.Anyway, maybe a game wants to show us that you cant buy happiness, can you?The controls are realistic but really annoying.I dont know if my PC is too weak, but this game was laggy for me, so I will say that it is not very well optimized.Compared to SAMP this games multiplayer isShitProsThe story is rich, I really enjoyed the humor in it and it is kinda immersive. And I really liked the radio talkshows, really funny stuff.And still, even though there are so many cons in this game I still enjoyed it, because it is immersive.P.S. Lil Jacob is awesome.P.S. And Roman, he is ummm. Like everyone else.
