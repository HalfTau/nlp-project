Previous entries in the GTA series made me give up, either from frustration or boredom. IV was worth completing to the end. No bicycles in this for some reason, and motorcycles are seemingly way less common.Didnt enjoy the soundtrack as much as previous GTA games. I wish there was a mode where you could just explore without someone needing you to go play a boring minigame every 20 mins.
