While Grand Theft Auto IV offers a nice story and some memorable characters, its still far from being a good game in terms of gameplay and its full of technical issues. It feels like a downgrade to me.The goodThe story is long and brilliant, I must sayMemorable charactersGood graphics for a 2008 game, as it still holds up todayThe neutral/ The city itself feels dark and grittyThe badNot able to tune carsCrappy portAnnoying cousinNo planesSmall mapLittle to no interaction with other people/not as many activitiesSome things were scrapped from the original game and added in EFLCparachute and some gunsMultiplayer is boring as hellPersonal score 6.5/10A good game destroyed by a bad port and fun things scrapped/not added at all in the game.
