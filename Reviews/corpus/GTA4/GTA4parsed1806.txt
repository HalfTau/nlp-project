lets play Pros  Cons for this review.ProsFun open world gameplay.Interesting storyline.ConsExtremely buggy Cars spawn halfway into the ground sometimes, AI bumps into things alot like doors and stairs making me have to push the AI around alot, cutscenes sometimes zoom in randomly and sometimes just freeze requiring a restart to fix, street textures can appear as just big grey squares for a split second occasionally.Poor optimization the framerate can drop into the 40s even at 1080p max settings on a GTX1080TI.Strange deadzone with the mouse making tiny mouse movements impossible.Way too much acceleration on the snipers when zoomed in.Terrible car handling driving feels like its on ice all the time especially compared to previous gta games.Lack of content when compared to previous games in the series.Handbrake cam spins out of control when you are using a controller for driving with the handbrake camera setting turned on.Multiplayer isnt that great when compared to GTA 5 and is probably dead by now idk, havent checkedin a whileOverall, I had fun with this game but i only recomend it if youre a gta singleplayer fan who can manage with a few broken PC ports of video games from time to time which I am, hence why im giving this game a thumbs up even through there are more cons than pros.Oh, and im not including the mod ban controversy into the score because I think theres enough protest out there to prove the point that what Rockstar/Take Two did was obviously dumb and greedy.
