This is an absolutely fantastic game that still holds up today, even though the port sucks The main thing I see in the negative reviews is that the game is unplayable because of GFWL.Well, you CAN play it with that. However, if you dont want to which I wouldnt blame you if you dont, you just have to download  and then you dont have to play with GFWL anymore. Hope this helped someone!
