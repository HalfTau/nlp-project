This game was a great time back in 2008. The PC Port was absolutely horrid however, but the mods make up for it. If you can work a little to get your game to even run correctly, then you will be rewarded with a unique and exciting experience. Overall, if you want a great openworld game, look no further. But dont expect it to stand up to titles that are more recent.
