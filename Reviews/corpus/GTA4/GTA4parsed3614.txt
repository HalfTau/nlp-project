This is a hard one for me to do. Dont take this the WRONG way. GTA 4 is a GOOD game. but it is 50/50 bet if the game will run for you. But GFWL Games For Windows Live may mess you over and NOT allow you to play it. So overall the game isnt worth getting as fixing the issue can be pretty tiring and annoying to do AS of now.Note to Rockstar Yo get working on REMOVING GFWL from GTA and youll make the gaming community happy.
