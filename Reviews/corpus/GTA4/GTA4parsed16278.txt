I Greatly recommend to not buy this game for all us Windows 8 users the time it took for me to try and get it to work with all the bs downloading of the xlived.dll. files and the configuring for other stupid unessasary crap to jsut get a once was fun game to even load not to mention I dont even know if my system meets the requirements of the games standard. But if u own anything else besides the huge Sht load of people using Windows feel free to downoad and play and for us windows people well download at your own risk.
