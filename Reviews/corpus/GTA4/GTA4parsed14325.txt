I really love the whole GTA saga apart from the first and second because they are all brilliantlyamazing open world games with many things to do, places to explore, things to see and planes, cars, planes and boats to comander and steal. GTA 4 may not be my favourite but its not my least. Myself coming from PS3 to PC / Computer its fascinating to see the picture quality difference on every game ive played so far and the pc version of every game is 100 better than the console version with added cut scenes, missions, mods and characters to nnearly every game pis the step fard if your a passionate gamer.
