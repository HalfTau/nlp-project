THIS GAME IS BROKEN... PERIOD... not only do you have to make 3 different accounts through 3 different services, AND edit some registry file just to make the game start, but until they fix the WINDOWS LIVE service where it will actually log in, you cant save your game or get acheevs... DO NOT buy this game as it does not work and they WILL NOT refund you your money once you activate the cd key which you have to do at the end of the actual install... I loved this game on my PS3 but how they ported it to PC was executed so horribly that everyone who works at the EOCKSTAR SOCIAL CLUB and WINDOWS LIVE should be drinking some magical red kool aid.... 0/10 DONT BUY!
