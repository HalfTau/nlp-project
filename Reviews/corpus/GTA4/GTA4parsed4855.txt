I do think this is a sometimes underappreciated game in the Grand Theft Auto series. It doesnt quite feel like it should be called a GTA game. The character feels more human. The story is a lot more depressing and cold than that of San Andreas or GTA 5, with the outofstory mayhem feeling far out of place and not being in touch with Niko Bellic as a character. It showed however, that Rockstar could write and make a more realistic world. Of cours, this isnt what the market wanted.Good points? The story is very strong, as are most of the characters. The radio stations are amazing as always. This was the game where Rockstar really started to make their cities feel like people lived in them. It has a more realistic level of mayhem when compared to some of the earlier games, as the National Guard doesnt come after you at max stars. As for the ending of the game, I gave GTA IV a nomination for Im not crying, theres something in my eye solely because of that.Why would you play this game? For the story, and probably little else. Youll get far less enjoyment from causing mayhem in this edition. If you want to fly around with a jetpack and blow stuff up, play San Andreas. If you want glamour, while also blowing stuff up, play Vice City. Anything else, play GTA V.As a side note, I do tend to agree with a few of the reviews Ive seen. Buy this game on a console if you want the stable and easygoing experience. It isnt difficult to get the game running, and the mods available do make it a lot more fun.
