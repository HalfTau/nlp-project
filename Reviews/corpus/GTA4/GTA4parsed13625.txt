I just noticed that I have not yet written a review for GTA IV. A clear oversight!So far, Ive been playing all the games in the franchise except those that have not been released for PC, and while Im missing certain features from GTASA car mods, safe houses with a garage, GTA IV is certainly a very entertaining game with a good replay value. The story is the usual GTA based gangster based clich, but I wouldnt expect anything else Nico Bellics back story is certainly a tad more interesting than Carl Johnsons, and a struggling illegal immigrant certainly makes sense the way its portrayed in the game. What do you have to lose?Speaking of New Y.... pardon me, Liverty City the city is filled with a lot of weird characters, but feels alive enough for my liking you can even get to the GTA version of Liberty Island, even if good ol lady  looks a tad strange here.The game definitely has the appeal of the previous ones, namely that you can just roam around for hours without having to actually play one mission except for when you get hassled by people via text message or phone call. Its a nice way of getting around and getting some missions though. Definitely LOVE the GPS navigation via planned route, whethe or not the game sometimes plans things overly complicated. Its so much easier to get around that way.On release I attempted to play on my Core 2 Duo, but at the time it was unplayable. On my current system I can pretty much have everything on high at a decent resolution and have 5060 fps. Rockstar certainly wont win a medal for optimization and scalability for the PC version given that one of the most recent games, Alien Isolation, can still be played on my system on Ultra settings and I gete the same fps rate. . ..Ultimately, this game is a huge amount of fun, in a big and lively city, with good mission variety, great details and I havent even touched LC Stories. If you like the GTA franchise in general, and have a fairly modern PC, you cant go wrong here.
