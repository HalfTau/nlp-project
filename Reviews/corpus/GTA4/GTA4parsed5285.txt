I have just started the game a few days ago. I had to figure out how to actually get it to work on Windows 10. The typical interface, Social Club, doesnt work in tandem with this game. So I had to activate it through Windows Games. But now that I passed that it plays. I just wanted to warn people. Now that Ive played the game briefly I find the controls pretty good. The graphics pretty good in todays standards. Its a nicely done open world. I will say the traffic is buggy. If you stay in one place to long, long backups occur. But I also found this in some other same gen games like Mafia 2.
