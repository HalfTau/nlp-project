EDIT TO MY OLD POST DOWN BELOWVideo Version of FixHOW TO PLAY IN MAX SETTINGS WITHOUT GRAPHICAL ERRORSI figured out how to play with max settings and have no graphical errors.1. The first thing that you are gonna wanna do is check how much vram you graphics card has if you have atleast 2gigs of vram you should be able to play on max settings if you have anything lower then 2gigs your card is most likely not good enough to play the game in max settings anyway.2. Once you figure out how much vram your card has you want to open up your steam library find grandtheft auto 4 right click it and open up properties this should pull up a tab that has a button that says set launch options click that and type in these commands.nomemrestrict norestrictions availablevidmem what ever you vram amount isMy commands would look like this nomemrestrict norestrictions availablevidmem 8000.0 because my card has 8 gigs of vram IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU PUT THE .0 AFTER THE NUMBER.3. Then click ok and then launch the game and you should be able to turn the graphics ssettings to max without seeing through the map or having any other big graphical errors i have noticed a little texture popping here and there but i think that just might be a gta problem and not a you problem.If this does not work for you use the other fix down below it should work for most peopleOLD FIXIf you are having problems with floating textures or being able to see through the map and want to play on max settings set you graphical settings toResolution  whatever you wantTexture Quaiilty  HighReflection Quaility Very HighShadow Quailty  HighNight Shadows  Very HighTexture Filter  X16View Distance  25Detail Distance  31vehicle Density  100Definition  OnVsync  What Ever you want. This caps your frames to whatever your refresh rate is to get rid of screen tearingHaving Shadow Quaility on very high caused the problem with being able to see through the map and floating textures.Having any value over 25 and 31 for Detail Distance and View Distance will cause rendering issues. Objects will pop in and out in the distance and wont load properly.Im really excited to finally play this game without graphical problems. Hopes this helps someone else with the same problems that i had.
