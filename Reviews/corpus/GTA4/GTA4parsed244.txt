Bought the game a while back, then went through a series of crappy computers that could load the game but not run it. Now I finally have a machine that can handle it, and it wont load. The game opens and gets stuck on a copyright screen, which seems to be a common issue. Ive seen some people point to Windows Live for Gaming. IDK, I just know that the game doesnt work, dont waste your money
