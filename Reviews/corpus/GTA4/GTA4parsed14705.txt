I have mid rage PC, and this game runs like garbage on the lowest possible settings. Ive looked up several solutions to this problem and I havent been able to get over 20 FPS, IF that, even with the settings STILL on low. Ive been told you need a REALLY good CPU at least to run this game effectively, but Im not willing to drop more money on this game alone. It lacks any and all optimization. Unless you have a complete beast of a machine, dont waste your money.
