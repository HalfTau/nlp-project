This game has a lot of problems. It is buggy, crashes occasionaly, has bad performance unrelated to the settings and HW and isnt a particularly good PC port hints for gamepad controls, when you are using the keyboard for example.I also think this is the worst game from the GTA series. The typical GTA humour stayed in the environment but disappeared from the missions and story. Also there is basically nothing else to do except play the missions, where all the previous games of the series offered a slew of awesome activities and customizing options.BUT the city is gorgeous and the gameplay fun.If you are new to the GTA series this is a great stand alone game and I definitely recommend it.If you already played all the GTA games except this one, go for it! It is still worth it.If you like the GTA series but havent played some other gems from the series, go for those first.
