Do not Purchase this game. I have Windows 8 and a perfectly capabe machine and yet i cannot log into Windows live. I have spent hours trying to figure this out. It is shameful that the developers are of no help. Fix this. If it is not fixed soon i reccomend everyone who bought the game as of April 12 2015 should demand a refund.
