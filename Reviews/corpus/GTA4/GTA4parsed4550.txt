What a great game this was. But not anymore. Rockstar released patch 8 to fix certain problems. People playing on Windows 10 can now play without issue, yey! Well guess ing what. Im playing on Windows 10, never had any ing problems, EVER. BUT NOW I DO. Nothing happens anymore after pressing Play. Says Running for a while until it goes away with nothing happening... Im geting really sick of this, Rockstar... Im telling ya. They can make good games. But they handle the games like a ing drunk guy driving a Ferrari RWD on ice... Crashing, crashing, until, unplayable. Thanks!
