The games storyline is just great in general. The car physics are decent. The wide range in characters and personality is one of the best that Ive seen in a very long time. The game gets even funner when you add some mods or change playermodels. You can get a mod menu like nothing. The wide variety of weaponary is also amazing and that includes many vehicles with over 60! I 100 dont regret purchasing this game and I still do go back to it to play the story again or just for memories.
