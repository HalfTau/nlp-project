The game simply doesnt open after you click it. Ive spent two days watching tutorials on how to solve this problem and the furthest I got was the copyright screen. Once I got there, the game froze and the only way to close it was to restart the computer. Nothing helped. Do yourself a favor and buy it on console where it actually works or dont buy it at all. Someone has clearly been lazy.
