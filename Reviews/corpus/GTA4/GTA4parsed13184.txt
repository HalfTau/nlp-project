Probably one of my favorite games of all time.  I love the setting and the story is easily one of the most fun, enthralling adventures I ever had.  The telling of immigrant mafia/gangster lifestyle and the hardships that come from that.  You make little choices during the game that are subtle but actually make a difference which is great.  I also love that there is plenty of content throughout the game and that is actually fun to do.  You can easily get emotionally invested in this game if you are a first time GTA player and thats awesome.  Great city to explore and feels alive which really adds to the experience.  It still has a nice community surrounding it so the multiplayer isnt quite dead yet.  There are also plenty of mods to get so thats great. 9/10
