I bought this game for the purpose of playing multiplayer, thinking it would work better than the disc nonSteam version, but it did not. In addition, I had to go to the Xbox website to download and install a GFWLrelated program in order for the game to not, something which I had the pleasure of figuring out. As has always been the case, I was unable to download my GFWL profile and therefore unable to sign into GFWL, which prevents me from playing multiplayer. If you buy this game, you should know that the multiplayer that is included in the gamebecause. I do not recommend buying the game because I do not believe that it is worth it considering that the multiplayer component that you are paying for does not work.I am currently awaiting a refund.
