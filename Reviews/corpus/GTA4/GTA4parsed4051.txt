I bought this game during the Winter Sale event... thingy. I installed it which it took about 3060 minutes. I got 20 FPS, tho I could still play it it wasnt quite fun. I guess a game like this requires friends to play with.Maybe when I get GTA V and a play station and friends willing to play with me. Not a good game tho. Bad influence. Especially on younger people.
