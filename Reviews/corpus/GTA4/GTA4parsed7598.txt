Its a remarkable game. A musthave in every game collection. But there are several things I personally dont like, most notably the game feels like its set in treacle because in previous gta games you always felt so light and quick and responsive but now theres a weight to every action. Furthermore the handtohand combat sucks balls, the cover system is more of a nuisance than help, most of the cars understeer like hell and if you run the game in lower graphics settings then in poor visibility, people blend into the backround and then youll spend 5 min searching for a guy to shoot at. Story wise the game has had many improvements particularly the abilty to choose between things of major significance, which is nice. I have bought this game 3 times now dont ask why and I think it was worth all that money.
