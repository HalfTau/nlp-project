Cannot play, windows live is required and wont let you log into it. Do not buy this until its fixed. besides that, windows sells it for 6.99 now. So your only saving 2 dollars with this steam sale. Even though its just a waste of money because you the mouse is glitched so you cant use it. STEAM NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THESE GAMES ARE STILL PLAYABLE.
