Gaming experiencePaid 30 bucks.Spent an hour finding and downloading a working version of GFWL.Im 17, GFWL wouldnt let me log in. Spent an hour changing birth date.Logged in. Fascinating experience.Played for another 5 times. All wonderful game, nice plot, nice graphics.GFWL would not let me log in anymore. Cannot save my game.End up downloading a pirated version. Works better than original.10/10 Would NEVER ever buy a game which requires GFWL !!!Give me my multiplayer back!
