Its the same game as on console, being a darker and grittyer side of the Grand Theft Auto series. Driving physics are terrible and the game itelf is not very efficient. Dealing with Xbox LIVE almost makes this game not worth buying if you havent already made an account. But once you get past all the t involved in starting the game in the first place, its fun and incredibly supportive of mods which makes it actually makes it worth paying for.
