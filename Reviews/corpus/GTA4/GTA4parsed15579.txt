For some stupid no good reason this game require 2 more logins to play .... Rockstar Club and Games for Windows Live... Instead of simply using steam... It forces me to update Games for Windows Live and it erased all my saves for everygame that required Games for Windows Live. And it wont log me in Rockstar Club so I cant play multiplayer... I do not Recommend the PC  verison of GTA IV
