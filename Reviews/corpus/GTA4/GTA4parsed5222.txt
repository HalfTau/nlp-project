This is a great game. While there were a few errors at the startup, but the fixes were REALLY easy. There is, however, no multiplayer, but I didnt want that anyway. The story is a solid critique of the American dream. And the controls were just fine, I had no troubles getting a hang of it. I was able to mod it to get the graphics looking better, since they are fairly old. Most importantly, its a lot of fun to play the story and to explore the world of Liberty City. All and all a great game. Dont let the bad reviews deter you.
