A lot of the reviews on here are negative due to the fact you need a Windows Live account in order to play. They feel its pretty stupid, and I agree.Having said that, if you can get past it, this game is amazing. Im about 13 hrs in at this point and it was all in about 2 days. I havent binge played a game like this in a LONG time. I played all the GTA games religiously as a kid, and somehow GTA IV snuck away from me for so long. Theres a cool balance between actually playing the missions, going on dates, hangout out with your friends, and simply doing nothing. The driving is a new experience, and the vehicles seem much more realistic than the older ones. I actually found using my Steam Controller to be impossible because the camera doesnt center on your vehicle. Not too much of a factor, as the mouse  keyboard controls are much easier than the default controls for San Andreas.Theres a real connection between the player and the main character. One example of this is during the Jamaican missions when Little Jacob literally has to translate for Real Badman and Nikkos standing there looking at LJ like WTF?. Its one of the more hilarious interactions in the entire series, IMO.All in all, this is turning out to be another favorite of mine from an amazing series. Funny, creative, exciting, and sometimes almost boring. Its real life simulator with drugs, guns, and easy women. Whats not to love?
