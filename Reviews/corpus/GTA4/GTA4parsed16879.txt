Took me over an hour to get this game to work on Windows 8.1. You need to install some Windows Games Live Marketplace look in the community forums, then create a rockstar social club account, start the game in offline mode online mode and multiplayer doesnt work, create a windows live account and create a windows live xbox account or how its called. Definitely the last game i bought from Rockstar.
