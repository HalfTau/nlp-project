Buyer BEWARE! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU USE ANYTHING BEYOND WINDOWS 7!! !I bought this game on disc Waaaayyyy back when I was still running windows 7, around 2011 I believe. Lo and behold, I could not get the game to run on my machine, despite being above spec on recommended hardware. As I got it on clearance I just wrote it off that and I couldnt return it since the celophane was opened, I simply say  you WalMart. Anyway, I grabbed the game on steam sale I gave up on physical games a bit ago one new computer and a new operating system later. It has been nothing but a headache trying to work with this. Ive seen backwardsDRM before, but THIS, this game took the top prize. Signing in to even play singleplayer, with a website thats never worked since its inception, graphical tearing on a topend machine, and a settings file that simply would not listen when they were changed and applied.To wrap up,  YOU ROCKSTAR! Thank you for never removing your t social club system and making your games impossible to play. If you ever cared about your customer base, which history has shown you dont, recompile and rerelease this game as a story expansion or something to GTA V, I may actually buy that one then.Steam Admins, seriously, remove this freakin game from the marketplace. Its an eyesore and a joke. We are laughing at you for keeping this trash on here.
