Terrible portReason THe game wont start, it will  force close you need . The game cant detect your GPU need to put commandlist to force the settings. Because it cant detect your GPU, the game will have the infinte load screen. Need another overwrite commandlist to ignore the GPU usage.If you cant even start the game when you just bought it and not having it patched proves that Rockstars Games abandon this game.The only reason I recommend this game are the mods that the community made to fix the game.If you want to plug and play, than this game is a no go.
