GTA IV ruined the franchise by making driving boatlike  yeah, no more hollywood stunts, you just drive a boat through the streets. With a trunk full of heroin, chased by FBI and cops, you still have to slow down to 5mph on every crossroad like an idiot, otherwise you wont fit. If I wanted driving like that, Id just drive around my neighbourhood IRL. Total disappointment.
