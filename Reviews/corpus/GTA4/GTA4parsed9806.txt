Hello, you are obviously wanting to review the games for either laughter, or just in general looking at why to buy the game, Id recommend this game on XBOX or Playstation, as on the PC the textures are glitched, but you can fix that, I fixed it.I prefer this game over GTA V because Its good graphics, and you save 30 bucks.Although there are rarely online players, this game is good for singleplayer.Nice Story, I dont really like to do the Story as I just like to run people over and kill cops cIn conclusion, Go ahead buy it! ID RECOMMEND IT! But.. if you arent really good at the files of finding and fixing the glitches, thats okay. Just look up a guide, theres a lot on Steam/Youtube/Google/Ect.BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!
