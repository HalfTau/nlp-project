This is the revolutionary milestone on the GTA series before GTA V was released. GTA IV still is a thriving community because of the amount of modders we have. With computers of today, coupled with ultra realism graphics mods, your in game NYC can never looked more real, with real billboards, station names and even modern vehicles! Not to forget you can mod yourself into an elephant, or simply be Ironman. Albeit all these good stuff only works in free roam and will crash multiplayer duh!.Do note that with new Windows versions and PC builds the GTA IV might not be able to start as it was configured for pre Windows 8. There may be workarounds etc, but they take some time and skills to do.
