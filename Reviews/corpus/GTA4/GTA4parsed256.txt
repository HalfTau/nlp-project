An excellent change of pace from GTAV. While it might not have the same glitzy graphics or vast, impressive game world GTA IV feels like a game that people put a lot of effort into, and one that still offers a lot of fun. Even moderate modern machines can handle the game at this point, and with prices still quite a bit lower than GTA 5, its a great alternative. If you havent yet played GTA, its worth a chance. If you havent played the game in a few years, go back. GTA 4 offers a lot of story and an amazing game world to explore, one that feels alive and realistic.
