Its definitely the worst Grand Theft Auto so far. The only thing I like about it, is the plot. As far as disadvantages are concerned, lets start with friends in the game. Some guy programmed them so that they call you and invite you to do some crap in worst possible moments like just before you want to start a mission. Also you have just one hour to get through to them, otherwise they dont like you that much. Of course sometimes this hour is not enough, but its gamers problem.The next thing to complain about is physics engine, especially when youre driving a car or riding a motorbike. It seems like guys from Rockstar wanted to make driving more realistic than it was in for example San Andreas. I dont know however which engine was more realistic, cause in GTA IV driving is extremely hard. Unrealistically long breaking distance, skidding at low speed, and so on.And finally, the last thing that kills the joy of playing are missions. I dont know what happened to the guys in Rockstar but they certainly lost creativity. 90 of missions is about chasing someone in a car. Among these, 70 is like You chase guys in a car, on your path you approach several obstacles, then the guys get out and run, now you chase them on foot and kill them. Its boring and if you combine it with awful physics engine, the missions are rather torture than entertainment.
