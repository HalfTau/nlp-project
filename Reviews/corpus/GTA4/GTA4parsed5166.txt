Went a month trying to go through support to get games to work. Only one message was about actually trying to help me play the games I purchased, the other 56 were requests to patch gta 5 which I didnt have. Only the newest gets support apparantly and screw all others.Refund if you can. Dont buy. I will never by rockstar anything again for the complete and totalpoor service and treatment
