I cant believe this. I cant ing believe that people expect you to pay for this. All I wanted to do was just relieve moments from when I had a working XBOX 360, but NOOOO... They expect you to sign in an outdated  unwanted software nobody even uses anymore. The graphics look AWFUL as they still render  cellshade Liberty City. The obselete Social Club news drowns you as you browse through the options, but the absolute WORST aspect of the game is Games for Windows LIVE I have to sign in  download pointless crap after pointless crap,  without playing offline I CANT EVEN SAVE OR GO ONLINE?!?! I HAVE A ROCKSTAR ACCOUNT, I HAVE STEAM, I HAVE A ING GTA ONLINE CHARACTER WITH NO PROBLEMS!!! Dont buy this game on the PC, it would be better if you would bought it for another console, like the XBOX 360 or the PS3.... or perhaps wait until it becomes compatible with the Next Generation Consoles...
