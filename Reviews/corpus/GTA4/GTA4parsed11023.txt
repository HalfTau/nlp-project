Had trouble signing in with Social Club, and even more trouble with that crap GFWL. I failed to register three times on their stupid system. Ive gone nowhere so far and this is my first review of a game without actually playing it.I hope Steam comes to its senses and make it a rule not to allow games to associate themselves with GFWL if theyre going to be on Steam. WTH is the point of GFWL if youre already using Steam?1/10, emphatically.
