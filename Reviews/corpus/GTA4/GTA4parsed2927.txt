Ive purchased and loved both GTA IV and GTA V for the modding community, and especially in the case of GTA V considering the terrible state of GTA Online and the lack of singleplayer expansions like The Ballad of Gay Tony for GTA IV. Now, instead of paid singleplayer expansions to the game, we are getting garbage Online content.The extremely expensive features included in free DLC for Online are only meant to sell overpriced Shark Cards to people who dont have the time to grind tens of millions of dollars over the course of several weeks in order to enjoy the new missions, vehicles, weapons, and customizations.The Grand Theft Auto modding scene was the sole reason a person would even think about buying GTA IV on PC because the game wasin terms of optimization, and GTA Vs neglected singleplayer is actually enjoyable lategame with the help of mods however, Take Two has done away with all of that now.I cannot wrap my head around thethat businesses are taking recently, and this isnt even confined to game publishers. Net Neutrality is the same kind of problem take advantage of your loyal consumers in order to make a quick buck but destroy your reputation and brand image in the process.
