a fantastic game, defintely worth a buy, you may even grow attached to the characters, and seek revenge if someone you know in the game dies by your hand or someone elses. Youll enjoy running people over on the pier, and having the cops chase you commiting more crimes them you by slamming into people! Not to mention the graphics, the vehicles, and some of the weapons. My only beef though, is that some of the weapons maybe if not all, are not wielded correctly when fired, but this is can be easily overlooked, the rest of the game is good!Played this on Xbox 360, bought again for PC, your money will not be wasted, especially if you love the GTA genre. 9/10
