I heavily regret having bought this game. Outdated DRM, terrible controls for the PC. Failed to launch without warning, had to do a couple of hacks to get it working. Then, the god forsaken camera dont know how to follow you around when you are driving. Seriously? Am I truly required to manually adjust my camera as I drive, as if driving itself wasnt demanding enough of my attention? Because the slightest tip on the keyboard almost makes your car turn 180 degrees. Nice optimization.Got get Saints Row. At least that games bug is not related to gameplay, unlike this one.
