Worst port Ive seen in a game. Seriously. Windows 7 Ultimate, Can run BF4 on 120 FPS smoothly and I cant run this with no mods.8 Times I have Bluescreened, 3 of them. Not GTAs fault. I had to Defrag my hard drive. I bluescreened. Ive spent 3 hours on trying to get the game to work. What happened? I had to run it on windowed mode. Yet it still happened. Instead of that, My taskbar would dissapear and my computer would automatically restart. No, I dont have any viruses on my computer.After a while I finally got the game to work. Full of popins, more than enough. Constant freezes.So, I thought I would install the reason I wanted to get GTA 4, LCPDFR. Guess what? BLUESCREEN.Wait for GTA 5.
