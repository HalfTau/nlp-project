Brand Theft Audit IV is the worst banking/financial simulator Ive ever played. This travesty, developed by rock music game company Popstar, is a poorly designed auditing simulator with little to offer. Protagonist Nickel Bellcurve, an Uzbekistani economist and professional cabdriver, must travel to Freedom Town to meet with his comicrelief character of a cousin, Roman Currency. There, he must face the demons of his past as he audits his way through innocent family after innocent family on the street. The dialogue is a masterpiece of badness. I do not reccommend this game for those who are new to the financial world.In summary,9/10Killed multiple hookers whilst riding around on a vespa in my underwear, blasting 80s synthpop.
