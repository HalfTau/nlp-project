The game is not bad tho i never played it on Steam... i spent 83 mins trying to get the stupid thing to work and ended up getting it elsewere ... The windows live is just the worst thing ever made on this planet and its messing up everything up. Cant start the game and when it starts u cant save so u play once and u have to restart next time you try to play... If you want this game dont buy it on steam its not worth it...
