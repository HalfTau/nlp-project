Do you think its reasonable for game developers to provide a modicum of support for their games? Do you think its outrageous that this game requires Games for Windows Live to run? Do you think game developers shouldnt just make cash grab content?If you answered yes to any of these questions, Congrats Go find a different game and buy that. Dont support Rockstar, the edgelords of game developers, who hates modders and hates players.
