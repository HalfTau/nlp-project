If you are getting this game for your CPU, I would not recommend it. It has incredible trouble starting up and getting just to the home screen and usually crashes after or before that. Me and a few friends have had the same thing happen. If you can even get it to play you will have a max of 6 fps. I really do not recommend the CPU version of any GTA game. Better to just buy it for your other gaming console or start saving cash for both.
