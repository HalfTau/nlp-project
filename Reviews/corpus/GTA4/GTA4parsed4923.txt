You cant even play the game anymore since their update, even when downgrading to the older update its still near impossible to play. This is ridiculous that I cant even play a game I payed for. My computer has an i7, 8gb ddr3, and a gtx 950m. I can play most games onn high or ultra, and Im unable to get a decent resolution. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I love this game and I played almost 100 hours but since the update they have made this game unable to play. Maybe so you can  buy GTA 5?
