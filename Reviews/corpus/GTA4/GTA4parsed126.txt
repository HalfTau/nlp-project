Ive heard many great things about Grand Theft Auto IV. People have gone far enough to say it even surpasses its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto V. Well, you can argue that, I would too if I could only get the game to run.Most of the negative reviews for the PC version of GTA IV are because people cant get the game to start or play without trouble. Me? I couldnt get past the loading screen when I launched the application.I tried online solutions to no avail. I eventually choose to refund the game.As for you, the reader, I suggest you wait until Rockstar Games hopefully but, unlikely fixes the games compatibility issues and reliance on Games For Windows Live. I am not alone on this issue and people have been asking for a fix for a while, now.I would hate to hear that you spent 20 buying this game just to find out you couldnt start it, and then couldnt get a refund from Steam.Although, I dont recommend it you would probably have better luck pirating the game at this point in time...
