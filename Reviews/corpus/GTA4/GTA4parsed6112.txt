I continue to go back to GTA IV to this day,Its gritty, a little bit depressing, realistic and intense. The storytelling is superb.Nico is a great, interesting, tragic, cold, but also warm inside and a deep character. I could go on forever.V is childs play,IV is an adult game which was a great breakthrough for the whole genre.V just had three characters and zero innovation.
