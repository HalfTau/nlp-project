Total Laziness.Grand Theft Auto IV still forces you to use Games for Windows Live even though Microsoft doesnt even support it anymore. Installing any modifications is a complete nightmare. Just installing a visual upgrade requires downgrading the game and renaming files and folders. If your GPU has more than 2GB of memory you actually have to load it with special commands as another review pointed out. I wouldnt recommend this game unless you have a lot of time on your hands to waste. I guess Rockstar couldnt care less about PC gamers.
