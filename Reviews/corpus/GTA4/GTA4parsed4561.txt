Newest update broke the game. Now, it wont even boot up...EDIT After almost a year, theyve managed to  up this game even more! I cant even downgrade to Version 1.0.7.0 anymore to run certain mods like LCPDFR! And dont even say This is a 9 year old game, why are you complaining? Im complaining because POSTAL 2 has been out for 14 years, and they just added NEWCONTENT last year! Unbelieveable! Ill be avoiding Rockstar Games in the future...
