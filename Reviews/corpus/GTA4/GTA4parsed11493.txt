This game has one of the best storylines I have ever seen. The storyline doesnt have a big impact on the regular gameplay. But instead u have bigger weapons, more entertainment and more places to visit.The mod support on this game is enourmous! There are plenty of mod like Watchdogs IVChanges GTA IV to Watchdogs or LCPD FR which changes your character in the world Criminal  Police Officer.These mods can add lots of more playtime.Since the new update fixed the games for Windows Live bug the game is more accessible. This update has also enhanced performance which is great as now even weaker computers/laptops can play it!Pros Great storyline Good mod support Optimized Many weapons to choose from PC Port is goodCons Multiplayer isnt fun and full of hackers without a clan or friends. Older graphics Not the best optimizationI would recommend this game!8/10
