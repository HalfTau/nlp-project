There seem to be a lot of people claiming this game doesnt work on windows 10 etc. While I cant speak for them I would like to say that this game runs well enough on my circa 2013 windows 10 potato so your mileage  may vary. In addition liveless is not required as gfwl logs in fine and Ive come across few features that dont seem to work. Multiplayer still works although getting games is hard as few people seem to be playing. As for the game itself I think its pretty good although with many people not liking it theres a fair chance you wont either. With that said if you ever thought GTA needed to be a bit more serious this might be the game for you.
