First of all, this game is amazing when it came out, I enjoy playing this game and installing mods for this game, the mod community for this game is amazing. Theyre two things that ruin my game experinence though, 1. I assure you that I have completed this game on PC, Dont let my hours tell you otherwise. When Ive played this game, I played it through Games For Windows Live, which completely ruins the game experience, and I have no hours to show my dedication to this game. My second problem is that you need a rockstar social club account AND a Games For Windows Live account to play online. Which ruins online. I recommend that you get this game for the singleplayer, the story line is completely incredible. DO NOT get this game if you want to play online and have fun like you see the YouTubers do youll be disapointed.
