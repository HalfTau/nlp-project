I literally have not had any technical problems with this game. The game sits at a constant 60 fps, never had a problem with GFWL, not a single crash in my current playtime. Perhaps Im very lucky with games running on my PC.As for the game, its great. It plays alot like San Andreas but with a cover system and an emphasis on realism which does make the physics a bit of a pain at times. Even with GTA 5 out today, this game is still worth playing, although with a majority of peoples luck, you may be better off playing this on a console.Oh and by the way, this game is under the user tag bowling.
