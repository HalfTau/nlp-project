As of 25DEC2014, this game no longer works. For anybody. It requires Games for Windows Live, and that has been shut down. Normally we would file a classaction lawsuit against Steam for still selling things like this which cant possibly work, and they know it but Steam updated the EULA a while back, and you have theoretically signed away your rights to file a class action lawsuit.Unless, of course, you happen to live in the European Union...
