Probably the worst non birds eye GTA to date... in saying that, with the help of mods it can still be pretty fun. For those who want a gta on PC, id wait for GTAV. and if it never comes out... then buy a console and play a real gta on it. Unless you can pick it up for anything south of 5... steer clear of niko and everyones favourite cousin, Roman.
