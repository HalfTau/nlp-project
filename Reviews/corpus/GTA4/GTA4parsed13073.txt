Works great on Xbox, but doesnt work at all on PC. Even with my perfectly capable rig, Rockstars shoddy port work and even shoddier customer service doesnt allow me to play it for no apparent reason whatsoever.Doesnt matter, I guess. They have my money. Game over, man. Lets hope GTA V is functional, whenever that manages to come to PC one of these years.
