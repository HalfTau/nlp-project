GTA IV definitely shows its age next to the polish and scale of GTA V, but is still fun to play. The modding community is huge and always coming up with new ways to wreak havoc on the streets of Liberty City.There are a few issues with this releaseFirst, the PC port of this game was relatively sloppy. The controls arent that great, and there is zero native controller support, which is insane for a game ported from consoles. There are a number of programs on Steam that can fix this I highly recommend grabbing one of these and using a controller rather than the mouse/keyboard.Second, the most recent patch broke modding completely. In order to do anything interesting to your game, youll have to unpatch it. Its not an incredibly difficult process, and you can find simple instructions via Google. If youre playing the vanilla version of GTA IV, to be blunt, youre doing it wrong.All that said, Ive been a huge fan of the series from day one and will continue to support its titles as long as they keep making them. IV is hardly Rockstars magnum opus that honor still goes to Red Dead Redemption and isnt even the best title in the series, but is still an endless bucket of fun.I rate this title seventeen out of twentythree dismembered streetwalker limbs. The ratings system is arbitrary, but that basically means I liked it. I think.
