Great game except for the fact that you cant fly planes, cant ride a bicycle, and you have limited ways of transportation. The story is very good and feels original and responsive to your actions, I enjoyed it so much that I beat the game twice in approx 60 hours.I would recommend it ONLY if you already played Vice City and San Andreas to really appreciate this one.
