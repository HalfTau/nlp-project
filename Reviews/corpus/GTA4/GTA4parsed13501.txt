Amazeing game, the graphics still look acceptabable to this day! Grand Theft Auto 4 had a lot of replay value with its open world! Say goodbye to plane though as the map is not as big as SA, and in comaprason its very small. The mission of killing ALL the pigons in NYC will keep you busy for bit good luck with that! I highly recomend that you complete the game before installing any mods though as you can brake the game. All and all GTA 4 is a good addition to the series and I would give it a 8/10!
