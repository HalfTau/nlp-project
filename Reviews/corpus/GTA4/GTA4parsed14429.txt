GTA is the most legendary open world game in the history of games. The LCPD mod for it makes this game so much more fun. All the mods for this game just keep this game alive, it is still played by millions today. Mostly mods for this game keep it alive, just wait till GTA 5 comes out for PC and Xbone and PS4, that will probably be the most playable game till 2040... I over exagerated just a little there but you get y point.
