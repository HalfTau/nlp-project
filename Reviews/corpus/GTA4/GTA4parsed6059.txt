I never  got a chance to play the game. I am a keyboard and mouse player, recently switched to wirless controller. I find the initial setup in order to play on PC was overkill. Not having Rockstar support to help you thru the process  and the many steps required to play , referring to choice to play online or offline which was not working  was the deciding factor to request a refund. I truly wanted the package deal. I already have GTA3, Vice City and San Andreas on disk, the others would have been a welcomed addition, and getting them as a steam download so as not to worry about worn or lost disk for me is a plus. For this to happen ,was very dissapointing.
