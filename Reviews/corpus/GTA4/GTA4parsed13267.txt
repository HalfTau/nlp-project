Original ReviewWorst PC game ever in terms of optimization. It will not run unless you have a really good computer. An avarage computer will only run it at a maximum of 20fps and an avarage of 1518fps. I do not reccomend. Those of you who are wondering if the steam version is any better than the original DVD version in terms of optimization, it is not, it is actually worse. The same applies to EFLC, and I am not going to bother reviewing it.Updated ReviewIt is now 2017, the game has been updated, and a lot of people have updated their hardware by now. Almost any modern PC with an i5 or better should be able to run it just fine on medium/low settings at the very least. Consoles looked worse than this in my opinion. I play it just fine with an i5 on intergrated graphics.Maybe its just the nostalgia, but I personally enjoyed IV more than V. GTA Vs online and heists are fun, but IVs storyline blows Vs out of the water. I had completely forgot just how much GTA 4s story sucks you in to the point where you feel like you are actually in the game. For a game released in 2008 it really holds up.
