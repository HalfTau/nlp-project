Yeah,Im giving it an up.This game,man,this game...This game has got lots of issues,its hard to even get in the game,thats why I got so many hours,but only like 80 hours were played.A second ago I finished this game,and 100 I mean.I feel so relieved,because its so hard to do it because of the bugs in this.But I still have to recommend this game,I had fun with it,the story feels great,you even get to chose who to kill and who to let to live,and other decissions and the game even have multiple endings,2 in fact,but still,its more than one,and believe me,its a big difference and if you will get to this point,it will hit you emotionally.Get this game,on a sale its only like 5 euro,and for 5 euro,believe me,you will have lots of problems,but you can get over 100 hours out of this game,and thats a lot.Even if its got all this bugs,I enjoyed it and Im going to do some achievements,as much of them as I can,and play some online,Im going to get more than those 80 hours,because the game is fun,but,Im going to do a pro/con list.PROThe game is gorgeous,and Im still amazed by the fact that you can get a chopper,get to the top of the sky and see the whole game at the same time,you can even see,barelly,but still,can see the cars moving on the islands and boats and everything,and it looks so good.The story is well made,even if you may not feel Niko,but you will feel for the other characters and care about them and you will feel bad if you dont show on a meeting or things like that.And if some of them get killed,man,its hard.Carefull on detail,I mean,when its thunder,you can even see the people how they get scared,or when it rains,they have umbrelas,and there are lots of other little things that make it greatIts funny,especially the shows,I found myself laughing like I havent done in a long time,especially the comedy show.The cabaret may scare you a littleThe girls look good,I mean,you can go into a strip club and while youre going for your private dance,you can see hershaking while she is walking,man the developers had a lot of fun doing this part of the game The cars look good,almost every car looks like one you would like to drive,and thats a cool thingThe drunk camera is great,it shakes so good that I feel drunk myself and I feel sick after,its really well madeAnd there are many other things that you will fall in love with this game if you will try it,and I recomand you to do it.CONSThe game has lots of troubles,LOTSYou need a social club account and a Games For Windows Live account before you get to play itThe social club will say that it doesnt recognizes your details most of the time,or somethat he cant connect,you need to wait like 5 minutes with social club on before pressing the play button,but its playableYou will maximum get around 4050 fps out of this game,and you will encounter framedrops like around 1020 fps,and its the game,not the PC,so dont worry,but it sucksYour friends will want to go out a lot,they tried to make it more realistic with this,but not every player wants to go out so much with them,but a little secret,you can say youre going and cancel plans a minute later and they dont get upset anymore Youre welcomeThe motorbikes are rare in this game,and you wont be able to get back up on the bike a lot when you fall,because,if it falls somewhere where it shakes,the game wont pick it up for you,and you will have to search again for one and you need them for the stunt jumps especially,so its bagAnother bad thing,the stealing,you will press the button to steal a car and Niko will start running for the car,but when he is close to it,he will slow down and wait for it to go again and then he starts running again,so the only way to steal a car is by stopping it first,and its really annoyingIf youre doing the most wanted thing with police,if you will be too close to the guy,the game will tell you that it updates his profile and it will block there,making you to restart the whole game,waiting again for the social club and all thatThe bowling and pool are bad,I mean,it feels good,you want to play more,but it moves bad,it happened that the bowling ball will hit Nikos leg and it will go out,or the white ball in pool will fly over the table because of the framedrops that are making you to shoot a little harderNot many clothes to choose from and most of them are looking badNO CUSTOMIZABLE CARS,this is something that I really felt disappointed about,you only have the paint spray thing,but no customizableAnd there are a lot of problems with the game,things that will stop you from reaching 100,or not letting you play and from what Ive heard,you cant play it on Windows10,and a lot,a lot of other things.Yeah,I know,lots of cons,but I guarantee that you will enjoy this game,buggy as it is,its something funny about it,it has something good,and for 5 euro on sale,you can at least try it.
