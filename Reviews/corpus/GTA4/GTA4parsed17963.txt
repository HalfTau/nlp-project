The Grand theft Auto IV edition of the original game and its dlc, episodes from liberty city gives you an amount of content and detail off the charts. Grand theft auto is known for its over the top mayham and this game brings to the table a whole new meaning. Three characters, Three different story lines, all connected. Over 100 missions filled with crazy amounts of guns, vehicles and just about everything a Grand theft auto needs. Truely a step up from San Andreas, I would reccomend this game if youre looking toaround and have fun or play the game to live a story.
