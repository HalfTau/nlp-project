Still uses GFWL   there has been apetition with thousands of supporters. Dirt 3, Bioshock 2 and so forth are all games that used GFWL but have transitioned to Steamworks. The game is still partially controller supported while its also on the Xbox 360 so that doesnt make any sense. Its super annoying having to use the mouse for small things that couldve easily been done with a controller. Do not buy this game as it is obvious Rockstar doesnt care about what gamers think.
