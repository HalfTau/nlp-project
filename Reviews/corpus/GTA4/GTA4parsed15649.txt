Rockstar Games Social Club and Steam do it again.  The game wont even start.  I paid 6.00 for this game is all, and I still feel ripped off.   As usual Steam will not provide support, and even makes you agree to a special waiver before you can download it.  Rockstar games continues to provide zero support for Steam users, and a barely veiled contempt for PC gamers.  Not to mention I had to fire up the launcher over and over again for an hour, just to get 5 minutes logged.  Enough to post you this warning.
