For everyone who wishes to play this gameThis is a unacceptable game, for the PC. Making a windows live account, logging in, making a rockstar account, logging in, install GFWL will break the game. All the patches and fixes I have tried have not worked. This game is an absolute piece of trash. Hoping to play multiplayer with friends, I come across launcher errors. I cant even get to the game. Launcher. Keeps. Freaking. Breaking. I dont know how people play it, and I wasted 20 on this piece of trash. Save your 20 for the xbox or ps3, not PC.
