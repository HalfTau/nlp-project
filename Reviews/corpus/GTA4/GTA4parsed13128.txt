Since i have bought this game 2 days ago i havent even been able to get onto it. first off the key would not work, after a good hour of faffing around i finally was able to proceed onto the next step. creating a socialclub account, since it would not let me on without this. after this, i try to sign in to social club, click play and the window closes, a loading symbol appears and the game fails to launch. been in touch with rockstar games with no reply. I am getting very annoyed now starting to feel like im never going to be able to play it.
