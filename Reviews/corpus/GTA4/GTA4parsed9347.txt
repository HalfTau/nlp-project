well all i can say is that gta iv has intrigued me so much i couldnt almost stop playing it, one thing for sure is that either or either not they have removed the damn windows live tell ya one of the hardest level to pass in gta iv, is a small problem, otherwise from that it stands on my 5 top list, with good graphics, vibe, beautifully oscarexecuted performance story and our favourite cousin Roman Belic that always ask you to play bowling  with him when you have damn army squad of police chasing you down although they are pretty easy compared to gta v, and i would say and agree that gta iv is a 10/10 game masterpiece and in my personal oppinion is the best in the series, and you should definitely get it D
