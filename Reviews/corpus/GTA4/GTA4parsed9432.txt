Playing this game, I cant help but wonder if I ever liked Vice City and San Andreas because of all the 80s and oldschool hiphop references, respectively. I found it extremely difficult to root for Niko, who appeared to me little more than a dim thug. Most of the characters in the game are obnoxious s, and the few that arent are almost instantly killed off, often by the protagonist himself. Perhaps its just that the characters hypocrisy, playing the victim and going on about loyalty and honour while himself doing anything and everything for money, pushed my buttons. I didnt finish the main campaign. Maybe he realises his mistakes and changed his course. Or maybe he got unceremoniously gunned down, as often happens to the unnamed, unfeeling evil goons like him. Man, I hope that happened.That the protagonist of the story is actually the villain wouldnt itself be a dealbreaker  there are lots of good stories like that  if the game was at least fun to play. However, if youre not interested in just causing havoc for its own sake, the game reduces to lots of driving around and occasional gunfights. It didnt take me long before I was taking the cab to everywhere I could, since driving was just so immensely boring. Even if you get cops on your tail  so what? Just lose them. If youre not going out of your way to collect wanted stars, its stupidly easy to do. Combat isnt exactly challenging, either  your biggest enemy is the control scheme. Niko can barely manage to climb over the ledge of the pavement without hurting himself, never mind navigating inside buildings while shooting at people.The game runs very poorly considering how ugly it looks. There are plenty of mods to address both issues, but I found none that wouldnt also create a host of their own. All in all, the game feels like far too much work for far too little reward.
