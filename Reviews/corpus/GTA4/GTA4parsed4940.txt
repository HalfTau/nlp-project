I loved playing this game. I had it shelved in my steam library for a long time before finally deciding to play it again. Much to my dismay, this game has literally become abandonware, probably in lieu of GTA5. Basically This game is the victim of being a single player game that requires you to sign in to a server that no longer exists JUST to be able to save. There are probably other effects from this issue but I wouldnt even play past the first 5 minutes because of not being able to save.
