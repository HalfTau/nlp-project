GTA IV, while perhaps a good game on console, made a horrible transistion to PC. The performance can be very poor and on some rigs the cutscenes around every mission can slow the game to a crawl, making it practically unplayable. Be very dilligent before you pick up the game, or you may be throwing away your money.
