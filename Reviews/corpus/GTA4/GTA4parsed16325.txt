Its a great game, for it to be quite old Six Yearsbut alot of others are still currently playing the game on the consoles  PC Version.I Totally recommend buying this game on Steam! 10/10One last thing, The game plays fine but WITH textures on, I seem to lagAnd WITHOUT them being on, I sort of have smoother gameplay.thats because I NEED a new processor  Graphics card.Obviously my RAM isnt that high either Probably cause of lagging
