I forgot just how bad the physics were in this game. GTA V really took everything to a whole new level and while GTA IV is that old, after playing GTA V for hours, and hours, these game seems prehistoric. Either way, as a fan of all of the GTA games, its still a nostalgic game for me. If only Rockstar would remaster this game... Still I always recommend the GTA series as all of the GTA games are top notch for their times.
