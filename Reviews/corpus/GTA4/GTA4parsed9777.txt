First i had, like everybody else, trouble with windows live to start the game. Took me 20 minutes and I had to create an account The games only good point is that you can roam free and do everything you want, using cheats or not. The missions are boring and repetitive and the story so long you dont care anymore. And what happened with the cars in this game, at first I thought my pc couldnt handle the driving but I saw online that this crap was normal O And maybe the most annoying thing in game was that your friends would call you  asking to do something with them, almost every 10 minutes. Terrible
