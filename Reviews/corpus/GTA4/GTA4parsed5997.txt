Game by itself is good , some parts of the game feel very much like a chore than a game , but it is worth for the storyOn the other hand , the port is terrible , even after 8 years of the game comming out and having the pc that can run most of newer games i cant get more than 30fps on fullHD ,dont even get me started on all that social club t you need to do to actually play the game ....gameplay is so badly ported and the cover mechanism is terrible for pc and it is so clear it was made for console and put no effort for the pc ..... Camera buggs all the time even when i try to controll it , Niko does randomthat make no sense ,  final mission is bugged so you cant complete the game , and motha ing Roman just wants to bowl all dayIf you are like me who recently got into PC gaming and is going around playing some of the famous games , SKIP THIS.
