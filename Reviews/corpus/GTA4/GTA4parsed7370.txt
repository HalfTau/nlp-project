In my opnion the worst GTA game to date.PROSGood visuals not stunning just goodMissions are fun in generalGuns are still gunsQuite cheap when on saleCONSDriving a car is very unstableIt feels like you need to Drive your player instead of actualy moving themCombat with fist is just weirdIn the end its kinda meh for a GTA title but i still would recommend it if its on sale but i woudnt buy it at full price
