Pure and utter garbage, I bought it on sale and it still wasnt worth it. Cant even run properly on a STRIX GTX 960 overclocked to 1560 Mhz and a Core i5 4460QuadCore running at 3Ghz. Also, games for windows live is embedded into the DNA of this crap. Lost respect for Rockstar over the fact that they cant even try and optimize this game because it doesnt make money. What happened to not ing over the customer?
