One of the best GTAs license games.The gap between San Andreas and IV is just incredible, far deeper than between IV and V. solid story map size diversity of atmosphere just awesome new fight gameplay elements realism car crashes especially lifetime driving motorcycle  suicide map size have to use the map every minute or so cause cannot remember every places desert multiplayer character movments leading u crazy sometimes i dont count deaths because of 10steps stairs anymore....Roughly speaking, this game rocks and is the perfect transition between the incredible SA and V.Recommand without doubt
