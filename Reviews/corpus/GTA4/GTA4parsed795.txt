Grand Theft Auto IV is, in many ways, better than GTA V. The game is wonderful, features excellent map design and in depth character. The number one complaint I have is Windows Live. I spent two hours trying to get it to work before using the following solution1. Download2. Drag the .zip file into /Steam/steamapps/common/Grand Theft Auto IV/GTAIV3. Extract the .zip file4. Launch the game from LaunchGTAIV.exe5. Create a shortcut for LaunchGTAIV.exe and place it on your desktopHope this helps those having problems.
