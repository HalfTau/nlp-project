Downloaded the Complete Edition and went to run it, however it doesnt even start up. Created a Social Club and Games for Windows account just like the ReadMe.txt says in the GTA IV folder, yet that doesnt even work. For 30.00 Im not going to waste my time messing around with do this, do that to run this game, it should run without creating 20 different accounts and updating things manually. Overall it was a complete waste of money and my time.TDLR  Game isnt ready to be played upon download, will require you to do hours of research online on how to get your game to work. Would not suggest.
