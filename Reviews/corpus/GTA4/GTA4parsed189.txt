This game, for the past month or so, has made me very angry. The game refuses to start up after the Play now SC pop up and I see a whole lot of fixes that apparently work to fix this but none of them have worked. Once again Rockstar is too focused on other things like their god awful GTA Online to fix blairing issues with the old games that I paid to be able to play. Imthat they decided Steam was also not the only program you needed to have the game as well. I do not care for the MP in this and I do not see why they had to add the terrible Games for Windows Live and SCfor no reason which is what I think the issue I am having is. I am having to sit on hold and live chats just to speak to some idiot who, if they cant fix the problem, will just end up leaving me alone in an endless loop of figuring out if my game will ever be fixed. Do not buy this anytime soon as there are multiple problems many people are facing with startup issues.
