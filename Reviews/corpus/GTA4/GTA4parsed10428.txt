NIKO! S! LETS GO BOWLING!It is beyond me why this game has created so much fame, besides it being a GTA game and having, back then, the brand new graphics engine. I find the story very thin, the graphics very unpretty the whole of Liberty City looks grey and overall the same., the characters completely either over the top ridiculous, or shallow and forgettable.Buy GTA 4 in the complete package with the two STORIES DLCs, then play BALLAD OF GAY TONY, which is in my opinion, the most complete GTA experience and which IS a lot of fun.
