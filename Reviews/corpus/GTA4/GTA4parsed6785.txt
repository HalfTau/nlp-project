Welp, I had a gigantic review that covered most aspects of the game, but its gone now. So, Ill try to sum it up.You should only purchase this game if you understand that it has outdated and very brown graphics, sometimes boring gameplay along with horrendous driving physics, and compatibility issues. If you can get past these things like I could, then, by all means, go ahead and enjoy it. However, if these things sound like a nightmare to you, then you probably will hate it, so dont waste your time.
