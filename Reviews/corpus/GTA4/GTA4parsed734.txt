This game works well on windows 10. i see some comments stating otherwise i have a feeling they just dont know how to run it. take 2 minutes and google search for help if your still stuckGTA Vice city was my number one game of the series until GTAiv hit the scene. this game was a breath of fresh air as in new mechanics darker deeper story a bucket load of new content cars that drive like cars.. well.. they wabble a bit at times but i can easily look past this. YES roman can be annoying but he does not ruin the gameplay for me at all. i love the addes Stories love the art style and appreciate the police. why? because they are reasonable unlike GTA5. The police in this game actually give you a minute to decide on your next step instead of just blasting your a to pieces the minute you look at them wrong. the NPCs are amazing, responsive to your every movement and also better feeling then the NPCs in GTA5 who like to call the police if you look at them wrong, yes, thats a fact they do call the police if you look at them too long. even in 2017 almost 2018 this game stands up. the graphics are great the gameplay is smooth and works on my modern system with little issue but nothing to stop me from enjoying this masterpiece. i recently went back to GTAVC on my moderm systrem and it was a broken mess, so playing this felt even better.ignore then people who say it cannot work on a modern PC or cannot work on windows 10, it 100 can!
