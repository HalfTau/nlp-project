DO NOT GET THIS! This game is horrible for PC! It requires you to log in with your Rockstar Social Club account, Windows Live account AND your xbox account! I had none of those. It says you dont need to sign up for single player? Cool! Except its a flat out lie! So I signed up for Rockstars Social Club since that seemed to be needed.I start playing, the camera does not follow the car, so every turn you make, you have to move your mouse to adjust the view. Worst possible camera Ive ever seen in a game... sigh ok, lets keep going. Do the intro mission and cutscenes. Ok the game is asking me to save... You must be logged in to save, log in now? What? I already signed up... Ok login again I guess. NOPE, WINDOWS FIN LIVE pops up! Log into that to save?! WTF! Okay... raging now, lets do it. I go to sign up, not only do I need to have a windows live account, I HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR AN XBOX ACCOUNT! IVE NEVER OWNED AN XBOX! WTF! So fine, I create my THIRD ACCOUNT to be able to play. Finally, go back into the game, enter the log in for the last account. WINDOWS LIVE NEEDS AN UPDATE! SAVE YOUR GAME AND RESTART!.... uhhh, go into the game. MUST LOG IN BEFORE YOU CAN SAVE! FUUUUUUUUUCK YOU ROCKSTAR!
