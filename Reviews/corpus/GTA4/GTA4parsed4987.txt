Good game, but multiplyaer is unplayable. By that I mean RockStars Social Club and Xboxs Windows Live Games will make sure that any account you create will not login.As far as Im concerned, theres no solution to this...NOTE Im not going to recommend this game for the sole purpose of the inadequate multiplayer functionGTA games are supposed to be fun multiplayer games. Save your money, and hope theyll fix itthey probably wont.
