Imagine slowly walking down a corridor towards a smelly dog, except youre drunk and bleeding to death. When you get to the smelly dog, the game starts lagging for no reason, and by the time the game is back to normal the dog has shot you in the  and is now throwing up on a rug. Thats the pc port of GTA IV in a nutshell. Dont buy this.
