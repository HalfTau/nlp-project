Game does not work at all, first off you cant change the screen resoultion unless you input commands in the properties, then the game freezes after the windows live prompt.It requires so much changes and steps for the game to even work and its just not worth the effort to do so. The game should work right out the boxdownload but instead its an incomplete game for pc that cant even start the damn loading screen.
