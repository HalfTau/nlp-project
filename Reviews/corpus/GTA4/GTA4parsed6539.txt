Its a great game and all. Ever since i was little i wanted to play gta iv. but then my dad sold it to my cousins uncle. Now that i own it, it fails on me. Since my cousin let me play his on the PS3 and it was magic. If your planning to buy this game, think it through. This game is like 8 years old and the game is out of date to the new computers. AlsoWindows 8, 8.1, 10. They havent doneto fix it.Update i fixed it, might get another computer to run the game more faster but still works like a charm, dont just give it a bad rating because it wont load. Just go on a tutorial on youtube and see the problem, i cant help that much so good luck
