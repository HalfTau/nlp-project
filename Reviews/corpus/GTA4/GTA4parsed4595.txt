A well known classic of the GTA gameline.Is it the best game of the series? Not at all, but it will always hold a special place in my heart.It has easily one of the best stories and main character in any game Ive played, not to mention that it has a massive modding history to make things fun.Mods and google will help with any issues you have, so dont worry.Just rememberRoman is always ready to bowl.
