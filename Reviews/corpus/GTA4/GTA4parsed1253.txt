I crashed into a wall so hard it hardlocked my laptop. At first I tried holding down the power button for 30 seconds and it did nothing. Just pressing it to go to sleep mode didnt work either. I had to open the bottom panel and disconnect the battery from my motherboard after unplugging it from the wall in order to quit the game.10/10 best bricking simulator in existence
