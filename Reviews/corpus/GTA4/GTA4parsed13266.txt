Hella good!Not only is the story awesomely intriguing but its takes place in amazing Liberty City. The city is the source of most of the fun in the game, screwing around killnig things, drivng everywhere and having any sort of fun you can think of is a big part of what makes this game amazing. The multiplayer is so much better than i thought especially if you have other friendsto paly with because now all the hilarity that you did before can continue with a friend. Ive got over 100 hours on this game and I dont regret a single one of them.Amazing buy, I feel I owe Rockstar money because of how good this was!
