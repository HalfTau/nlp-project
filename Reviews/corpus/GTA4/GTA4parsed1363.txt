GTA4 is a fantastic game that I highly recommend to almost everyone! If you havent played through this epic campaign yet, buy the game and play it already! Unfortunately, the PC version on Steam is complete garbage that doesnt run for most people. Thankfully it works on my new gaming laptop, but Id recommend playing this on a console. One of the best in the series. Unforgettable campaign, worthwhile DLC.TLDR Play this campaign if you havent already! PC port  not the best. Play on console.
