Everything from the download process and installing seems fine...Then Social Club, not much of a problem, just sign in...And you thought you were done...Nope...Games For Windows Live shows up as your first and worst enemy in this game, not even the villains...Basically the worst form of DRM because you need luck to sign in multiple times and your save files are attached to your account...You cant sign in... theyre gone... forever... until you sign in back... my worst nightmare... maybe yours...Aside from GFWL the game suffers from performance issuesWhich is a shame that GTA 4 is a great game... but marred by a garbage DRM system and poor optimizationThe game is good enough to place my review as Recommended
