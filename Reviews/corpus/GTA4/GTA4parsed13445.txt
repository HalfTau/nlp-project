Another Case of Console ported Software that doesnt even run on one of the most common up to date OS Win 8.1.This business practice is ridiculous and shouldnt be supported.That will be the last game I ever purchased from Rockstar, and I will advise everybody in my social circle to do so too.If you sell a product MAKE ING SURE YOUR CUSTOMERS CAN CONSUME IT at least.I tried for ing 4 hours to make it run, its enough. Im done, Ill hand my money to Publishers who at least care a minimum about theirbr//edit a slight correction concerning the marketshare of win8
