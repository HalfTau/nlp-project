My cousin knowing the manager very well arranged a Friday night here with our better halves. Super clean, polite staff and bowling in a posh environment. From shoes to private table service, we were so impressed and we had the best evening ever. There were a lot of different balls to choose from to fit any hand, plenty of lanes with privacy in curtains in between and the music was definitely fun. Great light bar fare also, albeit pricey but delish. Most definitely worth the price tag, I would never bowl any other way.
