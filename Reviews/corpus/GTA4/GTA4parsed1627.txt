It is ok, the game works if you have a really good computer with alot of memory so i suggest that you have the latest gaming computer or gaming laptop like the CyberPower PC, other than that the game runs fine. There is a bunch of mods like the popular ones LCPDF  Tsunami Simulator Mod. I suggest this game for people who know what there doing and know how to code and know there keys for the keyboard since there is alot of keys you press during the game.Graphics Rating 7 Stars out of 10 StarsGameplay Rating 9 Stars out of 10 Stars
