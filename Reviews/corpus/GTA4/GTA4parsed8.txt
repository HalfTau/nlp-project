DONT BUY THIS GAME, ITS BROKEN!! !It requires synchronizing GTA4 with Games For Windows Live account to be able to save the games progress. GFWL doesnt work anymore, it will not log in... so you wont save it. Also, the game has problem starting up. Most of the time it freazes system at the first loading screen.
