Amazing gameplay, beautiful visuals, and possibly the most powerful plot in any game Ive ever played, period.GTA IV raised the bar for openworld games. The world feels really alive, and not the breathing world of PR talk, Liberty City feels like a real place, even the generic civilians feel like more than a target or street decoration.The characters Nico encounters in his travels are flawlessly written, have their own flaws, dreams and preferences, and their interactions with the protagonist feel tangible, even through the usual GTA stereotypes and humor.The game has a unique personality to it, a deep satyre on modern culture and a slight antiwar message through the main character, who suffered the horrors of war firsthand, which is one of the reasons he arrived to Liberty City.However, all is not flawless with GTA IV It requires a powerful machine to run smoothly I have a midend computer and the game had issues loading the scenery and playing for long stretches of time, and youll need a topoftheline PC if you wish to experiment the modded visuals. Other than that, some missions feel like a chore, especially if you fail them, and time passes by too quickly for my tastes, meaning youll be late for ingame appointments due to how fast the clock runs in Liberty City.I fully recommend this game for anyone who wants an uniquely engaging openworld experience, with smooth gunplay and charismatic characters and atmosphere.
