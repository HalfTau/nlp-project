Dont get this game. I got it to run the first time I played it, but the FPS was so bad. I have newly built pc and it runs other games well on high settings. I have a Ryzen 3 1200, MSI GTX 1060 6gb, and 16gb of ram. This game is so poorly optimized. The game does not even run anymore for some reason. I suggest just pirating the game from someplace that has an actual good port, if that even exist.
