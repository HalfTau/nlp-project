Beating Hookers, shooting Police, smashing Cars and all those glorious ENBs. Whats not to like? Combine some Realism Mods on Multiplayer and youve got yourself a very fun but LONG session ahead of you. Definetly fun if you plan to be throwing your life away on a weekend. Best thing to keep yourself sane until GTA 5 for PC.
