I reinstalled this game the day before OpenIV was taken off the net. Now I can barely run this game. I definitely cannot install most of the best mods for this game, as theyre dependant on OpenIV. Take Two ruins gaming in the pursuit of microtransaction profits. I bet they didnt even realize the mod was for more games than just GTAV. Or just didnt care. If this trend continues, then maybe its time for a boycott on gaming in general. Unplug these PC games, turn off Steam and do something else. Profit outweighs playability now, and that leads to lackluster design, and selfsabatoging decisions, like threatening litigation to the designers of the mod that fuels a significant portion of your PC sales.
