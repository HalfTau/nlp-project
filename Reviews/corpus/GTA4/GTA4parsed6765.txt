cant login to social club.  so i try to play off line and it tells me i need to login to social club.  even though in the beginning it says that you dont have to login  to play the campaign.  so i make a whole new account and it still says login failed try again later.   funny how it says to be polite when writing reviews.  Thats the last thing i wanna hear right now bro.  i just lost my money.  kiss my azz.  i will never buy another game that says you need a bogus azz social club account.
