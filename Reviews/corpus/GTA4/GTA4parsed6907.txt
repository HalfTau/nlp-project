The game itself is really good. Had quite a bit of fun. HOWEVER...ITS AN UNOPTIMIZED PIECE OF CRAP! And it has lots of bugs. It runs at 28 or less! FPS at medium settings on my GTX 750 Ti. AT 1360X768! It feels like my old ATI HD 4350 ran this game better than my 750 Ti.Dont get me started on the bugs. My game wouldnt start, it literally closed after the Social Club part. Eventually I had to install a mod that removed GFWL to actually START the game! Also, I got the dual cursor glitch. Seems that this is caused by Steam Overlay..Anyway, what Im trying to say is, dont buy this game. I literally had a better experience on my PS3 Only PC game I can say that about.. and on my pirated version of the game on my old PC. The optimization is horrendous and it has a lot of bugs. The game itself is great, but thats not enough to justify buying this game.
