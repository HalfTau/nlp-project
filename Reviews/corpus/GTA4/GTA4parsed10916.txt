the only reason i buy games its because i honestly cannot be bothered anymore with cracks and whatnot, but seeing how this still isnt working out of the box like a stupid game should, ill be downloading a game for the first time after a couple of years.people actually managed to pirate GTA V before i started a genuine copy of GTA IV.so cant really tell you much about the gameplay, sorry.
