I put a review earlier on this game, but now Ive reminded myself why did I uninstall it. Rockstar dont give a special support on this game so have fun trying to connect to the Social Club. At the first launch your game will be under lowest settings although you have got a highend PC. Sometimes in the gameplay you may crash. In the SP part the game is good, however modding in GTA is being attacked by Take Two...So, it could be better...Ah, and I need to mention that I didnt use OpenIV much
