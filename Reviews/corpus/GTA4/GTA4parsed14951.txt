The graphics are aging and the gunplay is average, but damn if that pudgy cousin of the main character aint the funniest guy in the game. On top of that, the experience can be made exponentially more funny with mods like invincibility, infinite ammo, and a mod that turns you into a flying, flaming rag doll with infinite mass that can target people and vehicles like a guided missile. Also, carmageddon. Ill leave it at that.
