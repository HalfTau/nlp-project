Well its GTA IV...ProsThe Story is a more Personal Story then GTA 5.The Characters you meet are cool and I enjoyed all of them and how none of them feel out of place they all have a purpose.The game as a whole is more realistic.The Car Damage is on point.The amount of play time you will get out of this game.The Radio Stations are comedy Gold and are so inappropriate in just the right way.You get a FULL FAT PERSONAL RADIO STATION WITH ITS OWN ADS.Proper Controller Support.Oh and the Mods are on another level.Swingset Glitch.ConsThe Port is kinda Rubbish.The game is a less Sandbox game compared to GTA SA.The Customisation is essentially nonexistant.You will get bored of this game a lot quicker then previous GTAs and other then the serious tone and the Radio station commentary I dont really see this game standing the test of time like nearly every other GTA game.The Publisher TAKE TWO is real prick and tried to take down Single Player mods simply because people where not playing online and paying MicroB U L L S H I T in a SINGLE PLAYER FOCUSED FRANCHISE AFTER PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY PAYED MONEY THROUGH A LEGAL TRANSACTION!!If Roman calls me one more time I swear to god im going to Fudkjnjkdd jv.So all in all I would Recommend this game but it is not without fault and proving you look over those Faults you are in for a hell of a fun time with or without Modding.7/10  GreatSirJarko
