I have to say this is one of the worst ports of console game to the PC I have ever seen. The video settings are locked at the lowest possible and the render distant is so close that you will hit cars that appear secounds before you crash. Also the controls for the keyboard and mouse are terrible. I recommend using a 360 controller if you have one and if you dont your pretty much ed, as seeing how you cant make a proper turn with the mouse forwhen going fast. Its really disappointing because I had such high hopes for this game, but they were destroyed by a terrible port to PC.
