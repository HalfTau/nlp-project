This game is terrible.  The only grand theft going on is that I spent money on this game.  GTA IV looks like the old games of yore, IBM XT style.  GTA IV runs in 800x600 with no ability to change to a higher res.  The options are set hard and unchangeable.  Unless you have a computer with a 5.25 floppy drive I would avoid this game.
