I picked this up as part of a package a while back and figured Id give it a shot before trying GTA V also late to the party on that, but no biggie.  DRM is over the top.  I registered through Steam using my game key just to encounter all the GFWL malarkey.  I attempted to make use of the XBox app to run it that way per recommendations online just to get into it and find out that  lo and behold  since my key was used elsewhere I couldnt link it to my XBox acct.  Your welcome, MS  Rockstar, for the free money.  Hope GTA V is worth it!
