What can I say about one of my top 5 most favorite games of all time? Too much! GTA 4 is one of the best games I have ever played. The story is awesome, the characters are well written and super likable. Its a benchmark for Rockstar Games and it can only get better from here on out. GTA 5 has shown that.I 100 recommend this game to everyone especially those who love open world games. Its massive and super fun especially with friends!
