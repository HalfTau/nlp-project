Game is good except huge ending bug for PC gamers who use 30 fps.Last mission is bugged, and fix never come, because spamming space is coded into fps. Can be done on some stoneage PC. Also game dont allow keyboard and mouse macros to go around the bug only direct inputs.How to go around the bug at the last mission just before you land on heli, pause game, open task manager and force gtaIV.exe to use only 1 CPU core. After you manage to enter heli change CPU usage back to all cores.
