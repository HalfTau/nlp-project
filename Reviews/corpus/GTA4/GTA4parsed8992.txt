Dear rockstar, or maybe more to steam..So i purchased the bundling of GTA from GTA 3 to GTA 4 eflc.I wonder why i cant launch the game, only gta3,vice city and san andreas that is working, but not the GTA 4 and GTA  4eflc.I dont know why, but wtf! I download 30gb amount of data, and the 2 biggest game of those bundle cant even launch? its imposible if its hardware problem, coz i can launch WITCHER 3 and GTA V  with highest setting with no problem. wtf, seriouslly, tell me, i know its a cheap price, but come on!
