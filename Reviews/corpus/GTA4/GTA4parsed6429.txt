Dont buy his game unless you want to play it at 800x600 the entire time. You cant change the resolution without it saying the VRAM is near exceeded when it says 202/2048 MB used and I have a 4gb GTX 960 which makes no sense. The worst part about this is Games For Windows Live. OH GOD WHAT A MESS!!!! I tried logging in to my regular Xbox account and it wont let me in. I cant save my game without it saying you need to log in. Half the time Social Club will not let me log in but GTA V does it just fine. So your better off just buying it on Xbox, the PC version of this game is a waste
