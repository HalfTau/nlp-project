i know gta iv in itself is a great game but on pc, ive received 0 support in getting the game to work. everytime i try to play, it says login attempt failed even though ive jumped through every hoop there is to make the account work. this is very frustrating as i just spent 20 dollars on the game and still cannot play it. i hope this is fixed soon or i will have a permanent bad taste in my mouth about rockstar
