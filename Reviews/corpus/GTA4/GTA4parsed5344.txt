So I got this game to run by following a 14 step guide written on one of the top reviews on Steam.I was happy.I played for 22 and I was extremely happy for about 2 days.But then I tried to link my xbox live account up to my social club account so I could play online.And all of my saves got deleted.So I just lost 22 to 23 hours of work and I still cant play online because for some reason I cant get authenticated when I start up the game.Why do I have to go through 40 different sites just to play online to then be told I cant and then delete all my saves.I spent like 1 to 2 hours trying to get back my saves and to at least be able to play online but neither of that happened.So now im dwn like 8 bucks, I have no saves and have to start over and I cant play online.And what does Rockstar do?They give out 1 response to this problem that doesnt even work.Thanks Rockstar.Dumb
