Grand Theft Auto 4 is a highly unoptomised however most computers can run it on low graphics even though it lookes junk that bad but it is still a fun game even so. The map detail is incredible nd you feel like you are living in New York, the AI are smart and realistic and the cars for once are actually heavy in this game. The only negative is that for half the game all you do is just go and kill someone, a group of people, or someone in a car. The only other mission that I have come across is following a helicopter and maybe getting a girlfriend.The phones in this game is pretty cool and also the limited access internet.Overall continuously being told to kill people is fun and entertaining whilst doing it in a realistic New York so for that I would recommend it. Though if you dont mind the age of a game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has much more variety of missions and more of an overall interesting map that you somehow develop an incetive to explore. You dont as much in GTA 4.
