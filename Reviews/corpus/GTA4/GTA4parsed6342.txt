Grand Theft Auto IV is an amazing game... But the Support system around this Package is not. I bought this pack expecting the full deal. Grand Theft Auto IV and Grand Theft Auto IV Episodes of Liberty City But i didnt. I only Recieved GTA IV itself, no DLC package. I got my moneys worth of the game 100. But i would like to know what im paying for. I gave My Money for the package... Prepare for a battle getting this package to work. Ive had this Package for at least one Year and still dont have the full package.I recomend the game. But not the Package.
