GTA 4 is probablly the first GTA where i got tied into the story. I loved the mechanics, the story, the characters, the cars, the weapons, multiplayer, the game was just over all fantastic. The story was beautifully writtten, amazing voice actors. I felt like I was Niko Bellic living in Liberty City with my cousin form the old country Roman. You meet friends, girl friends, some back stabbers, lone sharks, drug dealers, drug users, and a hole mess of characters. My only complaint is you couldnt upgrade your stats like San Andreas, or get hair cuts, or tatoos, or unique clothing. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that you couldnt customize vehicles. That was my favorite part of San Andreas. The Multiplayer was surprisingly successful too. customizable characters was a good touch. several different game modes was a good thing. Theres isnt really a Coop mode, but ther is team mafia work where you get a job and you and your team have to complete it before the other team. Theres also Deathmatch, Races, Free mode, Party mode, and other player created mode like Zombies, Gun game, and Role play my favorite. In Roleplay you get a house/apartment. you can buy a car and earn money in Liberty City by robbing banks, or doing several odd Jobs. Holythat was a long review, but it didnt even touch my happiness ofr GTA 4. Best game ever. And dont get me started on the Episodes..
