GTA IV was my first GTA on Xbox but when I moved over to PC I had nothing but problems from the time I pressed Play. Its a poorly optimised game that needed to be finished before they developed GTA V. Without mods the game is stable almost but very boring to play, with mods it s my game but is fun to play. I have decided to eradicate this game and uninstall it from my pc as everytime I launch it the amount of crashes give me cancer in my brain. I would give this game a 6/10 for the game in general and a 0.0000005/10 for graphics and optimisation. Thanks for the brain cancer yousucking .
