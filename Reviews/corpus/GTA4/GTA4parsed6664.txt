sighGTA 4 is a game where Niko Bellic has moved io Liberty City thanks to his cousin, and gets involved with ruthless loan sharks, dealers, and junkies. The game is perfect on Xbox 360. The controls are smooth, its story is wonderful, and the atmosphere is amazing.And then I tried the PC version.Oh my god. This port is one of the worst ports Ive seen in a while. Resource usage issues, Social Club login failures, GFWL login failures, and much more. The game came out a buggy mess, and still is. But thankfully, R has put out instructions to fix these issues. To cut it short, it worked.The gameplay is just how I wanted it to be, the game runs smoothly, and the feel while playing the Xbox 360 returns. This game is amazing. Despite all its bugs, its a gem.I do recommend this game, but be aware that you will get a heart attack just by trying to get this thing to work.
