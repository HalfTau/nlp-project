this was worse than GTA3. just terrible. game is choppy, and glitchy. very boring and slow. driving is just a nightmare. and whats up with this new gimick theyve come up with? that I MUST get online to save my stupid game? whats up with that? how does that make sense?really dissappointing. DO NOT BUY THIS
