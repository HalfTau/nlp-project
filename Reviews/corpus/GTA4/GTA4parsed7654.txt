After purchasing, I went to launch the game and it made me procceed through an awful activation proccess. After completing the proccess and having the game activated, I decided to play it. When I launched the game, it prompted me to sign in to social club so I did. But... every time I click Play, the game closes itself and there is no possible way to fix it as far as I know.
