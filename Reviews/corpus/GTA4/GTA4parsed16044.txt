Its an amazing game, step up for Rockstar Games after we saw th beauty of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.However, once you complete the game it does get boring, but the PC version has opened up to a wide range of mods.. including switching to the good side and playing as a cop in LCPDFR Liberty City Police Department First Response modification.The wide range of mods is what makes the PC version extremely better than the console releases
