Unlike 90 of the other reviews, this isnt a rant about how xbox live doesnt exist anymore, or how this game doesnt have Steam Workshop support why would it?. I bought this game for 5USD, installed it and I used my Googling skills to my advantage  found , among many other performance enhancing mods  fixes. I was running this on a normal, daytoday laptop, fully moddedI wouldnt go based on these review, not even mine, to choose wether I should buy it or not. Steam reviews have proven time  time again, theyre not serious. This game has been out for ages, the price you could find on some places for keys, or CD copies with a working key is super low, and most likely worth it.
