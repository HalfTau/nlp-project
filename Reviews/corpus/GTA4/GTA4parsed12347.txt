WIsh I would have realized this game had GFWL before i bought it, at least I waited for the steam sale so I only wasted 8 dollars.Who in the right mind wants to log in through 3 seperate online services 2 of which are complete pieces ofthat dont even work to play a 6 year old single player game that is terribly optimized and barely works?
