I personally havent had many issues with the port. The only one was near the ends when i had to spam space and i would do anything. This was solved by opening task amanager and setting the affinity of the game to 1 core.Im giving it its bad review since its one of the worst GTA games.Boring story, characters, map, and enemiesoverall worse than other gta gamesmap is badalso has 2 other DRM.
