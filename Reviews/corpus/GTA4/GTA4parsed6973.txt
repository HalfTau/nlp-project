If you have Windows 10, do not purchase this game!It was a good game, Id even say great when modded.This aside the game simply does not work on windows 10 and Rockstar dont appear to be taking any action to resolve the issue. The thing I find most disgusting is how this is still available on the store without any bold warning about the unplayability on modern gaming PCs with Windows 10.
