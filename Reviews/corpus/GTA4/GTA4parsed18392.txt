DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! THE WAY THAT MICROSOFT FORCES YOU TO PLAY IT, IS JUST HUMILIATING! YOU ARE FORCED TO CREATE LOTS AND LOTS OF EMAIL ACCOUNT AND DO A LOT OF STUFF THAT YOU WONT DO. BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM, THINK TWICE... YOU WILL CRY TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK, AND EVEN IF IS NOT ABOUT THE MONEY, ITS A COMPLETELY PAIN IN THEAND FULL OF T! PS  YOU XBOX LIVE!
