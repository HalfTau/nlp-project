Even if its not the best game of the series propably the worst, its still good enough to fill some lone gaming hours. I would recommend to buy the game whenever its on sale. If only, then get it for the awesome mods. It does require Games for Windows live, so youve been warned.Graphics 7/10Sound 6/10Handling port 6/10Gameplay 8/10 Jobs 7/10 Side Missions 6/19 Story 9/10 Characters 8/10Mods 10/10
