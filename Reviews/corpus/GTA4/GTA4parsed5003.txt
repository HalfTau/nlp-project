Do not buy this game until it gets rereleased without all its appalling DRM and patched to work on a modern hardware.I repeat Do not buy, DRM and technical problems make this game virtually unplayable.Steam Awards update I nominate GTA IV to The Worst DRM Award. It is sad that so many passionate people worked on this game and all this hard work and creativity goes to waste as many gamers cannot even enjoy it due to games horrific DRM. What kind of shortsightedness and greed  is needed to destroy an otherwise good game?
