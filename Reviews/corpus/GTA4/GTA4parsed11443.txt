Where do I begin with this tale of an off the boat Serb coming to America due to the lies of his cousin? Meet Niko Bellic, a man who gets into deep crap every turn of the story. I swear, this has to be my favorite of all Grand Theft Auto titles, with San Andreas and 5 very close behind. I love all the cars in the game, but mainly the Ruiner for some odd reason. The games storyline is so well thought out and I enjoyed it even when playing for the third time. I sadly never played the episodes from Liberty City, but as soon as I can rack up the cash, I will buy it without hesitation. This is a must buy if you want an emotional storyline, or for funny/cool mods to use, since this game is VERY mod friendly.
