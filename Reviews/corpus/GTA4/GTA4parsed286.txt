its a great game,its more realistic than the gta V,have a great story,nice graphics,Vladivostok FMbest radio station,Niko its roman Lets go bowling x3,the two endings of the gamethe both are nice but the revenge ending its canon or that are saying,sorry if i am wrong lads,a really different liberty cityobviously they are not the same liberty city as gta 3 or liberty city stories,a Serbian protagonist running away from his past to live the american dream,the only thing i hate is that thing of Games For Windows Live and many users almost all I can say hate create a account to save and dont start from the beginning losing his progress,anyways i recommend this game because his story is realistic,graphics are really nice,the endings
