The game is really cool, but it has some disadvantages 1 there are no planes and parachutes  only one helicopter2 driving is realistic, but very hard3 missions are a bit monotonic.Anyways, I liked the game. I bought GTA IV  Complete Edition and I thing i didnt waste my money at all.I reccomend you buying this cool game!
