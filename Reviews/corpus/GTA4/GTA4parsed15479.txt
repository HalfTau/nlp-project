This game I was very sceptical of when it first came out, I hated it.But then I bought it for myself and enjoyed the so called Realistic feel to the game.The cars and very slidy, as if they are driving on butter, the story is ok, the graphics are alright but very dank and can get very gray at times, and the radio stations alright. Even with these bad things I still seem to find this weird amount of enjoyment while playing it.If youve played GTA before and enjoyed it, I recommend it, if your sceptical but dont play games like this then I would say avoid it. Though this game goes for dirt cheep like every 3 months so I would pick it up to have a try.
