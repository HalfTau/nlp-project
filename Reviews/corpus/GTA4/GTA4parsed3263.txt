This is a really good game, however, there are 2 things that ruin this game. 1, It has terrible optimization and lags alot even though i have a decent system. 2, it requires games for windows live. Fortunatley, you can use  to get rid of the windows live functionality. overall, except for those two issues, it is a really good game
