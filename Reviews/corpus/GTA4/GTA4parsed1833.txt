Very poor port, I have a strong PC and I had to set  everything to medium 720p just to play smoothly. Aiming gently is nearly impossible it feels like aiming is tied to big rectangles where you can only move your mouse on the edges. And there is one mission the very last one where you have to set the game affinity to only CPU0 at a part of the mission otherwise you cant climb into the chopper thus you fail the mission. This is outrageous.Otherwise the story is great and the slavic feels are strong.
