Cant play the game on my gaming pc with Windows 10,but I can play it on my school laptop with Windows 7.  play because the laptop is not capable running the game as it should run.not the needed specsAnd rockstar clearly abounded this game because they havent changed anything about it.I wish that it was playable on Windows 10 because I know its a good game.I still give this game a thumb up because I know its playable on Windows 7.EditAfter the new update it works for me on my windows 10.So far everything runs good and smooth.The only thing that I have is that it has a 60 fps lock so it wont go over 60 fps, but I guess that there is a way to remove that.So thumbs up to rockstar for fixing this and listining to the community D
