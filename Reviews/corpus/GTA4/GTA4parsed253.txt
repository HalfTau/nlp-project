Maybe the best game that I have ever played next to Red Dead Redemption on the 360. I remember how I borrowed the game from a friend of mine, all those years ago. Played it a lot, finished it a few times. After a while I bought my own copy of the game, and I have finished it again. Then I got it on the 360 and had two 100 walkthroughs on it. Now I got it on Steam, and I have just finished the game again, 100. I still felt entertained with the stunt jumps and pigeon hunt. Car thefts and assassination contracts. Even hanging out with Nikos friends was quite fun. The storyline is still a lot of fun as well. The dialogue, the jokes, its all there. The missions, most of which have more than one way of completion are also fun. Found ways of finishing the missions I did not know before, and thats after how many playthroughs? I stopped counting them. I should mention that this game, for its age 10 Years old this year!!! Should we expect a 10th Anniversary? the game still looks fantastic. Very detailed and believable. The sound of the gun fights is also great, with every shootout feeling like a Michael Mann film. Its not as casual as GTA 5 is and the constantly calling Roman asking to go bowling may be an issue fore some tho.
