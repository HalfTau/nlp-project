Play the 360/PS3 version of this game instead. The game itself is fantastic. However I cant recommend it for the following reasonsFirst off you have to download custom fixes off the internet to get rid of the annoying Games For Windows Live login screen. Otherwise you cant even save the game.Secondly the game runs like absolute garbage even on modern spec PCs for whatever reason. When you big framedrops at times on a PC with a GTX 1080, you know you have a poorly optimized game on your hand. By contrast GTA V runs absolutely fine on maxed settings in 1440P on the same system.
