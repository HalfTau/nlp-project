I think this game should get a 9.5/10! But a 9/10 if you got it on consoleI think its story pretty good, and all the characters had some sort of interesting background or story.I even had more fun playing this in singleplayer, than GTA V.And it DEFFINANTLY is more fun than GTA V, if you get it on PC. Because of the mods you can get.But I have two problems about this game.1. I just dont like Rockstars R.A.G.E Engine in this game, it make every object react to physics pretty funny looking, and also makes RPG rocket slide if it doesnt hit a flat wall.2. I also just dont like how far you have to go into the games story in order to get your first gun. Pistol
