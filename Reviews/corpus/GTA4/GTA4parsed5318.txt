Some people have problems running GTA IV on windows 10.Hear is what I did to get it to work.Go to Steam library games and select GTA IV Right click mouse and select Properties then select Set Launch Options and input thisnomemrestrict norestrictionsThen press ok. When you run the game log in with your Social club and select play ofline. Social Club does not work with GTA IV from what I understand.I downloaded the Live Update from windows and installed it and logged in with Xbox live account and it worked fine. Here is the link.The game played fine after that.I have played it on the Xbox 360 before.Its a fun game and I would recommend it for the.PC only when its on sale just do to the crap you have to do to get it to run.I love Rock Star Games.but you guys should update GTA IV and remove the Social Club and Games for windows Live garbage.Hope this helps someone.
