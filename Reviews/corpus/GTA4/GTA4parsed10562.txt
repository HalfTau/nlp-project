This game is very faulty. Roads do not appear on my screen, buildings are invisible, while my car glitches from visible to invisible. Very hard to get around the map, since everything is invisible. I have to use the map to see where I am going, and this game is absolutely no fun when all you can see is your character and car you are driving in at the moment.
