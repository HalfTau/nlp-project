DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!! I purchased this today and the damn game is giving me a headache! 1st problem it wont sign me in the social club and yes, I make sure and type my email and password correctly so I cant play multiplayer.2nd problem The settings are on the lowest and I cant change them and my PC is the Asus G75 gaming notebook with an intel i7 2.3 Ghz quadcore cpu, 12 GB RAM and an Nvidia 670M. Yeah, its a little bit old but still powerfull! If Max Payne 3, Elder Scrolls Skyrim and Planetside 2 can run on my PC on high settings then this game shouldnt have any problem!
