Do not buy this game. It is poorly optimized and runs horribly on systems much more powerful than its recommended requirements. Its also very unstable and will often crash especially when changing graphical settings. I have reinstalled it three times, and it has given me different problems on each install. On the most recent one, it crashed 2 times, and then hard crashed on its third time, doing possible damage to my machine. I have since uninstalled it and will not go back.
