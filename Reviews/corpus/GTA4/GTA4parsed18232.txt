This game is stupid. The controls are overly touchy when driving to where you cant keep from dinging another car and thus getting the police after you. I played for awhile, deleted it, and when I tried to download it again, the stupid thing wouldnt even load. Any game that requires you to log in through a completely different service just to save is simply not worth the time to download. Paying for this is one of the worst decisions I have ever made.
