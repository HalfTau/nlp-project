so this game looks amazing, and I played the EFLC game to see just how good the game play is, but the problem with this game is the game. me and hundreds of people have all experienced the seculauncher problem. if you buy this game, you will almost certainly run into this. if your like most people, you can fix this incredibly easily. however, if your part of my minority, you wont be able to fix it. I cant play this game at all, nothing I tried worked, so thats why I have to downgrade it. if someone could fix this for me, I will update this review.
