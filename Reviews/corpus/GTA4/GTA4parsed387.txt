For a start, making the decision to put the controller down and start writing this review was a big test of self control. The original plan of starting writing the review Saturday morning, soon became, Sunday morning and shortly thereafter Sunday night. Never before have we played a game thatArrays so hard to put down. ArrayJust one more mission,Array or ArrayOh, letArrays see if I can survive a six star wanted level,Array are some of the justifications youArrayll use to keep playing.Believe us, if we could have gotten away with a review that simply said, ArrayCanArrayt talkArray playing GTA IV,Array we would have. Without a doubt, rest assured this is the best game yet for this generation. The only reason weArrayve resisted giving it full marks is that in the same way GTA IIIArrays template was blown out so much further in Vice City and San Andreas, weArrayre confident the next GTA on this generation will up the ante considerably. WeArrayre not knocking the decision to focus GTA IVArrays energy on making its single city experience as real and exciting as possible, rather than opting for an entire continent and whatever gimmicky vehicles hadnArrayt been done yet submarines and space shuttles are about the only ones that come to mind but that doesnArrayt mean we wonArrayt welcome new additions like countryside and fighter jets in the inevitable sequel, now that Rockstar has succeeded in simulating a city with the same level of groundbreaking new gameplay that it did last generation with GTA III.Thanks to the most believable characters, the best visuals, the most realistic physics and above all, the most fun to be had of any game yet, Grand Theft Auto IV deserves a place in the collections of anyone even vaguely interested in videogames. At a minimum of 30 hours to just finish the story missions, and anywhere up into the hundreds of hours potentially offered by the multiplayer and tracking down every last secret in the game, GTAIV does represent a huge investment of time in todayArrays hyperpaced society, but trust us, itArrays more than worth your investment. Entertainment, of any kind, doesnArrayt get much better than this.
