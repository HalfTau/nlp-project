Terrible. I cannot really say how the game is, since it does not work. It is bad enough, one has to install this terrible windows live game software stuff, but for me it did not even work. So I got the  dll and now GTA IV is so slow is unplayable. Great. I actually wonder why I even buy games, if it is just one big assblast.
