as a blueberry i do like this game in general exept for some glitchy stuff with the constant lag on non top of the line computers. if your computer is really not top of the line you will really hate this lag.i know how lag will go away if u play for a while hell no. this game has so much lag on low computers is that i had to turn all the options for graphics low dont buy this for a bad computer but other wise its a really fun games.
