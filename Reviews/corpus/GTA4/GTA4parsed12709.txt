As everybody has mentioned, the port to PC was horrible. Games for Windows Live is a stupid addition, aside from the Rockstar Social Club. It took several days just to get the game started, with a LOT of help from the internet  and then the frame rate was just terrible. My computer is not highend but it should run the game just fine  nope,  Lagging like crazy and although the storyline is quite interesting, Ill have to shelf this game and write it off as experience.
