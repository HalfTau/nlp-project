Better then GTA V. Good campaign and great story. Game feels fleshed out and physics are great especially for combat. GTA V took a step back from this. No longer does shooting someone in the leg do anything to slow people down in the new one for example. No now all rockstar cares about is fleecing us for more money. Heres hoping they dont ruin the new Red Dead. PLaying this again it still holds up well and still more fun and more immersive then the new one.
