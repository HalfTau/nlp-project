I bought GTA IV to play while I waited for GTA V to come out on PC.  I dont know if it used to be different, but the game is complete and utter garbage now.  Not only is the buggy and unreliable Windows Live NECESSARY to functionally play the game, but once you actually get into the game its so poorly optimized that its not even enjoyable.  I have a midrange computer and my framerate was so awful that I had to stop for fear of getting nauseous.  I regret giving any money to this disgustingly broken game.  I want my money back, Rockstar, but somehow I think the hassle of getting a refund is worth more than I paid for the game.  absolutely unacceptable.
