This games port is kinda crappy to say the least. But the mods keep it nostalgic. There are issues with Windows Live, secuRom, and Rockstar Social Club. But once you get all the issues figured out its a really solid game. Game is a little demanding for being almost 8 years old, but its a blast. You should definetly pick this up in the bundle for 9.99 when the winter sale comes around. Also dont forget. The bundle has Vice City, and San Andreas. Well worth the money. If youre having issues put this in on the custom launch options. norestrictions nomemrestrict availablevidmem 2048.0
