Let me know if you would like to know how to install this game if you dont manage to, and I will help you out!I think the game is great, I use Icenhancer 3.0 with it and my own handling modI really enjoy the story, and multiplayer races/freeroam/freeroamcops.9/10, because every game has a few little flaws.Make sure you got a decent CPU  like a gtx 660 8GB RAM and you will be fine.
