disappointing error regarding the activation code, such a shame, I asked for refund.Ok, so I eventually did buy the game alone, which solved the wrong activation key issue, but!... everyone already wrote how poorly optimized this game is, and that is a FACT. Rockstar should really sit down and make this gem shine, for my GTA V is working 50 times smoother than GTA IV on much more detailed graphics.Still bad, still needs fix to play on a PC.
