The game works fine for me personally, I really think a lot of people are just giving up and not understanding the problem. After you install the base game it ask you to install Windows Live, after wards most people install the Episodes form liberty city which another prompt asking to install Windows Live will show, if you read for a second or two it is actually saying you are removing it since the Wizard detects it in your PC. So if you make sure to close that window. Sign into your rock star social to link your account then the game should have zero problems. If it does please Google it and do some self research, its very beneficial. Of course this is not the fix for everyone but I think it will help.
