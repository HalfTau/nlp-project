Before I start off, lemme just say I love this game. Its a huge, open world thats full of different activities and things to do. The graphics are good, you can mod the game. Everything about the GAME is good. The reason why Im giving it a thumbs down is not because of the game itself, but because of the rediculous process that it takes in order to play the game. Let me tell you a little story written in greentext style, which will give you an idea of what youll likely go through during the process of playing this game.be mebe 13be running Windows 8 osdad says i cant get GTAdecide to get it anyway because  itBuy all gta games on steam besides 5download and launch gta 4soexcited.jpgbrings me to Social Club logintf is Social Clubmakes me create an account in order to playdonepress play onlinesays i dont have the right login infoyes i dotry againstill nowtf.jpgdecide to play offlinepress buttonnothing happenstry over and over again, same resultslook up fix on the internetsays I have to download windows livedownload useless software that I will only use oncegame starts uppress play in the ingame menuinfinite loading screenrllysearch the web to find the right fixfinally fix itgo back into gamesays i have to log into Windowsomfglog into windowsforces me to log into to Xbox live even tho I use pci dont have an XBL accountcant save game progress unless i have oneon 2nd step of creating accountalmostdone.jpegsays i need parent permission in order to confirm the accountohshit.jpegparents need xboxlive accountdammitragequitgetscancerdiesStupid Microsoft.
