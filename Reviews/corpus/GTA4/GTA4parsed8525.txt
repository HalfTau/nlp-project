Very good game with a few memorable characters that are very loveable. The city is very realistic and the tone is also based in reality so its not for the players who are used to GTA Vs over the top story line and happenings. It kind of reminds me on GTA San Andreas with how the city looks and how you get to interact with people and your surroundings.
