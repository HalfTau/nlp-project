Perhaps the issues will be solved, but considering I can start up the PS3 and play this with no headaches, its not worth getting here. I was very excited seeing the collection of GTA 3, VC, SA, 4 and its DLC, but now Im in the process of requesting a refund not holding my breath either.Im not even having the same problems as everyone else CD key not working instead I can login to GFWL just fine and start the game up, despite never entering the key in the first place. No, I get the much more annoying issue of the game not saving, which worked with no problems at all prior to this update. The lesson I learned here is to never buy a rerelease of anything, ever. Moreso if I already own it, forget supporting devs and games I liked if they want to screw me like this. Have a nice day.
