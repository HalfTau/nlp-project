This game runs buggy and was poorly ported, not only that I had key issues, ontop of that you need to create a social club profile, ontop of that you need to create a Windows Live profile, ontop of that you need to figure out Windows Live. I dont even have Episodes From Liberty City in my library and when I try to play it through the game Windows Live tries to make me buy the DLC  that I bought complete edition I should have the 3 games no problem but guess what? I only have GTA 4 Ive had this game since last summer, have fun trying to figure everything out and pay for all the games when you can barely play one.
