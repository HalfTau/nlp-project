I bought this game a while back, but with the recent launch of GTA V and the rumors that Games for Windows Live is shutting down, I decided to go ahead and play it. GTA III for PC didnt connect with me. This game is much more refined. Better graphics of course, but also better story, better characters, and much better controls when using XBox 360 Controller. This game takes itself a little more seriously than GTA III, but you can still cause a lot of crazy mayhem. It goes without saying that none of this content is for the kiddies.The PC version is no doubt the best looking version of the game, but there are some graphical glitches and texture popping. I also ran into a bug in the final mission and had to Google to find a workaround. I prefer the progression system in games like Assassins Creed and Infamous. At a certain point in the game, I felt like I earned all this money and had nothing to spend it on but ammo and weapon refills. None of this takes away enjoyment for what the game does best.The story missions alone take about 2030 hours to complete, but there is so much to do too many things to list, you could easily spend hundreds of hours in this game if you choose. The city is huge and the developers did a fantastic job of making it feel alive. This is where the game really shines and why gamers choose to keep playing long after the story is complete. You can feel the massive amount of work that must have went into developing the simulation. It really is an impressive feat.
