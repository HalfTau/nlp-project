Awful port, seriously some of the worst, most halfshit before ACU. But hardware is becoming less of a problem now that its 7 years old, most computers can run this game at or near its highest settings. There are also some pretty sweet ultra graphics mods for this game. GFWL sucks but the raw gameplay is not too terrible.
