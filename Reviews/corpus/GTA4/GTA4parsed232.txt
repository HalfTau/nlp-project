This game is awesome. The story is great and the soundtrack is pretty nice. The only problem I have is, for some reason at some random time. My game is so glitchy. I start it up and it just pauses and unpauses. The game doesnt even load so I cant play it. I wouldve given this game a 10/10 but, since that happened. Im going to have to bring it down to an 8/10.
