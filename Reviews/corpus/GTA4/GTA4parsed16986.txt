This game is dark, fun, and a perfect satirical representation of modern day america. The graphics and level of detail are impressive, the story is one of the best in the series some reviewers have compared it to an Oscar winning story the characters feel real and theyre all absolutely hilarious in their own twisted way. Personally, Ive played this game for countless of hours not on steam and ive replayed it many, many times.
