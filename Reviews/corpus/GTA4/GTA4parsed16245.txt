This game is great but FAIR WARNING this game is a severe pain in the balls to run. Wont even run on my desktop with i77700k, gtx 1070, 8gb ddr4. Keeps telling me to enter a serial code found in the game manual. Yes because the steam version comes with a physical game manual. However runs like a charm on my laptop with i74710hq, gtx 860m, 12gb ddr3. Still need the games for windows live baloney though. Anyway awesome game if you can make it run. Dont buy it unless you are prepared to go through hoops and obstacles. Honestly should not reccomend this title on steam but its still a fun game with some crappy optimization go figure seems to be a trend with a lot of titles on steam. GTA V is great and very well optimized but to be fair I keep coming back to this one for the memories of the good ol days. Plus it runs like trash on xbox 360. gg rockstar, but trash support and optimization.
