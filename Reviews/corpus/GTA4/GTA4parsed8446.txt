I have never had this many problems with any game.Steam says I spent 1 hour for this game but it was all spent on trying to fix things.Problems I have encountered so far1 I couldnt count the number of accounts I had to login.2 This game says my VRAM is not enough and doesnt let me change resolution I have gtx980ti. I know there is a solution, setting launch options but is it that hard for Rockstar to fix this?3 I downloaded GFWL from Microsoft website. I thought it would be the latest one. I was wrong...  An ingame update is required and at the end you need to quit game to continue updating.4 YOU CANNOT QUIT. I had to restart my computer 4 times just to quit. I could never quit in a normal way. When you try to quit, a black screen appears. Guess what, you also cant close the game using task manager.  This screen prevents you to see other windows, the only way to quit is restart.5 GFWL, GFWL, GFWL6So I couldnt even play a minute. I have no idea about ingame things.I have never thought I would see something worse than UPLAY. After having trouble with this game I think UPLAY is good enough.
