If you interested in this game, I suggest to save your money to buy something else. do not buy this game.I bought this because I have played this game on PS3, I really wanted to try it on PC version.I bought the GTA bundle, but this is what i got for this game First launch, need to login to Social Club, but everytime I entered my email and password, It ALWAYS FAILED TO LOGIN, but finally I can skipped this thanks to Internet for the tutorial how to skip this Not optimized for Windows 10, I know this is 2008 game, but Rockstar still needs to support and update this game, because some people wanted to try GTA IV before buy GTA V , because GTA V has amazingly ing expensive price. Games for Windows Live sucks on Windows 10, I even cannot create my savegame. I wonder why Rockstar didnt try to remove ing GFWL from this game. Infinite loading screens at startup, have tried any solutions onthe Internet, but no luck cant change graphics settings, WTF I have 2015 laptop. I have tried any solution on the Internet, luckly it worked, rockstar had published and confirmed this problem on their website, I wonder why they didnt do something to fix this steamsad I bought this as an original game, but I need to struggle, struggle, struggle to make it playable, it just like Im using the pirated version problems. If you have Windows 8/8.1/10, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME steamsad I have wasted my hours to make this game playableI want to request refund, but because my little brother really wants to play this, well..... i will try to make his wish come true...
