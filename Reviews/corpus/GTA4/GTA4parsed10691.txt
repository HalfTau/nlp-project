I am not going to comment on the Game itself since I couldnt get it to run !And after the same problems with other Rockstar Games I can tell you thisIf you want to keep your sanity, stay away from any Rockstar Games.Those people are so paranoid that anyone might steal their games, theyd rather make the Game unplayable for hundred thousands of people who payed for it, than have one guy play it who didnt pay.Newsflash Rockstar People who steal and crack your games have no problems. Its only us honest customers who get screwed over by your stupid Social Club.If you are hellbound on installing copy protection other than steam itself. AT LEAST get people on it who know what they are doing !
