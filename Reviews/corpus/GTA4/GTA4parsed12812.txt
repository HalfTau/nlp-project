i LOVE this game and its mods, online, world, cars, and characters.its an awsome game that stars niko. the main protagonist of the game. his idiot cousin tricks him into coming to america with the promies of cars, wealth, a home, and big american s.but when he arives in liberty city everything isnt what he expected.and the rest is history.i love goofing off on this game and going online!!warning! if you want to unleash the full potential of this game you NEED trainer 6.5!warning2! you need 3 acounts to run this game. steam, social club and games for windows live.WARNING3 games for windows live is a pain in the a.!WARNING4! trainer 6.5 is almost MANDITORY to play online because pepole with the mod WILL push you around trainer6.5 is a mod that lets you do EVERYTHING including harass other players.i hope this has helped.takumi on behalf of
