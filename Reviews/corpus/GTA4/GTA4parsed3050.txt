I absolutely love this game, but anything that Rockstar/2k/TakeTwo is currently being boycotted until they are no longer going on a witch hunt against modders.Mods are the most important part of video games, its how potential developers discover they like programming.I will no longer be purchasing from either TakeTwo or Electronic Arts. they have clearly stated that they have no interest in selling their products.
