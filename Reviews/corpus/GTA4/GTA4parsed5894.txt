BE WARNED Social Club will fail to login 99.9 of the time, not worth fiddling with. Just assume it wont be working ever, and play offline. Before you start be sure to Manually enable autosaves and  other than that its a fairly decent game.Itll also bug you about creating a windows live account if you want to save your progress. There is a patch for it somewhere if you cant get it to work, though that part did work fine for me once I manually enabled autosaves. Manually saving isnt a menu option, but rather an ingame go to a safehouse location thing. that couldve been done better.
