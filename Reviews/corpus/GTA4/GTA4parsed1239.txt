altough GTA san andreas is a lil more versatile with the map, I think is far overated. I had such a great times with this game,good old days I must add, many gamers like playing GTA to have a good time doing what you pease, but this game its  deep more realistic on the story and sometimes is hard to handle watching....I personaly loved the story and I am kinda sad that some ppl dont like havent even tried it yet, should give an oportunity to this game it wont let you down.lets go bowling
