One of the best Grand theft auto games, if not the best.Gameplay wise I say this game was a huge ice breaker back in the day, it made a difference in the open world gaming community. Its not boring, but fun in every aspect. Who doesnt like to fly through a car window when hitting a car...Story was pretty, pretty awesome to be fair. It had everything you need, from Niko, the Serbian immigrant who lives in the past and ruining his future to make a difference in his head. And then you have his cousin who is a complete life fail, gambler and a standard fatty. As the game progresses you become a member of the mafia, and you work for a dirty cop who is a gang member brother, pardon gang members. To make things simple you experience a lot of sht in a very short time span.Graphics were pretty OP, especially when you think about the year this game came out. It aged pretty well.Some flaws that I would like to mention are not that important, but if you dont have a good temper they might bug you. Firstly you have the Windows live something, something that you need to register for or you cant save the game or something like that. You could check Youtube for tips but its a time waster and a painfull process. Next we have some minor graphics bugs that happen in the tunnel, and the famous last mission heli bug that stops you from beating the game. When you get the choice to pick between money and revenge pick the money because the revenge mission leads you to an ending in which you cant enter the heli.I give this game a good 7.5 / 10
