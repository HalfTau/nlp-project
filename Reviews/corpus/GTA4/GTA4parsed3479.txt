There are so many people complaining about not knowing how to start the game. That is the only reason theyre negative reviews.This game brings back so much nostalgia and fun. Probably not as much as GTA SA did/does but it still is heaps fun to play. The engine for ragdolling in this game is so much better then GTA V in my opinion allowing for some pretty funny times.
