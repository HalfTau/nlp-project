Terrible beyond belief, have not been able to play the game for years since the code was invalid although it was perfectly fine until the game was sold through steam. After all this time I finally receive a code that works and all that did was waste 15gb of downloading. Game does not launch, the games for windows live component needs to be removed, GFWL does not exist on windows 10. Typical Rockstar games, console trash ported poorly, so poorly it doesnt even launch.
