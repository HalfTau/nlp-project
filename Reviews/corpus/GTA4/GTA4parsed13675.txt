PROSA wonderful world, full of humor and wit. Well designed, and well orchestrated. Liberty City is a great addition to the GTA world.CONS Every car handles like youre driving a potatoe. The arguement could be made that when youre going very quickly, turning is hard, but as they dont give us a spedometer, well never know. To top that off, walking is a chore. Like... Painful. Turning around is just terrible.Also, every 5 minutes your phone is getting blown up. Theres always someone who wants something, and it really distracts from any real goal.They have removed the custom car system from SA as well. Very disapointing.Basically, it is a port, and as usual, they didnt put any time into making sure it worked as a port. I bought it, and I wish I hadnt, I would recomend you ignore this one, unless you have a friend with a 360 who will let you play for a half hour to see the city.tldrThe sights are something to see, but I imagine this is a game that is better played on console, and not at length.edit I have over 4 hours invested in GTA IV, but I have been offline, so Steam wont recognize it.
