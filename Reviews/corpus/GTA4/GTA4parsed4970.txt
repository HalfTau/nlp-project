Dont buy this game this is one of the worst entries in the Grand Theft Auto series and for many reasons first off the loading screen took years, it took me two hours to find out that the first loading screen was going on forever. So now I cant refund it at this point so I have to enjoy the game now and now it takes a total of one hour to figure out how to fix it to open a game that I hated. The missions are awful with some deaths I feel cheated and the bank heist level is just so hard. And Nikos voice just perfect just totally annoying squeaky dumb and makes me want to jump out a window. Speaking of window Windows live is messing up my game and I hate it you need an account to save the game I get disconnected frequently meaning I CAN NOT SAVE THE GAME. I will now leave you with what Niko speaks like,Paqeeeeeeeee Illee goq geeeeeet the moneyeeeeeeeeeeeee goqer meeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Honestly I wouldnt know what he was saying without subtitles heres what he acctually says, Ill go get the money cover me. Amazing!
