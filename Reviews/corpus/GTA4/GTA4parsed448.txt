my first unironic serious reviewGTA IV in the end gets a negative review from me because of 3 main things  GFWL, the optimization and performance, and the missions/gameplay.Games for Windows Live DRM in this game is terrible  since its now unsupported and discontinued getting this game to work correctly has become a huge pain. There are mods out there to disable GFWL and allow you to play the game, but you lose access to multiplayer.The performance and optimization in this game is terrible. This is one of the worst PC ports of any game Ive seen, almost as bad as SR2. No matter what setup you have, youll see slowdowns, stutters, and odd graphical glitches. Ive tried this game on multiple PCs, and even far exceeding the requirements doesnt help. Rockstar has done very little to improve performance, and this late in the game, now almost 10 years later, GTA IV wont be getting any patches anytime soon.Lastly, the story and missions are pretty lacking. Most missions involve going to see someone, have them complain, drive to a different location, and kill someone. The only variation you get is maybe sometimes youll have to kill a group of people, or maybe youll have to follow someone and THEN kill them. There is just not much here. On top of that, outside of missions, theres not much to do. Sure you can be harassed by friends to hang out, or buy clothing, but you get no mod shop which was in GTA SA, no cool minigames where is my paramedic and firefighting missions?? ?, and a somewhat bland city to explore.In 2008 this was revolutionary. Unfortunately its now 2018. Dont buy unless on sale.
