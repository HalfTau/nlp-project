Grand Theft Auto IV was released in 2008 and is a departure from the gameplay and style of its predescessor, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. Grand Theft Auto IV is actually the Eleventh title in the GTA series, and features Nico Bellic, a Serbian military veteran who travels to Liberty City to start a new life with his cousin Roman. As Nico begins to settle in he finds himself working for a loan shark, Roman is indebted to and eventually kills him. Nico is then recruited by other powerful figures in the Liberty City underworld and quickly begins accumulating power.Grand Theft Auto IV is a fun game to play, but differs from San Andreas in the way it looks and feels, making it a little weird to get used to if you have played the previous games in the series. The voice acting is pretty good, the story is interesting, especially with the Downloadable Content such as The Ballad of Gay Tony. Though showing its age, Grand Theft Auto IV is still fun and worth playing if you are a fan of the series.
