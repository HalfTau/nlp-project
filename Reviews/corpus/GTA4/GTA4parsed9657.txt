Worst Grand Theft Auto game from HD era. Missions are boring and always the same, difficulty is lost somewhere, story is good but number of missions are too big. Cut 2035 from the game and it will be great. Realism you say? GTA was awesome without it. Great ragdoll physic GTA V  sucks?The NPCs bodies are too light and fly away from a single shot, even from Glock17.Well, this was interesting experiment, especially for GTA series.5.7/10 Play this game only if you big fan of boring missions/realism/GTA or just dumb piece of like me.
