It is good, works for me well after I signed in with a Windows Live account for save.. bad idea to use such method for saving though..The problem with this game is still the same like in every GTA series.. it is a TPS action game partly, and the movement of the chracter is still not capable to do it properly.. this run, and slippering before stop is really annoying often.. the Super bikes are uncontrollable, spinning really easy. Nothing special for a GTA game, but it is OK.After Vice City experience.. why we cant buy any companies and make money in this game as well? Why we have to do always the same thing? Dirty work for big and small sharks.. And those phone calls non stop... I cant have a peacful moment. I have 700000 dollars and cannot use it for anything. DUsing Windows Live profile  1Using Windows Live profile for game saving.. another 1Character movements are still bad for an action game.. it is too slow.. 1Superbikes are uncontrollable, always the same dirty work.. nothing special, cannot buy companies or firms.. I am on full ammo and cannot use my money for anything.6/10
