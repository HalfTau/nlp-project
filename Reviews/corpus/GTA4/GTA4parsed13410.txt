I have played over 1000 hours in nonsteam versionEpic crime drama set in fictional version of New York Liberty City, tells a story about Niko Bellic who just came in from Serbia seeking for the american dream that his cousin Roman told him about, apparently its all lies crime depicted in this game is dark and gritty forget hollywoodaction movie styled gangster personalities. The game itself also filled with present day popculture, political satires and parodies you could laugh to yourself while listening to the radio or watching the TV show and the ingame internet.The story line itself is comparable to 5 stars quality movie, as the player gets involved with the story of modern day balkan immigrant Niko Bellic as he travels to Liberty City seeking refuge from Serbia and his past. Throughout the way, the player feels sympathy and passion for Niko as he goes through love, hate, revenge, and all the modern emotions in real life with GTA IV. Liberty City of course based on New York, there are some familiar landmarks where epic shootouts take place in the game. The game is worthwhile just for the storyline and all the interesting characters alone that are involved with Nikos criminal activities in Liberty City.GTA IV has great story, and one becomes rather fascinated with all the characters towards the middle part of this experience. So before playing the newly released GTA V, take a step in a few years and play a game that truly revolutionized the GTA franchise, IV.ProsGreat storyOne of the best voice acting in video gameGood SoundtrackGreat dark vibeRealistic physics engine Euphoria Technology, still better than Watch DogsVideo editor, great for movie makingModding of courseConsGames For Windows Live no explanation needed its pure shtConsole port, need a good pc to run in good settingsFor some audienceSlow paced gameplay, dont expect Michael Bayesque gameplayClumsy controls great animation thoughScore 92/100
