2 out of 5, would have been a 3 but Microsoft sucks. I had a lot of fun playing this game. My main complaints revolve around the whole Microsoft Live crap attached to this game. There were several times I could not continue my game because I couldnt connect to the Live servers, apparently your save file is tied in with Live so if you cant log in all you can do is start a new game. While playing Live would often log out and back in interrupting gameplay. There were whole days of Live outages where I couldnt play. I never figured out how to get multiplayer to work, I tried once but it was confusing and I quickly gave up. My computer is not an XBox, stop treating it like one Microsoft!!! Anyways, the game was mostly fun, the story kinda falls apart in the late game, but overall I had a lot of fun. Most of the missions were fun, a few were confusing and difficult, but I figured them out in the end. Overall this is a good GTA game. I cant wait for 5, but they are taking wayyyyy toooooo loooooonnnnnngggg releasing it for PC, I will probably not have any interest by the time it actually comes out.
