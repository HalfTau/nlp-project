Gta Iv my favorite GTA i love it. The only minus is that well.. Windows Live and the fact i have alot of graphical issues but maybe that is just mypc. The story, the gameplay, the multiplayer if you can find a game is soo fun and i love it. The mods for this game also fun as fck just driveing in the ingame world of NYC and your friend hanging out the window and shooting random pedestrians is the best. I higly reccomend this game if you have a friend you can freeroam with!! !
