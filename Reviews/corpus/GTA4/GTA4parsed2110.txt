I am sadly disappointed. I recently got this urge to play Grand Theft Auto 4 FINALLY. So I boot up and try to play and the game is just running smooth enough for me to play. I am frequently getting single digit fps on a GTX980. I wish I could recommend the game but with this being my experience I would say check out a lets play on Youtube. This is what I will be doing since I can not get the game to run correctly.
