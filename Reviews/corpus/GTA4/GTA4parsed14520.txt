Its a fun game to just mindlesslyaround with friends. I would recommend keeping it around just for when you get bored. I wouldnt worry about playing it for the story thoght. In my opinion none of the GTA games have very good stories, but they are fun to mess around and kill people in. there are some building that you can even enter and hold off in, but good luck finding them.
