Well this is now the first GTA that Ive actually finished.Its great, not as indepth as San Andreas but the story and characters are interesting.Still holds up well visually and the gameplay/gunplay is a definite improvement compared to previous games, at times making you feel like a trained hitman.Though i got to say... I come from Balkan and whenever i see us portrayed in video games or even movies, they completely mess up our names, words and pronounciation.It doesnt harm the game, but its funny, therefore making it even more entertaining for us really... lolAlso i didnt like that one forced relationship in the story, turns out i chose my paths well. Just based on Nikos words in the beginning of the game That being said the ending didnt have any impact on me.
