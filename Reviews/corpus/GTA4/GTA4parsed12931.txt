Even with the release of GTAV, this game is great. If you find yourself likely to get the new one, you shouldnt get this one, because going back will be really hard and probably not enjoyable. But I played it for a long time. I am a sucker for openworld games, and this one delivered in spades. Liberty City Based on NYC is huge and detailed with lots of people and tons of different cars. And motorcycles. The missions are cool and the characters are cheesy and bad in that good way. I liked it a lot, and it usually goes on ridiculous price reductions during sales.
