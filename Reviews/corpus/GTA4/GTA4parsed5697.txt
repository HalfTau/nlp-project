I wanted to re dowload this and PLAY it but i guess that was too much to ask.I got a black screen when I clicked play, so I looked up how to fix it on the internet and fixed it.Then the loading scren was infifite, so i looked up on the internet how to fix it, and fixed it.then it said I didnt have enought video memory to load stuff like the floor or anything around me.on top of that you need a rockstar account a gfwl account and a steam account to play it.I have spent hours trying to PLAY THE GAME and now im just done.it like a project just trying to start it.im sick of fighting this garbage, and unless you want to be too, DONT BUY IT.
