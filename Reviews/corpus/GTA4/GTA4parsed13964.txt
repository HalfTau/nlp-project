after hours of work to get this game to run i can say i do recomend it although it was a pain in theto get going and i had to end up not running it through stem, the story was amazing most people complain about not being able to customize cars but those are the same people that play GTA games just to mess around a kill people this one kept me wanting to do more of the story and it is by far the best GTA title in my opinion
