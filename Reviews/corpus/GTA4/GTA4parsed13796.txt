Im sorry to say this game is a great game, but for consoles, not on PC. The possiblity of me playing with no lag is impossible I have a high powered AMD Desktop, making the game unplayable. Im not saying the game is bad, its one of the best in the franchise GTA V is my overall favorite, except the PC port is almost unplayable. Also the multiplayer is now not even around due to it depending on games for windows live, now discontinued. Save your money and buy the PC port of GTA V that is comming out in January, or if you want a PC GTA now, buy Grand Theft Auto San Andreas most PCs can run it at high/ultra settings.
