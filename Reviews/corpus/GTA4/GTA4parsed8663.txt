To be honest, I think it was a huge waste of money. I cant even play the game because of DRM provided by our favorite Games for Windows Live, which, guess what, Is incompatible with Windows 8 and up!But alas, steam has no refunds, so I only have a message for both the developers and consumers.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU OWN WINDOWS 8 OR 10!Seriously, its just a hassle to even open.TO THE DEVELOPERS Microsoft, Steam, RockstarPatch out GFWL. Seriously. This is the sort of crap that makes me think the quality control of Steam as a whole is just going downhill.
