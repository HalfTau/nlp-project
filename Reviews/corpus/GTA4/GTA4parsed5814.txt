Thinking about purchasing? Id buy GTAV instead though... First, massive world to explore! Second, plenty of vehicles to drive! Third, lots of weapons to use! Fourth, decent story! Fifth, decent graphics! Sixth, mods! First, no customization, besides clothing for your character. Second, multiplayer is mostly dead. Third, no Workshop Support. Fourth, can be hard to run on lowend systems.Would I recommend this? Yes, but Id recommend GTAV more. Besides, if you dont like it, you can always refund. Just be sure,
