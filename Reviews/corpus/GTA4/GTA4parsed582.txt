I have been buying and playing games on Steam for a few months now and, by far, this is the worst game I have ever bought. Specifically this version of the game. GTA 4 on Steam is terrible. Not only is the setup convoluted and computercrashingly bad, the frame rate is terrible and makes the cutscenes look like a slideshow. Im not sure if you will be able to see how many hours I have been playing this but if you can, that is an example of how terrible this download is. It takes forever and doesnt even work. I am glad I only paid 9 for this because I got it on sale. If you actually pay 30 for this, demand a refund. If you want to know how good my PCs performance is, it can handle Injustice 2 and other games that are bigger than GTA 4. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM!!! If you want a good GTA experience, download GTA 5. It is worth the money and actually works!
