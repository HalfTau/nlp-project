Good game. Nice story, protagonist, and so ever, but optimalization is poor. While playing gta 5 on ultra I get something about 50/60 fps, then in gta 4 it was sort of 30/40, and even 25 fps. Anywhay, I can totaly recomand you this game, couse of the story. I think that its one of best gta ever. Have fun
