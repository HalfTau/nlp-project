I had a problem with activation. So I contacted Rockstar Games Support. I had shown them proof of purchase.But one day I decided to change my name from Nebula to Mushtario Pepperoni.Before changing my name I had attached a screenshot of the game in my library. They then asked for another screen shot of my library, so I attached another screenshot. They saw that my name had changed.After that they closed the ticket and accused me of having two Steam accounts.10 out of ing 10 for support.
