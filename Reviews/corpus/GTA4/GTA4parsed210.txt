Although its a bit lacklustre in comparison to the other GTA games, like San Andreas and V, it is still a great game in its own right. Not many agree but I enjoyed the story it was the main factor that kept me engaged. Its gameplay is similar to GTA V but a bit clunky but nothing too drastic. I find Liberty City to be a much better setting than GTA Vs Los Santos as the cityscape is much more interesting and tone appropriate. When this first released, the PC port was staggeringly bad but my PC could handle 1080p, 60fps  95 of the time. My main specs being a GTX 1050Ti, i5 7400 QC with 8GB RAM
