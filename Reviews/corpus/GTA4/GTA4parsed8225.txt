Overall A fantastic effort by Rockstar but falls flat on gameplay and world design leaving me disappointed. Large and richly detailed open world Decent storyline with emotional involvement of the player Realistic physics Detailed model design, beautiful graphics No side missions! No taxi, firefighter, ambulance etc... missions, making it a very boring missiontomission experience Open world is too linear  only city everywhere with very little diversity Realistic physics makes for frustrating driving at times Very linear gameplay missions are a simple formula of go here, kill this guy, get paid
