Singleplayer works after you jump through hoops just to get the game to start, plenty of info out there on how to do it. Great nostaliga of the early 90s gaming days of spending too much time editing CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT trying to find just the right settings to get the game to work. Would be 10/10 if there was a way to finally get the game to run only to realize you accidentally removed theline from AUTOEXEC.BAT and didnt realize it until you got the game loaded.Id originally bought the box version from Best Buy when the game first game out, bought the Steam version a while back when it was on sale because Id broke one of my discs and wanted to play it on my newer PC. I swear I remember playing online multiplayer as late as last December but now it seems to no longer be functioning
