Honestly, I can play this game, however theres a lot of work to be done in order to get a decent frame rate on this. Lower the graphics settings, get a very specific launch option code, get the clean city mod, get another mod that clouds out the view to add a few extra frames, and you can maybe get 3040 frames at 720p. At least, thats what I had to do. Very fun game, especially The Ballad of Gay Tony. I just want to play this more on console now that its more of a chore to play this game, configure, test, repeat until you get it running decently.
