Playing around and messing around are hilariously fun in this game.Adding to that multiplayer is also a hoot, and finally the campaign wraps it all up in a nice little bow. The characters are interesting and unique and all have their own styles. Its very interesting to see how they interact with one another.The relationship system feels a bit tedious, but you cant get a homerun in every category, can you?
