A great game , well , atleast if you are a console peasant , probably the worst port in gaming history , the social club and all the shtty login problems still hasnt been fixed for years , graphics are a mess , cant even play online , i played this game on PS3 , was an amazing experience , not the best GTA game in my opinion but certainly not the worst , then i bought it when i first came out on Steam , played it for about 2 hours and immediately uninstall it since i can only replay the same old storyline again , which is fine by me , the game still has a large variety of mods and stuffs to mess around with . But it is the bad porting and login problems that makes me uninstall the game , i just reinstalled it , played it for like an hour and is planning to uninstall it again , still , if you have never tried the game , you should definitely check the game out. A great GTA game , that is for sure
