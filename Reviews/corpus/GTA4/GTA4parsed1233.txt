honestly it really pisses me off to see people complaining about games for windows live even though it 100 percent works you just have to make a offfline account,and i know that people once they find out how to do it they will complain about how its to much trouble to press 4 buttons in order to make a account just really actually think about something for once. AND YES IT WORKS FOR WINDOWS 10
