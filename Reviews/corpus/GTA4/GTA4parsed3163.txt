Probably my favorite Grand Theft Auto game. Has a great story and a lot of gameplay. Too bad it was a terrible port. Although the recent patch did fix alot of issues, there is still a substantial amount of stuttering. BUT it is mostly playable. These stutters mostly happen while driving. Other than that a great game. Keep in mind that youll have to sign in with a Windows Live account to save.
