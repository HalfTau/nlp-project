Great game all around and lightyears beyond GTA V oddly enough, GTA V is mostly just a cartoon while GTA IV is an actual story driven games with characters you care about and they dont feel the need to say  evey 2nd word dont get me wrong i curse like a ing salior but GTA V is just silly so all around this game is a 9/10 easy...However the PC version requires windows live to play and despite having played it earlier today I can no longer sign in and play the game.So I cant save my game making this a pointless waste of money.0/10get it on xbox or playstation, cheaper and you can actually play it with no real issues.
