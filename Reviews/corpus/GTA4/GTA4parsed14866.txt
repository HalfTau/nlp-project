I dont think anyone should be buying this game on pc. Its just a big hassle. It took me nearly an hour just to launch the game, then when it finally was up it ran like poo. I have a 4.4ghz 4670k and a 780ti and I can easily say crysis 3 runs much better maxed out than this game does on high settings. Then I found out I cannot save unless I use games for windows live which is a steaming pile of garbage. But this is only after you have to make sure you have a rockstar social club account, which you must sign into every single time you launch. With all the technical issues and the hoops you must jump through for this game its not worth it, not even on a cheapo steam sale.
