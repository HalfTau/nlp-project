GTA IV is a good but highly overrated game. I will be condensing my review into a pros and cons list. Like most Steam games, its only worth getting on sale.ProsOpen worldGood atmosphere, feels very genuine like an actual cityGraphics were good for their time and still hold up decently although the antialising needed some serious work. Still, I would argue that the game looks better on PC than GTA V does on consoles. Graphics can be imrpoved through nonsteam modsCampaign is goodDLC is a worthy time investmentFun to mess around in by yourself or with friendsMultiplayer modes are plentifulLots of mods only thing that makes this game worth buying imoConsWindows Live is quite possibly the worst thing I have ever seen in my life and you need it for anything that isnt singleplayerMultiplayer characters lack good customizationGeneral lack of models, no more than 1020 in the game for everyone in the cityStrictly city environment, GTA V fixes thisLack of anything to do once the main game is finished, no coop or lasting incentive to keep playingA lot of bugsDLC Episodes from Liberty City is seperated from the main game which is incredibly annoying.
