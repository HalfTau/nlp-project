If your thinking about getting this game and catching up a bit before GTA V comes out for PC, do yourself a favor and just dont. Or better yet, whip out that old Xbox 360 thats collecting dust and play it on that.GTA IV is a great game that I had a lot of fun playing on counsle, but the port makes rockstar look like they didnt even try. reducing my draw distance and Setting my graphics to to medium because the low setting is just... so bad, the game was still terribly laggy, and while my machine isnt a top of the line rig, Its definetly not a dinosaur.Then you have The Xbox Live intergration, wich if you dont have an account or dont remember your old one can take half an hour just so you can save the game.
