I used to play this game on my XBOX360 and I enjoyed it. So when I saw winter sale  I bought GTAIV collection. But the problem is, I cant play it cause of the WINDOWS LIVE. I have Social Club account, I made Windows LIVE account and I cant link em. I get error Sorry, we cant reach WINDOWS LIVE account I tried it with multiple accounts, made ton of em. And without that I cant play singleplayer Cause if you want to save your progress IG, you need to have Windows LIVE linked. GGWP.
