Dont buy. Cant login to the social in game but I can on the website, and why do people still use Windows live?! Even when you try to play offline the game just breaks and gets stuck on a black screen. A complete waste of 20 and of course Rockstar doesnt give a crap about its customers....but what do you expect? It is Rockstar after all XD
