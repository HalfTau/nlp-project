Was alright. Had GFWL but was managable. Now that Microsoft has gone all limp dicked about GFWL and are too ing lazy to fix it this game now will not save. At all. Ever. You are actively blocked from saving due to DRM. Thankfully the modding community have made a mod to bypass GFWL but I would not, under any circumstances, recommend this game in its current state. Do not buy unless you are willing to have to kick yourself in the balls to get the damn thing working.
