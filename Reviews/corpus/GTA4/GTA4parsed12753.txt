The game is great. No doubt about it. Come on, its GTA. Do I have to explain?Im not recommending it because GFWL screws everything up. It seriouslyme off to find that once I installed the game, it wouldnt start. I then went on to troubleshoot and I HAD to install the latest version. Okay, then I got it to work, and I got through the first cutscene. Charming characters, bla bla bla. The typical GTA stuff. BUT THEN IT TELLS ME THAT I NEED TO MAKE AND SIGN INTO A GFWL ACCOUNT TO SAVE? So I make an account and sign in, and then it tells me that I need to update GFWL ONCE AGAIN in order to save. Its a load of steaming horse crap. Im actually writing this as its updating. Nobody should ever go through all this trouble let alone sign in to this GFWL t just to play a game. And then it tells me to save my game progress and exit so I can install the GFWL update. What the hell? That bull is the exact reason why I CANT SAVE THE GAME and youre telling me to save the game so I can save the game? I find all of this pointless. Youre not even playing online, yet youre forced to be tethered to this GFWL monstrosity just so you can perform the most basic act of saving.Man, I am so mad. I think Im gonna destress with some GTA IV.OH WAIT I CANT BECAUSE GFWL IS ING IT UP.
