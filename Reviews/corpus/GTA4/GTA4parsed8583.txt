Surprised! Playing the game on a Macbook 12I played trough this game on Xbox 360 a while ago, and i just absolutely loved it!The guy behind the voice of Nico Bellic  Mr. Michael Hollick, is doing a massiv job of making you feel attached to Nico, and you really is feeling him when you play him! Just simply  the best voice over job in a computer game ever in my opinionThe story is sooo good, that i wanted to wait until i had forgotten most of the story, so i could play it again  and now i have!So i downloaded this on my Macbook 12 1,1Ghz 8GB RAM  1,5GB intel Int.gr graphics, just to see how it would work  and it actually is playable PDo not expect Super PerformanceIm running on low on all settings  so you can compare the graphics with San Andreas Just a little bit better! But the good thing is, i can now enjoy the awesome story once more, and play it anywhere i like!
