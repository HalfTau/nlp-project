ok we need to get it straight right now. The game can work just fine on the newest hardware, such as, windows 10 64x and amd R9 390 and i5 6600. Yes the game works and it does not crash at all......butBut it took me a few hours to figure out how to get rid of all the problems with launching, stutter, crashes and DRM issue. There was definately a lot of them at first.First off all, make sure to update your BIOS motherboard drivers withing the bios system. This solved my issue for DRM protection. The game just would not launch becasuse it would tell me there is some DRM t. I have ASUS board, but it is pobably the same for Gigabyte and others.Next, Xbox one controller apparently can cause stutter and FPS drops in some guys. It is caused by front USB power source that does not get enough power for XBOX one. Just use USB at the back. However Xbox 360 controller should work fine.Next, unable to change graphic settings. This can be fixed as well. There are multiple tutorials how to make changes in your files in order to make GTA adjust graphics for you. However, keep in mind that this game was really poorly optimized for PC so it will never run smooth butter on the best hardware.  But the resolution fix  and stutter should be gone forever.If you dont want to spend too much time creating windows live profile just create an Offline profile and sign in with it. Takes 3 seconds.Lastly, the game is still super fun and looks really good despite unstable framrate. Once you get passed all the issues, it will work like it should.
