I vote yes, BUT why isnt it letting me sign into the Social Club I have an account due to GTA 5 online... But everytime I sign in it says authentication correct, Then it loads, and just closes. Doesnt say anything. It closes completely. I open it again, it does the same thing, I restarted my PC thinking it might be it, but no it still does not work. Can somone help me out.
