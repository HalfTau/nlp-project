If you have windows 8, dont. Just turn back, and run.I purchased this game during April, before the new refund feature on steam. By the time refunds were a thing on steam, my 14 days were long gone.I tried to refund it even then, but I was quickly greeted with a We will not be granting a refund at this time.If I know anything about Rockstar as a company now, they could care less. Customer Satisfaction isnt on their query for this game anymore, theyll put it on sale to make it seem like a deal to quickly realize you just purchased a hollow row of words in your Library that represent a game you cant play.
