Wow  you Rockstar. First of all, you release a game with a stupidsystem called Games for Windows live, then when you remove it, you  everything up so that nobody can run thiseither because of that ing SecuRom t or because of game not even starting after logging into the Social Club. ing t if i cant even play this game so i guess i have to pirate it even tho i have it on steam.
