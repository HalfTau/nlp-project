GTA IV for the PC is a great way to spend an afternoun with freinds, its almost inpossible to play this game without seeing howbadly you can brake a car, if your playing on console thats where the never ending fun ends but on PC a new never ending fun is added on in the form of mods and console commands, i could honestly sit and play this game for a hole year if i didnt keep getting some sort of problem with the texture its apparently an easy fix though. if you have a good computer and a hand full of freinds who also have equaly good computers then your set for fun, when GTA V comes out on PC im gunna be so exited that my face will come out of my face after its come out of my face!
