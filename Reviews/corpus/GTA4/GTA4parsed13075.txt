This is a great game. It really is, but it DOES NOT WORK ON WINDOWS 8. The only way to get it to work is to download 10,000 files and if Im like anyone else I would rather not download a bunch of stuff on my computer. Now if youre not using Windows 8 or 8.1 check the forums because it might work on another OS. Again its a super fun game but will not work. Maybe now you have an excuse to dust off that old Xbox.
