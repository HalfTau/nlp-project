REVIEW WRITTEN IGNORING THE FACT THAT THE PC PORT IS ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUSWhat can I say about this game? GTA IV beats GTA V in every single aspect. It is truly one of the greatest games Rockstar has released in the last decade. The soundtrack is unlike anything I have ever heard in a game seriously, its LITERALLY the best ing soundtrack a game has. The story is amazing and the characters are unique and funny.The physics are superb and the gameplay feels extremely smooth playing with a controller.The multiplayer RIP was the most fun I had in a game since MTA.This game was, and still is, ahead of its time. I cant recommend this game enough. Its a masterpiece.This game definitely gets a 9/10 from me. Nostalgia also makes this game 10 times more fun.ing buy it.EDIT Stop giving this game negative reviews simply because T2on GTA Vs SP mods. It has absolutely nothing to do with this game and you are just stopping potential customers from buying this amazing game
