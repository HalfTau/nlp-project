If you want to hear about the actual game then dont listen to me. I could recommend this game, or write a review about the story/features, but I only seek to make it known that if your computer can only handle normal games or minor ones dont buy this game. The suggested standards for system requirements are not very accurate. I thought that considering my computer can handle Skyrim adequately that this game would be no problems, but I was wrong. The game is fairly old, yet the fact that I cannot play it is somewhat relevant to this.I am impartial to the game, and I think it would have been great. Judging by the pictures and the trailer, it seemed to be something I would play over and over. Dont buy it if you cant play it.?/10
