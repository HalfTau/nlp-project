What can i say? Is this game well optimised for windows? HELL NO. Does it have annoying 3rd party software such as RockStar Social club that constantly doesnt work? YES. So why would i recommend this game? Because gosh darn it despite all that this is one of THE best GTA games i have ever played, yes i went there. It ranks on top of with San Andreas as one of the best GTA games IMO, we all know GTA V is nice and all but this, the story, the setting and especially the characters makes you so emotinally invested in its story that its hard not to love Nico Bellic, our main character in the game.SO what are you waiting for? If you have a decent rig, i recommend downloading the CryENBV mod, this enchances the experience and makes this 8 year old game stand out and gives it some new life.
