Story and characters are boring, gameplay is clunky as hell, cars handle worse than a Planetside 2 Sunderer with its wheels replaced with bars of soap, giant empty city with nothing to do and a currency system more broken than anything Ubisoft has dreamed up in recent years... multiplayer was okay, even fun now and then with a friend, but theyve even managed to break that to the point that I cant even get into a game anymore.I know everybody but me absolutely loves this game, and I wasted over a hundred hours of my life trying to figure out why that is.  I have absolutely no reason to recommend this piece ofto anyone.  Go buy Sleeping Dogs or Saints Row 3 instead.  Hell, Id even recommend WatchDogs over this if there were any guarantee you could get past Uplay.Oh, and its a  PC port too.
