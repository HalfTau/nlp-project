Waste of money. Im unable to play this game at all. The offline mode tells me a I cant play multiplayer...thats nice, I dont care, but the game WONT OPEN. Most of the time trying to play singleplayer or multiplayer I get the login fail but the few times I dont get a login fail, the game STILL WONT OPEN. Yes I bought it for uber cheap, but I should have kept my 10 for something like a single starbucks coffee or 2.5 gallons of gas.
