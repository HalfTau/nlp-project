Poor optimization and four FOUR! layers of DRM prevent this from being the incredible experience it is on consoles. Its possible to run it on new systems with the latest version of Windows, but prepare to do research to get it to boot into the actual game at all. Microsofts neglect of Games For Windows Live and the fact that that platform never worked very well to begin with make this into an absolute nightmare to get running properly.The irony is that downloading a crack for this game gets the whole thing up and running flawlessly within a matter of seconds.
