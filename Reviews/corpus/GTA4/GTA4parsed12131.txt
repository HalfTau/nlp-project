I shelled out 20For a game with constant fps drops and glitches, that runs on windows live windows live is not supported anymore btwNow think to yourselves now, what does it take to run such a work of art on Windows Live?Well ill tell you masochistic slugger! You need to make an account, to make an account, to make an account, to start up gta 4, to close gta 4, go make an account. Got all that? Now time span that over 2 hours and boom, you can play your 20 dollar game.Also something i havent seen in these other reviews which seems to be a problem only with me. I tried to join a friend, everytime i tried to join it either canceled or kicked him and let me join. The same thing happened vice versa. I have nooo idea what can do this perhaps the game is just ing broken.DO. NOT. BUY THIS. IT DOESNT ING WORK.
