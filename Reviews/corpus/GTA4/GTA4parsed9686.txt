1 If you are having problems with Games For Windows Live, you can easily disable it by installing a file called xlive but make sure you have the correct version of it.  I dont think version 1.0.8.0 needs xlive. Yes, it is a pain in the butt to make a Hotmail/MSN account but it is worth it.2 If you are having problems running the game on Windows 10 which is odd because I run it on this OS with no problems try going to your games local files navigate to GTAIV.exeright clickPropertiesCompatibility check Run this program in compatibility modechoose Windows 7click apply. Hope that helps.3 If your game is running on low framerates and you have a powerful computer which is odd because I have i5 7600k and a GTX 760 and I run 60 fps on high at least, but of course I do expect drops make sure to disable frame lock either in your game setting or go to your game local files and look for a file called commandline.txt make sure to delete this file or try and modify it by searching for a command that will fix your problem either on google or youtube.4 If your game started on all low setting, low resolution and the game wont let you fix it, search for a fix on youtube. It has to be with commandline.txt file too, shouldnt be that hard.5 When installing mods or messing with the ingame files MAKE SURE TO BACKUP YOUR ORIGINAL FILES.This game has been the best Grand Theft Auto game yet in my experience, with all of it modding, open sand box and Easter eggs. The voice actors did a very excellent job, Nikos voice the main character of this game is on spot and the voices of other characters. The games mechanics are amazingly realistic and the ability to add your own songs in a radio station is hilarious, but there are other problems like poorly optimization, bugs which version 1.0.8.0 should have already taken care of and the visual effects that make the game feels a little dull.
