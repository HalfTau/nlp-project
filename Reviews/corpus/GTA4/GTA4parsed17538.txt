Though somewhat boring at certain parts GTA IV really launched the HD Universe games, but it did feel like something was missing. Well, a lot of things. Previous entries in the series spawned numerous fun things to do like the multitude of fun things to do in GTA SA which was just... missing in GTA IV. the DLCs in a way fixed a tad bit of it Plus the numerous phone calls you have to get from friends to hang out most notably your cousin in the game Roman can just make it feel like a desperate, lonely friend simulator at times.It does have a solid soundtrack, as well as storyline, and fun physics to play around with when, say, crashing a car or bike.But after completion of the main storyline, and doing all the stuff to get completely at 100 completion all that youre left to do is blow up cars with a rocket which is fun to do but actually gets boring after a while and fling yourself off of buildings.Even though after the numerous things Ive said about the game, Ill give you a tldr of different aspects of the game in forms of scores 1 to 100Driving 50/100 considering its a driving game it shouldnt be this awfulPhysics 70/100 okay Im mostly taking into effect how much fun I have with flinging myself off buildings BUTShooting 80/100 surprisingly solid shooting even though theres always room for improvementVoice Acting 60/100 eh... not as good as it shouldve beenStoryline 85/100 other than saving Roman 100 times, its fairly niceModding Community 60/100 Im not a modder myself but the community is fairly large and there are many nice mods availableAllinall 85/100 the game is great, but the PC port is horrendous, which really made me not give it a perfect score
