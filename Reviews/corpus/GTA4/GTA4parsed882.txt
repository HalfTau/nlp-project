Grand theft auto IV probably a very good game. However this social club software and live ID that you need to have in order to play sucks. basically you cant play without it. And even when you try to install it. it wont work. Have played every GTA there is and becasue of this social club the game is the worst. You should be able to enjoy and play a game without any extra installation software. The graphic and game it self looks awesome. shame one cant enjoy and play it.
