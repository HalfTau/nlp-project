Jesus christ the amount of reviews here that say it doesnt work without its bad connection to socialclub or without games for windows live. Just download windows live from the first link on google, or if youre too dumb thats. Also theres literally a button that says Play Offline if you cant connect to socialclub. And if that button doesnt work,and its only the third link that tells you to delete paul.dll and it works.With that out of the way holytheres a lot of amazing mods out there. 10/10 even without the mods because the physics and AI are way better than gtavs.
