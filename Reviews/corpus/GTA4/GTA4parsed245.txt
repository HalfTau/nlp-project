The game itself is great, no question about that. But this steam version doesnt even work and the game wont even load. Clicking play takes you to the screen that says this game is subject to license... and it freezes there for 5 minutes. If youre lucky you will then hear the loading theme but it just cuts to black screen and stays frozen forever. I cant even alt tab out and have to force close or restart my computer.
