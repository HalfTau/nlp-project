Contrary to what some reviews say, Ive had no trouble running this on windows 10 ever since last years patch.Before that, it was barely a problem either all I had to do was replace a whole three!!! files to circumvent Windows Live.As for the game itself, I like going back to it every now and again to mess around. In many ways, the game is more realistic than GTA V is. The contrast between my wanton destruction and the seriousness of the overall game makes for some great times.A controller is recommended to play this though unlike their performance in GTA V, they did a pretty terrible job translating the controls to PC in this one. It just feels off without a controller.I got the game in the GTA Collection on sale for ten Euros before GTA V even came out, which I do recommend more than a full price purchase.
