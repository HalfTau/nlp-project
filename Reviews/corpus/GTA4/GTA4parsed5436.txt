FULL DISCLOSURE There really isnt much to getting this game to work. These negative reviews go on and on about how IMPOSSIBLE it is to get GTA 4 to work but its really not that hard. Also quit ing how you cant play online coming from a guy who loves singleplayer games you can disregard this if you want to.If you can get this game to work, then youre in for a big treat. The amount of hours Ive spent so far are not representative of the countless hours Ive spent messing around in Liberty City back on the Xbox 360. GTA 4 has one of, if not the best, narratives out of all the GTA games. Niko Bellic is the most human GTA protagonist in my opinion and has earned his place as my favorite videogame character of all time. Sure, the game hasnt aged well, but thats the beauty of the PC version! Just download a few graphics mods and even some crazy/funny mods to keep the game fresh. Hell If I could spend 300 hours on the Xbox 360 version, R clearly did something right! I also feel the same way with the Episodes from Liberty City, which are badass in their own right. Buy this game. This is the last GTA game that kept the spirit of the older titles while having its own unique aspects.
