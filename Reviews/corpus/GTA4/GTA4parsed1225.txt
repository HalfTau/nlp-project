Grand Theft Auto IV is the first true sequel to Grand Theft Auto III. The previous games were prequels, while this one is set after the events of three, so its only appropriate to label this as IV when we are going forward in the franchise rather than backwards. This entry in the franchise is focused on a foreigner from somewhere in East Europe named Niko Bellic. He was a veteran of the Bosnian Wars and struggles with post dramatic stress of the battles and fighting he witnessed. To escape from this past, Niko immigrates to Liberty City in hopes of finding a way to start a new. He is greeted by his cousin Roman who shows him around the neighborhood and how it differs from the old country. Everything seems peaceful and calm for Niko, until he learns his cousin owes a lot of money to the mafia, while an old enemy from Nikos past slowly comes to Liberty City. Niko must choose to either help his cousin out of debt or relive the past hed hope to never live through again. This game was more grittier and down to Earth as opposed to San Andreas. The character customizations are only limited to clothing. There is no body mass or hair style option, which took the fun away cause I loved those options where you can custom your character to your appeal. There is fewer weapons to choose from, safe houses cant be purchase and are less in numbers, and theres no money landering option. Despite these set backs, the game proved to be a good entry in the GTA series. Its not up there with San Andreas, but its highly playable. The game is sorta like an updated version of the gameplay of the third game. Hence the setting of Liberty City as well as an outfit you can unlock that resembles Claudes outfit from the third game. So if you are expecting the next big entry in the GTA series, you wont find it here. But if you like games on par with gritty crime dramas, then this game is worth your while.
