GIVE ME MY GTA IV ANNIVERSARY EDITION. I DONT WANT NO CONSOLE PORTSeriously, the game has the worst optimization ever, however still a great game. Yes it uses games for windows live but me and my friends have easily used it to get on multiplayer on W10 dont see why anyone cant.I loved the mechanics and the story better than Vs. V is full of microtransactions and is giving the feel of Saints Row in online.Mainly have this for LCPDFR.
