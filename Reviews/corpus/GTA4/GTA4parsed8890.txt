I bought 2 copies of this game because Im an idiot. Do not buy. These games do not work on even a relatively modern computer from 2009. i5750, 760GTX, Windows 8.1 The only thing this game will do is nag you about socialising and then load up advertisements for other games.If you try to adjust the resolution or anything, it wont let you. Every setting is locked on the lowest.If you start the game, it will lock up your entire ing computer during the loading screen.
