People are complaining about  Windows Live because they do not know how to solve the issue. When all they have to do is create an Xbox live account. Then link it to the rockstar social club and then finally sign in through in game windows live with that same Xl account. Problem solved and takes about 610 minutes. The game runs smoothly depending on your rig.
