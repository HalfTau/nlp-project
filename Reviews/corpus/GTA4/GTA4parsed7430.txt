I hate to say this, especially on Steam, but buy this on a console if you have the means and ways. The framerates drop all the time. SLi isnt supported from what I can tell. The aliasing is dreadful even  x16AA on 1920x1080 monitor  120Hz. I had to mod the freaking start command since this game doesnt load properly from the Steam launcher. It will crash if you do! Its clearly not optimized for PC at all and they prolly wont fix it anyway.Is it fun? Kinda...it gets dull after awhile. The mission markers always disappear and you have to keep calling your friends in the game to get missions to drive to a place, grab a car, drive it to another place, and get 250. Woopy doo! !Saints Row 3 is a WAAAY better title. Try that.
