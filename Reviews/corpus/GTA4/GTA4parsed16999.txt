Great open world sandbox with crap story, unlikeable characters and stupid game mechanics. I had a blast driving around, messing about, but the story elements were either bland, stupid or both, and I hate the autosave feature with a passion. Mess up your mission? Now drive over the entire map to start it again. No. Just no. Never this.After playing for nearly 60 hours, I can safely say Get Sleeping Dogs, one of the Mafia games or LA Noire instead. They are just better in every way.
