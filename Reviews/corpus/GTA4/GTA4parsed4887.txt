Liberty in City.Graphics are 10/10 considering this is a 2008/2009 game.Storyline is dark, very nice, really feels like New York although they could have used a bit more slavic language in the cutscenes.Physics outweigh GTA Vs physics. You can shimmy, peds wont attack you randomly and also the cops wont try to kill you randomly, they will try to arrest you. The car damage is more realistic, same with vehicle handling. The extra weapons on TBOGT DLC was a very nice touch.Multiplayer reminds me of GTASAMP, pretty basic, usual deathmatch/race gamemodes.
