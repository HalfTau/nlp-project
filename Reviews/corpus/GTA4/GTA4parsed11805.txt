Now isnt this a surprise, GTA IV.GTA IV is like other GTAs, go from A to B, and well thats enough about the gameplay, because not joking, thats all you do in this game.But the reason im making it not recommendable is due to it having support from Windows Live, its technically the worst PC Port i have seen in a long time, and this is from Rockstar Games, and somehow they ed it up.Its not even that well optimized, its just a rushed attempt to release it on PC, people waited 8 months for the worst PC Port ever, i mean even look at other reviewers even the PC Port Reviewers themselves.Now if there is anything good about this game it is the Modding community, it has one of the biggest out there and well thats the only reason i would recommend this game. Sadly i would say its better to buy GTA Vice City, GTA San Andreas, hell even GTA III.GTA IV gets a 5/10. Could be higher and even recommendable if it wasnt for the poor PC Port and lack of change from GTA SA, even going backwards to GTA III like gameplay.
