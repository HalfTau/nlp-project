I played this game on console and I enjoyed my time with it.however.. the PC version has GFWL..you cant save without logging in and since GFWL is no more, your sort of boned.do NOT buy it on PC!if you havent played it yet buy it on console.I reccomend it on console, but will give it a no since were talking PC port here on steam.
