I loved this game. I bought it and played for a long time. But then, when I tried to save, the infamous windows live showed up. I knew that was the end of the game. because when that pops up. You cant make an account. or login. So thus came the problem of every time I open the game I restart. So, thus, its is pointless to buy this unless you are a wizard with the capabilities of logging into a live account. Dont buy it.
