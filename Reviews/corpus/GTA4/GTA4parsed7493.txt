The characters, the story, the city, the everything etc. etc. is awesome, but theres a bug with Social Club when I want to sign in it doesnt let me play, unless I restart the game several times. BUT THAT WONT MAKE ME SAY NO TO THE GAME. The game is awesome and thats what those revews should say. If the game is unplayable, then its a problem. But the game is great!
