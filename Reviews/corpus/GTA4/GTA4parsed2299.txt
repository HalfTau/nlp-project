OpenIV getting CDd aside, I would recommend buying this game on sale to revisit the amazing story. GTA IVs story is a lot more personal and features a lot of great characters imo better than V, but thats subjective. Driving physics are way better than GTA V and feel more realistic. Comparing the game to other installments in the franchise, there are less open world activities to do than GTA V or San Andreas, but you can still go around and explore the really well designed map of Liberty City.Dont expect to run this game at constant 60 fps with whatever configuration you have. For a 9year old game, the optimization is terrible. Even with NVIDIA 10series GTX cards you will still encounter framedrops. The game is dated and so are the graphics, but its not unplayable. On max settings, the game looks OK, but lacks antialiasing can be fixed with ENBseries. Most of these problems can be fixed with mods, but that will require you to downgrade the game from 1.0.8.0 to 1.0.7.0, since a lot of these mods are not being updated anymore.
