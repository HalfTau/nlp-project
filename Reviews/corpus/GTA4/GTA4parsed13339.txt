Im not sure why so many people are having problems with gfwl? i made an account and hopped right into gta 4, ive been driving around in modded cars all day. this game is awesome, if you have any desire to drive around/drift around in jdm cars like the nissan s13 or skyline then i would definitely recommend buying this and modding it. 10/10 would drift again and will
