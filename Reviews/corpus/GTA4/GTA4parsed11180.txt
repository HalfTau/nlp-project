GG No re  YOU MICROSOFT AND ROCKSTAR!! !ok...im normally a calm individual but after 3 god forsaken hours of trying to get this game to launch let alone play im done. ive lost all hope of maybe microsofts games for windows live was dead. its very ing promonet here. how much you say? WELL enough for this to not only not LAUNCH without it, you cannot SAVE PROGRESS without it. meaning sell your soul. if this was just a need to play online id understand but its not. the play offline mode is a complete lie and the steam page didnt GFWL DRM is there...get the holy water and buy this amazingpile on console. your safe there
