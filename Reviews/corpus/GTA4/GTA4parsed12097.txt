Im tired for the lack luster versions of PC, infact my game doesnt even work. Windows live is stupid, Social Cub is stupid, nd the ing ystem in which you cant change the fcking graphic settings is stupid. I spent an hour trying to get the ing game to LAUNCH, and then once I did it cant even load the world map! I sent numerous reports to Rockstar, and they refused to help me saying I BROKE THERE FCKING GAME. So  you Rockstar,  you!
