If youre familiar with GTA, youll already know the gist. The first GTA game to attempt to bring a gritty sort of realism to the series, which is both a good thing and bad.Good Great graphics. Very good sound and ambiance. More realistic people on the street and police behavior. The game feels very polished and well thought out. Small details make the game very enjoyable.Bad The most polarizing issue, which most people consider bad and so do I is the vehicle controls. It feels like your steering just has no effect beyond about a 20 degree angle turning left or right. In order to turn, you have to slow WAY down, then steer. And if you mess it up, youre going to spin out...every time. This behavior almost seems less realistic than previous GTA games, but regardless of that, makes driving extremely frustrating. Overall, like most of the previous GTA games, this game is a lot of fun, but it definitely feels like a step down in pure fun and features from the amazing GTA San Andreas, which has only recently been topped by GTA V, which is just freaking amazing.One very standout GOOD thing about this game is that it is apparently very moddable. I personally have not done that, but options are good. Overall Great game, get it when its in a cheap bundle.
