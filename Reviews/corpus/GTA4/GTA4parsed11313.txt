After having spent a few hours playing Rough estimate half hour singleplayer, 3h30m multi with friends The game is still runnable, as opposed to the reviews about the Games for Windows Live program not working anymore.One thing to note, though, is that when I installed the game it didnt install the aforementioned program, which I believe it was suppose to. Easy fix, though, is by looking it up and downloading it from the xbox site. Dont launch it when its finished installing, just launch the game and it should work from thereSo far, one thing that is kind of annoying, but also at times humoring, that Ive found would be the Such as youre driving 50mph down a road all of a sudden you see a guy end up above you because he spawned right in front of you..Another issue, or to me atleast, is..its nothing like, say, Battlefield 4 or Just Cause 2 Helicopters where they are easy to control or somewhat easy to use for firsttimers.May have ran into a hacker or two, but when youre in a lobby/game w/ friends easily remedied with a kick.Some others that I play with, though, also reported having crashing issues.That aside  Having a fun time playing so far.If I run into anything more might edit this.. if I remember to.
