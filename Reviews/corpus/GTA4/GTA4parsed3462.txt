That game was thewhen it was new. But recently I played it again and it was Too many unnecessary side quest, too many bugs that were never fixed. Saving points always set in a way to annoy theout of you. You always have to drive somewhere, but then leave your car behind. So if it was a nice or even unique one, well, dont get to attached to something. Enemies spawning literally in your face. And dont even think they fixed the major bug in the disproportional hardcore end fight. They didnt. Just not.Oh, and my windows crashed 2 times during playing this game, I never saw the windows 10 bluescreen before. Just saying. No optimisation for the pc. Still installing the dead windows live no back up of save games.The games flaws were more obvious to me because i played Mafia 2 before, I hated that too for other reasons, telling myself over and over again what was better in GTAIV. But now I played that piece ofand I cannot recall which one I hate more. Probs GTA, because it did not let me finish the game. So much hate, wow. Totally blue balled by Rockstar.
