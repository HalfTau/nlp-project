Currently, a very bad bug is stopping me from playing, and it must be recent, because before I was able to play normally. Anyway, I go to start up the game and I cant because it gives me just a black screen and sorta freezes my computer. Then I have to start task manager and kill it. It is a shame, because I use to really enjoy playing the game.
