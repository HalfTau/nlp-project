I bought the game and at the start it was fine, but when I got to Nikos house it told me to save the game by sleeping. I slept but all I got was a black screen, he didnt wake up and the game would not come back on. I really think its a waste of money. Luckily I didnt send too much time on the game trying to fix it I was able to get my refund and all money back. Thank you for reading this post and I hope this helped you. Enjoy shopping and buying something else other than this waste of money and time.
