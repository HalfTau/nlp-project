I was really excited to get this game i spent like 4 hours waiting for it to download and once it was finished it asked me to join the social club so i made an acount tried running it wouldnt work i tried typing in my password differently so many times i knew it wasnt wrong so i tried running it online it began to work it woudnt let me save until i signed into windows live so i tried doing that it asked for the game code i typed it in it said it was wrong so on top of waiting 4 hours to download it took me another 3 hours to try figuring it out luckily i was abe to refund it dont make the same mistake as i did purchasig this game.
