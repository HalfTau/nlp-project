This game is the best GTA game out. It is much more immersive that GTA V, in every way. The physics are better, the cars are more modest, the gunplay is better, the story is better, it is just a better game tha 5. They took the new game and dumbed it down to the point where it just isnt as fun if you are a more mature gamer. The new game is just boring, cars are too easy to drive, the characters arent as good, the guns are flat and unexciting, and the worst part is, its the same damn engine. They had to actively remove stuff, and thats what they chose to do. This game is better, cheaper, and a whole lot less glitchy. The only downside to this game is all of the setup crap related to Rockstar and Microsoft. But dont let that keep you from getting this game.
