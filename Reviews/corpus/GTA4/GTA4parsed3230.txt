Great game but no you cannot save the game, if Microsoft Live doesnt support you country, Sounds bit like a fraud in this sense. You buy a game, but then you realize, Microsoft Live is not supported in your country. This warning should be when you actually BUY the game, because you can throw money for nothing.I could create account and lie about my country in the form, but this is fraud itself.I dont get what to support. Its like when youve sent email to person XY and it says  Sorry you cannot write this person, because he is in another country. On the internet, actually! D Some managers of game companies must be totally insane.Can Steam create some save game cloud or force developers with at least offline savegame possiblity, so this madness will not occur in the future? Linking with the steam account wouild be great.On other note.. the game feels fine inside VR googles.. not many full games for VR now, but when you play through Vorpx, you can have VR experience on good old games. Not many VR car driving games.. so this feeling, like actual city, where you go into burger king and buy i burger, if you see burger fast food in the distance, is great. The same for folk in the streets. Good illusion of a real city.Only criticism goes for LIVE from Microsoft.Not only its so picky about countries.. it also seems buggy. I dont get, how people can play XBOX, which is sold in this country, if there is this issue. Ive seen instructions on the internet, that you should pick different couintry, when you register. Kafka game.
