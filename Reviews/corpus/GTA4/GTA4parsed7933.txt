This game is a complete waste of money and effort to get it working on a Windows 7 64 Bit system it requires the resources of a small planet to attempt to run it!! we have an i7 processor overclocked to 4.2 Ghz and a ATI Radeon HD7970 3GB graphics card the resolution is locked to 800600 I am fully aware that the graphics card exceeds the 2GB of memory so why sell this game on steam? very few people actually run Windows Vista / Xp? strangely enough I have this game for the XBox 360 and it runs without any problems!!Tried searching all over the internet reading endless problems to why this does not work on Windows 7 no one appears to have an acceptable answer  DO NOT BUY!! seems to be the common denominator!!If you want to spend hours  hours trying to get this game working on your PC buy it!! we lost the overclocked profile on our PC with countless hours trying to get this to work!! and the rockstar social club popping up all the time!! for an easy life just buy an XBox 360 and avoid the drama!! the end game over!!
