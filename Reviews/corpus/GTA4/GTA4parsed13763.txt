The game itself is good, however, getting it to work under win 8.1 sucks . . . Like really, how hard is it to release a game that work without hundreds of people having to drain their brains to get it going ? ! This is bad Rockstar and Steam , You gotta pull Yourselves together people ! Seriously disappointed .
