7/10Grand Theft Auto IV is a game that revolutionized Grand Theft Auto series in terms of graphics and gameplay features. This is one of my favorite games in series, just because it made a huge difference from the previous games in series, it has great story, excellent characters, Niko is simply amazing, and fits perfectly in everything, cousin Roman and his bowling calls  AMAZING! If youre looking for game and want to spend money but want it to last at least 5060 hours this one is for you, I didnt finish it on steam just because I finished it before, so thats the reason I got only under 20 hours ingame. So to conclude its not a perfect classic like GTA San Andreas, nor GTA III but its really worth playing. Do I recommend this game? Yes, its worth the money, but Id really like to recommend you waiting for the sale and get it then, since steam charges a lot for such an old game, yes its still great to this day but its little bit too much, so wait for sale.Now to the bad side, this game really suffers from opimization issues, youll get frame drops every once in a while, even the most powerful PCs are struggling from these issues, because it simply wont utilize grahics card power at all, once it does your game is over 100FPS if you have a decent graphics card, but most of the time youll be stuck around 4060 FPS which isnt as great as constant 60 or 6080 FPS, its not due to PC specs, its simply due to optimization issues, before it got udpated to 1,0,4,0 back in the day it was even worse, frame drops on Windows Vista and Windows 7 systems were pain in the a. So, this is a great game in general, but it lacks from optimization and technical issues.
