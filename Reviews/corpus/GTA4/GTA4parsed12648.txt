I got this game as a gift from of my friends. Mainly so we can  around in multiplayer. While he was afk, Id thought Id set up the game. It took me and my friend about an hour to get through the terrible windows live system the game has. Even after that the game crashes before the first mission even ends. So my friend wasted five bucks, and I wasted about an hour of my time Lets just hope GTA V Wont beon PC
