lol bowling simulator 9/2137Ok, getting over the bowling jokes, this game is truly an masterpeace. The dark and moody style and story Rockstar went for this game has... really bloody paid off. Our main hero or  antihero  cause its really in between, Niko Bellic, an emigrant from Europe just arrived at the Liberty City  the city of infinite choices, the city of hot women with big breasts and womens, that suck like a vaccum... at least, thats what your cousin Roman has told you. To be fair  city is an   graphicly and mentaly. The game hasnt aged too well, but at some places in this game, this really adds its charm. The ruined cartels, the shiny centrum of the city, still working factories, when they shouldnt, this really isnt Vice City or San Andreas. Going back to the story  our wacky adventures of Niko and Roman Spoiler Alert push our main protagonist in the criminal world AND... wont gonna spoil it for ya. The shooting system in this is a bloody miracle for maniacs like me  NPCs after getting shot sometimes will live and try escape from the battle ground, random passerby trying to stop the car, thats slowly pushing them foward  its a lot of fun. But  not everything is sunshine and rainbows. Driving system is really mine opinion driving nuts over time, and not in good way. Kinda weak moral choices, and bad in some cases character development really stands out.BUT, overall, i really bloody liked this game. If you werent playing this before how, just how, just get it and dont get spoiled.
