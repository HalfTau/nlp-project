I Recommend playing this to all who like open world games with action/and humor!The main character NIKO has a real dilemma when his cousin picks him up from the Docks, but nevertheless the story has depth..Because Niko is good at making BAD choices,whilest shooting trough the streets off Liberty City...No other game has These Radio Stations Tunes,good mix off hard shootouts and Fun all together...The guys from rockstar games know how to make a game worth playing!Especially when you can MOD it now and make it look like the next Chapter!Its a bit off a Drag Modding, but when you complete it, youll have a grogeous picture!
