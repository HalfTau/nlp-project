I would definitely NOT recommend it to any GTA fan. It is a huge disappointment after San Andreas.Main story is dull. The only motivation our Niko Bellic gets to complete a mission  I need money. Thats it. And ok, that could work if only there was anything to spend those money on. But alas unlike GTA SA there are no businesses to buy in GTA IV, not even safehouses  theyre earned through missions. It gets ridiculous by the middle of the game, when you have over 100,000 cash with full ammo on all weapons and every piece of clothing and our hero accepts little nothing for 3,000 saying Ill do it if it the pay is good. There are some interesting realistic background stories though, just not about the guy were controlling.Also the game is plagued by graphic engine. While using video memory as currency to spend on graphic options might seem interesting it introduces more issues than it solves. For me it was locked at lowest quality and resolution because it somehow calculated that 202 MB used is more than 4096 MB available and required a little hack to get out. And there are many more issues, see for yourself in discussions.It also requires you to register on Games for Windows to save your progress in single player, and one more account on rockstar social club for multiplayer. A bit annoying compared to how easy it usually is to get other games on steam working.In the end Id give it about 4/10. Its a pretty basic 3rdperson shooter with some driving arcade and ridiculous Ill do it for 100 story cutscenes.
