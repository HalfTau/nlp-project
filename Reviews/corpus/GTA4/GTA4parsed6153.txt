BeforeThis game is amazing! Very good for a throwback! Yes, most of the reviews are talking about why GFWL is Cancer but you can get out of it if you take everything calm. It took me almost an hour to get everything, but it was well worth it! The game for my computer has to load up parts in only to get the entire view, but the game is good nonetheless. Some reviews tell you how to escape the GFWL Hell, but I didnt do that, and it runs smoothly. This was just ported badly. Buy the game when a sales up, but thats it.AfterThis game is amazing! Very good for a throwback! There seems to be no more GFWL stuff to play the game. Now with one easy patch, you dont need to stress out! The game is a little more laggy now, but the game is good nonetheless. Some reviews will tell you how to update the game,and I did that, and it runs smoothly. This is now an excellent port! This is now worth your 20 bucks!
