So TakeTwo/Rockstar want to ban Open IV. I dont own GTA V on steam so i cant review it but im leaving this here. So on behalf of all my friends who play your games,  you! Ive spent over 250 on the GTA series and i sinscerly regret that now, i hope they learn a leason from this, the PC community is not to be messed with!
