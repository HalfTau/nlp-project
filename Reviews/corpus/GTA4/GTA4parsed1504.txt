My pc is MORE than capable to run this game. Its basically the worst optimized game Ive ever seen. Cant even get past the loading screens. What awaste of time and money!EDIT I have been trying for 23 hours to fix this issue, followed 4 videos instructions and the best I could do before crashing again was to drive for 2 seconds! DONT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS ROCKSTAR FIXES IT. Almost 50 of all people who have bought this have the same problem!
