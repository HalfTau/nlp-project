I am really frustrated... I just wanted to play this game, but it just will not work. I persevered through the annoying Rockstar Social Club. Then I held through the severely annoying Windows Live account creation and installation and I had to restart my compter several times. So I finish all that. I hit play and it is an infinite loading screen. I just wanted to play....
