I cant even get the game to run past the starting screen. I get to that point, log in to all the accounts Im forced to join you dont have to get forced to sign up for so many acounts for LA Noire, why the change now, Rockstar?, and once all is good, The only thing  heard is the music that plays when maybe the beginning sequence of the game is supposed to be on screen. No luck.The optimization is horrible, to say the least. I dont even know what more to comment on since I dont get that far.
