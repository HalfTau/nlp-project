This is such a great game in the GTA series.  It truley redesigned the art style in the series.  Only thing I do not like, is that this game uses NVIDIA technology, and a I happen to have an AMD RX 480, so it runs worse than it should be.  I can not complain too much though, becuase the lowest ive seen it go is 45 FPS and usually hovers around 60 Worse than GTA V.  All in all, a great game, especially if you want a gam to play with friends and cant afford GTA V.
