How about all of you that wont shut up that the game doesnt work for GFWL have a fix hereWhen the game asks you to log in to GFWL, click Create a NEW Account, then look for the link that says create local account.There. Now you can ing save and play multiplayer using LAN so Hamachi or Tunngle works.Now stop giving this good game bad reviews and actually use your brain sometimes instead of ing about it.
