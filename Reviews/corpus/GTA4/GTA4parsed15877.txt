That awkward moment when a pirated version of a game works better then the actaul game. I use to own a pirated version of this game, and hres how I played. Started up the game, loaded up save. Heres how you play with the real version. Start up game, login, hope none of your  xbox live freinds message you dirty console peasants, start up the game, and play. But then guess what? The multiplayer is a thing of dog. Me and my friend can NOT connect to eachother. No matter what we try, we just cant. LAN or LIVE. Doesnt work.
