Cant even UGH ok ok dont get me wrong its not that the game is bad its just there is a glitch that you are going to have to worry about. See bascically half way through the game you encounter a mission witch entitles you to bring a stolen car to a garage here is the problem when driving in and getting out the door closes and you may not leave  YOU ROCKSTAR ugh but if your willing to risk it buy the game.
