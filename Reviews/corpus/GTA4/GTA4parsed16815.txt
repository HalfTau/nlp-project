Grand Theft Auto IV is a great game, but do not buy it on PC. Rockstar has had issues with players being unable to log in to Social Hub, which means you cannot play the game AT ALL. Not even the single player. This has been an issue that has affected PC users for months, yet Rockstar has not done anything to fix it. Instead of fixing the game, they even decided to put it on sale! Until these issues are fixed, do not buy this game!
