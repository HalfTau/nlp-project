Game is literally 100 unplayable since GFWL pooped out.Yay, DRM is the best.Okay, so imagine this.The game will give you a black screen on launch. UNLESS Youre signed in to GFWL. But you cant sign in to GFWL. So the game doesnt launch.You cant play this game. Go find another sandbox game. There are plenty on steam.I paid for this. With money. Thats the equivalent of a car dealership selling you one of their best sellers, and then stalking you to your house to wreck it themselves. And they keep the money too.
