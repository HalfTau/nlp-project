It is very tricky to install this game. You will need a lot of additional accounts rockstar and windows live. You need to install windows live market manually. That thing that installed automatically wont work on windows 8. Initial game graphics setup is awful and doesnt allow to be improved. I found me .exe file in programfilessteamsteamappsgta4gta4launcher.exe made a shortcut and added  the following parameters nomemrestrict norestrictions  to be able to play. Finally I found that xbox360 version is looking better.
