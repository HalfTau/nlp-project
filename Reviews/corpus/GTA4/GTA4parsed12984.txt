I found this game boring, really really boring. To alleviate my boredom I would decide to go on a good old fashioned Grand Theft Auto style rampage, but every time I did anything outside the story line an NPC would call demanding to be social, and if I turned them down my relationship with them would be damaged, I was being punished for not participating in the absolute worst thing that this game has to offer. All I wanted to do was have fun, and the game wouldnt let me without interfering. Sure, the game looked good, and if you can bring yourself to care about the story line then Im sure that there is some value in it. But twice Ive tried playing through this game, the second time because my save files randomly got wiped, and twice Ive just ended up frustrated and bored, so very very bored.
