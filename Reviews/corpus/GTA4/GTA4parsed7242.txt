Im sure the game is fine, but it doesnt run on newer devices. If you want to sell an old game on steam, it needs to be able to run on a new machine. I know windows 10 is new, but games for windows live IS dead. It doesnt work on the new OS. I shouldnt need to switch operating systems just to play a game that the publisher couldnt be bothered to port properly.On top of that, even then the game asks you to sign in to Rockstars own little online account clubhouse. If you try to, it says authentification error no matter HOW many times you try. I made a new account and it still didnt let me. If you hit Play offline the game just minimizes, runs for a moment and kills itself. Man, that sure was worth the purchase.In short, dont buy if youre using a machine made in the last two years.
