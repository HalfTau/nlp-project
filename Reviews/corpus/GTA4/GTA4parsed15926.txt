Its a really pain to setup this game. When I first started the game it said that I had to manually enter the code....I was ok with that. But then I had to enter two codes but I was given one. After 30 minutes of research turns out I have to generate the second code from a website. So i entered the two codes hoping that I can play the game now. But it now said i need a rock star account to play. So I spent 10 minutes setting up my account. Then i pressed play but THE GAME WONT START!!. now I was So another 30 minutes of research I found out I need to download some windows program to play this game and I need a live account. So after setting up that the game finally worked.  Never in my life did i have go through this much trouble to set up a game.
