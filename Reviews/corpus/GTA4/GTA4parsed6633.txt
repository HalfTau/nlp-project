NOTE I have changed opinions on the game, please read the update below to find why.Yes, I highly wish I could recommend Grand Theft Auto IV. I just cant however. I love GTA IV but there are lots of issues that make this game literally unplayable and nonenjoyable. The game wont launch on startup without installing a fix. I cry. The social club for GTA IV has dropped, and theres literally no more support. Terribly optimized. Expect to only get 10 FPS on a lowend computer.I love this game, I really do, but if you want to play GTA IV, I highly recommend that you dont buy the PC version and get the console version instead. Therell be less problems when you get the console version and you can get a more stable FPS.UPDATE When it may be the worst port of all time, Grand Theft Auto IV is still plenty of fun. It has everything a GTA game should have, and Ill tell you, its really awesome. You no longer have to install a fix, and the framerate has improved a bit.
