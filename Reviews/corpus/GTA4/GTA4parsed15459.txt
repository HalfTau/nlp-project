I have tried to play this game multiple times. It doesnt work on Windows 8 or older!!! The time I have played the game, I have actually tried to log into Windows live, which you will have to download if you want to play this game. I have looked up muktiple ways of fixing the problem with opening this game and actually getting to play it. Now I have many apps, which I dont need and dont work. If you are planning on running this on Windows 8 or older excluding the pro versions, which seem to work just fine, do not buy this! For me, this is 20 bucks wasted!
