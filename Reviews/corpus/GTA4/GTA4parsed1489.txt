I have to say, I was really disappionted with this game. Its my first GTA game, but by no means is it my first exposure to the series. Ive been watching videos on the games specifically 5 for years. I went into this game expecting an open world where I could fairly quickly go off and do whatever I wanted with the world. Instead, I got some really terrible missions, absolutely atrocious vehicle handling, and after several hours in the game, it still hasnt properly opened up. Ive hit a mission where because of the terrible vehicle handling, I simply cannot get past it, no matter how much I try. Im not sure whether or not Ill return to the game in the future.
