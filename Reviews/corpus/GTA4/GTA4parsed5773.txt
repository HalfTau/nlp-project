My review for this game is the steps i had to take to get the game working. First i booted the game and it did not work I then downloaded game for windows live and insatlled it The actuall booted but with all of the graphics settings locked to the lowest possible settings I then used an online guide and created a txt file and usedthe advanced boot options and got the game to the desired settings I then played the prologue mission and the game then told me that i had to log into games for windows live or i could not save my game After signing into games for windows live for a second time the game prompted me for my product code which i then entered The game then said games for windows live had to update this is after i just downloaded the latest version from microsoft The game then creahsed twice After this i gave the game one last chance an the game finally worked surpriseinglystill works better than no mans sky10/10
