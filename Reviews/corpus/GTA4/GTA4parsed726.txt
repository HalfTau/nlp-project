Great game, played it years ago on PS3 and wanted to play though it again for nostalgia, but unfortunately the PC port is so badly optimized its unreal.To put it into perspective i can play GTA5 on high settings but I cant play this on low settings with a playable framerate.I guess you can try it and if it doesnt work for you then make sure you dont hit 2 hours playtime and get a refund.
