The game is excellent with a few exceptions. The first is that it runs like absolute garbage on every system. Probably the worst port Ive ever been subjected to. The second is with the tone of the game. It feels like the game takes itself so extremely seriously that it collides with the ballsout satire signature of the GTA series. One minute youre hearing about how Niko was a war criminal who did unspeakable things and saw children with their hands cut off and throats slit and the next youre going to an internet cafe called Tw. Other than those two things I enjoy the hell out of it.
