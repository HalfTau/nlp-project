this game is horrible and i dint even play. i cant play it. this is just a waste of time to buy becuase of the stupid windows live i press play then the activication code window comes up then after that the rickstar account window pops up so i create an account then when i press play nothing happens. then when i redo do it and press play offline still nothing happens. then when i looked at the reviews about windows live people had the same problem. so then i whent to the system requirements and i still cant play it. then when i try to play offline it just goes to the intro and you cant do anything because it always gets stuck on the ing intro. so then i find out that windows live is just something from the xbox. so i go on my xbox and sign in to my account then when i try to play the game on my pc i find out it expired. so now i gotta get more money for a card just so i can play a game that cost me half my steam wallet. dont get this game until at least the offline button works or it stop getting stuck on the loading page.updated ok so i originally couldnt play this game but i few months later i decided to see if it would work and it finally did. this is a great game and i happy i finally get to play it because i waited forever to get thid game to work. the only thing i dont likw in my opinion is the atmosphere only because it seems to always be cloudy or raining most of the time. otherwise its a really good game for the pc and im still trying to get money for gta5 so i can play that one too.i also have two questions about this game 1. how do you play multiplayer because i somehow cant get it to work. 2. how do you download the mods for this game.rate this 9/10 D
