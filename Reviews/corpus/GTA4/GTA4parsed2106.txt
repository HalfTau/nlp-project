Ignore the negative reviews from Open IV being taken away, which is also now back. This is one of my favorite games of all time and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the gta series. Performance and bad optimization are frequently complained about but with most modern PCs or simply lowering some settings. This game is easily capable of running.10/10, Would go bowling again.
