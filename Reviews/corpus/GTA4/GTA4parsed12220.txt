I had originally played GTA4 when it was released on the XBox 360, and it surprised me.The GTA series, starting from GTA3 probably made the whole idea of a sandbox game mainstream. From there, various iterations of GTA have since been released, and each one has been praised by critics all around... I didnt really like any of them!However, GTA4s main character, Niko Bellic, is a genuinely likeable one. Just this fact alone changes the whole tone of the game, and makes Liberty City a welcome place to explore. This Liberty City is bigger and better than before, with more things to do.The porting job from console to PC was a bad one, however. Even with a high end machine, its like the game was just designed to be locked in at 30 FPS and while it doesnt break the game, it makes it feel a bit more sluggish than it should be. On the plus side, with the addition to the ICEMOD, this game looks fantastic. As of 2015, this game looks spectacular even by todays standards, and makes the world even more immersive.7/10 Good
