Buy a game from Steam, spend 1 hour setting it up because of Rockstar and Windows, get in, play a mission then spend 2 hours on forums trying to fix drunken camera effect. Fixed it, play a couple more mission, buy a new computer, install the game, log in Windows something, rockstart something else and SURPRISE your progress is gone.. Guess if you are not a hardcore fan the game is really not worth the hustle.
