The controls are awful and it doesnt run very well. My PC is definitely strong enough to handle it but its optimized so poorly. The controls suck Maybe because i like GTA Vs so much and its just overall not fun. I managed to install a couple of mods to try it make it better but nothing worked. If you want to play a GTA game, go with GTA V over this.
