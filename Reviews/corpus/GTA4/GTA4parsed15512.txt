If you can handle, doing alot of garbage, JUST TO PLAY THE GAME...then you should buy it.. however, you better do some researching if you do buy the game, cause it has alot of problems. espescially, for pc.Now that that is settled, Gta IV is a really fun game. It does what every gta does, however this one has an amazing storyline about a guy name Niko who was in the military to move in with his cousin to America looking to start over. However , come on.. this is GTA, YOULL ALWAYS GET INTOEVERYWHERE. if i had to rate it.. id give 8.5.. 10/10 if they release like a patch for the games glitch.feel free to tell rockstars in a Niko Bellic voice Screw you for not patching the game P.
