Poorly optimised for PC. Ive been able to bypass the Social Club login issue and thought Hurray! I can finally play. But no, sadly windows live for games had different ideas. I just get stuck on the signing in screen, then when I try to shut the game down it crashes and wont go away. I am literally at my wits end with this.You can decide to play the game without logging on to live BUT it comes with a catch, you either sit there and play from beginning to end as it wont save it OR keep your PC on and play nothing else until finished. Absolutetake.If I cant sort it by the end of the day, I will be getting my money back...
