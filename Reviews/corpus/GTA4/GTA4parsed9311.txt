Now, I wouldve recommended this game had it not been for that fact that not only in the past has GFWL been a pain in theto use before, but now it has decided to completely  itself, because whenever you try to sign into to your GFWL profile, itll give you an error saying you have a network error or the GFWL ID service is unavailable. This has been going on for several months now, and had it not been for this one little  up GFWL had, I wouldnt be writing this review. Also the game requires extra work to get it to even start, so thats another reason to forget aobut this game on PC. Shame, this game has some pretty amazing mods. Until rockstar decides to get rid of GFWL which I highly doubt they will or GFWL decides to fix itself which it wont I highly discourage you from buying this game, atleast on PC.RECENTLY The game has been in up bad lately, my friend cant start up the game, it ask him for his serial number when hes already used it kinda like how Rainbowsix siege ask me for my product key when Ive already used it after its most recent update. you Ubisoft. and Niko, the minimap, the pause menu map are invisible. Rockstar fix yourgoddamnit it. This is why I dont like Rockstar much anymore.
