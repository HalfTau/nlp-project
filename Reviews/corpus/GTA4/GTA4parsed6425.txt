Before you buy this game, Heres somethings you need to know.1, You need to install Windows Live and forced to create a Microsoft account, Even if you want to play the signle player campaign.2, You need a Rockstar Social Club account to play multiplayer, Which btw is broken nearly half of the time you will get Social Club login failed,Please try again which when you pray to god that it will work.3, This PC port doesnt work on Windows 8 and Windows 10 but dont worry Rockstar realised this and made a guide on how to solve this problem.4, If you have a bad computer dont waste yout money on this, My desktop computer is a GX but it runs on a solid 15 fp on High quality, Make sure to degrade your game as much as possible, but you cant play Multiplayer once you downgrade it.Overall this is a good game but these errors really would make living hell.
