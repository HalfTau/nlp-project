Ooh. I love this masterpice. Nico Bellic for president.! I rank GTA 4 as the best game ever in my profile info.R did a great job here. I hate that they took away the car physics and handling and made GTA 5 much worse. Do like the Mafia series and put an option for car handling Arcade or Simulation. In the single player experience it works.The dark story of Nico Bellic is very well written.Story goes even darker into the abyss in a good way with the Episodes From Liberty City, the 2 DLC expansions where you play as Johnny Klebitz, the biker and vice president of the criminal gang the Lost. And the other DLC is called The Ballad of Gay Tony where you play as the bodygard Luis Lopez. These extra campains complement the main game GTA 4 so, so great. This is a true masterpice work from R... Get it./Score 10/10
