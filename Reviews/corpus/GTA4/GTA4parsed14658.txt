Having never played a GTA game before this, there is so much hype with the GTA series, but I dont know about 4 specifically.I feel that the game had way too long of a ramp up. The game started to become great after about 3/5th of the way of the 30 hr playthough. Until then it felt like a bunch of bch work, driving a realistic car where drift wasnt drifting it was like driving horizontally into a side of a wall. All other than a single mission Gracie Mission I thought it was not as controvertial as the media claims it to be. The story after that 3/5ths moment became very good.The most frustrating part definitely had to be when you failed a mission because when you do, you have to drive from the activation of the mission across the entire world to die again, lose money, then do it over again.Overall I would give the game a 6/10 and I wouldnt tell you to buy it but at the same time I wouldnt dissuade you from buying it either.
