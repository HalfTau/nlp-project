Its still a pretty fun game/DLCs, but it really doesnt age well. The DRM is a bit of a . You have to put up with Rockstar Social Club deciding to work when it wants to, and then hope that GFWL doesnt eat your key and screw with you only after spending an hour picking a name that isnt complete garbage, since most are taken.Basically, its old, clunky, and ugly, but still fun. If you can stomache it, Id recommend it.
