I have not played GTAIV on PC before, because back when it was initially released it was so horrendously unoptimized you couldnt even joke about it.Nothing has changed.This is a shameful mess of a game, so extremely badly ported it makes me want to cry.You cant log in to Social most of the timeRockstar Social uses a heavily outdated version, for whatever reasonIt uses the unholy GFWL, stillCrashes and freezes galoreLocks your graphical settings to lowest possible if your GPU is too strong not  you, there is a community fix thoNo AA, at allRuns like even on my 970 FTW editionThe mouse is choppy and awkward all the timeUsing steam overlay is prone to cause the game to lock up, or simply not let you exit the overlayMay lock up your entire computer randomly upon booting, forcing you to restart you cant even kill the process manuallyThis is from just, like, an hour of playing the game, too.Its still fun to play a game I spent countless hours on many years ago at launch with the 360, but god damn it Rockstar, how can you mess up a port this badly?If you plan to buy this game on PC, prepare to jump through some hoops and facepalm at GFWL, among other things, a lot.
