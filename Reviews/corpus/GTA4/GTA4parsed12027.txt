I dont understand everyone complaining about GFWL. I was able to get the game to launch with only a few minutes of my time to update GFWL to the latest version after the first initial launch. Downloaded directly from microsoft, installed, updated, installed updates to the game itself, then the game and GFWL and any other games that use GFWL run flawlessly without issue.Moving on, this game is a definite musthave for any fan of the GTA franchise. Modding it is only a plus on an otherwise perfectly working port of the game. The only gripe I have about it is that even with a 4 GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 770 utilizing 3 GB of VRAM I was still experiencing some framerate issues. Nothing that would make the game unplayable, but sometimes dipping as low as 25 FPS.Overall Id highly recommend this game. Just take some time to step back and research and fix your problems before you bash something that otherwise is perfectly fine.I have no comments for the Social Club thingy because all I did was create an account and click play and it works without issue... so... I guess Im just lucky or something.
