if it doesnt start, look at the forums. the first sticky is probably going to help you a lot.if it does start first thing you have to do is disable the handbrake camera. it will make the driving a lot easier. i dont know who designed that but doing a full 360 around the car every time i want to take a sharp left or right turn is not doing wonders for my driving.after all that, enjoy one of the best games in the gta series.
