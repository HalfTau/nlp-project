You cannot get the game running without looking into making it work. After you get it running, it doesnt let you change your graphics settings. Once you look into making that work, the game starts with a drive to your first mission.Camera. Does. Not. Follow. The. Car.And then Microsoft has the audacity to tell you its time to save, but you cant save without a Microsoft Live account!Dont waste your time and money.
