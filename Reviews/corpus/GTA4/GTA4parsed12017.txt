I cant save my gave because Windows Live wont work. I click on forgot password and it opens an old site that no longer extist so I cant reset the p/w. In game, if I play w/o being signed in, it takes me in an endless loop of telling me I cant save my progess, do I want to sign in, I hit no, if you dont sign you cant save, do you want to sign in.... and on and on and on. I try signing in just using my hotmail sign in and it keeps using my old Windows Live account that I cant access because theres no where to change the p/w. Ive had it.
