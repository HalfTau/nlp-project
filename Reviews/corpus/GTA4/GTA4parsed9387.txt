So before you all start this review is based on the Experience of starting up the game. Not the actual Game play experience  I had it on xbox 360 the game was ok obviously no where near as good as GTA5 . Now for some stupid reason i decided to buy this game on PC to see what it was like compared to GTA5 on pc and to see the mods. I havent actually got to that stage yet because Windows tried to tell me something like Windows games does not like this app Something like that anyway Basically being ing awkward which wasnt very unsual for windows. The next Point of  was the Fact that Social Club would not let me sign in. I know the log in works because it works on GTA5 Online and Rockstar Website. I generally think its because Rockstar have now rejected the game and dont give aabout the Servers. Hopefully i can get this came working and write a semi good review. and yes im afor buying this.
