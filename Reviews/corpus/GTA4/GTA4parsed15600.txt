DONT BUY!I bought it but cant play it because theres something wrong with windows LIVE online registration process, and if you cant log on to windows LIVE you can play the game BUT YOU CANT SAVE!How could you play a game like this if you cant save?As far as I can tell from all the complaints and comments, Steam is selling a game that they know has major issues and I find that really maddening. I have filed a ticket with support and will have to wait a week or so to see what Steam says, but I imagine they will say the problem is not theirs.My main point is If I have a Steam account and I purchase a game from Steam, I should be able to play that game without signing in to any other intrusive, dictatorial, email demanding websites! If Steam cant get the publishers to strip out this garbage then they shouldnt sell the game to their customers! I mean where is Steams pride?...windows LIVE is their goddamned competition!?!
