Complete crap, i bought it in a package with GTA San Andreas and i tried to start GTA IV and its telling me i need the serial number from the BACK OF THE GAME MANUAL that is not existent because its a digital copy and it didnt send anything to my email either so if youre gonna buy it just buy the actual disk.
