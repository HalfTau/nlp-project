Awesome achievement in open world gaming. Liberty City is as much a character than Nico Bellic. The primary story is very enjoyable even after multiple play throughs. Of the DLC I prefer The Ballad of Gay Tony TBOGT much more than The Lost and Damned but TLAD is certainly worth playing. Add in a huge mod scene want to fly around Liberty City as Iron Man? Already done... p  its a title that is well worth the money.
