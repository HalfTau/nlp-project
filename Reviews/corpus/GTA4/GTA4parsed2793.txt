Please do not buy this game. The producer, Take two, has banned single player mods and LIED that it is because of multi player which is false. TAKE TWO want you to play multi player and pay for micro transactions. MODS PREVENT you from going into multiplayer and this is just another huge corporation using the horribly flawed DMCA to stifle innovation. It seems my review is getting deleted so hmm.The reason this is such a problem stems down to the way this game was made and how it connected to other players. There is no central server or sets of servers. The game runs its multi player service like BitTorrent so their security sucks. This is why they are suing or threatened to sue single player mods because their system is not robust enough to prevent Hacking. The main issue is that the hackers are not using the legit mods and banning legit mods will do nothing to stop the hackers because THEY DONT NEED THE MODS.The game is ok. Not worth the60 that you would pay for a brand new game. It is 3 years old and it was fun playing single player with mods. Honestly single player without mods sucks.Multi player, this game sucks. It takes about 45 minutes per loading screen on a i72600k with a gtx 970 with everything on a solid state drive. FIVE MINUTES???? Then 45 minutes between matches or races and so much LAG.
