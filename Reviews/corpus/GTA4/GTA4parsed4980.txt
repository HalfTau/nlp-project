As frustrating as it is to get past Social Club login, Games for Windows Live, and the numerous bugs and issues with the PC port of Grand Theft Auto IV, this game is still so much fun to play. The single player story is engaging and exciting and the extra content of Episodes from Liberty City is just as good as the main story. Even when not completing missions, I find myself, like many others, roaming the city just for fun. No, the graphics arent exactly a huge improvement from the console version of this game, but I dont think that really matters too much in this case. The likeable characters, the open world of Liberty City, the enjoyment to be had from being a courteous citizen or a wild rebel on the streets makes it all worth it in the end. If youre interested in playing multiplayer, I would not recommend that you purchase this as Rockstar Social Club has enormous issues with connectivity and most likely will not allow you to connect to any multiplayer match. If youre looking for a storyrich singleplayer game with hours of fun to be had I would heartily suggest you purchase Grand Theft Auto IV.
