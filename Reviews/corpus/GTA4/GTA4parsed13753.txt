Okay, this ones technically good. if you want a pc version of GTA get this one until GTA V comes out on PC.But if youre gonna get this game, there are countless problems. they are all because of the port.Infinate loading screens, the game closing as soon as you log into social club and the list goes on. You could easily spend 2 hours trying to get the game to simply load. its terrible! Im afraid to say that if you want to play this game, youre probably better off getting it for PS3 or Xbox 360.
