Many people say that this was the worst storyline from all the GTA franchise, but to me it was the most realistic. A european, who comes to America after hearing his cousin promising money, cars, women and a new life realises that America is not that. That the American dream is just a dream. This actually happens to many people who come to America. Also, the game is beautifull graphically and also runs nicely on todays gpus. I would buy this just for the fun in singleplayer and the modding options, sucha s the WatchDogsIV mod or the LCPDFR mod.
