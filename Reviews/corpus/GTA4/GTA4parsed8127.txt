Ive played this game before on console. Its a really good game. I honestly enjoyed it. But on PC you need an activation key to access the ability to save, online, etc. The game does give you a code when you buy it from Steam, but upon entering that code the game says its invalid. There are ways around it, according to the internet, but all or most of them involve using Games for Windows Live, which has been as far as Im aware completely discontinued. There is no way for me to activate my key. Ive even tried contacting Rockstar games support about it, but have recieved no response.Like I said, the game is great. But the inability to play it on PC kind of ruins my experience playing it because...you know....I cant play it.
