Great game if you have a PC that can run it. I did have some trouble getting this to run on my old PC, but on my new PC it runs smooth as butter... rough, frozen butter. The framerate can unexpectadly drop to 20 FPS from 50 fps. I did have to download something called      X l i v e l e s s      to remove the stupid GFWL integration. After all this how can I still recommend it you ask? Well, its fun.
