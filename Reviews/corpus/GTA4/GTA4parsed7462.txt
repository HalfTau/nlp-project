I reccommend the game. Thats not the problem here. The problem is that you need a ton of accounts to even launch the game, and once you get past that, youre hit with what you think is the loading screen. Youd be right in assuming this. You wait for the opening screen to end. Its taking a little longer than expected. You wait a bit longer. Its still not ending. Many hours later and the game still wants you to look at that damn opening screen until you go insane.TLDR the game doesnt work.
