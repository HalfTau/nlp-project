GTA IV is a great game.. It is not GTASA or GTAVC but the over all feel of the game is the same. The missions and game replayability are fantastic. The city is full of life and can be beautiful it its own way. This game is fully modable as well which adds a totally different and unique aspect to GTA! If this game is on sale for less than 10 youre crazy not to buy it!
