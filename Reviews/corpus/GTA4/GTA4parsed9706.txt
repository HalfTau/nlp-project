1. Disregard the people who says you need GFWL to play. You can create an offline account and never need to bother with it again.2. Its like GTASA but with less RPGesque customization, better graphics, more slavic, more actioney and ragdoll physics in all of its hilarity.3. Also doubles as a neato bowling simulator.
