Works great on win 8.1 as long as you install microsoft live manually.Downloaded one of those FPS mods and is currently running 60 fps outdoor and 150 fps indoor with i7 4770k gtx780SLI 16gb ram. This is with Nvidia DSR enabled, so playing at 3840 x 2160.Game itself is amazing. My gametime is rather low as of review date as I played through it on xbox so I skipped the fourth instalment and went straight for Episodes. No problems so far after beating Ballad of Gay Tony twice and is currently playing though IV again on PC.Will edit if I somehow cant beat the game because of bad port or wrong OS.
