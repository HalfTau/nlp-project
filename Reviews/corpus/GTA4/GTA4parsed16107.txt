I love this game! I love the interactions with everybody, the flow of the game. Im sure youve already played this game 3 years ago but I only got back into gaming this week! Man I have a ton of games of catch up on, ive already played 14 hours on this one and I wish I had more time to play. Rockstar has really come a long way. Everything is so detail and well thought out. I cant wait for GTA 5 to come out on PC, Ill be buying that one for sure.
