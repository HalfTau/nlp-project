I bought this and had it refunded within hours. I have never had such a frustrating experience with a GTA title. Thats saying a lot because Ive played every title excluding GTA V. This was different though. Other frustrations came from glitches within the game. Anyone else remember the glitch where you had to catch Madd Dogg in the truck before he jumped off the roof in GTA SA? Youre well over the halfway mark at that point when this glitch occurs! To be fair, this glitch only happened if you used certain cheats such as the riot cheat, but we didnt know this at the time. GTA IV, however... I could never even get it to load. I spent HOURS trying to make it play. Youtube videos, Google searches, advice from friends who owned the game, nothing made a difference. I cant even give a review on gameplay. I never got to see any. Im glad I got my refund and Im seriously reconsidering buying GTA V due to the mess that happened and is still happening with GTA IV. There is not a single viable excuse for leaving the game in the condition that it is currently in and should be removed from Steam until it is fixed.
