I love how Im forced to use Games for Windows Live in order to play this. I love how all saves are stored on their servers. Its wonderful to always have to be connected to the internet to play, and even then be unable to keep playing where I left off because something went wrong on their end.Its wonderful having to start over again and again.Seriously, awful decision on Rockstars part. The game is fine  Its not amazing like San Andreas but the issue with save games makes me wish I never bought it. Would not recommend.
