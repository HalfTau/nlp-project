By you making OpenIV illegal you not only are affecting peoples only reason for buying GTA, you are affecting peoples careers and hobbies as well. Without modding the game would simply get boring. Modding keeps the game fresh. Please find a way to allow single player modding without taking down OpenIV. More people are affected by this change then people affected by the so called hackers and harrassment in multiplayer.
