This game is a little slow paced compared to Call of Duty and other FPSs, but this game is by far the best military simulator with extremely large maps and a huge variety of vehicles and weapons to choose from. Singleplayer is not so great but all of the fun and action comes from the coop missions online. You wont get anywhere in this game without an organized team which is one of the many reasons why this game is so fun. Highly recommended. Blows any competition out of the water Op Flashpoint Dragon Rising, CoD, MoH, etc..
