All GTA Titles in the series were great until you ruined it TakeTwo by taking down OpenIV. If you arent able to take care of cheaters and hackers in online mode then dont publish games anymore. You may stopped a few thousand cheaters/hackers but you ruined millions of singleplayer games. Thanks.Never going to buy any of your games anymore.
