Ive played this on PS3 and it was awesome. Probably up on my favorite games of all time. So, here I am on steam now, bought this game to replay it. IT DOES NOT WORK PEOPLE. Dont buy it here. Play it on a console instead. Ive requested a refund. I havent heard from steam support. Hopefully, I do get it cause this was such a waste.. The game is awesome. This file maybe is not.
