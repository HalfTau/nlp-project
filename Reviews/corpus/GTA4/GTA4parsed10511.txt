This console port is buggy with one bug preventing you from even finishing if you have a high spec pc bike jump  to fix use Windows D, then task manager to set affinity to just one processor and crank up the graphics to max.This should be a good game. I was initially taken with the immigrant angle of the plot but it soon became to run of the mill. What is really irritating is the lack of checkpoints on long missions, often leading requiring complete restarts including long pointless repetitive drives across the city often accompanied by repetitive dialogue. This is basic game design flaws and not what I would expect from such an established franchise.That said I completed it because it was good enough to pass the time whilst waiting for the next big game.Overall, I wanted to like this but found it ultimately disappointing. Stick to Saints Row instead who know how to deliver a more satisfying gaming experience.
