You might think that this game is the bees knees, and you would be completely right, If you like to play on a console. After years of playing gta IV on xbox, I finally decided that I would pony up the dough and buy the game for my pc, and a 5 sale price really cought my eye. After a half hour of downloading, I discovered that I would not be able to play the game that I know and love right off the bat. I looked around on the internet to fid some answeres and I finally got it to start up and get to the first loading screen. That was all that I have seen of this pc version so far. I then found out that this game isnt even able to be played on windows 8, the operating system I have on my gamig PC. So I promptly tossed my PC down a stairwell and like a veteran with PTSD, I went back to my old and primative ways of playing on my xbox. Dont get this if you have a PC that is better than a stick of butter.
