No, just no.This game is as broken as a game can be, the same applies to TBOGT.If you want to buy this game, prepare for raging as it will probably crash immediatly on your newish computer.This game can barely stay at a steady 50fps on new laptops running i7s and such.Nearly all stories missions and nearly all sidemissions have you driving/flying/walking somewhere far from the place you are now, then kill someone, then drive back.The games engine is worthless. For instance, when youre entering a building, you will often run into a wall. When you try to turn around, you end up running into the wall just beside the one Niko, or your online character just faceplanted.Although the driving is bad, the flying in this game is hellish. If you do not own a controller, you are pretty much screwed.On an aditional note, the multiplayer is often pretty dead. Expect about five or six servers, two or three of them are freemode, which gets boring very quickly. Since the only difference between it and the normal campaign is that you can freely go to the airport, without ending up with a three of fourstar pursuit.There are some fun moments, especialy in The Ballad of Gay Tony. But in that same game, you have to do the same three sidemissions over for fifty times, just to unlock some weapons at your safehouse. And the rampages tend to get boring as well after youve been in five of them just to pass the time untill you get to the next mission.To conclude, if you have a computer that can in theory run this game, it could still be a terrible experience.In 2014, where there are much more zany games that look better and more importantly, run better.Spare yourself the bs of Games for windows marketplace, the nearly dead multiplayer, the same clich missions, glitches not of the fun sort and bad animations and spend your bucks on something else.
