Rockstar went full rtard by creating a primarily clientside multiplayer game with peertopeer sessions instead of a primarily serverside game. PROTIP 1997 is long, long passed. Rockstar then refused to stop rampant modding in online play that ravaged the player base for more than a year. The situation metastasized to the point that modders took control of the Rockstar servers and backend database, thus making Rockstar the biggest laughing stock of the game development community for all time. Now with the new Gun Gunning DLC, Take Two has decided to declare single player mods illegal, yet online modding still exists. So the good guy singleplayer mod makers are suffering, the players are certainly suffering, but the modders are casually creating new mod menus and will be back to obliterating the online experience in a few days. Take Two and Rockstar walk away with their 3 BILLION in profits. My nightmare vision goggles are working perfectly.
