Absolutely amazing experience. The perfect amount of action, humor, and customization to make  fans of open world games happy. Missions and story are kept interesting, with lots of plot twists. The open world is large with plenty of vehicles and interaction with citizens and also hidden missions when you pass by certain ones. All of the characters have great personalities and make an amazing experience overall.
