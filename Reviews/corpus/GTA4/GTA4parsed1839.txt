Only play this game if you got a powerful PC as this was horribly optimized, and I was lucky to get at least 45 FPS. Its inexcusable on Rockstars part as well as keeping GFWL, though that problem can easily be fixed with a mod. If youre lucky to get at least 60 fps, you will still have a great time playing this game. Amazing story, fantastic graphics and awesome voice acting for characters such as Niko and Roman. The mod support and community for this game is still very strong.
