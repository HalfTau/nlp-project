Niko! Its your cousin! Lets go bowling. But seriously, on to the review.This game is basically a rollercoaster of emotions. Also, its a good bowling simulator if you like those types of games. But seriously, gameplay was great, although a bit laggy, I fixed this problem via lowering my graphics, which didnt bother me. I highly recommend this game. Also, most of the negative reviews are probably Windows 8 users.
