Well, they just f uc ked up the 1 reason these games live way past their prime  customization and fun through modding.Without that, the base games become boring aspretty fast, to various degrees pending play style. No reason to ever return to any of them, at all, without being able to customize them and add variety back into the mix.This was an ignorant move.Sign this petition. Right now its about all that can be done. Truly stupid situation.
