I cant say anything bad aboud the game itself, but the amount of DRM they stuck into the PC version is simply ridiculous. Not one, not two, not three, but FOUR fing layers of DRM Steam, SecuROM, Rockstar Social thingy and GWFL.I played it a quite while ago and now that I decided to play again on another PC, not only my progress is gone which is what Steam supposed to be about but it wont even save my progress without forcing me to sign up for the Rockstar Social t!STAY AWAY
