In order to use any online features which is the only part of the game I am interested in you must also login to Games for Windows Live which you need to install yourself,Rockstars Social Club service. This wouldnt be a problem... except for the fact that the social club has not been working in this game for well over a month now. The game has several layers of DRM that simply do not work.
