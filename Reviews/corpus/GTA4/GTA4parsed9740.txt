GTA IV was a giant leap for the video gaming world. The story, graphics, extras, combat, physics and everything about this game were totally ground breaking. For any fan of shooter games or just a great story in general, I highly recommend this game. This is also the first GTA where you get to easily make major decisions which can change the fate of characters and the outcome of the entire story. GTA IV is an easy 10/10.
