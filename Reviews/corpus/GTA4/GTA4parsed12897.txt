Between the required junkware SecuRom, Games For Windows Live, the semirequired notformeware Rockstar Social Club, and the optimization issues see below and the internet for details, I have to give this otherwise good game a thumbs down.These are my results for two different computers, Your mileage may vary, especially with another OS. These results are with having tried most of the common fixes other than disabling Windows event logger,  at a low resolution, minimal draw distance, minimal shadows, textures, etc, clip recording disabled, using various combinations of the common command line fixes.While a good game in the series, it can be hard to get running well even at minimal settings with a computer far above the system requirements.Win 8.1 x64 Core 2 Duo  3.36, GTX 770, 4GB Ram bogs below 20 fps when moving fast.Win 7 x64 i7  4.2, R9, 8GB Ram mostly holds between 3040, with some significant dips.Bottom line, even especially? modern higher end computers can have trouble with the game and most recent patch, which are often resolvable with enough effort as long as your CPU is an i5 or better. Similar games, Saints Row 3 or 4, Just Cause 2, etc run much better, though with a different tone, of course, and may be a better choice unless you know your configuration can power through the optimization issues.
