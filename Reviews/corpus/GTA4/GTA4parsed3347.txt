Before i start i donno why it sais ive only played 30 minutes..ive spend the past 4 hours in game. Anyway , here it goes.Ive loved San Andreas , i still think its the best gta ever made , i like it more than gta5 or vice city.So i was really happy when gta4 got released , but i was broke af and i could not afford the game. The years have passed , i bought the game but never played it. Why ? Cuz all the ppl who did reviews andwere saying how the game is unplayable , full of bugs , etc.Years have passed and i realised that 99 of the ppl doing reviews have no in ideea wth are they talking about , even so called proreviewrs like gameshop , ign , etc dont know wtf their doing.   giving sniper elite 4 , the last solid snake or MassEffect Andromeda insane grades for no reason...games like those deserve a 4/10 at the most, but thats a different discution So i installed GTA4 today on my old student laptop , an i3 , 12giga ram and a 2gb video card.HAd no problems installing the game , made an offline account and started playing.Turned everything to max and the game runned fine for most part.So all the review calling this game bugged and unplayable are full ofNow, lemme make this short THE BAD  had to modify some .txt. thats not a problem, were pc gamers, we learn to do this from the beginning its a console port  the consoles are the pleague of gaming and it shows  the way your character moves takes a bit of gettin used to it..since the character moves like on a console.you dont have 100 control , you cant stop on a dime  same  control like in the witcher 3  but in i got used to it under one hour, so its more than playablethe car control is kinda shity for the same reason   console port  , but if u learn when to break , and how to use the hand break ull be just fine  ive never ed up a mission cuz of the driving part graphix are a bit.again, console port and old game.but for a real gamer, graphix are not importantTHE GOOD  nice story really fun characters good content good paceing really nice city map epic radio stations good gunplayBottom line is this   the game is more than ok , i give it an 8/10 ! Dont belive the bad reviews.I think ppl who gave bad reviews to this game have no ideea how to use a pc  , or are very young and dont know what to do....stupidity or unexperience..or a mix of those two...
