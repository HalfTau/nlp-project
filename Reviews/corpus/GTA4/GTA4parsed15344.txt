Genuinely a great game. While it may not have an indepth story or HUGE map like San Andreas, it does polish more of the smaller details within the map, and is definitely worth your time and money. Also, if you have a beefy computer, GET. AN. ENB. It turns an already beautiful game into something thats truely outofthisworld.  Granted, having to sign in with a Windows Live account is atrocious, especially for playing singleplayer. The controls are very clunky. However, with a plethora of glitches to try out and a HUGE modding community to tweak the game to your liking, it really is something to buy.TLDR Games pretty, can easily be made prettier. Clunky controls. Pretty decent story. Hilarious glitches. Best played with friends.8/10
