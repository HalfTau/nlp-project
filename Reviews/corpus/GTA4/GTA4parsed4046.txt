Honestly love this game, i have played it xbox so many times and it brings back memories. I recently bought a new gaming pc and wanted to replay gta 4. First i bumped up to all max settings as my pc well surpasses the requirments, the game looked great and hit good frames, but the game stuttered every 10 seconds. I used the auto config and the game looked and ran well but still suffers stutters! Then i went to play online with my friend but apparently to play i need xbox live gold!If you want to play this game online get a ps3 or xbox 360. Atleast on xbox and ps3 its optimised and still plays well.My SpecsIntel Core i34170 3.70 GHz8GB DDR3 RAMNVIDIA Geforce GTX 1050 Ti PALITWindows 8.1 x64
