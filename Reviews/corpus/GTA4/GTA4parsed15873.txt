Do not buy this game. However good you expect it to be, theres a tremendous chance it simply wont work. The forums are full of people whove paid money, cant play the game, and get no support from Rockstar. This is bordering on a scam at this point. The DRM is more extreme than any game Ive every played. It requires games for windows live, which was a bad idea even before it started to get shut down. It uses securom which is famous as one of the worst bits of DRM anywhere. And on top of that its not maintaned or supported to even the most basic level. This was the laziest of ports to start with, and it treates its audience, ironically, as potential criminals. Only buy this if you want to give your money away with little to no chance of getting to play the game itself, especially on windows 8.As to the gameplay, compared to the previous game this is a tedious slog. The best cars handle as well or worse than the worst cars in vice city or san andreas. The story itself is grey, depressing, and lackluster. The missions are so poorly done comedian Dara o Brien even does a bit in his stand up show mocking it. The ending, not to spoil it, is miserable. Just give the entire game a miss and pretend it never happened.
