The grand theft auto experienceI was lucky enough to buy a complete gta pack for 10 usd during sales. Although it didnt had gta 5, I started playing from gta 3 all the way to Vice city, San Andreas then gta 4. Let me tell you,  I was shocked of the improvements made in a short 4 years of time. My friend was even asking if I was playing gta 5 mostly because he lived under a rock. Gameplay and graphics wise, its a great improvement over the past installments. The new cover system, gun play etc. The story was OK to follow, nothing mind blowing but it gets the job of you killing people robbing banks and stealing cars right. The city also feels a lot more alive than previous games.Now for the million dollar question Is this better than gta 5?Answer Yes and No. It depends on your situation, if you have the money, Gta 5 is the next gen experience that is worth your money. However if you are an average working Joe who doesnt want to spend 60 dollars on a game and doesnt have a capable pc to run gta 5, then gta 4 might be perfect for you.P.s. I was able to play this on Windows 8.1,so dont know where the complaints are coming from..  Moving onGiven that the complete gta pack exclude gta von sale is 6 times cheaper than gta v given sales are so few and the price doesnt drop below 60 usd. Whether you want to wait for gta 5 to drop to a reasonable price is up to you.
