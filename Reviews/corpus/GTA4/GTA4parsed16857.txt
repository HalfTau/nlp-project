DO NOT GET THIS SICKISH TIME WAISTING PEACE OF CRAP! I spent all morning trying to get on. When I try to log on to social club my game crashes. I am sick of Rockstar letting people down because of this dumb, idiotic, social club peace of If I dont get a refund I and my friends will boycott rockstar forever. I will not buy a game for 20 bucks and not get to play it. I would rather play super mario brothers than take up rockstars peace of crap social club. If you are reading this, dont waist your time with this crap, go to Ubisoft or Activision or something like that. DONT GET THIS PLEASE! You will regret it. This game is good, I used to play it on my 360, but im upset that rockstar has screwed so many people. Max payne, GTA, all of them are ruined and stupid for one reason Social club. It might work for some people, but the majority of people cant because rockstar just HAD to make a social club when really, no one wants/wanted it. If you dont have this problem, then dont comment saying you just have a problem with your computer. I hope a lot of people read this and decide not to buy it.10/10 rockstar  up
