I will not recommend this game only for one reason GFWL games for windows live.Its made by microshit, so that youll get tied in to a service that you dont need and want xboxshit, and I just cant see how this piece ofdoesnt get rectified.Am I angry? Yes. The reason?The launcher works, the authentication works, but once it comes to GFWL, the entirecrashes and refuses to run. All because of a  program to tiein to  services by a  company known as microshit/microshaft.
