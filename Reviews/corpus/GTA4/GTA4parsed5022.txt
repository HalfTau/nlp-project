Its a shame this is getting so many bad reviews because honestly its a great game.The optimisation is not very good but comared to what everyone says it now runs natively on Win10.OpenIV is NOT dead, as a matter of fact it received an update and the download page is back up again.And its not Rockstar that was responsible for its shutdown. It was TakeTwo. Learn to do your research before you jump on a bandwagon, people.
