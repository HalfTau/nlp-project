The singleplayer in the game is supper fun, the missions have an interesting story to tell you that will get you connected to Niko. Not to mention that they have a wide varaiety of tasks, thankfully that includes missions where you dont have to fight with guns, unlike some games. Sadly the PC port isnt the best but its not the worst PC port around and rockstar finally removed social club from this game so you dont have to worry about creating an account. Just get .dll and youll be pretty clear of all the annoying DRM that was once in the game.
