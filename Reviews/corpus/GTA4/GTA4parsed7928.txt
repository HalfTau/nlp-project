After visiting the discussion board here on Steam, I found a quick fix for the no launch problem that seems to be plaguing the game. There is a download of a couple files that are apparently broken or missing from the games folders, and theyre clean of viruses and other malware. The game now runs perfectly fine, and the fix took all of two minutes to implement. Im giving this game a thumbs up because it is such a fun game once you get into it.
