Avoid at all costs. I bought this game to see how good It would be on PC. To my demise It turned out to be worse than what It was on the xbox 360 or PS3.Avoid at all costs.I would suggest Max Payne 3 and GTA V which are good Rockstar games for PC. Im not sure about L.A Noire and Red Dead Redemption never came out on PC.UPDATE30/01/2017  A miraculous patch appeared from know where and fixed all issues online works again ! but no one plays it... The game still looks really good even for a 9 year old game ! The cars crash and npcs crash even more funnier in this game than GTA V. Really fun 10/10 Just wish theyd add Red Dead Redemption to PC. A CLASSIC.
