Game is awsome, but not for PC. There are also a lot of problems with Games For Windows Live. Now better  buy GTA V. It has larger map, more interesting story, more things you can do go to the strip club, go cycling, go surfing, play tennis, diving... and no problem with optimization. I like this game but I like GTA V more.
