Runs terrible on AMD CPUs. For this reason the game was somewhat annoying for me. I would say only get it if you have Intel, or are willing to do some googling and troubleshooting. Fantastic game from what I could experience, but the AMD CPU FPS issues really took a lot of wind out of my sails for it.
