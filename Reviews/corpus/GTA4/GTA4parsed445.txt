Im love with this game, granted it has its flaws, the performance which on my modern system, i5 7600k and rx 480, runs well most of the time, but there are fps dips in the 30s, but apart from that the game has a great single player story which I couldnt understand when I was younger playing on my old XBox 360, but now that Im older I can finally understand it and its great!Id recomend this game if you want a good single player, story driven game with a great story.8/10  Solely based on the performance of the game it doesnt get a 10, but its the second best Grand Theft Auto game to date, second only to Vice City.
