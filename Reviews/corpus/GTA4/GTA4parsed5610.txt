Call my opinion biased if you want, but I dont really care...The same way I dont really care for these characters or their motivations.The same way I dont really care for the small amount of car variety.The same way I dont really care for invisible barriers forcing you to play through the story.The same way I dont really care for rockstars attitude towards PC gamers in general.I was hoping for a nice city sim where you can visit New York in all its glory.I knew about the characters and didnt really mind if you can ignore it.I think the gta series in general is trying too hard to get this thug life persona going...Maybe its enjoyable for some, but to me it doesnt work.There are a lot of people who adore this game series. In some ways I can see why. The idea of an open world sandbox to play with your friends. Drive cars shoot people and get away with it. In others I really dont I can make an educated guess that single player is just lackluster and boring after youve seen the city for an ingame day or two.Maybe my opinion will change if I ever have literally nothing better to do and got time to play through the forced story to see the full map. Untill than I consider this kind of a waste of my time and money.
