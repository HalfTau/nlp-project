I got this game in the Grand Theft Auto Complete Pack and I have to say its terrible. With Windows Live bugging you all the time and having to create a lot of accounts, it gets very maddening. Also, no matter what, whenever I go anywhere its not loaded at all and all that is there is a couple of floating lampposts and people. Do not get this game, save your money for something that actually works.
