This is indeed a good game and fun, I like the way they made it seem as realistic as possible, the vehicles have great detail and the visuals within the world itself look really good. Dislikes are the driving mechanics, I have seen better driving in other games. Other dislikes are the fact that you require a Microsoft Windows Live account in order to save your game history and at the writing of this review, there is a known issue with Microsoft Windows Live not accepting the CD KEY provided by steam. Overall its a good game and I did enjoy the story line and the way the game plays as if you are watching a movie. Cant wait for Grand Theft Auto V to be available on PC/Steam.
