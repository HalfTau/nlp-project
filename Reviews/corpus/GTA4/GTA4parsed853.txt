This was the first open world game that I played and I love it. Its a sandbox meant for experimentation so if you like that then youll love this. Its a bit old  thats part of its charm but it comes at the cost that there are many other games that do what it does better, like GTA 5. The story  missions within it arent all to noteworthy except that infuriating heist mission but theyre still fun. The focus is on toying around, using cheat codes, and downloading mods for it which allows for a ton of fun. Its definately worth the price but I cant say its worth the 60 hours Ive put into it Id much rather get GTA 5 which is a bit pricer but with a lot more freedom.
