They think their customers are idiots they told us they went against OpenIV because it helped hackers when thats indeed a lie, its the complete opposite, the tools team went a long way to make sure people coulnt mess the online portion of the game by using malicious mods online.I definitely wont buy any more games from this bunch of greedy liars.
