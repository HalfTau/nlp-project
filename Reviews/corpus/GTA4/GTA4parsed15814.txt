What can I say. It is GTA IV.... I have played this game for a long time... I used to rush home in order to play it on my Xbox 360. GTA IV is also one of the games that inspired me to buy a gaming pc. Because of mods. This game is so much fun playing with mods, so even until this day I play the game sometimes.If I were to recommend one mod, it would be LCPDFR A police simulator within GTA IVGAMEPLAY 8/10GAMEPLAY 10/10 with modsSo yeah I strongly recommend this game!
