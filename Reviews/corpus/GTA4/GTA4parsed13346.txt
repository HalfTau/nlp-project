This was a fantastic game i cant deny that. Just the game....Rockstar ported the game from consoles, so it would crash lots of times and has weird glitches. I would buy the game on consoles because its more optimized and that you could play for more than 20 minutes. Other than that this is the best game ive ever played...Nice story, Fantastic animations, nice vehicles, and cool activities that you could do. I hate that they removed many features from previous GTA games. Also the AI is not that good...the civilians would crash into you or run you over for no reason, the police AI is even worse they are terrible at driving and that they dont act like cops at all..i understand that this is a parody but still i mean they cant be that bad. And it is a pretty old game. I would buy the DLC like TBOGT and TLAD because they are more modern or in this case revised. So i would give this game a overall score of a 8/10.
