Here is the deal, it will run flawlessly on Windows 10 machines with a little tweaking. Spend 10 minutes on google and you will find multiple sources with clear instructions to get this running. Yes they killed mods, but GTA IV is a great game all by itself. If you enjoy the game, characters, story, and would like to have it on your PC, go for it. Ive had it downloaded since January and had all the bugs worked out within an hour of installing it.Have fun everyone!
