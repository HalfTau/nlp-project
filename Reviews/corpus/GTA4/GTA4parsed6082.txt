I have very fond memories of playing GTA IV, there was an open world to explore, an amazing story and the dialogue was hilarious. Although the PC port is just garbage, with my game lagging at times. For those who have issues launching the game, look for a patch, however you will not be able to log into social club.Despite all that, I really enjoy this game and I cant wait to try some of the mods available.
