This is a great game. Grand Theft Auto IV has a great story, one that feels darker than the other games, and realistic, unique gameplay you wont find in any other game. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys freeroam games, likes story games, or wants to have fun.Its sad that this great game now has negative reviews just because OpenIV was shut down, apparently they shadow the game itself.
