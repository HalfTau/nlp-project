Get it on console.Optimization is garbage, I run 5 on high/ultra better than this on medium.You need GFWL to save progress.Doesnt recognize GPUs with greater than 2GB of processing powerRequires all sorts of modding and config edits to get running reliablyIts a great game and I had a blast from the tiny amount I played on 360, so I bought this on PC hoping to enjoy it on my preferred platform, and holy damn it is a disaster.Game is good, port is bad.I cannot recommend such a broken port of an otherwise amazing game.
