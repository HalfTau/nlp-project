 The port doesnt work on all computers including mine. Also visit the forum before buying and you will see lots of people who cant play. It also complains about not having enough memory and stuff like that but the real reason is that I have too much memory for the game to handle. Uses GFWL  Social Club aside from Steam. They didnt spent a lot of time to properly port this game to the PC.Upon launch the key is already entered but I cant click the I Agree button. It does not respond to the keyboard and the mouse is bugged out and doesnt work. The offline version does not have this problem.But both the steam and the regular PC version do not work for me complains about not enough memory, black gaps, missing textures, etc. so that will make this a short review.Note that my PC passes all benchmarks and stresstests so its the game that fails and not my PC.
