even though this game is 8 years old,id wanna give it a review because i feel betrayed  the optimization for pc is really bad on this game because it gives you very low fps,i only bought this game cause i was getting a good deal of 2 with GTA  San Andreas along with it.i used to play this game on my intel dual core without any graphic card yet it used to run so good on it and now i have a gpu it gives so low fps TT i liek my gta  san andreas 3 its the best in all.
