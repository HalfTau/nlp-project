As a child, I had the nightmare of many gamers strict parents. I wasnt allowed to play any games that sparked violence. GTA was a clear example. Therefore, the only memories I had of GTA was either at a friends house or Youtube videos. I barely had any experience with GTA IV. It was on sale, so I purchased it. There was a problem. The social club wouldnt launch. However, I was able to fix that. I then was able to play, and man, what a great game it was. Many features, great plot and storyline, and a great recreation of New York City. So, finally owning a game I wanted to play was a great feeling, so I had the sudden urge to park my car next to a swing set next to the ocean. I closed my eyes, relaxing, only opening them again to realize Ive been launched to the seventh dimension
