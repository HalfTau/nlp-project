GTA IV offers an engaging story and tons of content. It is a blast to play though even though driving and being required to do side missions in between story missions sometimes can feel like a chore. Also, the tone of the story doesnt exactly match the tone of the gameplay. Its kinda difficult to seriously think about the value of human life in the story when you ran over 40 people on the way to the mission. Still, its fun. Play it and have fun.
