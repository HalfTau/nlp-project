I bought the game in a steam sale years ago, but the port to PC is so badly optimised that it never ran smoothly on my old laptop. Years later, with a proper PC the game runs fine, but 30 hours in and the story is boring, the characters are not engaging, the humour, well what humour? The driving mechanics are bad, and it is so easy to fail missions because of small glitches. The gameplay is basically solve the problems of whiny selfcentred NPCs by murdering large numbers of people  it gets stale very quickly. Forgetable.
