Typically for STEAM when you buy a bundle not all the games work. You almost expect it from older games but seen as how GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas all work and its only 4 and Liberty City Stories that let the whole thing down Im gonna assume its STEAMS shoddy customer support to blame. No point moaning about it to them as theres zero chance of a refund.
