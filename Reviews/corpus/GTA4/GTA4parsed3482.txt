A great game, and the first entry into the HD universe, this game Ill recommend despite it requiring a bunch of registrations and services.The storyline and the whole atmosphere are both, in fact, highly depressing, but the best thing is that its still pretty playable storylinewise, and its atmosphere really makes you stick into it even more, something which is Rockstars signature way to make games seems depressing but also quite happy at the same time.The only two things that are wrong with this version is the registrations AND the mandatory download of the Windows Live services that you have to do and go through before being able to properly play this game, and the poor job that Rockstars done with the port, requiring you to have extraordinarily high PC specs just to run it in mid or high settings.In overall though, GTA IV really has a special and touching story, something that was obviously been worked on for a long time.I recommend this, and its expansion pack too.
