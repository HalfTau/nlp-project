I will now do my best to compare GTA 4 with GTA 5.Keep in mind, GTA 4 is a 2008 game, meanwhile GTA 5 is a 2013 AAA title.HandToHand combat/Melee fighting  GTA 4Shooting  GTA 4Weapon Variety  GTA 5Physics  GTA 4Multiplayer  GTA 4 is PURE freeroam, GTA 5, not so.Exploration  GTA 4Vehicle Handling  GTA 4Helicopters/Planes  GTA 4Explosions  GTA 4Water splashing, looks  GTA 4Buildings  GTA 4Story  GTA 4 GTA 5s story was good aswell, but I found GTA 4s more interestingCompanions/Friends  GTA 4  you can even hang out with them. GTA 5  N/ADating  GTA 4 gimmicky, but still a feature GTA 5 doesnt haveReactions  GTA 4 If you point a weapon at someone driving a car, they will put their hands up and get out of it, meanwhile in GTA 5 they will just run awayInteraction  GTA 4 standing near someone in GTA 5 will start a fight, not even to mention, cops will start shooting at you if you even stay still for a few seconds near them.Parkour  GTA 4 you can even climb on ledges and get on top of buildings that way, something GTA 5 lacked.Graphics  GTA 5And more. Even though Ive spent over a hundred hours on GTA 5, those 65 hrs on GTA 4 were much more enjoyable. Give this game a try.
