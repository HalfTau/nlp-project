Its GTA  little introduction is needed. Very enjoyable game, but the PC versions suffers from poor performance as well as the Games for Windows Live disservice. You must also sign in to the Rockstar Social Club which is a more or less a useless feature.Disable Clip Capture under the game settings to gain some extra performance if you dont plan on making ingame videos! By default it is on.
