This game is just broken. Dont even think about it. I dunno how I even got 16 hours on it, unless I left it running overnight after passing out drinking a bottle of whisky trying to tweak this damn thing. I just spent an evening trying to get it to run on the second pc Ive installed it on. I bought it two years ago and couldnt get it to run good, and said to myself well Ill try it again when I get a better computer someday. Well I just tried it on my new computer. Still broken.
