I played this game on console a while back,very good game.It was on sale so i thought Hey i might as well buy it.Big mistake,That rockstar logindoesnt even ign work, i keep having errors,i searched at least for 2 hours for a damn solution and none of them have worked, i cant even play it offline because the buggy piece oflog in window closes,and the loginalways says wrong password or whatever when its right.Man,rockstar really ed up this game
