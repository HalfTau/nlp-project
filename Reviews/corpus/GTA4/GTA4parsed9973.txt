Great game, unfortunately i cant recommend it because the cost resulting from the negative utility associated with problems like loading screen, Windows Live, Video/Graphics setup is high enough to overwhelm the positive utility from the experience, if I could I would give it back. You should use alternative ways to get it and play it because that way you wont face those problems and you will be able to enjoy a great game.
