Do not buy this game. It is terribly codded for PC and takes a redicules amount of stress to just get the game to run. After a few hours of ing with the files and searching the internet I finally got the game to run only to have it trip into a loop of loading everytime it starts. This game is so poorly made I weap for the others who bought it.
