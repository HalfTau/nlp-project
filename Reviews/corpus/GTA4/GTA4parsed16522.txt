I really dont appreciate when a game requires additional thirdparty bulllike GFWL to run, and having no warning of this provided on the Steam store page.GFWL does not work at all, the help page/troubleshooter for it is a complete joke. Ive wasted hours on trying to get this crap to run, and now I just want a refund.Dont buy this game.
