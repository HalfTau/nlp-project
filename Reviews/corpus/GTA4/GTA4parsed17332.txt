PLEASE SAY THIS REVIEW IS HELPFUL SO PEOPLE CAN SEE IT.This game is currently, and for the foreseeable future, not multiplayer. Games for windows live has ruined this game, and thus forth the multiplayer doesnt exist anymore.You must download a program, or fiddle around with the files to get rid of GFWL.This games singleplayer is 1000x better than GTA V as far as story goes, but there definitely isnt as much to do. The story is extremely long though, in fact, you got an achievement on xbox called The Libery City Minute or something like that for completing it in under 30 hours. Dont go in expecting the happy go lucky bs that GTA Vs story is like. This game is about Niko Bellic, and his past catching up to him. Its about him fighting in the serbian war when he was a child, and people coming back to haunt him after such a long time. Its nothing close to robbing banks, and generic psychopaths. If you enjoy a great story, with a lot of unforgettable characters, than this is definitely better than GTA v.I wish I could write this review with the multiplayer in mind because its absolutely crazy how screwed up the multiplayer is for GTA V. There shouldnt even be a currency, let alone cash cards. In this game, me and my friends would explore Liberty City, and its complexities. Any environment you could enter in story, you could enter in multiplayer too. Some environments werent even enterable in singleplayer, that are enterable in multiplayer. The city feels more alive, and unforgettable. Maybe some day well get a remaster, or something of the sort, but until then, we are stuck with crappy GTA V multiplayer.
