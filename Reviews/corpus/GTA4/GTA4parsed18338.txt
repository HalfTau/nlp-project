Whats the better game, Grand Theft Auto IV or Saints Row the Third? Thats a major question Ive been asking myself for the past two months, but I can honestly say now that both games are equally good, but whatever game you prefer all depends on your style.If you like to go crazy, play with dangerous weapons, wear silly costumes and drive wacky vehicles, then I recommend Saints Row the Third over Grand Theft Auto IV.BUT!If you prefer a more serious game in a more realistic world with a crimegangster movie storyline thats teeming with shady, yet loveable characters, then welcome to Liberty City, and enjoy the beeg American teetees!
