The franchise that defined the term open world in video games is back for a fourth time but this time around you play a Russian immigrant who just came to America to chase the American dream. Surprisingly Rockstar have taken out a lot of the customization that was previously available in GTA SanAndreas tattoos, gym etc.. GTA 4 is competent. It might not be the best open world game one can play but its a solid thirdperson coverbased shooter in an open world that has lots of mission variety. I would have praised it more if it wasnt for the previously mentioned stripping of a lot of the customization. And also the obnoxious sidemissions that your cousin or any other associate might call up on just so that the player can go through all the side activities comedy shows, bowling ally, random mini game etc. that the developer managed to shove in, which wasnt a lot to begin with as previous iteration and also its sequels would have more variety. I would not say its the best GTA out there but its still alive to this day solely because of the amazing modding community surrounding the game. Would defiantly recommend it but only when the whole GTA bundle goes on sale, and it often does.
