Pro Good StoryContra You need Windows Live or a Rockstar Account to save the game took me hours.. The game only saves manually when at home. Multiple Times lost multiple missions becauce the game crashed. If you die in a Mission, you have to repeat it from the start  with all the driving ... Police spawns next to you even if you nearly lost them.The game often is Fun, but most of the time it was just grindinglike driving from one end of the city to the other. The missions are very similar and dont have savepoints in between.
