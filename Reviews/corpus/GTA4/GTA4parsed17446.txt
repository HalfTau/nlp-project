Probably the best game ive played in my life.The memories i have, both online and sp, is amazing. The story is also amazing, the way you get to know Nico and his friends is awesome and for example when one of Nicos friend died, i cried...Of course there is some bad stuff to, for example is the multiplayer extremely buggy sometimes and there is some glitches, even tho most of them are pretty funny.I really recomend this game for everyone!
