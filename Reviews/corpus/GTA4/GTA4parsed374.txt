i mean like. everybody is hating this. But this gta was so different from sa. It was new. ofc it didnt have planes etc. but why would you want to fly a plane in middle on nyc. quite offensive for americans, dont u think. Its also beatiful looking game. For 2008 it was just godness. and that story is literally just one of these good gta storys that you can play, also cuz of choices youre given. Love it
