I honestly expected this game to be pretty easy and fun to play...but, it barely hits 2 frames per sec on the lowest possible settings. At least i have San Andreas, and GTA V...which i got GTA V on christmas, and will not be playing due to a hackers breach everyones complaining about...Lucky I got this while its on sale...and I can refund it.I hope this game actually improves...by removing Windows Live...and poking some other things around.
