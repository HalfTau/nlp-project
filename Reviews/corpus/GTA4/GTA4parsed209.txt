You play as Nicko Belick eastern europian that came to Liberty city in search of revenge. The story mode is entertaining and Ive really grown to like Nicko and the characters that he interacts with, Jamaican weed smoking Rasta, Gambling Causin, Mobe bosses and the story itself is very well written.What I have an issue with is the gameplay, most of the missions are the same, chases the bad guys down and shoot them, and the difficulty curve is, make the chases longer and make more enemies to shoot so the gameplay actually got old pretty quick. There where times where I rather drive around a city to find odd encounters with Liberty city citizens  and help them out spy on their wifes, drive them to pick up 10g crack rocks and drop their drank a home, you also meet some people that you come to US on the boat with and can see what they are up to.Rockstar open world for is really enjoyable and with your tunes on the radio, it is very relaxing just driving around. The radio and the commentary on the world by the news anchors is also a very strong point of GTA series personally I trust Weazel News more the I trust CNNThe game takes around 30h to complete and it is a got pic on sales for 10 for the complete series GTA IV and 2 DLCs, I think Ill take some time off for now before I go back and finish the DLC as the game is very repetitive, and most of the cars and bikes drive like garbage, which makes it hard to complete the missions on the first try when you dont know how to get to the destination.Overall I love the game because of the storyline coming to America and chasing the American dream, but I have rage quit the game on a few occasions so this one is 7/10.
