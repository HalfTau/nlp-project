Played 40 hours on this one out of nostalgia and it was a good 40 hours... until GFWL done ed up and causes my game to crash when the press home to access windows live appears on the loading screen.Will rate positive when there is a solution on this. If you dont have this yet on your library, even if it is on a sale, DO NOT BUY UNTIL ROCKSTAR FIXES GFWL INTEGRATION!Go play something else like an entire franchise of Saints Row or something.
