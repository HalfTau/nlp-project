If you like the GTAseries, you have a lot of spare time and the games cheap, you should buy it.However, if you owned GTA San Andreas and gamed theout of that one, you wont like GTA IV unfortunately. Besides the amazing graphics, its a really weak game. The storyline is okay, the expansion packs are great addition, but it lacks all the freedom of GTA San Andreas. Like NO PLANES! And the controls for the helicopter if you can locate one are not that smooth. Cars and motorcycles are the same, controlling them feels a bit awkward and slow.
