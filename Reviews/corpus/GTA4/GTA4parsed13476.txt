This game in its current state of dependancy on both GFWL and Rockstar social club, is UNPLAYABLE. Do not spend your money on this wreck until it has been fixed.EditSpellingMy original review was posted in a state of extreme frustration, This is an excellent game, issues with DRM aside. However I still cannot recommend a a game that is this broken out of the box. With mods such as  the game becomes playable, but the EULA for the game prohibits these modifications, and making them disables the multiplayer component.I think its irresponsible and disrespectful to release a game in this state, and to ignore the issues once its out.
