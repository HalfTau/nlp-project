More kickgta action. This game has everything but strangly, for me, it got boring pretty fast. The game itself is amazing though. The crazy situations you find yourself in on a regular basis, the guns, the cars, the upgrades the madness that is gta is definitly worth a shot. If you have never played gta before you are in for a treat.
