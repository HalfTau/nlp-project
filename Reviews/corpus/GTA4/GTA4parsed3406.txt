For those of you still unable to play GTAIV on Windows 10 try downloading the recent Games for Windows Live hereI was having trouble getting the game to run, i tried every tutorial possible to get it to work but nothing worked, even downloading the X liveless mod that didnt work with GFWL until i deleted X liveless then the game started.This is where i found the download link if it doesnt work for you maybe something else on this forum thread will.Good luck! This game is too beautiful to not be enjoyed all these years later.Edit I also downloaded the patches for GTAIV and EFLC which are on page 1 of that forumnot sure if steam automatically updated the game or not because i only bought the game on PC yesterday after learning of the Windows 10 patch
