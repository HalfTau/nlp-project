Good graphicsSolid controls on footFun multiplayerBoring storyRepetitive missionsDull color paletteFriends are annoyingWorst driving controls/physics everNothing to do in singleplayer after missionsFun for a few hours, but missions become a grind quickly. Way too realistic, making chaos MUCH harder and less fun. Almost requires mods to hold any replayablity, but has no workshop support. Either get Saints Row, Sleeping Dogs or wait for GTA 5.
