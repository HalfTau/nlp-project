Dont even bother. Even with the recent update GFWL is still in place and makes the game unplayable. Sure the game launches but you still can not save your single player game without GFWL. I saw online that you can save if you use an offline profile but it seems even that is broken. There are not many games that I downvote but sadly this is one of them.
