NOTE the following is my initial review, ever since there has been an update yes an update for a game that came out in 08 which has fixed the issues, read afterwards for my updated review.Its a Good Game, what you expect from Rockstar and their Grand Theft Auto FranchiseHowever one problem is the fact and this is a big one is that it dosent ing work, launching after the first time is a massive problem as rockstar social club still wants to cling on to Games for Windows Live even though microshaft ended up concluding that it wasand letting it die quick was best for it, if you want moreache then go for it but until theis sorted which wont happen then best get it for your Playstation or Xbox you Normie.UPDATE Now that the game works, it still upholds as a good game in 2017, the one problem I have is the lack of Multiplayer servers however that cant be helped unless we go back to before GTAV, eitherway Single Player is great and what you expect from Rockstar and Modding is bloody amazing, I mean where else can be Spiderman, driving an F1 car into thomas the tank engine so hard they explode, all the while cars are flying around you wanting to take what little sence of life you have left.I Happily give this a good rating
