Useless in 2016. Getting Rockstar Social Club to work isnt possible for me, even though I can log in on the website. Windows Live Marketplace is also trash and cant log in while Im in game. When I go in offline mode I cant even turn up the graphics above 800x600. Not worth buying at all anymore.I remember somehow getting things to work a couple of years back, but not anymore. Everyone who tries to come up with their own game marketplace for PC ends up ruining things.
