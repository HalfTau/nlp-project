If you wanted to know if one of those hacking simulator games was for you but you werent sure how complicated they were, you could just get this game and then try to actually play it. Microsofts Games for Windows Live is still running on this thing, and if you forgot your password, good luck! Because the site to recover it no longer exists, and the slackjawed idiots youll deal with through the XBOX support site will make it very apparent just how much quality control Microsoft and Rockstar are willing to throw down on their older games.I heard from one of the gaming channels on YouTube that there was a major update to GTAIV recently, which included a fix for peoples login issues. They should have specified some of the login issues, though I dont care to know how there could be further trouble than not being able to play the game you bought...Its a good game, but dealing with it on PC as it currently stands is absolutely not worth it.Cram it up your bum, Windows Live!Delete Local Content
