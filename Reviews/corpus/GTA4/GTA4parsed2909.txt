Do Not Buy. Purchased this game solely for the modding capabilities. Now that my money and many others is already spent, TakeTwo and Rockstar have decided to turn their back on the modding community, which is probably the vast majority of the customer base for the GTA Series on PC. If I wanted to play this game without mods, I would never have purchased the PC version in addition to the console version. Period.  DO NOT BUY.Until TakeTwo redacts its threats made to Open IV and issues a sincere AND PUBLIC!! Apology, I will refuse to spend any of my hard earned money on any of the releases by TakeTwo, Rockstar, or the Gta series. I will also strongly urge all those that I know to do the same.
