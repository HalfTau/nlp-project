Interesting plot! Well written and realistic characters, while occasionally still delivering that craziness expected from GTA.Mechanics driving is ok, shooting is quite rigid due to cover system  not the most enjoyable when the fighting missions are so boring. Soundtrack is great, and the city feels like it would be a real one.My main problem is the save system during the missions, which is terrible. In some missions, if you die in the very end, you will have to start from the very beginnig. Which means extra driving, extra cutscenes, and extra shooting. Not cool at all, and is very frustrating once again, as there is no Quick Saves available. This was fixed in the extra episodes, so I wonder why this was not implemened as update to the main game as well.8.5/10 9/10 if the save system would be better
