Litterally unplayable.When you finally get over the graphics issue, which took me a couple of hours, the game still runs on extreme low settings. It is buggy and lagging as hell.I could live with bad graphics and a bit of lag, mainly because of the story. But the loading takes forever, and then i run into a major lag. The game freezes at the end of Bull in a China Shop... Freezes on a load screen.Dear RockStar games. Why the hell do you s release a game for PC that is so buggy? why would anyone trust you to make something remotely good again after thisI am writing this review in 2015. The problems should be fixed by now.I hope that i find a way around this freezing issue, and the graphics issue i mean, San Andreas had better graphics on low setting than this crap.It is truly sad to see a franchise take such a huge dump on its fanbase.... Shame on you!
