So cant really say one way or other for this game yetbut this much I can forwarn people aboutGetting this game to start up, if you are not a existing member of Windows gaming and Social Club, is a FREAKING PAINyou have to have accounts in both social club and then link to windows Live or XBOX, Twitter, Nintendo and blah blah blah.Such a pain for a single player game.Far as game goes, played for abit finally and really havent done much more then drive around Liberty CityDefinately off to a slow start but Im hoping things pick up from here
