Finally got around to playing this. Had played V previously and it bercame one of the best games i had ever played. Had misgivings at first but graphics at 4K and amazing story kept me at it. Face animations aside the graphics are very good for the age of the game. Story on par if not better then GTAV. Windows live a slight hassle but not a deal breaker. Cheap as chips when on sale as full version. Gonna play SFLC at some point as well. Well worth it
