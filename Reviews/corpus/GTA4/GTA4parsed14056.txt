Its a waste of money. First off, if you want to save your game, you are forced to make a windows live account. Secondly, youll end up seeing holes in the world, to fix this problem you need to lower the resolution, which then makes the game hard to play because you dont know where you are going. My advise, only buy this game if you have a super computor, dont waste your time and money if you have a lower end PC in buying this game.
