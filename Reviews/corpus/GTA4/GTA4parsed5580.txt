An incredibly gritty leap forwards in the series by R if you could get over the initial performance issues on release, the story remains one of my favourites in gaming, and the sounds, sights and feel of Liberty City were magnificently achieved.The added bonus is that The Ballad of Gay Tony breathed new life into the game which I spent far too long bumming about in and is the best DLC that any game has ever had, ever, in the history of forever. Ever.The Lost and the Damned is like the fourth Indiana Jones film if you like good things, you pretend it doesnt exist.Help me, I cant stop playing.
