I guess this wouldve been fun, if it had actually worked. When i am purchasing games of steam i except them to work when fully installed and updated. I shouldnt be needed to go download extra software from Rcokstars sites. If your looking for some troubleshooting before accesing this game, great! the game itself is good, but the way steam choose to solve isnt.
