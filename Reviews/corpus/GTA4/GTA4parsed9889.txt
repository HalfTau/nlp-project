One of the most boring games ever made. A real let down especially considering this got 10/10s pretty much everywhere on release.RDR is the game this should have been...unfortunately that never made it to PC.GTA IV is like playing a movie...as in, you just watch animated stupidity and hardly play. Characters generally unlikeable. Missions repetitive and mindless AI smeared around the game world.
