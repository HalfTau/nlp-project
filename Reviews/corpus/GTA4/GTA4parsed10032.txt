This game has problems. Securom antipiracy and Windows Live. Is Windows live even around any more? I instantly got a windows live login fail followed by a securom fail to even launch the game into any kind of window. I tried briefly to fix it to no effect. Could I fix it? Yes. Is it worth all the effort to play an inexpensive old game? Absolutely not. Why do I post that I do not recommend? Ya, it could be an awesome game. But my experience with it is fail to launch. So the gameplay doesnt matter when I represent my overall experience. Look, you buy a game, you expect that it works. You start it, it runs. Its that simple. Why should I give a game that has multiple errors to launch any kind of credit? There is no reason I can think of. I had high hopes for this game but Im just not willing to slog through all the effort to get it to run when there are so many other games out there worth my time and money that run when executed. Ill Try 5. I hope it works. I hear great things. If you are willing to troubleshoot windows live and securom, then go for it. I hear its a great game. If you feel you shouldnt have to pay for a troubleshooting experience just to run a game, I would avoid this title.
