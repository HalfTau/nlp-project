Walked down the street to do a mission. Thought to myself theres two cars in the way no big deal Ill just go past them...NOPE! Game glitched and sent me though the air in slow mation and couldnt move so I died. Congratulations game you successfuly exiled inme off for life!Other then that I like the internet cafe. I use it to look up naughty pics on giggle and then make the next user look like a perv.Idk I technically liked SA better then 4 not only that SA has a huge multiplayer right now.3/10  Slow moving cars can easily stun and kill you... and take forever doing it.
