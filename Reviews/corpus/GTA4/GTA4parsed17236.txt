For a game I enjoyed on a console, it should have stayed there!to play on the pc, sign into steam, launch the game, sign into rockstar social game app crap thing, sign into windows live gaming ......  just over it. To hard to even start the game let alone enjoy it.If I wanted to try and remember 6 user names 12 passwords and a secret handshake, well I wouldnt do it for relaxation.
