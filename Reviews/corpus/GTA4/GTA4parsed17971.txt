A game that didnt quite live up to expectations but nonetheless is an absolutely solid title. Good driving, combat, and missions for the most part along with enough sidequests and things to keep you occupied. Of course, its also a shootemup Sandbox with an absolutely amazing satire of midrecession America. So theres that.
