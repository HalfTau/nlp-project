Lots of whining here. Even when this game wasnt working, you could find your way around it and play it, but these geeks/nerds/ hardcore gamers are somehow too lazy to work it out, and just give up easily, like they do in life, you bunch of failures. Anyways, Rockstar has fixed the main issues with logging into Rockstar Social, and you can play it just fine. The only problem here is the lack of people playing it. Lets go back to the classics, people. The best online experience from the franchise so far. Trust me, you can buy it and it will work just fine, even online. Cheers! See you in the lobby!
