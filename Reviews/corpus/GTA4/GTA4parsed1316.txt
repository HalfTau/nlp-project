I found a good deal on GTA 4 and I thought, hey why not, had some good times playing this game. After I installed, clicked play and boom sign into the social club. Why? Im not playing online. Close that and game doesnt start. After an hour of frustrating searching I found out there were a lot of people experiencing the same thing. Cant play the game unless YOURE LOGGED INTO WINDOWS LIVE! Ok so I FINALLY got it running, it relentlesy prompts me to sign into WINDOWS LIVE. What the hell is this??? then I find out I CANNOT SAVE UNLESS IM SIGNED INTO WINDOWS LIVE! ?What?This is the worst experience Ive had trying to access a game I purchased. Even worse than Ubisoft games, and thats saying something. I cannot reccomend playing this game on pc. Youre better off going to an old game store and picking up a copy for the xbox or ps3.
