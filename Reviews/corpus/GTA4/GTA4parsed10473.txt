I have for the most part enjoyed this game. Pretty well written, some good spots. Some namely the last mission is annoying  not really being difficult, but giving little leeway if you mess up. That goes for all the missions  die or fail, and you have to restart  often having to travel to the place again. On multiple occasions I have given up playing for a while thanks to this, and I did a lot of taxi travelling towards the end to avoid this.Apart from this and one or two minor issues, I have enjoyed playing GTA IV, and look forward to playing GTA V when I can afford a machine that will cope with the size and scale of the game.
