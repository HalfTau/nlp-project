Okay I bought the game for a good price and was hoping to play after downlaoding it. I click play and then it says I need to login to my social acount, so i did. Then i hit submit, it says something like success and then it shows my mouse, next to it with the loading thing, im like oh I cant wait to play, but it wont. I even restarted my computer and the same thing happened, except Steam had to update and I thougth that was the problem, but sadly know. I want a refund, seriously. That is just stupid. When you buy a game ecspecially form a big well known game company Rockstarr, and it doenst work. Yeah your gonna get complaints, jezz. Im super frustrated Steam plzz do something, Plzz help.
