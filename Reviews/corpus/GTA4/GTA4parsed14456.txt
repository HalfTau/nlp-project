Simply Fantastic. The game will not even start for me. Just what I wanted, I get to the Social Club login, tried logging in and playing offline, neither of them work. The game crashes and closes everytime. Totally worth the 20 to get a disfunctional game. Absolutely everything I expected from a game whos title is a Felony.
