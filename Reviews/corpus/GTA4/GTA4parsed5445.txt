Huge disappointment... I really hoped to have this game running right when I bought it, but Windows LIVE had to screw everything up. I had to download lots of software to get this game running well and it has yet to impress me. I cant even get through levels cause the NPCs would just freeze after having a conversation with you in certain levels. Even on a high end gaming laptop, the game still doesnt load up the enviroment quickly as it should. I was looking forward to playing this game for the story and mods,  but I geuss Ill stick with San Andreas and GTA V...
