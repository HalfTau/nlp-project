Its a good game actually. If you can start the game... Personally, buying the game is the easiest part. The hardest part is to be able to solve the problems and start the game. I started playing with some research I did on the internet. Yes... I am proud to be among the people who can start the game.If the game launching issues are resolved and if you like the game series, its a game worth playing.
