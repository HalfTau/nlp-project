I wont recommend this game because I cant even play it... It wont let me log into the Rockstar club which is a must. From my browser I can login but in the game not. If I press play offline the window closes and thats all... My friends have the same Problem. I cant beleive that a huge publisher like rockstar games isnt able to make their games work on PC ...
