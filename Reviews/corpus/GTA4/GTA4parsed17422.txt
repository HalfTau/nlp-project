GTA IV is an astonishing peace of work. The series is well known for its open environment, authentic settings, and the raunchiness that accompanies crime and mayhem. Although the others were great, GTA IV unleases the future potential of the series with a nicer look of graphics and an excellent and soneeded cover system.Its not GTA V great, but it is definitely up there. 90/100 at the very least.
