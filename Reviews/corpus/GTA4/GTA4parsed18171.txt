Oh the joys of being a criminal in an open world environment.is a game that brings you the engrossing story of, a Serbian who fought in the Yugoslav Wars. He moved to Liberty City to live with his cousin,, with two goals revenge and money. This is a game that beat my expectations, as an oldfan, in almost every single way. It has a vast amount of things to do compared to its predecessors i.e. hang out with friends, do many side missions, customize your phone, watch shows/TV, get ingame achievements, etc contains top notch writing and gameplay mechanics, and an incredibly thrilling multiplayer. Get this game and live the American dream, its that simple.
