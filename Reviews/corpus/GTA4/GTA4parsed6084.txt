This is the dirty gta. It looks horrible no more colour and light of vice city just murk. No more fast movement and amazingly drivable cars. You feel like your walking in treacle where ever you go and all the fun has been stripped from driving so if you actually want to get round that corner youd better  be going at a snails pace or else youll be wrapped around the lamp post.The more realistic tone they were going for had a cost then. And in hindsite with the bugs ironed out and machines that can run its poorly optimised engine without breaking sweat the fourth outing for gta is characterised more now by its more realistic story and commentary that its technical limitations. No its not as fun as it one was. Its not supposed to be. Its got its own flavour of gameplay that matches the overall tone of the title. Its story and commentary on that fasset of western life. Imegration and the american dream all told from the wrong side of the law.Thats whats great about gta. Each one can be individual in its tone and aesthetic. Perhaps its not as fun as vice city was when you were 15 but isnt it nice that the game grew up with you.
