Game is ok.The unnecessary addition of Windows Live on top of the already annoying Social Club however earns my thumbs down. What should be a simple straight forward experience of installing and playing the game, turned into an hour long session of trying to sign into Social Club and Games for Windows Live. After finally logging into both, the Windows Live update somehow broke Social Club. Now I can no longer sign into Social Club.What en epic fail from Rockstar.
