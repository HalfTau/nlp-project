niko bellic, a badstrolling through liberty city. great game with an even better story. played it many times through. the radio stations are a joy to listen and make you cruise the city just to hear the next song. highly recommended, especially the DLC. Yusuf Amir is one of the funniest characters ever. ARAB MONEY!
