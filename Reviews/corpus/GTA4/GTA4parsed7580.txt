January 28th, almost one year after I posted my initial review of the Steam copy of Grand Theft Auto IV February 18, Negative Review. While the game is still flawed, after the update a few months ago, I would definitely change my opinion a fair amount. Its far more stable, and I would reccomend the game in its current state.The ups. The story was fairly well done and captivating, while the gameplay is fun, and it still holds relatively few glitches.The downs. The multiplayer servers were always hardly worth playing as there was little online content beyond exploration, it was mostly a sandbox with a ranking system. To this day, the optimization isnt perfect, as there are still occasional lag spikes, and you may need to tweak file settings in order to fix certain issues.The PC port of GTA IV would get a 7/10 overall from me. Id of rated a point higher, if not for the fact that it was broken for so long.Edit Cousin, lets go boooowliiing!
