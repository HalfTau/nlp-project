The Grand Theft Auto series never fails to disappoint, but this one was finally the one to somewhat disappoint the PC gaming community.Why do I recommend this? It is still playable.The game is not so optimized for PC, if you have a strong video card you might still only get 3050 FPS in this game, sometimes landing 60 but still might not impress you. Not only that, you need to deal with logging in Windows Live, the evil brother of Uplay as I call. But after dealing with that, you can still enjoy GTA 4.You play as Niko, a Russian who just immigrated to Liberty City on a boat looking for opportunity while his friend Roman tries to help him, The ending of the story is very interesting, and the gameplay is very, very enjoyable to this day.I would only buy this game for 5 due to its optimization.7.5/10
