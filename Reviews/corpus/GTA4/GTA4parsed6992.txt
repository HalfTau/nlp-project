You can hang onto ledges and shimmy in this. Can you do that in GTA 5? No. You cant. Buy this instead.I honestly did find this one more memorable. Like the story never took 500 directions. A lot more memorable characters. Aside from that, the other better things I could think of are just the fighting. Fighting in GTA 5 is usually 12 punches and they die. GTA 4 you really have to fight. The DLC even had a fight club in TBoGT. And also a slightly different environment. Sure it was cool that GTA 5 had mountains and hills and stuff. But it wont be often youll get that overflowing city feel of GTA 4. Nothing to climb up your car in, just a setting of New Jersery/New York City based areas. Bumper to bumper traffic that you almost cant escape only adding more and more to the difficulty when it comes to getting through traffic.
