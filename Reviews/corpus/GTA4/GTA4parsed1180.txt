Unplayable.Despite from being forced to install Games for Windows Live  Rockstar Social Club it is not possible to play the game without giving your phone number!!! to GFWL.GFWL immediately shuts down your account for no reason and forces you to enter your phone number. Itll happen to all your email addressesI feel sorry for the developers who made a great game which is simply inaccessable.
