The game comes with an outdated version of GFWL and youll have to manually remove it and install a newer one to make the game work, which is really disappointing since no one has even fixed this yet and players will have to figure out how to start the game. If youre here for multiplayer, its long abandoned and I recommend you GTA V.Otherwise, its a fun and addicting game with a great storyline that keeps you playing.
