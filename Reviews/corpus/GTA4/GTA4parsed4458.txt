First of all, I enjoy this game. But Ive always had problems with it. On 11/29/2016 R released an update, which fixed compatability issues.Before the update, I had a horrid frame rate, and my save file was eventually deleted. After the update, the game runs smoothly, but its missing a lot and by a lot, I mean my save file, and the entire city. Yep, city wont load. Only Niko, NPCs, and Vehicles will spawn, and thats not even touching the GFWL issue, after setting it up, its not really a hassle, but installing/making an account is a whole different story....TLDR Good game, many issues, even after the update. Wouldnt reccomend on PC.
