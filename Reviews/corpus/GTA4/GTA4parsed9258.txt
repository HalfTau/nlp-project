Honestly GTA 4 is alright.Its not really impressive but it brings some fun time.The story line is good but I feel like there should be better customizations. Literally, the degree of customization is probably on the same level, if no worse than GTA SA, just with enhanced graphics.And MV Agusta F4 sounds like a parallel twin engine bike.Its a decent game to say the least, but just decent, buy it when its on sale.
