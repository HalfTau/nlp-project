Afer hours and hours of going through the headacheinducing experience that was getting the game to EVEN WORK on windows 10, we had the displeasure of seeing that the online was not a possibility anymore not listed anywhere, by the way, so we thought, okay no problem we can just use hamachi and fake a LAN game, and after the even more painful steps of setting up Hamachi, a ping limit fixer, setting all the launch options, etc. my point is there is an insane amount of hassle to even get this game to run, let alone run with a friend we find out that even our LAN game wont be working. We have no way of playing with each other, as advertised is possible, and as was our original intention with the game, and now we have no use for the game.   Please either fix the game on the store to let the player know that the online is completely screwed, because there is really almost no way to even play the game offline, and Im fairly sure theres no way to play onlnine. This is an atrocity of a game, do NOT bother.
