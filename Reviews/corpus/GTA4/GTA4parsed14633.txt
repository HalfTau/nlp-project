40hour Fiasco and yet another crappy port of an overrated game.   The last straw is losing an hours worth of play when a silly sidemission lost my Comet because it wanted to spawn some crappy hoopdier I couldnt possibly care less about receving as a replacement.Nevermind theres no quicksave.  NEvermind the physics are a joke.  Nevermind the inventory/weapon access system is a joke.  Nevermind that theres no way to collect more than a handful of cars and, like I mentioned, they can be taken away from you through sloppy programming shortcuts.   Nevermind that the character customization thirdrate.    Nevermind all the other ambition greater than ability issues...I could live with them if the story was compelling, tight, and moved forward at a reasonable pace.   But its not.  The story is rambling mess and the whole game has pretty much devolved into a bunch of side quests for the ADD crowd that are pretty much only solvable with gunfire and highspeed chases.   Which, obviously, has gotten really boring at this point.Better to go back a revision and play San Andreas or wait for the PC port of GTA V than bargainbasementing this overhyped mess.  Even reduced to the 20 it goes for a nonSteamsale basis its just not worth the aggrevation and crappy game play.
