I love Grand Theft Auto IV  i ended up buying it a total of 3 times, for xbox 360, ps3, and obviously PC however i feel this is the worst version overall, not very well optimized at least when i played it it ran at a terrible framerate consistently.... but i had a great time playing it still, gameplay was still fun, story i personally liked, and the graphics look better on this version, i played all the way to the end on all versions but the ps3 and i have to say my experience has not changed because of the not so good optimization. do i recommend this game? well yes and no. yes if you can get it running better for damn sure, and yes if you like the series already, hell like me if you look past this versions flaws, you will still have an enjoyable time... but i say no as well, because its a bit on the buggy side on pc, and while it does look better, the framrate, will kill it for those who care..... so i say be your own judge at this point. that said, i give the PC version a 4/5
