Really liked this game back in the day on PS3 but it seems impossible to get past the Windows Live sign in.  This means you cannot save the game.  To be honest Im not sure why Steam is selling this game in its current state  its desperately crying out for a patch that gets rid of the Windows Live stuff.  I mean it cant be that hard right?
