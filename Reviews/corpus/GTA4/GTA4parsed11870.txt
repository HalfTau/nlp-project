This game is terribly optimized for PC, as of 2015 there has yet to be any sort of optimization tweak from Rockstar. Although this game is weak in the optimization area, this game has so much replayability. If youre looking to kill some cops, hookers, civilians or even a few birds here and there this game is for you, until GTA 5 comes out of course!
