Grand Theft Auto IV is a good game with a fluent storyline and I really liked it, to those who cant access GTA IV through steam currently, download the Windows Live Games here. With the Windows Live Games, youll be able to open GTA IV after youve downloaded it. You will also need to create an account for Windows Live Games in order to save your game progress. Hope this helps most of you who cant access and enter the game!
