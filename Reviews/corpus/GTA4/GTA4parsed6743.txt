Ok so a lot of people say this game sucks well thats their opinion but i honestly think this is one of the better gtas on steam if you can get past the issues which in my opinion are simple to fix with just reading the guides and getting the programs and scripts to override stuff.Pros. better damage and physics than GTA V better storyline mods out theand simple to installCons. bad optimization doesnt work well on low end pcs im running a windows 8.1 intel 1.85ghz dual core intel integrated 4gb ram and get 14 fps but i can tolerate it overpriced for what it is multiplayer is unplayable without a bunch of fixes and a strong pc.If you can get this game on sale or on a discount site then i would definitely pick it up if you are a fan of gta. Definitely worth the buy if you can tolerate some of the minor bugs.
