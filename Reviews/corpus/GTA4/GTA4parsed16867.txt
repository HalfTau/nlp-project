So I liked this game, even though there are plenty of people that were turned off by the extra realism vs. fun aspect of the game. The PC version is extremely moddable, which makes it even more fun while adding to the replay value. However, it is very poorly optimized and just simply doesnt want to run well. The story was ok, I had the most fun modding the game and going crazy.
