TLDR It may not have the surplus of innovative content that GTA V now has, but this game has a lot of charm. Its like when you get a new energetic pupper GTA V but you still love the musty old one GTA IV.The singleplayer is quite memorable, its no San Andreas but it can give you that goodon the first date. The characters are fun and have tonnnes of personality R.I.P. the cousin lets go bowling memes and i, personally, think the villains In IV are a lot more interesting compared to the ones in V. I mean, what the  even was that Devon guy, just a character we really wanted dead. Nikos personal struggles with the villains really had me pegged to the story GTA Vs story seemed to focus more on the relationship between M, F and T and how that developed is what drives that narrative.Multiplayer can still be fun, grab a few friends and try to have as much fun as Achievement Hunter used to. Windows live is the only real con within any of it.
