Funny, it says I have 0.4 hours on record, even though Ive completed most the game, so I dont how thats happend.GTA 4 is good, although, its not big enough. I mean, comared to GTA 5, its nothing.The only reason why I would rather play through GTA 4s story is beacuse its not as graphic.That being said, if you just want to drive around and have generally more fun, go for GTA 5.
