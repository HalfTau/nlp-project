Absolutely impossible to play due to compatibility bugs.1. As you start of the game launches with incredibly low graphics settings including a 800x600 resolution. Those settings CANNOT be changed. You have to add various command line properties to work around that.2. Once that is done  you can finally change settings The game gets stuck on loading screen because shadows textures fail to be read 0 no workaround for that, gotta keep them off.3. Passed that? no problem!  cxhange resolution and ALL your world textures are gone.4. Another command line workaround NOT a fix solves this.5. And now to the fun part  want to save game? you CANT! thats right. Even after you go through the annoying hell of setting up an otherwise next to useless account just for that purpose  It doesnt accept your steam product key.Support from steam? redirects to publisher. Support from publisher? redirects to forum posts that do not help.I am sending in a refund request.  Get the bootlegged version if nyou want this game.
