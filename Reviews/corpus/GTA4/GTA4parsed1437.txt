ing stupid System  error error everywhere right after clicking the play button!! giv back 5 pls!Its been almost 10 years and this game still is more buggy and broken than an EA game after a week of releaseGame does not work on multiple systems.  Steam wont refund.Windows Live DRM prevents the game working properly. Im aware this can be modded but basically Steam are selling a faulty product and itd be good if this was patched. I also dont remember this game running as badly as it does on my modern system.
