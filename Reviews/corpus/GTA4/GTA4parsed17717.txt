People wonder why this game was being pirated. It might be the fact that the pirated version must have gutted the DRM. If you dont what what DRM is, its basiclly punishing people for buying a game. Me and 3 other friends purched this with the intent to play online. Social club is down the day of the sale. I dont know if its today, or an ongoing problem. But youd think the day it goes on sale Rockstar would have their servers ready for new players. Even if they discountiued the online features, its being advertised as part of the game on steam.Not only is the online mode down, you can not even play single player. Why? You need connection to your Social Club to save any progress. But thats not the worst of it. My game crashes every time I startup single player mode, Ive tried all the methods I could and not a single method resolved my problem. I have a brand new rig, and it exicutes my games flawlessly. This is the only title that has ever not worked on my rig.BUYER BEWARE, You personally might have 0 issues, and the game would be fantastic. But know that known issues are being ignrored, and dont count on any offical support or patches due to the fact that its a dated game. This is a prime example of a game that was so worried about dicsouraging piracty, that its in fact encouraging it by offering a broken nazistyle drm system to those they pay money for it.
