Heads up, check the system requirements. Note the support for Windows Vista and XP ONLY. It appears the SecuROM protection doesnt work with updated versions of Windows 7 or higher.I have paid 20 for this and I havent been able to start it on any of my system configuration, but refunds are a big nono.
