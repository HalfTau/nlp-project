Awesome storyline and gameplay! everything works and im glad to have GTA 4 instead of 5! 4 is much better in physics and NPC reactions. The only downside is that when I downloaded I couldnt launch due to Windows live so I had to manually remove it by adding some files to the directive. As a resullt from that I cant play with my friend who also has GTA 4. I still enjoy playing single player, doing whatever I want. D
