I bought this glorious game back when I still had my Windows 7 pc  I think it was back in 2012 or something, worked fine, I enjoyed the game and exploring the city, bought houses, clothes, etc. It was super fun GTA wise. But then, I bought a new pc with Windows 10. Of course Id want to upgrade my gear especially after knowing that Windows 10 will upgrade its game in...well gaming softwares / systems.After all these years, I felt like playing GTA4 again, only this time, I cant even get past the disclaimer screen with its Social Club, Games for Windows t. It even crashes my system completely most of the times and freezes my main screen completely.I searched throughout the web for solutions  but most of the time, I see lots of complaints from users towards Rockstar, Microsoft, etc. You would think that theyd help and try to fix this compability issue but I guess not.Unless Im an idiot.
