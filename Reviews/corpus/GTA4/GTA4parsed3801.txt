Is the game fun? Absolutely.Can you play it? no.The client is absolutely broken, because of Microsofts complete pile of festering garbage known as Games for Windows LIVE. Thanks to this abomination, you cant possibly expect to load up the game anymore regardless of troubleshooting.And on the offchance you get it working, it wont let you sign in, which means you cant access saves AND it disables saving all together!Honestly, youre better off buying it for PS3 or Xbox 360.
