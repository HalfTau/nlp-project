Bought the game with a steam wallet code got for my birthday. Took all day to download, didnt work. Tried the next day. Still, did not work. Uninstalled GTA IV off my PC, which uninstalled steam and ALL my steam games too. So, I gotta start all over. And the best part about it? I spent ALL day downloading GTA IV again and it DOESNT work. Thanks for ing stealing my money, steam.
