The best GTA ever. From loading screen I felt LibertyCity atmosphere, dirt streets, grey sky. People trying to survive, Russian mobsters. The sad story about Serbian immigrant, who came to the United States because of cousin. Charismatic personages, a lot of thing from Slavic culture. The ending makes me cry. Best game. 10/10  GTA   .       .     ,      .  ,         .    . 10/10
