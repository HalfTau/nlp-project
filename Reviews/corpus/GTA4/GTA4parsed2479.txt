In recent light of the GTA 5 OPENIV Controversy, heres my articlethat I wrote a few months ago.Ive been saying it... Ive been saying it for 10 god damn years! Well, technically only the last 3 years and I only actually wrote it down this Feb, but Ive been saying how theyre nothing but robbing s and that the community who has always come to the defense of Take Two and Rockstar at times when parents and censors said the game was too graphic, only for Rockstar to turn round and  over its own fanbase in the name of money. The community now could be so much better off without them. Considering the amount of work modders have put into their work, its a small surprise they havent created an entirely new game of their own yet... which they should! Please can the modders get together and create a new GTA IP. Entirely open source/crowd funded that doesnt make you buy shark cards?!
