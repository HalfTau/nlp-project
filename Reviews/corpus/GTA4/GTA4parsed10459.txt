I dont reccommend this game because I cannot play it! I know what Grand Theft Auto is but I mean come on, I CANT GET IN THE DAMN GAME! I have played GTA IV before on XBox but when I try to play it here, it just says that I am in but doesnt actually send me ingame. If you have already bought this, I feel sorry for you and if you havent I dont reccomend this for this reason only.Keep RockingOnePixelWrong
