Grand Theft Auto IV is a great game, but what really screws up with it is its port, which is bad even on ps3/xbox 360The game features a nice story, jogability and very realistic driving mechanics which is interesting even though can be frustating to get used with it, but with time this is no longer a problem.If you have a good machine the game worth it, especially due to the tons of mods available, but sadly it could be much better than it is.
