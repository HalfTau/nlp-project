This game might have GFWL, but it is still worth it.Theres mods to get rid of GFWL, at the expense of removing the pointless multiplayer.I dont doubt the multiplayer is fun as but theres so little people playing that its just pointless.The graphics are really outdated, but theres a HUGE variety of graphics mods available. Definitely check it out.It says I only have 22 minutes played because I have the mod that removes GFWL, so it doesnt track my hours. Damn, this game is great though. I played GTAV on xbox before playing this game, and damn I have to say that I like it already. GTAV is probably one of my favorite games right now so maybe GTA4 will be able to top it. Who knows.10/10.Great controlsGreat gameplayRuns smoothly on a GTX 770 w/ 2gb vramMods are incredibly easy to install. Took me 30 minutes to install all of them.You dont need mods to play this game, but its highly recommended though.
