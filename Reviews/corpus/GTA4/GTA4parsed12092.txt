Game 9.7 out of 10Port 0.0 out of 10After submerging my PC into liquid oxygen to play, I had to install a mod just to save. Yeah. The game itself is awesome beyond belief, but the integration of Games for Windows Live GFWL is stupid. Also, Microsoft doesnt even USE GFWL anymore! So I recommend the game. Barely. I consider myself a PC gamer, and I dont even have the console version, but it would probably run better than this halfport. If you DO get this on PC, install , a special DLL that removes the ing GFWL B.S.
