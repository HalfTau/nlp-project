I got a personal connection with this game. Id play this game rather than GTA V or San Andreas. My Steam hours doesnt represent my true hours playing this game although, adequate amount for a busy college student. I probably clocked in thousands of hours from my PS3, beating the game two times on 100. GTA 4 has shaped myself in a personal level, next to the Jak Series, ROBLOX, and Star Wars Battlefront.Im more forgiving with the Steam version because of the personal impact and great story/mechanics during its time 200710. The issue is the need for optimization in newer Windows/Mac Systems. Ironically, Rockstar updated the game to prevent modding, but wouldnt step up to optimize the game further. I couldve made the Steam version a negative review, but I treat this game as if it were a religious icon, or something.
