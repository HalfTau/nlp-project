Driving over bridges in full rush hour simulator. That can be bypassed with using taxi, but then the  gameplay is cut down by 60 percent. The game is  imposible to finish if you run it in more then 30 fps. So if your pc is in recomended configuration category, you will not be able to finish last mission. They still take your money so they can create more console games, and bad ports for pc.
