When I was given this game to me by a friend in middle school, it was the first GTA game I was allowed to play. This was right after thiscame out, and I knew about GTA games, but my parents wouldnt let me touch em. This game was/is one of my all time favoritesThus is why Im leaving this  you of a review to Rockstar giving their fans and loyalists this steaming pile of a ing PC port. Windows Live stays disconnected thus not allowing you to link to your profile, meaning you cant saveor load the ing this up in the first place. If you can get into the game, even the best desktop you can build with every setting up to max, the game runs like complete .Ive personally had my fill of GTA Vs Online nonsense and can say that I enjoy the story stillbut it lacks the New York, terroism era of the United States I grew up in and that we all still live in lol. I want Radio Broker, Roman blowing up my phone, spawning boats with cheat codes on top of pedestreans and NikoGod, I ing miss Niko.So,  this port! I recommend you dust off your 360/PS3 and get your hands on a copy. I dont recommend dropping 40 bucks, sitting for 15 hours, and just end up uninstalling it, leaving it greyed out between GTAV and Gauntlet which you and your friends played for like a day as a joke.0/10 Oi lick a ya
