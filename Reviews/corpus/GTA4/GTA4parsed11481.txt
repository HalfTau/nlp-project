I havent been able to play the game. I have a new computer and play other games with much higher requirements. Downloaded a patch from GTAs website, sorted compatibility problems This thing struggles with windows 8.1, even though san andreas doesnt. F  U  C  K  I  N  G  B U L L S H I T. The problem? The stupid social club and windows live ideas. Well done you stupid C U N T S, go ahead and become EA.Windows live and social club make this game unplayable. DO NOT BUY IT, I WANT MY MONEY BACK. Feel more robbed than the people in the actual game who get their cars stolen.My rating is If im given this game for free would I take it? NO. I rather have no game than this.
