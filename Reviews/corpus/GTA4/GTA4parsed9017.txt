ProsNice gameplay,Its GTAConsStupid LIVE account signin required. You cannot even save a game without signing in. When you need to save the game, you have to go through ingame sign up to Microsoft XBOX Live and you need to restart the game to continue. This will of course discard any progress in game you hadThis game does not work correctly on better graphic cards and you will need to take specific measures to ensure the game is running okay.Because of the issues with graphic card and Xbox live, I do not recommend.
