Well....this game is fun. When you get it to work. Do I recommend this game to any one I know, maybe. But there is a issue that Rockstar really needs to fix and they just dont feel like doing it because they care so much about GTA V now. I think it is stupid that you need to still use GFW Games For Windows when noone in the world anymore uses it, unless they have this game. I first had this game on the PS3 and had no problems what so ever. The glitches in the game were fun, but playing the game for so long, I just got bored very easily. I decided to buy GTA IV on my PC and play around with some mods and have a fun time. That went out the window when I ran into the issue with Liberty City not loading and having to play on the lowest settings because when I tried fixing the issue with a minimum amount of RAM being used and the game would not play right. IF you get the game to work, then it is fun to play, if you dont get it to work, well your screwed.
