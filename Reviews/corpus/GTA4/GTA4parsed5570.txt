This game was released with a t online authentication system that only hurts legitimate owners of this game, which, while still required, now  as of late 2016  isnt supported anymore, making the game unplayable in the most literal sense of the word.Even if you manage to find a workaround for the singleplayer part  which you should not have to do in the first place  multiplayer is permanently inaccessible now that RGSC is dead.Verdict Avoid like the plague. If you really want to get it  and I cant believe I am saying this  get it on console instead.
