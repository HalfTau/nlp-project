Just doing my part.Theyve turned on modding and simultaneously killed GTA for a lot of us, including me. I will never forgive those greedy fcks if this is it for OpenIV.Fck TakeTwo. Fck Rockstar not going to forgive them, for R must have some say in this matter. And while were at it, Fck GTA Online and its microtransactions too.
