Gameplay 7/ 10 Performance 4/10To put in a nutshell Poorly optimized. Wonder why I had to download GWFL manually usually Steam itself automatically installs prerequisites for the game. Having to install GWFL was a pain in theas it is outdated as . Took me quite a while to get it working. I also had to set up a new social club account as my current account couldnt sync with the outdated client. After all the  I went through to make the game work, it started crashing midgame. Finally, having exhausted all other options,  I tried verifing the game cache, which started downloading a patch out of nowhere. Fortunately, the game didnt crash anymore after that, but it failed to discern the amount of graphics memory, which restricted me from changing graphics settings. I had to create a separate text file in the game directory to force disable the restriction. If it wasnt for forums and search engines I wouldnt be playing this. And damn you SecuRom. Worst DRM Ive ever encountered.
