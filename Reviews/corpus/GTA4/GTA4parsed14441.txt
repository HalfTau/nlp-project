Pros graphics, physics, very good storyline, choises, open world, cover system, a lot of easter eggs, you dont loose all your weapons after death like it was in earlier GTA games, alternative Internet with over 200 sites, Rockstars humor, friends and dates  all friends and girlfriends have their special abilities which are quite useful, movie editor, multiplayer.Cons theres nothing to do after finishing the storyline  you always can kill people, drive around the city, meet friends, have dates and have fun with physics engine but believe me, its getting boring after a few hours, no mission replay, friends are calling too often and if you refuse they like and respect you less, really few customization options  you can only change your clothes, no car costomization, horrible optimization, issues with GFWL and SecuROM fortunately I didnt have them P.Even though optimization and all these cut sandbox features I still had much fun with it. I give it 7/10. After beating the storyline I recommend Simple Native Trainer  it gives a lot of fun.EDITBy the way, I didnt play it only 3 hours. I had boxed version earlier which I played dozens of hours and I bought Steam version recently because it was on the sale.
