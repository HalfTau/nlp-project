When you first install GTA IV you will be asked to log in to their Social Network, or play offline. It doesnt really matter which option you choose since neither option will launch the game. You will spend the next 5 minutes searching online for a solution that will eventually lead you to updating your Microsoft LIVE service note, this is required even if you want to play this game offline.Once you have completed your first quest and updated the live service, the game will finally launch in graphically stunning 800x600 resolution and the lowest possible graphics settings. You will not be allowed to change these settings because Rockstar in their infinite wisdom never contemplated that their game would be played on anything more advanced than a potato. You will spend the next 15 minutes researching that you need to add nomemrestrict norestrictions to the games launch options just to be able to change the settings.Ok, so the game now launches and no longer looks like a dumpster fire, were ready to play, right? WRONG!!! Even if you are playing offline, you must be signed in to a Microsof LIVE account just to be able to save your game. This is the kind of behavior that is ruining gaming. I am seriously considering refunding this game because of the awful, buggy, and invasive 45 minutes I have spent just trying to get to a point where I can play the game. The only thing preventing me from refunding is that I am in such an agitated state right now, I really need to commit some indiscriminate violence in Liberty City to vent this frustration.
