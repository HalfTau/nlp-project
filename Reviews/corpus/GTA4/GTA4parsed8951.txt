Well, I tried really hard to like this game, but man, all the tedious driving around, especially after you fail a mission, having to go back to the place where you started, is the most annoying crap Ive ever had to deal with in a game. This game was in need of a save anywhere feature, or at least they should start you off right at the point where the mission begins if you fail the first time.The final straw? Chasing a damn train to get to the baddies. At that point the story hadnt progressed enough to maintain my interest. I had to stop playing it and move on to something else. This game takes forever to develop into the heart of the story, I only had one meaningful and cool battle during my aborted attempt at liking this game, and it was the point spoilers where NB had the battle in the warehouse where Dmitri betrayed him early in the game. That was very cool and gave me hope, but the rest of the missions before the game moved forward in the main story were boring and tedious. Especially all that time wasting driving. They basically came down to finding a baddie/baddies, killing one of them in a building, chasing the rest in a car after they escape. Rinse, repeat. Damn it sucked.I hope GTA 5 fixed some of this crap. Its sad, because I liked the main character and was really interested in seeing him move up the ranks and learning of the drama as it unfolded. Sucks.
