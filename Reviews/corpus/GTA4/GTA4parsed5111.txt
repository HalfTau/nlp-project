Ive had nothing but problems since downloading this game. I have a 2014 Alienware X17, so I had should have no issues running a 2008 game, but nevertheless, I had to turn all my graphics on low or off in order to even get a partial load on the graphics. Needless to say, Im going to attempt to get a refund because the game isnt even playable. I highly suggest making sure youre rig is a monster before attempting to download this game.
