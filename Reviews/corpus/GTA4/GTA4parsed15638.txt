NEEEKOH BUDDY LETS GO BOWLINGI recommend this because its GTA. Its okay, its worth the experience, and it has its share of fun moments and funny cliches...  so I guess it passes.If the Yes / No meter on Steam is split on either side of the 50 mark, this game gets a 51 and therefore gets a Yes recommendation.I like to eat hot dogs to wipe away my bullet wounds irl so this really speaks to me.
