Do not buy this product, or any product associated with Rockstar Games or TakeTwo Interactive until theyve taken steps to apologize for and assure consumers they will take no further action such as what has happened recently you can read about below.Rockstar Games, and their publisher TakeTwo Interactive sent a cease and desist to the developers of OpenIV, a tool made for modding GTA and allowing the games to thrive years after release. So much time and effort put into the tool so that people could make the game their own and its all gone due to the greed of Rockstar and TakeTwo. I will never buy another Rockstar game after this and it was bad enough as it was with them turning onlline play from something basic and fun in GTA IV into a greed propeled grindfest.
