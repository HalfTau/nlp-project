great fun game.  though get confused by characters. bored sometimes, but it becomes a whole different game once you find the codes. seriously like the Matrix.you Need to face the windows live. then win 8.1 that cannot allow you to install windows live. then error 2502 and error 2503 which means you cannot install windows live by yourself. nice one Microsoft, once again the evil Rockstar is stopped.
