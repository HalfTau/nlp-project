The game is work perfectly in offline mode but the online is dead so if you care about online DONT BUY IT but if you dont I recommend it to u  GTA IV is fun game and has a good graphics for 2009  and nice story mode I played the game in PS3  in 2010 and now in 2016 Im flashback my great memories with this nice game actually I dont care about online mode in IV and EFLC not in gta V .
