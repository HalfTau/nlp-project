Game does not work. Will not launch without Windows Live which no longer existsRockstar has not done anything about this and never will.DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEupdate about a year later and still same issue. There IS NO Windows Live any more which the game requires to run. Check the right side of the store page where it says it requires a Games for Windows Live account... hah! good luck with that.. It might as well say Requires you to go back in time to play this game... no, litterally!
