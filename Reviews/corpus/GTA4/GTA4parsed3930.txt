Its difficult to give this game a definitive thumbs up or thumbs down.In terms of fun alone, get the game. The story is much better than GTA V, the driving and shooting is harder, but better in my opinion. Niko Bellic is a very likeable character, and you can spill out hundreds of hours just goofing around in Liberty City. For a GTA, or open world fan, you have to play GTA IV. Is it better than GTA V? In some ways yes, and some ways no. It really depends on what you like in a game.The optimization of this game is quite poor. My PC can run Battlefield 1 at high/ultra settings with very little stutter. However, GTA 4 does not run smoothly at ultra settings, and you have to turn the settings down significantly to avoid stutter.Games for Windows Live is the worst game service that currently exists in my opinion. Once you get through all of that garbage, and theres A LOT of garbage, you can finally enjoy the game.Overall, GTA IV as a game, is an enjoyable experience.
