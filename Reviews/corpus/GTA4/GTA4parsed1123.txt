My favorite Grand Theft Auto game ever.Best physics.Grat graphics.  can be even better if you install some mods souch as IVEnchancer I think?.Big map.  can be alot bigger if you install some mods that can truly transform the game.Beautiful car mods and a giant modding community.Ever wanted to drive a piano and race with it? Yea...Great story and loads of things to do. Can become kinda empty after some time... But the mods got you covered DThe thing I HATE ROCKSTAR AND MICROSOFT SOCIAL CRAP.Legit I have to use some cracks that allow me to save the game as I cannot sign in to microoft thingie...Overall a great game!
