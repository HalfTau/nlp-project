Grand Theft Auto IVThe Grand Theft Auto series have positively surprised me with theyr storrys and theyr Graphics.Even the old titles have had verry Advanced Graphics for theyr time.Grand Theft Auto IV is a Game that you could comme back at anny time and enjoy the Game and the Storyline.The Game Physics are OK and the Missions are donne well as they get harder the more you progress into the game.In my oppinion Grant Theft Auto IV is one of the Best Titles of Grand Theft Auto besides Vice City and San Andreas.My RatingsGraphics 8/10 for theyr time pretty grate. still had somme things that could be fixed. Otherwise grate.Physics 7/10 Somme times delayed responses and a way to hard Flying Control for First time Gamers.Story 10/10 Interesting background story. The player often has two opportunitys to choose how to continue with the story and with that a possibility of two endings of the game. Lots of side missions to master and a fairly big Map to exploreI would recoment it to everyone who liked anny part of Grand Theft Auto or a game of simmilair concept!
