Decent game, steering is done horribly in comparison of other GTA titles, many features and cars from San Andreas dont exist in this fighter jet, parachute, etc and the missions are uninspired and repetitive at best. Storyline is not as compelling as some wished me to think.What makes this game a crap pile is the port to PC controls are horrible. The last mission requires you to repeatedly tap space  but this changes the view in the helicopter youre trying to get into, rather than pulling you into it. Changing hotkeys didnt fix this issue, and Rockstar never issued a patch for it.Wont be installing the addons I bought, uninstalling. Disappointed.
