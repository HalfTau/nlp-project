As to a true Rockstar fashion, GTA IV is nothing but brilliant. Though in vehicle department it has a noticable regression, it more than makes up for it with an engaging storytelling, and bunch of new gameplay mechanics. It has introduced new levels of realism into the genre and to the series, for better or for worse.Though its praised all around, the PC port has a bunch of serious flaws. Most of them are technical. The biggest complaint has to be the optimization. It is sometimes bellow acceptible, even when the GPU is more than capable of running this game. For example, though considerably weak, GeForce 520M manages to run Max Payne 3 on medium settings rather well. Thats the same for more recent games like Far Cry 3 or Tomb Raider. However, that cannot be said for this title. Because of constant lag issues, the game sometimes becomes unplayable. The issue seems to be less aparent in Episodes from LC, but I wonder why these tweeks werent introduced on GTA IV that runs on the same engine.That said, I still recommend this title, but do have in mind to run this on a more capable system, because even to this day GTA IV is not very keen on working with medium powered hardware.
