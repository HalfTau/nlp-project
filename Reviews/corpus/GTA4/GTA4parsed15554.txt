This is a really damn good game. But here is why Im making this a negative review.Games for Windows Live DRM. Yep. This brokenis really bad, so bad in fact that Microsoft said it will be shutting it down. But this has had a big impact on all of the games using GfWL, which is a problem. Most companies removed it, which caused very stressful game save removals, some kind of solved it, but Rockstar Games apparently arent doing anything about this. Which is sad.Not only do you need GfWL to save games, but also to play on multiplayer. Which means third party multiplayer clients will be the only way of playing the game online and with your friends. People have created dll files to bypass GfWL, but what about multiplayer? Common, Rockstar!Hopefully Rockstar Games will pull the dreadful GfWL out of GTA IVs  and everyone will move on. Again, Im extremely sorry to make this a negative review.P.S. Rockstar Games Social Club, or RGSC for short, is actually a pretty good software/site. I like it, personally, it has its problems, but all in all its ok.
