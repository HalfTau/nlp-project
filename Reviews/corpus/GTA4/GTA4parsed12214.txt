Games For Windows Live doesnt work.Rockstar Social Club doesnt work.There is zero optimization for Windows 8.1If your graphics card has a higher memory than 2 GB, the game will think that it is lower than 2 GB and set all graphics to the lowest setting.This game is a nightmare to run properly. I give up. Rockstar and Windows can shove my fist down their greedy corporate throats.0/10 Would not recommend to my worst enemy.
