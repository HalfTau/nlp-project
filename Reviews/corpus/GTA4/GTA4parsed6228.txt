DO NOT DOWNLOADDo yourself a favor and skip this game. You might be one of the lucky ones that makes it through and gets to play. You may even be someone who is patient enough to trouble shoot a video game for thirty to forty five minutes to maybe get to play. For everone else screw this   I wish I had read the reviews. Seriously, how did Steam and Rockstar eff this up?!
