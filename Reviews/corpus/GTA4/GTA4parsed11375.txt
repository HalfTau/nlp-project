Although the game itself is probably good, I refuse to play this game due to the bloatware that they FORCE you to use. Want to save your game? NOPE! You NEED a windows live account.Also, this game has huge optimization problems with windows 8. Ive experienced infinite loading screens, crashes with no message, etc.Thankfully, I bought this game when it was on sale for 5. I could have lost more, but its still 5 down the drain because I could have bought another game with that 5.Uninstalled the game, and uninstalled the bloatware.This game took 30 minutes for me to download since I have good internet. Others would have to wait for hours just to get the game installed. Then i spent the 34 minutes of gametime to troubleshoot the game and to discover that i need to install bloatware. Took me 3 minutes to uninstall everything. What a waste of my time. I should have played something else.
