Dont get me wrong, the game it self is great but the pc version have some major problems.Windows live account is really annoying, i dont know if other people could play online but i couldnt.The game is so poorly optimized for pc, all my pc specs are way higher than what the game recommends, i set every single option to low and it still lags so much i couldnt play it for more than 12 hours
