GTA IV is a pretty solid game, with an interesting story and some fun gunplay. The feel of shooting someone in GTA IV is brilliant, and extremely satisfying.Driving in GTA IV is alright. The controls feel sluggish, but its not hard to do. Keep in mind, I am playing with a keyboard and mouse and not a controller.FLYING in GTA IV is terrible. I got to the helicopter mission and have yet to progress, because flying in this game is such a miserable experience. GTA IV is an action game, and is by no means a simulator, but I feel like they tried to make flying helicopters in GTA IV too realistic. Trying to fly anything that has semirealistic controls with a keyboard and mouse is a traumatizing experience that I do not wish on anyone.Aside from that? Pretty solid game, in my opinion. I would only suggest buying this game if you have a controller, however, as I feel it would make the entire experience much more enjoyable.
