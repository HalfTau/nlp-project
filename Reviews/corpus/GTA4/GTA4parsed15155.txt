Unable to really play this game on multiple windows installs. Possibly one of the buggiest games I have ever had the majesty to install. The equivalent of installing every antivirus on the market on one machine and letting them fight each other.I was able to drive around for a while after killing my passenger of course, but that soon ended with a blue screen telling me memory was hosed.This ranks up there with malware and the ILOVEYOU virus. Ranks slightly over a squared off kick to the old beanbag though..I would classify this as a 1.7/10   The .7 for the pretty blue colors it will show you
