Horribly buggy mess. Never have I had so much troubles playing a game. At first I could not get it to accept the steam key. Then I found out that I could play without game key but it would turn off multiplayer. Nevermind, I thought. In the game its barely playable there are lots of textures that would not load have fun driving into an invisible wall and killing yourself and I cant play with decent graphics settings even if my computer should easily run it even after trying a good dozen of fixes.If I had to not recommend a single game in my library, it would be that one. Its litteraly broken.
