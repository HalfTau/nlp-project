So game! Much graphics! Very gameplay! that was my thoughts when I bought this game. Social Club? GFWL? Is OK. Takes only few minutes more. And... Sorry, mate, your PC is too weak for this game. OK, one day I will play it, one day.Years passed and I got much better PC with Windows 8 onboard. Stop, what? GFWL is not supported anymore? OK, just need to find some solutions. It will take only few minutes more... or hours of installing/deinstalling/updating/reboot/register, but finally it works! Few fun days and I reached final mission.What? You cant? Sorry, mate, your PC is too strong for this game and you need to decrease your FPS to 30 and maximal graphics settings will not help you to do this. Thats the story. Purchase this game if you want same problems as mine.
