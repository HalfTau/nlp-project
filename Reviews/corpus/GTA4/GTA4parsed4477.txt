They updated it, I mean it barely worked before, it was on low res but hey, it at keast launched. Now it LITERALLY doesnt work. Im guessing they only updated it to take out the music because its been out for 10 years, like they did with San Andreas. This is bs, I tried stopping the update but I guess it updated when I wasnt looking. What a bs port.
