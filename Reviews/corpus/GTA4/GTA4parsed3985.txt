 I love this game. I played theout of it on PS3, then on PC ing around with mods. But I cannot recommend this game. After the latest patch the game no longer starts. Games for Windows Live has always been  but there were ways around it, either by just using it or using a mod called Xlive which removed the games dependency for it. However Xlive has been rendered obsolete by this newest patch and GFWLs pressence reinforced when it should have been removed. And to top it all off, GFWL is completely ing broken. I always get a Gamesforwindowslive.exe has stopped working message. Rockstar has killed the game. R.I.P. GTA IV, you will be missed.
