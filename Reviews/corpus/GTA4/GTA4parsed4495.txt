This game is finally running on steam as it should with the latest 2016 update that allows it to run on modern PCs. Windows live is still enabled to be used but this is a good thing because achievments are still able to be earned on your Xbox profile. At purchase a few years ago i was really excited to try this game out with mods but the game was really unplayable and was a pain to fix. I never even made it to the actual game because it would go crazy and wouldnt stay at one part of the menu, NOW its all fixed,fully playble and enjoyable. A must buy just like all the previous installments
