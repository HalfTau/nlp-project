Roman and I go drinking.Cops see Roman and I trying to drive home drunk.Drunk police pursuit insues, I drive over railing and onto the beachside to escape police.Car is too damaged to drive, catches on fire.Roman is stuck in between the car and the railing, he dies when the car explodes, and Im too drunk to walk away from the burning flames, and I die a slow, fiery death because I was too drunk to escape.10/10 would get drunk again.
