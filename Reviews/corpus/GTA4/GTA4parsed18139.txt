A very good game but it has many flaws.1. it is well known that the game was not well ported to the PC, so it suffers of constant lag spikes and stuttering unless you have a REALLY beefy computer.2. I bought this game for 20 dollars, and spent like 3 days searching for ways to fix the lag spike, by creating some archives in the game directory, commandlines that partially fixes the problems.3. I cannot get to online gaming, it isnt enough that the game pleads for accounts just like a world of warcraft junkie one for Rockstar Social Network and another one for Games For Windows Live. GFWL is no more, so we cant go online until they patch the game, which dissapointed me a lot.Letting pass those flaws, its a great game, really immersive and you get really into the characters Niko  Roman Bellic And I recommend this PCport ONLY if you were willing to play this game for a long time like me, and not having neither a XBOX360 or PS3, if you satisfy those conditions, your money will be wellspent.
