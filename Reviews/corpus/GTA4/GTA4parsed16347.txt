Do what you want to feel free, to go crazy, get cars, and live the bad life, then buy it. Interesting campaign, if you have played and liked any GTA title, you will like this one too. Basically its a better city, better graphics than its predecessor, big story, lots of missions, really worth if you have time to play, and also if youre having a bad day you can play it and get all your rage out. Single player its ok, there is some debate about if its better than previous GTA titles, but if you like this kind of games, then you wont be disappointed. Also if you get tired of single player you can go multiplayer, with friends its better.
