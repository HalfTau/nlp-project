We all know GTA IV is a great game, so Ill tell you whats notsogreat about this particular version. The port to PC is terrible. Games for windows live is a nightmare, especially if you want to play on a computer that isnt hooked up to the internet. Not to mention no optimization AT ALL was done on this game. Despite being almost a decade old it still is more intensive than a lot more modern games. Im no graphics queen, but the muddy, lowres textures in this game are just awful. Unfortunately I doubt rockstar will ever care to fix these crippling problems...
