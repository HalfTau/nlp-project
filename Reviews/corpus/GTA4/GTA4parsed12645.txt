One most over rated games/ series ever.The missions/ story is way to linear,  the rules of the world constantly change to suit the story E.g. if youre giving chase you can not apprehend your target till the specified time regardless what you do, so at time you waste ammunition or a vehicle when the outcome is predeterminedThe end mission is just plain fustrating its very long and very fragile, with no midway saves, I never completed it which sucked playing through the whole game just to get unraveled at the endGame play is okControlling cars and bikes, boats is mostly straight forward. The helicopter is slightly difficult, and mastering it is required for end mission.
