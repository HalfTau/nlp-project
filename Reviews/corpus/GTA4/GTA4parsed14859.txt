Grand Theft Auto IV is just one of those games that you simply cant put down. Its amazing. The story is great, running people over on the sidewalks is great, shooting cops in a hospital and seeing how long you can last is great... Everything about it is great. Except for Windows Live which is just stupid and my gametime not saving to steam yes I have played much more then 20 hours when writing this it just doesnt show, but none the less a great game. 10/10... its a total gem.
