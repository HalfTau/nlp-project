This is the first GTA game Ive ever actually played. It has a very nice main story plus several side quests. Additionally, youre free to do whatever you want while you arent in the middle of a quest.Driving experience could be highly improved but I understand thats not the point of the game, even considering that you have to spend most of the time in a vehicle.
