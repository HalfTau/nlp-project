it runs nicley and is a great game overall but should not be on pc at all cause it is very confusing of how to play it. you need to download windows live and make a windows account which sucks and you cant save the game because you NEED an account. though if you dont need to worry about that then it runs on medium on most low end computers so it is a good game but it still is also very hard to play with the controls but i recomend it if you dont have a console cause its better on that.
