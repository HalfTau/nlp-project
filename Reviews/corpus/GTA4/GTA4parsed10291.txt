awesome game. the games protagonist is really likeable, the story is great, gameplay is brilliant  except that absolutely every car in the game steers like a ing boat on wheels , and its really addicting. the only negative thing about gta4 is that it is REALLY hard to get working properly  come on, games for windows live?? . i also hat to limit my framerate to 30fps because gta4 on pc is a terrible port and doesnt run at constant fps unless you have a decent CPU in your pc... its heavily cpu based, your gpu doesnt matter too much. needless to say, the game is really fun if youve done all the troubleshooting and you should definetly get the complete edition for these cheap 7,49, like I did.
