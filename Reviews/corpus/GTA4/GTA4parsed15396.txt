GTA 4 is a great game to play if youve got time to waste. To be honest, 60 of the people playing this arent even following the missions. Theyre just doing random sht and mods.. Mods... MODS! The storyline is great. Im having fun with the story than doing random stuff here. I love this game so much. You can do everything. Goat Simulator? Boom. Just add a mod in this game. Max Payne? Done! Add mod. Wanna be Iron Man? Well, mod! Some say GTA IVs story is still better than GTA V but all they need is the GTA V graphics. Bam! GTA V mods to GTA IV. Now youre playing GTA IV with GTA Vs graphics. This game is currently one of the most modded game. And the thing about this I love is that you could bring your mods to Multiplayer! Doing random sht alone isnt as fun as doing random sht with your friends!  The possibilities of this game are endless!
