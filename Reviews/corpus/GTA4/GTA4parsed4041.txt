Steely Wheely Auto Mobeely IV is a crime game where you play in the most depressing city ever. The city is depressing because they do not have The Fresh Prince of BelAir on DVD.This game is also the only game that is not a minecraft rip off.10/10  IGN.ACTUAL REVIEWGrand Theft Auto IV is a great game. Sure, its not as polished as Grand Theft Auto V, or as new or shiny. But its still a masterpiece.The driving is definetely not as good as in V in my opinion, but this ones honestly subjective.I found the storyline to be much more interesting and fleshed out than Vs, but this game seemed to take a lesser focus on gameplay and more on Story.Niko Bellic is awesome. I found him to be much more of a badass and much more interesting than Michael, Franklin or Trevor.The game is definetely worth the price of 19.99. Grab it now.
