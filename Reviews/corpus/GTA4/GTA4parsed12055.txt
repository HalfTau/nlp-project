After 8 years, R has finally released a patch fixing some of the issues in my original review. I would still like to give the game a neutral recommendation on Steam due to the PC version generally having issues, but as I said before, get the game on a sale.ORIGINAL REVIEWThe game is so poorly optimized the testers couldnt even run the game well enough to discover that YOU CANNOT FINISH THE GAME ON 60 FPS.To be fair  dont get me wrong, the game is fun, but its quite obvious they didnt care about making the game run on PC. I had to spend several minutes tweaking the graphics settings to get 5060 FPS, mind that my computer can run pretty much all games that came out before 2012 on max.The cover system is sluggish, the default car camera is the worst one in all GTA games Ive played, and the mission replay system is frustrating not that it wasnt in the previous games. And of course a game breaking bug thats still there 7 years after release. But aside all that, its still an enjoyable game, just not for the full price.Get it on a sale. And open Google to find mods that fix the game, because Rockstar cant.
