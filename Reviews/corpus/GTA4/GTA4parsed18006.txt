When I look back in ten years at this game its going to be one of those euphoric nostalgia trips that elegantly wofts me into a daze about the good ol days when Rockstar finally made the leap from dated hardware to the PS3 and Xbox 360... coming to the PC a year later.A pretty sizable chunk of my life has been spent playing this game. I played through the story about three or four times, and on PC with a different set of mods each time. Hundreds of hours were spent on the multiplayer and the addon Episodes of Liberty City as well.While its no successor to San Andreas in the quirks department, GTA IV has its heart set on a gritty, realistic, realworld story of revenge, decorated with the typical satire and rediculous characters. Certainly a great experience over again. 9 / 10
