Bought this to gain access to multiplayer, Im glad I wasted money on it. Social Club wont work. Fix your stuff please.EDIT I now recommend this game because of the multiplayer, yes. I did not care much about the story because I have done it already, but if youre reading this because you maybe wanted to know about the main game itself, its probably worth if you buy it on a sale, but original price? Not really, theres alot of games you couldve bought instead of this. But just for the lulz itself, I still recomemend this game, there sure is alot of downsides for this, but who cares? You can still mod the game, just downgrade to game version 1.0.7.0 and youre good. Im sorry but Im not a really good reviewer, infact, this is my first edited review.Note that theres only a few people that play multiplayer on this game, not sure if youd like it or not, but its still worth buying on a sale for using mods, story? Id say its pretty good, but idk.Thanks for wasting your time reading this review. Have a nice day.
