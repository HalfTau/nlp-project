After loging in to three different accounts to play this pile of console trash. Dealing with the absolute nightmare of trying to navigate to multiplayer. Having no control of which game you join. Playing with a group of children and stoners who blast the mic. Cars spinning constantly out of control making me question if the programers have ever driven a car before. This is a 5 game.
