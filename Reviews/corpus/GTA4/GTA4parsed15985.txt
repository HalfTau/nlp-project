I really loved this game for Xbox but sadly my Xbox broke and so I bought a computer but I thought a Mac would be great, then I bought all GTA games for my Steam account and I tried downloading GTA 4 and it was a only Windows game, I would really love it if you developers at Rockstar made this game for Mac along with GTA 5.
