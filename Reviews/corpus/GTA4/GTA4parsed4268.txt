GTAseries always have great story and comedy, memorable characters, great voice acting, memorable action scenes, and great open world with details here and there. But I never like the combat and driving mechanic. Not to mention if you fail a mission, you have to restart from the beginning, driving the same road, listening the same talk, etc. Rockstar never bothered to change these since the games sold billions anyway and so here we are with GTA4 that have the same awful combat and driving mechanic as the previous games.Overall, this is still a fun game to play. I Nico was dating one of the GF, took her to a club, got drunk, driving her home in my yellow Lambo, and instead of getting a hot coffee from her, I got arrested for DUI instead. Seriously, have you ever been arrested for DUI in a game before? If you havent, then in this game you can.PS  If you have modern PC with multicores CPU, the final story mission are buggy. You have to set the app to run only on 2 cores resulting in lower FPS to avoid the bug and able to complete the mission.
