Ive had GTA IV and the GTA IV Episodes from Liberty City prior to this on the Playstation 3.This game is a huge defining leap from GTA San Andreas which was released back in 2005.A whole new world with stunning details, more interactive gameplay and it allows us to make choices which alter the minority of the storyline.Its been 6 years since its release date but overall this game is still decent.
