A land of opportunity! Gta IV is pretty amazing, bringing alot more to the gta series and full of Action, s, driving, killing, stabbing, shooting, eating hot dogs, BOWLING with your cousin Roman. This game is a blast to play with not that bad of a story line and fun to play with friends. WARNING This game is quite badly ported so I would reccomend quite  a beafy computer as it is not easy to run.
