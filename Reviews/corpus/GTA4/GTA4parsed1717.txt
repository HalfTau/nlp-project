Okay, Rockstar and Take Two may have made a collossal error with the banning of offline mods and OpenIV and everything...but thats all fixed now. Plus we just cant let that get in the way of what is an incredible game.Grand Theft Auto IV is one of the best games I have ever played. When this first came out, my jaw dropped looking at these unbelievable stunning visuals and outstanding gameplay.Some would say the story is incredibly dark and sombre but I love that about this game as it was and is a crisp new take on the GTA style of storytelling, by adding some dark noireesque grit to the storytelling and having a rise and fall of the gangster element to it as well. In ways, it reminded me of GTA III with its dark foggy atmosphere but still managed to be completely original!I look at GTA V and then GTA IV and love them both in their own unique way, because even though they are GTA games, they are completely different! They feel different, they look different, they play different, etc. But the big thing that keeps me coming back to GTA IV more than GTA V are the characters and that nostalgia of the first time I saw one of the GTA franchises evolve so drastically since GTA III from its predecessors.GTA IV is a masterpiece. Its characters are interesting the story plays out so damn well! Its certainly in my top 20, if not my top 10 and I give it a solid 5/5!Very few open world games compare to this wonderfully balanced, carefully constructed and spectacularly detailed world. Some of those that do are Rockstar games themselves like the amazing RDR!GTA IV on the PC is incredibly fun even now in 2017! It stands the test of time as far as Im concerned! Console or PC, whatever your preference is, play this game and if you already have, play it again!
