As many others have stated. The game is simply broken. You cant save and you cant go online. RS social club doesnt let you sign in, nor does windows live. I tried many youtube sources for how to fix it and after hours of trying with no success I concede. Valve, you really need to get a grip on thisbecuase this isnt the first game Ive bought that I cant play. If a game has known issues it should be clearly stated before checkout. I will not buy anything that works with windows live from this point forward.
