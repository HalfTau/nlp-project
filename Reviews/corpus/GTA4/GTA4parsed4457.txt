Ok, since R released the patch, I decided to give this game another try and surprisingly it works.I had to download XLiveLess files to disable GFWL and the code for validating the GTA IV part in SecuROM doesnt work even though EFLC does stern emails aplenty, but it EFLC at least functions. Thats more than I can say for when I downloaded this prepatch.A lot of postpatch reviews seem to be complaining about it not running that well but that hasnt been a problem at all for me. I have an i5 4690K and a 750 Ti and Im at a constant 60 on high/very high settings. Anything better that shouldnt cause any problems.
