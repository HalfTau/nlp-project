I had seen beautiful screenshots from the PC version of this game and after about 2 hours of trying to get this thing to run on my PC, I think those screenshots must have come from within Rockstar.First, the game wouldnt start at all, requiring me to create some login info. I dont want to log in to play the offline version of a game I just paid you money for, plain and simple.After the login info was sorted out, the game wouldnt start for some other reason. Apparently everyone else has this problem because I found some YouTube video of a Vietnamese guy barking out instructions like Im trying to land on the ing moon instead of launching a 5 year old vidya game. I follow his commands and relaunch...800x5XX. I go to the Options screen to change this and it WILL NOT LET ME. It says my graphics card cant handle anything more than the lowest settings. I have 8GB RAM and a GTX970.  you Rockstar, Im going home.
