This is a genuinely great game, but jesus christ the PC port is horrific. You have to deal with first Social Club which 90 of the time refused to let me log in even with resetting my password, and then you have to deal with Games for Windows Live which requires a workaround to even work on Windows 10. This isnt even including the serious performance issues and technical bugs and glitches that the port has. My PC has a serious problem with characters and NPCs going invisible after a period of time, and to even get that far, I had to set launch options to remove the stupid VRAM limit that doesnt function properly.This is a good game, but I suggest buying it on consoles or just staying away. Its clear Rockstar just doesnt care as they havent bothered trying to fix it over all these years its been available.
