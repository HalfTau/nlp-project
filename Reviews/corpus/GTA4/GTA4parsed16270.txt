Car handling PoorWeapons PoorMissions Poor as a hobo with no clothes onDont get me wrong, I LOVE this game. But all of the reasons lisited make this game suck so much that i would rather play a Cod  Game and become a 12 year old Cod fanboy and spam bad reviews about games that arent Cod. Save your 20.00 if you want to play the actual missions, because they involve you chasing some person in a high speed chase with the poor car control.EDIT Dont think mods will bail you out on this one, you touch one file and the whole game breaks
