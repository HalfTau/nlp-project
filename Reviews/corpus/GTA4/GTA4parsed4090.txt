So Rockstar did some update/fix to this game in hopes of solving a gpu compatibility issue. The patch is fine and now you can run the game at improved framerates. The only issue is that disabling  Vsync makes the framerate very unstable so its better to turn it on even if you are playing with Freesync activated.It still has Games for Windows Live, now with a new hat but i dont mind about it to be honest. Sometimes it needs some reading to run it properly but the steam board has all the info you need.GTA IV is an amazing game because of its well written script, driving mechanics, fun missions and great graphics. It comes as a shock to people who only played San Andreas so its pretty easy to think the game is a downgrade because you cant get haircuts or improve your car. But the engine, oh boy, its incredible. Not even GTA V has such refined physics or AI.Its like like GTA III with moar things to do and a cover system.
