Grand Theft Auto IV means the matureness for Rockstar, abandoning though not completely all its insane humor and arcade action, this chapter of Niko Bellic captures the essence of the american society with black humor, great narrative and the characteristic sandbox gameplay that the franchise has featured all this years. For the PC version all stays the same only the great technical optimization, the original videoeditor and the 32 players online modes are present as news. But, when you leave a masterpiece exactly the same, its a right move.
