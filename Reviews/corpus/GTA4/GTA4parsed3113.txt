PC version is criminally underated. If you just remove Live youre in for a real treat. Awesome story, atmosphere and attention to detail. Of course, the mods are what make this version miles better than any console release.Its pretty well optimized considering what publishers thought of PC gaming during the 2000s. Obvious console port, but still very playable.
