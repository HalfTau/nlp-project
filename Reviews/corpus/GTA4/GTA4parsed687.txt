Bad vehicle controls the cars skid when you reverse for a second and then accelerate forward. Oh and every time you slow  down even from a moderate speed. You turn but the car doesnt.Why steal a car see title of game if it handles so maddeningly? Thats a word now.When on foot, the camera manual control and auto turn makes me dizzy. I steal cars just so the camera stops swinging around. Then I crash said cars into buildings because they dont turn, even yes, when I hit hard or tap the breaks before I start the turn. Its just not fun to walk, run, or drive.The cinematic scenes are long and cause you to become a bystander in the story, and then you do the tedious task you probably didnt want to do in the first place. No thanks.
