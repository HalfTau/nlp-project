Had to get round gfwl as I couldnt start the game otherwise. Downloaded the latest version and agreed new rules, it still didnt work. Not overly impressed, but easily fixed.I have the game running just passably well on my q6600 OC 3.2GHz at 2560x1600, 4GB RAM, 6850 graphics. Runs between 3055 fps at these medium settings with high textures and looks okay to me.Additional settingsturned off camera record2x anisotropic252520 for draw distance etcThe game seems fun, and well worth it at special offer.
