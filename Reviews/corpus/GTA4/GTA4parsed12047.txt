Never worked. I feel so ripped off, if I go to steam support, it directs me to rockstar and that just takes me to the forums where I cant find any support with GTA IV. The game keeps crashing and whe I look up videos on how to fix it, it just a bunch of people trying to get others to download their viruses. HUGE rip off. DONT BUY!!!
