GTA4 is a landmark of a game that introduced a compelling platform for all currentgen systems to try out their benchmarking abilities on. This game is plagued with features that attempt to make the game more than it is.Simply put. This game is GTA with amazing graphics, but very little gameplay. GTA 5 revitalizes these graphics as well as keeps the gameplay in tact. GTA4 using the RAGE engine, allows the devs to get used to their tools and GTA4 is just a stepping stone in the process of just that.GTA4 has a great storyline, in my opinion, with the main pro/antagnonist, Niko Bellic, just coming off the boat to realize his great cousin Roman, had lied to him about all the success he claimed to have.Where GTA4 really shines, is both in vehicle and multiplayer gameplay. Where people are have completely torn the game apart and created mods for this fanatastic New York settlement, its a little bit unnerving that Rockstar hasnt employed these fine artists into making their games even better. Multiplayer Mod Support Niko Bellic Atmosphere Storyline Characters Lack of content Pales in gameplay compared to GTA SA Laggy unoptimized engine
