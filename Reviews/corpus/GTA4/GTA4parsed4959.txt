Terrible, dont buy this!!First of all Rockstar Social Club isnt working, then when I finally got into the game and set the resolution from the default setting lowest of the low to 1080 I tried story mode.... Here the real fun began.I had to login to windows live games!! So i logged it with some backup email, it looked like it was working but then it said i had to update windows live games and this update kept failing. So I cant even play this game and I will refund it!To fix this i have to download some 3rd party dll file that bypasses this windows live crap! DONT BUY THIS!!
