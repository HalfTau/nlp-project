Complete crap to be honest. I dont know if Steam is trying to scam you or anything like that or if its rockstar games the people who made this game but after the day you download this game you wont be able to play it because when it loads up it will ask you to go to sign into your rockstar social club account even tho theres no thing to type in your username/email or password. Then theres the play button that you go to click to play the game and when you click it to play the game it will show a blue circle like a loading thing next to your mouse cursor to start the game but then the blue circle disapears and nothing else happens after that. So basically if you want to waster 30 out of your wallet then go right ahead and buy this. Like I said though right when you buy it you can play it BUT after like a day the game will do that glitch and for me on a Windows 10 computer that just has been made just for gaming and with a graphics card to run gta 5 WITH MODS its really stupid that it does this. I swear I looked up every possible way to fix it and I tried them all and they dont work at all. The lastest video or post that someone made about fixing this glitch was around October in 2016. That was 2 years ago because now its 2018 so there is no possible way of fixing this glitch. If anyone actually knows how to fix this then tell me because I really want to know lol. Sorry for the rant but I just really wanted to get this out there. Hopefully Steam reads this and can stop scamming people or maybe fix this glitch.
