I like this game. The story is really nice and the game feels so real driving through the streets. However, this doesnt mean the PC version is amazing. First of all, the performance is awful. After several hours of tweaks and mods, the game finally runs at a nice 60fps but it would be great if they had optimized it well from the beginning. I have had no issues with GFWL yet so I have no comment on that. I also havent had any of the nightmare errors trying to play it, I just installed it and it worked from the start. If you are a fan of the Grand theft auto series or you enjoyed this game on consoles and have a decent computer, you will probably be fine with this. If you are new to grand theft auto, Id reccomend either just playing GTA4 on console or playing a different grand theft auto game.
