This game simply isnt playable. Oh, it runs. But the drops in FPS are killer. It will happen seemingly entirely at random, and no change to the settings seems to help. Honesly, the only way you can HOPE to get anything out of this game is if you cheat to make sure the FPS drops dont lead to your untimely demise, and then all you can really get out of it is the story, since the rest of the time youre too frustrated to enjoy yourself.Its really sad, because this game should have been quite nice to play on the PC. Instead, its an honest headache. With the sequel now released, the only reason you should ever pick up this title is if its priced under 3.00 and you really want to know about previous GTA games.All of this isnt even mentioning the headache you have to go through in order to remove the Windows Live requirement from the game and then downgrade it to a previous patch in order to play with all the original music and modding capabilities. If youre not computer savvy enough to deal with that last sentence, stay far, far away.
