I realize this game is very old now in regard to both timeline and releases as GTA V has been floating around on consoles for a bit. However this is still a very fun game to play though. The story is well thought out and the graphics MUCH improved over the previous GTA title San Andreas. On top of that, it seems to mod fairly well, and that adds a new layer of gameplay to this title. If youre into the GTA universe, this is one to definitely pick up and enjoy.
