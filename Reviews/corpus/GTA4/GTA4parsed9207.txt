I couldnt even get the stupid game installed properly and I tried twice. It shouldnt be a system issue since this game was released in 08 and I know for a fact I have the hardware/software capable of running this game. It keeps saying Im missing some xlive.dll file but I cant find any real help anywhere for it online. I want my 20 dollars back....
