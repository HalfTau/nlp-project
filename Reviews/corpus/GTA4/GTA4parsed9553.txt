This game was purchased with the GTA Collection primarily for multiplayer. Let me do a recap of the gaming experience of GTA IV This game runs like trash on good hardware i.e. the frame rate is all over the place despite having a R9 290X. Yeah, had to make a commandline modification to get this trash game to recognize my 4gb VRAM buffer. It didnt seem to help the performance any. GFWL is not helping this trash game any. How many steps do I have to take before I can play online? I dont remember having to do all this on my Xbox 360. Dont waste your time with this game and good luck running this game on the recommended specs listed. Having playable frames on low settings is what youre going to get with the recommended settings. No point in playing a newer GTA that looks worse than GTA SA.
