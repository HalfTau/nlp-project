Now this game is great, but im going to talk about the problems in this review.THIS GAME DOESNT WORK. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY TO PORT A GAME FROM CONSOLES. IF U WERE WATCHING YOUTUBERS HAVING FUN WITH THIS GAME U WILL BE SHOCKED AT HOW STTY THIS PORT IS. THIS GAME REQUIRES 2 ACCOUNTS THAT TOOK ME OVER AN HOUR TO MAKE. AND AFTER THAT. NOTHING im fking serious. IT EVEN SAYS THAT U DONT NEED THESE USELESS ACCOUNTS TO PLAY THE SINGLEPLAYER, BUT WHEN U SELECT THAT IT JUST EXITS U OUT OF THE GAME. IF U WANT OPEN WORLD GET SAINTS ROW. IF U WANT A FUNCTIONAL GAME GET ANYTHING ELSE. TOOK MY MONEY WITH JACK TO OFFER. Okay im done, buy this amazing game on the consoles its much better.
