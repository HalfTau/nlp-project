Old asbut still in the top 3 games ive ever played. this game was spectacular, now despite the morals of the game XD it had a great story, and a likeable main character... however if you were to add mods the games insane! Ever wanted to fight off the hulk as iron man? Ever want to play as spiderman and screw up villains want to cruise the streets as a police officer or as freaking batman? wanted to go Bowling with cousin Roman as a horse?11/10 would bowl again.
