Just spent my moniez on useless crap. When you install it, u have to sign in XBOX Live If you dont have your account, sign in Microsoft, then sign in here. Then, search in the internet for fing hours to find a patch that will fix missing textures. If you finished, you can spend nice time with your game key is incorrect message, even if you bought it on Steam. HAVE A NICE GAME!
