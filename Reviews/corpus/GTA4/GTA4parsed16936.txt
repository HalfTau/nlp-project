I dont care if GTA V comes to PC, GTA IV was, is and always be the GTA that changed the way we play. It has created the vastes modding community of any games, created communities of players dedicated to singular niches, and has created a passion for gaming like no other. From the interesting storyline, leading graphics of its time, and an amazing multiplayer environment, its hard to argue against it. Yes, it is a pretty rubbish port of the Xbox version, but that is small play compared to its positives. Unlike other games, GTA IV did not go outofdate several years later. Due to its vast modding community, people have made ENBs, graphics enhancers and many more mods to keep the game alive and thriving. This is no small part down to Rockstar, and their input to the gaming community, spuring them to thrive within their game. Well done Rockstar, Well done GTA, Well done everyone.
