Grand Theft Auto games are a lot like Elder Scrolls games. You KNOW youre going to enjoy yourself while playing them and you KNOW youre going to put hours into the game. GTA4 is no different. Its much more diverse and alive compared to its predecessor and features a lot of very likeable and unlikeable characters. It delivers a pretty stellar little storyline and provides a surprisingly fantastic multiplayer experience featuring multiple game modes to keep you entertained. The cars are delightfully diverse and while cops still dont stop you for running redlights or bumping other cars, your experience running from police is just as challenging and fun as ever.If youve played GTA games in the past, you know to expect something great. If you havent played them, friggin play them. You wont be disappointed.10/10 The game is solid from start to finish.
