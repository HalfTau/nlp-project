I have been tried to activate this game like 50 times, but the same message pops up SERIAL INVALID. Ive check my serial to all of the support sites that been written to help this activation and all of them said that my SERIAL is INVALID. Obviously, I want to get refund because nothing you can do to activate this game. To STEAM or any team that send me a WRONG SERIAL, please reply and give good reason about this mess. STEAM is a well known PC game provider and you must not make this kind of mistakes. Thanks.
