I dont get all the hate for this game, I enjoyed it for what it is. BEWARE THOUGH this game has infinite DRMs. Like, literally infinite. Well not really, but it has 3 layers of it. First theres Steam, then theres the weird Rockstar Club thing, and last but not certainly least there is the dreaded and thankfully now defunct Games For Windows Live. So playing this can be frustrating, and you might as well forgive achievements and multiplayer altogether.
