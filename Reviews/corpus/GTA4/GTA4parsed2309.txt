GTA IV continues to be the best game Ive ever played. Always a favorite, the game offers an entertaining story, thoroughly developed characters, and an immersive environment.The dialogue between Niko and Roman Bellic is endlessly hilarious. The gritty atmosphere of Liberty City perfectly recreates the reallife feel of an east coast city. The driving is realistic and the simulated motor sports are unmatched by any other racing game Ive ever played.I will forever support Rockstar because, with or without mods, their products are meticulously crafted, captivating, and highly polished gaming experiences. Exalted amongst a distressing sea of early access games, Rockstar games are worth every single dollar they cost.
