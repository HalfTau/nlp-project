Grand Theft Auto 4 is a great game. You may have to make serveral accounts for different places, but it is worth it. The game is fun to play some of the missions require some great driving skills and some get hard in high speed car chases. There is only one big problem, it is that if you are busted by police you lose all your weapons and some cash. The characters are all unique and strange in good and bad ways. The customation of your character is wide you can make him look like 47 from hitman or a shabby man in ruff clothes. Grand Theft Auto 4 is a game worth getting for laughs and gameplay.
