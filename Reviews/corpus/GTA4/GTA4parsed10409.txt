tl/dr DONT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU CAN HANDLE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CRASHES AND ERRORS! !Since i purchased the game almost 2 years ago, i encountered LOTS of trouble with the game.Not with the Gameplay itself, this runs smoothly.But with the Installation and Patching of the Game.The first thing that happened, was a complete deletion of ALL GTA IV Savegames two times! Every other savegame on my Computer wasnt involved. Only GTA IV Files were deletedAfter this the Game required a CD in my CD Slots  only reinstalling fixed this issue.Also it didnt detect my graphics card despite all drivers were up to date .. only norestrictions fixxed this.Later on an Update for Windows Live occured, which wasnt downloadable 0x8007002 error  Microsoft Support wrote that i should enable my LAN Driver.......And now. I am here.Unable to play the Game completely, since i can NOT save at all, because i cant log into Windows Live, because an Update which isnt downloadable is missing.Good job Microsoft, you screw this up.I am definitly not going to buy ANY other game again, which is somewhat related to Windows Live. Ever. Again.
