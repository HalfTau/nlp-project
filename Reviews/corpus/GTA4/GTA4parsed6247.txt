Ive got win10 and it didnt launched. To fix that problem i needed to spend 5 minutes. Those people who gives negative notes because of not running game are dumb and lazy... Game is nice and interesting. On my PC i54460, gtx 770, 8gb ram with everything high as possible works really good. Btw graphics is pretty nice its 2008 game
