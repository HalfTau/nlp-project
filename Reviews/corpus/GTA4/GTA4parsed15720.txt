Worst PC Port of all time! What is this garbage about Social Club, you click ignore, then it makes you accept the user agreement, then it wants you to login again, so you skip that BS and then it starts logging you in un Games for Windows Live...then finally you get to the game only to find out there is known bug where if your video card has more than 2GB ram...you are stuck at 800x600 resolution....I have 4 GB video ran and my monitor is 2550x1440  3 hours later on the forums etc and this disgrace of a PC port is uninstalled for good. I hear rumours GTA V has now been comfirmed for PC release in the fall...about time Rockstar...please dont mess that one up too !
