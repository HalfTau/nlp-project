I had this game on PS3 when it came out, and playing in 4k on the PC was great...up to a point.Firstly, I had to add a .txt file to the install directory to let me play in anything other than 800x600. No big deal, I can manage that.But the last mission cant be completed  its impossible to get into the helicopter.So even with the awesome ICE mod that makes everything look amazing, ultimately the game is a let down.
