I have bought and refunded this game I swear more than 3 times and I can never get this game to work. I have looked all over the web following and downloading all sorts of things to try to get this game to work. I continue to get this error seculauncher 2000 failed. I have tried everything. I love this game but Rockstar really needs to fix theiron PC
