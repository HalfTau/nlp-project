GTA IV is a great game. The story and gameplay are fantastic. The physics are amazingly realistic and revolutionary at the time. For a game that was released 7 years ago, the graphics withstands the test of time. Though the PC version has many technical issues. I tried this game in Windows 8.1 and it couldnt run without some tweaking, but it works fine in Windows 7. GTA IV is very poorly optimized for PC, you need Games for Windows Live to run it. In summary great game, terrible port.
