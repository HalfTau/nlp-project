While its definitely a terrible PC port, Id still recommend this to anyone who cant afford GTA V or is still a kid whose parents will let them play this but not V. Also, the modding community alone is ridiculously bright and expansive, and those FPS issues become a joke once you mod the game to inprove them and then install several other cool mods. I got it and EFLC before GTA V launched for just 6 dollars.
