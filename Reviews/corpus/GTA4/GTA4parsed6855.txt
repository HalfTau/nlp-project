One of the worst PC ports, not as bad as Saints Row 2 or DMC3 but still pretty terrible, the version you get is the 1.0.7.0 version which suffers from very bad performance. Also we have SecuROM, GFWL and RGSC, which are all very terrible DRM.I only reccomend this game if you buy it on a low price, install the 1.0.4.0 patch and the x liveless mod. With the patch and the x liveless mod the port is actally pretty decent but still not perfect.If you want this game for multiplayer then dont buy it, its just not worth it, the 1.0.7.0 is the only version that supports multiplayer but it suffers from terrible framerates and the DRM makes it impossible to even play the game.
