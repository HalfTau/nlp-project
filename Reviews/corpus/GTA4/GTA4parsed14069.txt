I cant recommend this peace of trash. I boot this up and it works wonders with my first playthrough. Next thing I know it prevents me from opening the damn game to begin with. Every single tutorial I checked on the web were all useless, and I cant download Games for Windows because the ing client is down. I tried. I went to the xbox site and tried downloading thatmultiple times.Wasted 20 on this when I could have spent my time investing and playing other/indie titles rather than waiting a few hours for a ing black screen.
