Contrary to most players who downvoted this game because of performance and optimization issues, I was able to play the game after tweaking the settings but it still didnt recognized at least 20 of the GPUs VRAM and I got a steady 5565fps. And still the gameplay felt below average to say the least. At the beginning it is kind of fun, but then the missions get really repetitive and the interactions with NPCs outside of the missions are annoying and time consuming. Youll spend most of your time fixing the NPCs mistakes and running errands for midlevel gangsters. After about 30 of the game youll have reached the ceiling of Nikos potential you become a midlevel muscle and thats it. Youll spend the next 70 of the game without rising up in the chain of command. Compared to the previous titles this one is really subpar, especially when it comes to voiceacting. I really disliked Nikos voiceactor, his accent was distracting and his general performance was cheesy, nothing like Ray Liotta in Vice City or Samuel L. Jackson in San Andreas. It seems to me that the studio tried to save a lot of money hiring unknown actors and counting on the games hype to be successful back in 2008.I did finish the game and AT TIMES I had fun, but to be honest most of the time I was doing missions as if they were chores, not something engaging that would deepen the story. I dont recommend this game unless you are going to play it for the sake of curiosity, otherwise I would skip directly to GTA V. Also, youll need a lot of patience with Rockstar Social Club, which at times wouldnt recognize my password even after I had changed it.PS the high point of the campaign is Ricky Gervais standup show. But you can see it on Youtube, so
