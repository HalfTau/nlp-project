The game is good per se as you might expect from GTA series. That being said, Windows Live and Social Club are useless miserable pieces of Ive spent like litteraly one hour trying to register an account and login after, to have my goddamn progress saved. And its only because a thought of paying money for the game and not being able to launch it was driving me crazy. If you played it before dont buy it now no matter what.
