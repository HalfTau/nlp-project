I ignored all of the negative reviews because I was just so excited to relive this game on my PC.That was a mistake.This is literally the worst port of any game that has ever existed. Yes, you can overcome a few of the issues, but then another one emerges. It took me an hour of downloading and fiddling to even get it to run, Then it froze, or I got infinite loading screens. Fixed that. Then I got crashes during FMVs.It simply isnt worth it, which is a real shame. Rockstar are normally known for their polish, and commitment to quality, but this is shoddy.
