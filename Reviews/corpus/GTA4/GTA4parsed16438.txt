Cons1 TERRIBLE driving physics  The cars have zero weight and will do multiple flips in the air if you hit a trash can. And good luck making a sharp turn quickly.2 TERRIBLE combat  You play Mr. Roboto trying to dodge AK47 fire. The lock on it SO BAD! You will be getting gunned down from someone directly in front of you, and you will continuously lock on to some person on the other side of the room.3 TERRIBLE save structure  Given 1 and 2 above... you will fail mission after mission and will be required to repeat 1 and 2 repeatedly There are no check points etc, absolutely nothingPros1 You dont have to play this game2 You can go buy Sleeping Dogs on Steam instead
