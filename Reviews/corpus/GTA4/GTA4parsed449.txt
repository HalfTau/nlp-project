Shame about having to join Windows Live or whatever and Xbox something I dont even have an Xbox before you can save a game. Its just blatant Microsoft ID fishing and it shouldnt be allowed. However this isnt the games fault.I played this on PS3 when it came out and wasnt a fan to be honest. After playing and finishing GTA5 years later, I went back to the PS3 and got to the final mission and failed to finish it.This PC version has been great fun so far, Im only half way through, but will play as far as I can. Having to replay the entire mission after failing  and with less ammo and body armour than previously  is still a major downer. GTA5 fixed that with auto save points during long missions, but hey, I knew this when I bought it.Its a great game for the price I bought it during the 2017 Christmas sale, so was cheap and Id be happy to recommend it. Its also nice to play it at full gfx capability now most PCs can handle it!Edit. OK, now Im getting to some of the end game missions, what a damn nuisance you lose all your ammo and armour when your stupid NPC character throws a mission by running into an explosion or at a heavily armed opponent and its Mission Failed. Even worse when he is killed by a single shot from a guy youve emptied 4 clips into and assumed was dead. Im beginning to remember why I gave up on the final PS3 mission now. Anyway, I got my moneys worth even if I quit now so not a bad game, just has annoying flaws.Edit 2. Yay, finished it  maybe I just didnt get on with the PS3 controller? Im now having fun trying to get 100. Value for money ratio getting even better!
