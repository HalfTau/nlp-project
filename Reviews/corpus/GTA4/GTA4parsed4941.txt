Firstly, this game has a lot of issues cough, cough Games for Windows live. If youre okay with sifting for solutions to crashes and failures to launch the game, then get it. Dont worry about the specs the game will stutter no matter what, its just a really crappy pc port. However if you can look past that then its a pretty ok game. The story is terrific, and the exploration aspects are still there in all their glory.
