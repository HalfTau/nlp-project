at the moment...If Microsoft can release this fantastic game from the jaws of doom which is Games for Windows Live. then i would recommend it. however at the present time the sheer process of even trying to play makes this game a sheer exercise in patience and self control. i finally got it working 2 hours after i finished downloading it.
