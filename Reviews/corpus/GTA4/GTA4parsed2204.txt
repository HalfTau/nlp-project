I played and finished GTA 4 before, but Im strongly against this for two reasons. I just got into the game again and...fing microsoft/take2/rockstar, whichever company... is slapping their big fat greasy ds all over this game. I bought THE GAME, I want to play THE GAME, yet they are spamming me to create accounts on their social media or whatever. I am being blackmailed into HAVING to be connected online if I want to play GTA 4 in SINGLE player and create a microsoft account, otherwise I cannot save my game. Wow, really??? What a  move!!! Also, I get bulls messages about nonsense achievements randomly at the top of the game. Really cuts the immersion of the game, I dont care about that nonesense! Inexcusable. This is just some tactic for them to get money from you. Its nice to have the FEATURE, but dont BLACKMAIL the user. When I declined to install window live, the game simply gave itself error messages when I tried to open it! The game would not let me play it if I did not install their adware!! !I wanted to mod the game in SINGLE player, I wanted to add a mercedes car... the devs did not make it easy to mod but thats ok and understandable. However I found out that the tool to mod the game has been made ILLEGAL. No, not against the rules of the game but outright the company hired a real life LAWYER and threatened to SUE the mod maker. WOW, what a  move!!!!! !So this company is spamming me and threatening to not save my file if I dont download their adware, and on the other hand take legal action and sue us if we, the players, try to have fun between ourselves, between the community.This is backwards and INEXCUSABLE.Its their game, they can do what they want with it, but this is my review, and I have the right to my opinion, and my opinion is that this company has absolutely no excuse and I hope the people responsible for this get some karma. I cannot have respect for a company like this.Just because its legal to be an ahole, doesnt mean you should be.
