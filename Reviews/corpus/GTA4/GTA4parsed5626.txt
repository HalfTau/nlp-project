When it worked, I loved the game, but it seems as if Rockstar doesnt really care to fix the issues with people not being able to play GTA IV. GTA IV in general, was so great with its personality and new gameplay improvements from GTA San Andreas, but now its just so difficult to get the game to run. I mean,  I dont blame Rockstar for prioritizing other things since GTA V is doing so well, but it doesnt make it right. When you have a game for sale, you should make sure it operates correctly.
