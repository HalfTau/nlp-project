This game has always run likeon PC. It runs ok now with my rig being way more powerful than when I originally played it. I beat the game on console originally. This game has the parachute locked behind the DLC paywall Ballad of Gay Tony. GTASA had jets, parachutes, motorcycles, etc all in the main game without DLC. GTA4 locks gameplay like that behind DLC, which to me is unforgivable. I actually hate this game and it is my least favorite of the entire GTA franchise. Roman, Brucie, and all the other friends you have to hang out with are annoying as all get out. The only memorable mission is No Leaf Clover to me and the final mission with the attack helicopter. and Little Jacob were the only two even somewhat likeable characters in the entire game. The driving in GTA to me has never been really good, and this game represents the driving at its absolute worst in the series. The physics are more advanced than GTAV in some respects, but the game itself is just plain less fun to play. GTA4, even when it runs right, is not even that good of a game. Makes me wonder if the people who reviewed it were paid off, it is that below average.
