I bought this game and have spent more time trying to log into rockstars social club than playing the game.  usually I am told my password is wrong even when changing the password moments before.  And if Social clubwhy do we need this garbage  does work the game just never loads.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times but the most frustrating thing is this is preventing me from downloading gta 5.  I do not recommend GTA on steam.  it is broken
