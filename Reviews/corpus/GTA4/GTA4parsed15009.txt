the game itself is good, i own it on console. however GTA 4 refuses to open for me, no matter how many times i uninstall it and wipe it from my computer. There is a website with patches for the problem i have  giving me the Rockstar Social CLub login screen and after i hit sign in it wont open the game but it still does not help the fact that i have an unplayable game in my library. I purchased this as a bundle when it came with GTA SA and it was supposed to have GTA 3. When i downloaded the game, i somehow got two copies of gta san andreas one works the other is so screwed up i cant even gift it to a friend and an unplayeable gta 4. If anyone knows a way to fix my never loading problem, that would be wonderfulDespite all that the game itself is fantasticaly and sadisticaly fun. I recommend buying it, just beware if you run across the same problem as I have.
