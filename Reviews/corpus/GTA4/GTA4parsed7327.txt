I spent almost 130 hours in GTA IV on my  old PC. It was on all low settings. playing on a resolution of 1600x900, and it barley hit 30fps. I finally built a new PC specs at the bottom, and I was so excited to play GTA IV! I downloaded it took me about an hour, then launched it... The hell broke loose. Uppon signing in with my social club account, after clicking play multiple times, It kept failing. So I decided to play offline, and the game crashed. Every time I launch the game and click play offline, the game crashes. I have spent 7 hours now looking around and trying to fix this, I even reinstalled the game. None of that works. If youve just built a new PC, or this is on sale and you have a decent PC, I do not recommend this game. If youre on a  PC then it should launch just fine. It did for me. If anybody has any ideas on how I could fix this problem, feel free to comment!SpecsGeForce GTX 960IntelR CoreTM i54590 CPU  3.30GHz16 GB RAMMicrosoft Windows 10 Home Edition
