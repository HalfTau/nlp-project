Besides unfixed bugs like Internet Cafes owners spawnning together in the same spot Dating one of the girls Alex is not working correctly, so your dates always fail A glitch disables Wanted Level so you can end the game without worrying about the police Manhunt achievement not working Random crashes, like when you perform a benchmark test or ride a cab.I DO RECOMMEND THIS GAME. Well, as long as you can deal with these problems.PS I know some players have not experienced such bugs. I dont care if I did, someone else may experience them as well. So Im giving Rockstar a thumbs down until them address these problems.
