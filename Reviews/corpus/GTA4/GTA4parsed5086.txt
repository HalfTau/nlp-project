This is one fungame.  Along with all the murder and crime, you get a cousin that constantly asks you if youd like to go bowling.  Isnt that nice of him?Now, onto the bad parts.  Its extremely poorly optimized.  Thats it.  Havent played in a really long time but other reviews seem to suggest it doesnt launch anymore.  Thats all Ive got to say.
