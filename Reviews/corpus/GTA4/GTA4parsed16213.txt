An epic game again by Rockstar entertainment. Its like an extension and an upturn, if I may say, of the previous GTA games, meaning that the game has much better graphics than previous ones and also you can improvise  interact with almost everything on the game you can use computers, enter various buildings, play various roles etc. and boy you even got a cell phone!!! Both the storyline and the questline is big and amusing with many missions and many outcomes. The only thing I did not like in this game is the fact that the experience bars, which were used back in GTA San Adreas Driving Skill, Stamina, Muscle etc. were removed and also the way that Police officers react and move . I mean wtf is this logic. In conclusion it is a good and fun game to play.I give this game
