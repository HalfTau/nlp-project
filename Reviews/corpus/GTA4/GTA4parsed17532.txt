I personally dont think there is lots to say about this game!Its awesome, its open world, Shooting, mod support! Everything you would like of a game!Overall i give it a score of 8/10 just because the gta v came out and I dont want it to seem like its better than it and I dont really want to compare it to gta v but....... The game is awesome BUY IT! And yeah for the price of 29.99 you can get gta iv or gta iv and gta iv Episodes from Liberty city!
