My review on GTA 4 for PCWell how do I put this.. The game itself is great but the way it has been ported to PC is really not so good. The story of GTA IV is well paced and has a good plot while the story can be quite boring unlike GTA Vs but thats just my opinion. The weapon system is nice and well balanced Unless you cheat Im looking at you Will. The handling of cars is quite good but not amazing and every cars engine sounds exactly the same. There are plenty of things to do other than the story like taking part in races, Pool, Darts even golf. You can also take part in side missions or friends as they are called. These are ok while some of the missions seem to feel a bit pointless.  The weather is dynamic with rain sun and sometimes wind.Now about the poor port. I have a fairly high end rig and it handles the game perfectly at 60 fps 1080p. But. The amount of graphical options is not good enough to support other peoples rigs like people who are using multiple GPS or people that are using a low end rig, its hard to set the options just right to make the game run how you want it to.  The game is not suited for keyboard and mouse but it works well enough to be playable but you will not get a big vantage over people in multiplayer who are using controllers. But we must remember that the game came out in 2008 about 6 years ago so hardware has moved on leaving the game behind. Its still a great game though while it still has its flaws its a good game. Rockstar have confirmed they are working harder on the GTA 5 port though which is good. I would rate this game 8/10.
