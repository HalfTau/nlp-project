GFWL pretty much tries to take over your computer and your soul. The monstrosity that was Games For Windows Lives only purpose seems to have been to obfuscate running a goddamn game so much that people stop buying games and turn to piracy. I wish gruesome and physical harm upon the people who took the decisions and designed this system. And Rockstar should be physically and repeatedly slapped over the face for implementing this system.Not only have I lost any disposition to play, as well as the couple of spare hours I had available for doing so, but I just never want to play any GTA game ever again. Getting back the money I paid for this steaming mess would still feel like I got robbed.LATER EDIT Having managed to wade through the mess that is GFWL and ending up creating an offline account, Ive had no more problems with the whole thing. The game is great, but that should be common knowledge by now.
