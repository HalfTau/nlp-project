This is in all fairness a rather good game, with all the fun to have with the modding scene.But unfortunatly, Do not, I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU LIFE IN THE EU.The codes for some reason only work in america for some reason and I can only hope that this doesnt have the same effect on the upcoming GTA V release for PC.
