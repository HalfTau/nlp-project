Car physics make me want to kill myself, theyre floaty and more difficult to control than surgeon simulator. Call it my ineptitude but I bought the game for the open world aspect, and you cant even do anything without passing loads of missions first, which all too many are chase missions that you have to do. I didnt get past like the fourth mission and Im not touching it again.Granted, if youre willing to put time and effort into it, Im sure its fun for some people. Hard pass if youre like me though.
