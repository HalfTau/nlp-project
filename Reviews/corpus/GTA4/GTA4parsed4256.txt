I knew I wanted this game after putting in hundreds of hours in between story and online on Xbox 360 but at first I was hesitant to buy this on PC due to all the reviews of poor optimization but now that I have it I dont see what the big issue is, Im able to play this fine on Windows 10. All I had to do was download GFWL and sign in. FPS is normal as well, some drops in high density areas but I also have on MSAA x16 and traffic density at 75no mods.Best campaign storyline out of any games from the GTA series and Niko Bellic is one of the best protagonists in any video game.Compared to GTA V, certain aspects of gameplay are a lot more grittier and realistic. Driving is a lot less arcadey, if youre driving a big 4door car or SUV, it drives like a boat because thats how it would be in real life. Unless youre driving a sports car you wont be travelling the corners as fast. Car crashes, vehicle damage and vehicle ejections are all more realistic than GTA V. Cop chases are more difficult to get away from. There is even squeaking from the suspension as you bottom out a vehicle when you get air, something GTA V decided to leave out.Fistfighting is a lot more realistic, instead of being able to drop an enemy in 3 normal punches, it takes 5 or so unless you do a powerful combo.Graphic wise, its not that far off of GTA V. You can easily tell GTA V is the more beautiful game graphically but GTA IV definitely holds its own for a game from 2008.
