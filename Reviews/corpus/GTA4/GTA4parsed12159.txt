I was only 9 years old I loved bowling so much,I had all the balls and shoesI pray to Roman every night before bed thanking him for the life Ive been given.Roman is love I say, Roman is lifeNiko overhears me and calls me a yokelI knew he was just jealous of my devotion for bowlingI called him an unloving brotherHe slaps me and sends me to go to sleepIm crying now, and my face hurtsI lay in bed and its really coldA warmth is moving towards me.I feel something touch meIts RomanI am so happyHe whispers into my ear this is my alleyHe grabs me with his powerful bowling hands and puts me on my hands and kneesIm readyI spread my bowling shoes for RomanHe penetrates my bowling ballIt hurts so much but I do it for RomanI can feel my bowling ball tearing as my eyes start to waterI push against his forceI want to please RomanHe roars a mighty roar as he fills my ball with his loveNiko walks inRoman looks him straight in the eye and says Its all bowling nowRoman leaves through my window
