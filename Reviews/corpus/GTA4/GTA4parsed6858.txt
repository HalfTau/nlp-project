Cousin, you want to go bowling?No?Okay I check back in 5 minutes.In all seriousness though, GTA4 was a massive step down from San Andreas in everything but graphics. Even the game world is smaller than San Andreas and theres very little to do unless you want to go bowling, alone, or drinking, alone, after you beat the storyline. Or you choose the other ending.The graphics are better and the AI pedestrians a little better, sure. The car physics are worse  they put in some type of realistic driving except its completely wonky and hilarious.All the advanced mechanics from SA are gone like the RPG elements  being able to improve skills, stamina, breath, and health meters. No jetpack. No proper tank. No helicopter variety. No planes. Minimal side activities. No additional melee fighting styles, and the melee combat is a joke.This is the best rendition of Liberty City in the franchise, yes, far better than in GTA3 or the brief moment in San Andreas.But the story is boring, just an eastern European illegal immigrant on a quest for a dude who wronged him, which ends up having a totally disappointing copout ending to it. There is one mission in this entire game that remains memorable  robbing the bank. And I still believe it was the basis for the entire heist game mechanic in GTA5, because so many people liked that mission.Yet at the same time, GTA4 seems more fun than GTA5, which corrected the majority of the shortcomings of GTA4.Overall, its still a GTA title, and GTA is always fun, so pick it up.
