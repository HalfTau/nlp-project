Ive owned this game on XB for years but, its only recently that I started playing it on the PC  and also ONLINE. Online play is excellent. I cant WAIT for 5 to release on PC... hopefully soon. Its a great game. Driving is pretty clunky, and so are the overall controls of the character at times. But, its a great game.
