Grand Theft Auto IV is the best GTA game rockstar have ever made by far best story best voice acting best combat 2nd best cars  GTA 5 has the best cars  and the funnest physics to mess around with especially pushing people off cliffs or people holding on too the handle of the car getting dragged through the city hitting of lamposts at 40 mph. I highly reccomend this especially if you do not have a good enough Graphics Card to run GTA 510/10
