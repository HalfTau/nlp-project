GTA IV is still quite a bit of fun. While shooting is painfully stiff, and driving is absurdly loose, theres a lot of fun to be had in this sandbox. Structured story missions are a chore, though  save for a few truly gripping parts, much of the game revolves around unresponsive stopandpop shooting or scripted car chases. GTA IV is best appreciated as a sandbox to mess around in. Freeroam multiplayer is a thrill, and its whats kept me coming back. Be warned, though this game is very poorly optimized, and there is a gamebreaking bug in the singleplayer finale.
