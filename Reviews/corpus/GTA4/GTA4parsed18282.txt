Honestly, this is a good game, but only really on console. It it terribly optimized for PC, resulting in relatively poor frames for less powerful computers. Unless you are a really big fan of the series or dont have a console, I wouldnt reccomend it for PC. One thing to consider however is the large mod community, which is really what makes is worth getting for me personally.
