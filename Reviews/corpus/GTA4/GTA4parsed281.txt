Good story and voice acting. Gameplay is probably some of the worst in the business. Look through my library I have some stinkers in there... GTA 4 is the worst. Is Niko supposed to be a disabled person?!? 6 seconds from the time you press the button to get out of a vehicle and the time you can actually fire your weapon. Worst driving physics youve ever seen. Imagine your car flipping 3 times because you hit a cardboard box. Even on modern gaming rigs, graphics have to be turned down in order to get decent FPS. Vehicle and clothing selection sucks. Its like it many of the essential features were just an afterthought. Shame, could have been... SHOULD have been a great game.
