Grand Theft Auto IV is truly the most amazing game I have ever played.The missions were very fun, and plot was very interesting. I was never bored with GTA IV.One minute, I could be robbing a bank with 3 other people, the next, stealing a a motorcycle, speeding down the highway, jumping a ramp, hit a building, eject, and fall on citizens of Liberty City.The game does have a large download size, but it is definelty worth the buy!
