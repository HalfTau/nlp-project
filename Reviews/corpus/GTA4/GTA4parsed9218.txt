I loved play Grand Theft Auto IV, the physics where fun to mess with and messing around with friends.Sadly I have to give it a bad review due to my key being rejected after formatting so many times.Ive exceeded the activation limit so I can no longer play this online or save game.The pain about this game is that you download this game on steam and then play it through steam, then you also play it through the games for windows live client thing. Why did they make it this way?I hope this helps anyone in future.
