After you buy the game, when you launch it, it makes you sign up for this social club account, which normally id be ok with since they arent just some sponser theyre like the devs or some crap like that, so they had a roll in making gta 4, so i was like, ok, whats the harm in making an account for these people so i can play my game that I bought, right? well, I thought it was alright until after Id created my account gta 4 still prompts you to login, not just for online multiplayer, but offline too which is total b.s.,  so when I went to put in my credentials, i get a message saying that my login information is incorrect. I kept retyping it, even checked online to make sure I had my login info down correctly. After about 20 tries, the game just started crashing every time id even try to type in my login information. Apparently many people have this same issue. Dont buy this game on steam, absolutely not worth it you can get a refund from steam, but the money transfer back onto your card or steam wallet takes several days, so just dont even bother with this game in the first place. hope this helps.
