This game is one of the best games i have played in my childhood and i bought it on PC to relive memories a while ago but after a few hours of looking to fix the game and set it up, i dont think its worth buying if you are using a Windows 8.1/10 PC.If anyone can tell me how i can get the game to run i will change my review, otherwise, i have to say no to the PC version /
