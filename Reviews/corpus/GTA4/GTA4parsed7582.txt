Typically when I buy a game from Steam I actually expect to play it afterwards. Despite my best efforts however, this game is completely unplayable. Ive spent hours reading the discussion boards on how to actually get the game to run, but nothing seems to work. Why does Steam continue to sell games that just do not work? Do NOT buy this game unless you enjoy wasting your money on absolutely nothing.
