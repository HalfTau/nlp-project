This game has never run on any computer Ive tried it on. Windows 7, Windows 8. It fails to start up.Buggy POS. Do not buy. If you search for GTA issues, you will find a laundry list of people trying weird hacks to make it work.Its obviously a bad port, and to make matters worse is tied into Games For Windows Live, which is completely useless to Steam users.
