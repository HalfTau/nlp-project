I dont recommend this game!This game is not worth the time it takes to set everything up.so first i made a social club account then i downloaded games for windows live Which i hate so much!then i made an account for games for windows live but for some ing reason i had to make an account like 3 timesbecause it said something about a wrong id everytime and then took me to a web page that dosent work! Really!then when i enter the game finally the setting were on the lower saying my pc is too weak to handle itI have a ing amd r9 290x!so i had to look it up then i fixed it i enter the game on the highest setting because its a ing game from 2008and i get 3040 fps like wtf? i run GTA V on 60 on high and very high settings!so to sum up this is not worth your money iv played this game 30 hours! with 3040 the multiplayer sucksbecause everyone is using mods and you cant kill them. Most of the time there are no people online at all!Please dont buy this game for pc atleast not for 20 dollars.
