The GTA title with the best storyline to date, for sure.Loved this game ever since it came out 8 years ago, only recently got it on my computer.Amazing storyline, really gets you into it and some parts can potentially make you cry.Havent had any GFWL issues, just had to install that seperately.However, two downsides and that is the infamous optimization and lack of online playcant log into social club recently, my guess is R took down the servers and did not announce it publicly.Game ran at about 3040fps steady at medium settings and 50 draw distance on my old radeon HD 8000 series video card. Wasnt too bad but I later upgraded to a GTX 750ti and my fps in GTA 4 has barely improved. I can run the game at high settings yeah, but my fps stays roughly the same as it did with my radeon card. Keep that in mind when buying this game.You will not regret playing through it, regardless of whether you have played it on console countless of times or never at all. You get really gripped into the story, it becomes really fun. The missions are not that hard compared to lets say GTA San Andreas and much harder than GTA 5s. Perfect balance imo.
