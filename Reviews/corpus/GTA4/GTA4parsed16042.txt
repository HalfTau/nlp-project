This game is ing.80 of missions are the same. Im absolutely serious now check the wiki, if you dont believe me. You go to a place at the other side ofmap and kill a single guy/group of them  end of mission.  Dammit, some missions can take under a minute. Take a taxi, quick travel to your destination, kill a dude with a sniper rifle  mission complete.Theres not a SINGLE interesting mission.Nico main protagonist is a annoying asshoIe. Im doing it for the money, I need money, blah blah blah, pay me, something something revenge, money, money, money STFU! ...Hes  like a broken record. There are maybe 2 characters that are not absolute Rest of them are so bland and... nothing. FFS, I dont even know, who I killed in the final mission. It was some dude I guess.Gameplaywise  also boring ! You cant do nothing. You want to change your clothes? You can buy a suit and a bad looking jacket.. wow, so much choice! You want to customise your car? lol no. Fly a yet ? nope. Buy a house or something? AGAIN, NO! YO, BUT HEY, you can watch TV in your safe house! OMG!Cars drive like . And dont tell me its realistic, blah blah . If you saying its realistic, you never drove a car. Shooting is standard, they also added a cover system.. whatever. Headshots in one hit kill  anyway, so you can kill an entire army with a pistol with no problem.All weapons feel the same. There is a assault rifle and a carbine rifle.. difference  none. A pistol and a combat pistol  one of them have smaller magazine ?This game was waste of my money and time. I was struggling to finish it.GTA VC , SA or even GTA 1 are far more better than this crap.
