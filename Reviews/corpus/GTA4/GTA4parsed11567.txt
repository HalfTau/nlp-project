I paid 20 or so for something that simply does not work.The only things that happen, is the Social Club login window popping up. So I enter the details for my Social Club account, tried both Play and Play Offline, my avatar shows a green border  for 5 seconds  and turns back to blue, and every time I supposedly play the game for a few seconds.Not good enough!
