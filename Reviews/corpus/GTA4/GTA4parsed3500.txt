let me start with saying this.i have played this game on pc 100 hours  and its is one of my favorite games ever.the game has had some minor issues, and i say minor because they have been solvable,problems like performance issues, on a high end pc, and the usual windows live nonsense.The last time i played this game was i think summer 2016, and it was working fine with treaks that gave stable fps.But 22032017 i tried reinstalling, and i dont know if there has been an update since,but it was a nightmare to get running, first GFWL made it super difficult just to play it, and when i finally booted the game up performance was worse than ever before and even with tweaks and mods it wont give stable fps,i have tried reinstalling and validate my files, and now ive given up and ive uninstalled it, and im currently waiting for it to be fixed.the game in itself is amazing, story wise and gameplay wise,and if not for these problems i would have recommended it, but it is basically unacceptible for me to recommend such a bad performing game.
