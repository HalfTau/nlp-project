Quite simply, one of the best games of the era. In addition to bringing a new engine RAGE, Rockstar also changed the GTA series, in the sense that theyve made the story approach differently from other games. In this game, it is as you feel that Niko always seems to grab the shortest end of the stick because in spite of all your choices, Niko never seems to get a good result. Storywise, this game is the best is the GTA series GTA V included. The mechanics have improved since you are now able to take cover, shoot without leaving cover and you are able to aim for yourself, even with the gamepad. It might not be as big as San Andreas, but it sure all hell is just as fun. The only complaint Ive found is that the cars seem a little too unrealistic like someone is purposely trying to take the wheel from you. Multiplayer hasnt been forgotten and is really fun play whether youre just looking for some coop or trying to take the crown in deathmatch or cops and crooks. All in all, this game is well worth your money.
