Firstly, I love this game because you can drive all over Europe. You have to manage your money, and make sure that, when you get out a loan from the bank, you have enough money to pay it back, or are at least making enough daily profit to pay it back.You also manage a business. You can hire drivers to work for you, and they will complete jobs for you, but you have to pay them a wage, plus some for every journey they complete. You level up they skills, that make them be better at certian things, like you can make them earn more money for going over a set distance, or you can make them carry high value or fragile cargo. They can also carry ADR materials, so things that could be dangourous. But you get paid more for that.You can always do Quick Jobs, and these are when the employer provides the truck, and you just go where they tell you. This is fun, but it starts to get boring, only doing short deliverys, so you can buy a truck, so that you can go further distances, and get more money.To conclude, I feel that anybody who likes games like Farm Simulator, or any simulator game should give this game a try, because it is a great way to unwind after a long day, and I have found it to be so much fun and very calming. Some people say that this is a boring game, I happen to disagree.
