When the game came out ragdoll physics were new and awesome. But the game was terribly optimized. Nowadays this engine, including the graphics the AI and the storyline is just barely enough to make people pay for this game. Shortly this game will be outdated. Of course itll be still a good game to play with.Hard to start up on Windows 8/8.17/10
