im not sure if I can reccomend this game, after all I did eventually manage to get it to work, however doing so was a painful experience, make no mistake if you are using a windows 8 PC getting this running is not simply a case of click to play, this port is fairly botched.Having said that however I did eventually get the game running perfectly, with the map etc showing up with no problems, it just  took a long time, roughly 10 hours, although a lot of that time was spent downloading various patchs, redownloading the game etc, so I was able to study during that time, so the time wasnt completly wasted.Suffice it to say however this is not a simple case of click to play, and unless you are getting this game as part of a pack, with a significant discount, or you really really want to play it I would reccomend against buying this game through steam.
