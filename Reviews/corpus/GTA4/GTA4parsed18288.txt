Pretty simple problem, Grand Theft Auto is a game where you spend more than half of it driving, one can say it is all about driving cars, pick up stuff, run away, follow, win races that is all the game is about and GTA IV was the worse drive experience i have ever had in games, i just cannot put into words how much it is unreal, you cannot make any turn like a normal car, that has got to be the worse GTA ever, and i used to be a fan, if you have to pay more then 10U do not do it, you WILL REGREAT, that is for sure.
