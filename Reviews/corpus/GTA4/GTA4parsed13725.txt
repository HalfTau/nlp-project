This game is very bad!This game almost made me frustrated when first installedthe only problem is just this game uses games for windows live and social club to playand it does not work in Windows 8!so I have to find a crack in order to play it offline without online featuresbut still, I played the offline version until finishand the most remarkable is the story, especially when it will reach the endingalso the shooting simulation is coolthe driving simulation toobesides that, I still recommend this game because the online multiplayers is not everything
