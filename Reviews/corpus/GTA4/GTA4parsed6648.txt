Shame. This was a really fun game to play but trying to make games for windows sign in is an infuriating struggle. You have to sign in to your live account even to play offline or you cant load the game or save  yet it is virtually impossible to get the account to workA fun game but the PC version, at least through steam is so much trouble to get it to work it is not worth it
