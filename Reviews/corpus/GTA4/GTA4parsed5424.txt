Do NOT buy this game. The things being said about it not working and you having to download outdated programs to make it run are COMPLETELY true. Even on sale it is not worth it. Dont do it unless you want to spend hours searching for fixes and working programs for this. Also, even if you get the game running it will bug and crash because of Microsoft Live and other software t. Pirate it online game mode has been shut down anyway, save your money, get just about anything else.
