Been dying to play this game for so long, and only this year did I have the chance to buy it with my own hardearned money.Still the gold standard in open world games, GTA continues to improve itself especially evident with the most recent GTA V. More and more interactions are being added, more and more side activities, and increasingly shiny cars, too.I love how Rockstar tries its best to put a premium on realism on basically everything, including street traffic and AI.One thing I notice though is that since LC is modeled after New York City, there should be as many people in LCs streets as well. However, I do understand that the tech from that time might still be too limited for such a demand. D
