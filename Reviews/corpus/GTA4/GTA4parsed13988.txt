for 20 bucks , this game is a no brainer. i know that it is a bad port, better than fallout NV and that multiplayer is down, for the moment. using fraps and other exes like nvidia inspector you can max out the settings and find the best frame rate and lock it through inspector if you arent using gtx, im sure you can google and find a free fps limiter to enhance the game play. most pc games take a little bit of tweaking to find the smoothest frame rate. for me id rather have a good decent fps than havew it look really good.
