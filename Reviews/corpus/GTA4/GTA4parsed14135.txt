I recommend this game if you have either played previous GTAs, or want to have a diverse way of meeting up with friends or have a lot of options. So if you make a group about something, this game can make sure you can do so. Or just play the story mode or dont and just do multiplayer all of the time. Its your choice, really. This game gives you that option with the ever expanding modding community.
