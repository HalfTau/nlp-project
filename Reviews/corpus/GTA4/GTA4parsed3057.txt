Yet another Take Two boycott review. Taking away single player modding is a terrible idea.That said, this game was terrible. I only ever got, what I figured, was about 2/3s of the way through before I grew bored and never picked it up again. There were too many distractions staring you right in the face the entire game. Constant phone calls, girlfriend issues and other things which really distracted me away from actually  having fun. It felt much like every mission was more or less the same, go here kill someone...In contrast, GTA 5 is absolutely amazing and I have put hundreds of hours into both Single Player and Multiplayer modes. Im pretty convinced the mystery is real, and Im very interested in seeing where it goes. However, the loss of single player modding, via sending the cease and desist order to OpenIV is completely disastrous. I personally have never modded GTA 5, due to rumors of people whod had their Online accounts being banned for single player moddinghowever Id really looked forward to modding nicer graphics into the game after the mystery was solved, and I felt like I was done with Online mode.However, I digress. I now boycott all Take Two games until this is rectified. No more R games, Civ 5, no chance of buying Civ 6... All movies, all games, everything Take Two has a part in. Im done. Please restore the status quo and find better ways to circumvent Online cheating.
