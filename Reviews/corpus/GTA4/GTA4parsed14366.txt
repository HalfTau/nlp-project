The best storyline in the Grand Theft Auto series thus far, also really well made and not as buggy as the prior 3D GTA games were.Only complaint is that GTA series started on PC and still belong on PC, console ports of this PC game series is fine with me,but for good sake dont betray your roots and release the PC version ALOT later then the console versions.
