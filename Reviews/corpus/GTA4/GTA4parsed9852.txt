My 55 minutes experience with this game on steam.I was just a boy when I bought this at a sale.So young and naive.I never got to play gta 4 on a pc and was really exited.the gta 5 craze was up so I decided to buy this pack to have some fun until the new gta arrives. Hoping I could roam around, drive cars and maybe run over some pedestrians. Yey what a fun time !But I was mistaken.Ow how mistaken....From the beginning when I launched the game I was caught by software after software of log in here to have a good time Its OK, the fun will begin shortly.The more I wait the better itll be. I said with a nervous voice.....I WAS WRONG.From the first second I entered the game, bad PC port fairies attacked me.Giving me bad framerate with high/low settings on a new 500  PC.I tried everything from scripts, to patches but everything failed and my faith was broken...Wait! I remember.....Yes! This game has multiplayer, woohooo.Finaly I can play a gta game in multiplayer with bots and get to make havoc, get in police chases, have killingsprees with random guys. YES!  .And my hope was high again, from the happiness and enthusiasm I couldnt even figure out how to open multiplayer.I opened quickly a browser tab and googled it.It was really simple, just take you phone and go to multiplayer.Yes! So i reopened the game, got my phone, selected multiplayer then the game closed and the social network window appeared.And while I was waiting for it to open the session, I saw the error connecting, please try again in a few minutes message.This must be a problem from the large number of people using it, I said feeling the fear of dissapointment.I tried again after a few minuts.I tried again after a few hours.NOTHING.All of my dreams where shatered.No gta 4 SP, no gta 4 MP, no gta 4....So. Buy it, install it.Hate it, ask for a refund.GGGo Pro
