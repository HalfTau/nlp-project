This game is fantastic! It looks beautiful, controlls flawlessly and gameplay is incredible! Ima be a weirdo and say, that personally, I rather enjoy GFWL or whatevers left of it!! The fact, that you can play it on steam, get achievements and see em on your 360 as well, makes it better, than having nothing at all! Guess haters gona hate. Online worked ok too, not as bad as dreaded hemoroids of uplay on FC3! Totally worthy investment! 9.5/10
