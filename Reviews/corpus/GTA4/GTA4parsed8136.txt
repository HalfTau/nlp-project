Ignore most of the reviews!This game was one of my favorite GTAs.Reason I heard it has issues is because of they instant moved it to PC with XBOX / PS3 settings or whatever.The game can run on windows 10.Just go to Steamapps/Common/GTA IV  and make the main files run for compatibillity Windows XP Service Pack 3and Install Games For Windows Live
