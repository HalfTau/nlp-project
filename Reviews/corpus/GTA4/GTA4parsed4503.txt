8 years since Rockstar released a patch for this damned game.Before Windows 10 released, this game worked like a charm for Windows 7 and 8, it was rough around 8, but it worked.Then Windows 10 released, the game would not boot. Yesterday night, Rockstar released a patch for GTA IV that would fix the issue on Windows 10, the game no longer requires a login at startup, just click play and go.Games For Windows Live, it still exists, and surprisingly, it still works on Windows 10, Games For Windows Live is completely optional, youre not forced to use Games For Windows Live for single player use, but if you wish to play online, or get achievements, you need to create a microsoft account, and login with that.The game will still try to install Social Club stuff, which is normal, thats just to activate your game and connect to their servers, which is completely normal and understandable. Youre not forced to create 2 accounts to play multiplayer or to even boot up the game, which is a huuuuuuuge plus.To summarize this, Rockstar finally did something good after some years, releasing a patch for a better game, with a better multiplayer experience. Props to you, Rockstar, props to you.Side note Those having issues with trying to play the game Press play, steam status changes to Playing Grand Theft Auto IV, then it goes back to Online, try uninstalling any mods or mod menus you might have installed... Currently that seems to be a huge issue with everyone trying to play this game, I havent tested the game with mods, but I might test in the near future.
