Dear Rockstar Games. I love to living in GTA IV.You guys made a huge and epic work to create this briliant game. Please keep it alive and make people enjoy your hard work.Please notice Mods keep games alive for years after their release. Without them, games would be dead within a couple years.Please add Workshop and Artwork section to Community Hub for making people share the usefull things and mods to each other and keep this brilliant game alive.Artwork is needed cause its not cool when gamers have images of gameplay that were made with modding tools such a Selfie mod or Phone Camera and they cant share of it with others.P.S. Grand THeft Auto IV is one of the best games I ever played in my life. Thanks to you Rockstar for make this happened to me.
