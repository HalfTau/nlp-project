A diamond in the rough GTA4 is Rockstars first entry into the HD universe and it changed so much from GTA3, Vice City, and San Andreas. Right from the start the games driving, shooting, and activities feel arguably unfun and mundane, the color filter gives fictional New York City a drab and dirty look. Pair that with bad PC port optimization and a delayed release after console versions, I can understand why a lot of people would give GTA4 a less than stellar review at first, and for a long time I almost felt betrayed by Rockstar until the DLCs fixed a lot of content fans were asking for.Until GTA5 dropped. While I do enjoy GTA5 for what it is, it has a lot of shallow elements and sacrifices subtletynuance for appealing fun. The harsh not gritty thankfully realism that GTA4 embraced and embodied in many facets made me appreciate its storytelling more. The spoilers unhappy endings of GTA4, mixed with protagonist Nikos inability to find and accomplish the American Dream, despite various risky ventures into crime, perfectly reflect the grim reality of many immigrants that come to America, despite all its glittering materialism and opportunities. end spoilers I thought this change from the 3D universe into a much more realistic, appearance and physicswise, HD universe showed maturity in direction from what are basically regarded as mass hookerandcop murder simulator car stealer psycho games.GTA4 isnt perfect some missions are plain bad/repetitive, the online portion feels incomplete, and the aforementioned optimization still is an issue on some 2016 machines. But Id definitely recommend picking it up on sale bundled with the DLC if you liked any of the other GTA titles and skipped this one because of its mixed reviews, or always wanted to a more mature GTA title but didnt like the other titles.
