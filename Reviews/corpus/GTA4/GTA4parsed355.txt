This was the last great GTA.The driving and ragdoll animation feels so much better in this than the 5th, the story was entertaining, not the best of the GTAs, but still entertaining and well worth the time.GTA V is a commercial cash grab that survives only by bleeding the credit card of the mothers and fathers of 12 year olds who play the game.I truly hope that when, or if they make a GTA VI, they dont make the same errors as they did with GTA V, I hope they go back to true GTA style and dont continue to go down this dark path.
