I, like many others, was frustrated with the Games for Windows Live integrated into the game.I did some searching online for a fix and was able to get around it by creating a Local Profile.Also, GfWL is dead now.PROS Graphics is still competent even up to 2015 standards Controls are straightforward Decent audio and awesome radio stations Beautiful environment and cityscape Wide array of car selection Substantial characters that you can relate/get attached to Missions were mostly interesting albeit some, repetitive Friendships can mean lifeordeath, successorfailure Decisions affect the storylineCONS Games for Windows Live Some glitches here and there Lack of silenced weapons Lack of military characters/objects soldiers, tanks, jets, etc. Driver AI isnt that smart Not enough dating choices No cosmetic change features working out, haircut No buyable propertiesFor a game that came out in 2008, this is still highly playable even with GTA 5 out there. Its definitely a big step up from GTA San Andreas. Even though is much to be desired, this was a game that kept me up at nights because I kept wanting to know what happens next.Overall, GTA 4 is a game that you should NOT skip in the series.
