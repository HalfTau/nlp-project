Due to Rockstars continued ignorance when it comes to curating their older titles, you cannot play GTA4 online, as it will not log in. Even after you use their manual updater, which actually doesnt even start most of the time anyway. you will still be told that you cannot log into social club.Then the game itself, I can play GTA5 pretty well on my current rig, but GTA4 gradually gets slower, and slower the longer you play it. This is due to literally hundreds of little bugs festering in the games memory, and constantly bugging around with the cache.Essentially, this game is broken across the board, and unless you happened to time your updates perfectly, you are going to have a damn hard time getting your moneys worth out of this game. Rockstar should hand over the curation to someone else, because they have no interest at all in helping players enjoy older games. And quite frankly I am getting kind of sick of working on getting their games to function. Bad show Rockstar, incredibly bad show.In simple terms, this was a great game.
