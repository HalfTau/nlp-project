one of my favoutite games of all time. you play as niko bellic who is an immigrant to liberty city, he lives with his cousin who claims to be rich but turns out to be heavily in debt and oweing to many loan sharks throughout liberty. niko hopes to escape his past whilst roman wishes to be rich and powerful. niko invinsions liberty as a heaven but when he arrives finds out that it is a city plauged with crime corrupt officials and organized gangs and chavs. the LCPD Liberty City Police Department is extremley underfunded making it hard for them to arrest the citys criminals making life hell for the citizens escpessially the two cousins roman and niko. one other thing is the mods i have met police mods and LCPDFR installed making u play as a cop for the met police. 9/10 a bit buggy and picky with your pc specs but overall a great game and worth the cash! dont let the kids playing it get to honkers
