So I bought this game  when I tried to play it, some Social Club t popped up  it clearly stated that a Social Club account is not required to play single player campaign. So I click on the play offline button  it tells me that Im not logged into Social Club  that a Social Club account login is required to access online multiplayer and video uploading to Social Club TV! I just wanted to play single player  it wouldnt let me. So what I did was create a Social Club account because I really wanted to play this amazing game. So I typed in my credentials  clicked on the play button  all it did was close the window. Dont waste your time or your money on this game. You cant even play it.
