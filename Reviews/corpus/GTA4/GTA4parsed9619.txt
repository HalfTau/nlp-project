The game seems pretty good, but after 2 hours downloading, installing a concrete version of the game so you wont use GFWL and trying to make it look visually great... I almost couldnt run it, Rockstar Social Club window didnt let me enter the game, then Social Club its over the main menu so I cannot see any option and finally, when I though it was over, optimization is ed and even I could play, I would just prefer buying GTAV.Ill see a movie version on Youtube instead of playing this ugly port.
