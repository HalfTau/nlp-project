DO NOT BUY THIS THING.  It has tons of problems, you will fix one to find another two and so on.First, this game has 4, FOUR... FOUR!!! damn layers of DRM!1. SecuROM One of the most legal costumer punishers PC gaming has ever known2. Rockstar Social Club An a bit annoying but tolerable Multiplayer DRM made from Rockstar itself3. Games for Windows Live A zombie DRM service which the legend says it has more flaws than Skyrim has bugs4. Steam Will prefer just to not have any DRM, but Steam is the only DRM I know it doesnt punish people who actually pay for PC gamesIt is unplayable, but no, literally, it is unplayable, you wont be able to properly play it, because, if you are able to run it, you will still have problems with GFWL which ultimately doesnt lets you save if you cant log in.Dont play this game until you can just click on the damn shortcut in your steam library and normally start the game like any other game on Steam, this game doesnt deserve your money, not even one single dollar. Just take a look on the Internet and see how good is the experience for people pirating it.DRM has been proved wrong, and not disabling it just makes obvious the fact this publisher doesnt give a  about their customers. And even with those problems, they still selling it, you dont need a P h D to disable DRMs, it just takes less than an hour of work for an intern,If Sega ditched GFWL with the first Company of Heroes, I cant find a single rational explanation for why a ridiculously big publisher like Rockstar didnt even bothered to do more than a post on their blog saying they were trying to find a solution for GFWL.This is only rated as recommended because that way more people can see it.
