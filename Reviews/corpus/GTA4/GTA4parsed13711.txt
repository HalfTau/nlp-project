Cannot reccomend for the terrible optimization of this game, I have a system that is well over the reccomended specs for this game yet cannot get playable framerates on medium settings. I have an i5, 6gb ram and a radeon 7670Honestly when I stick this on to play it I just get depresssed and turn it off because the graphics look so terrible on the settings I have to use. This should not be the case, I run Bioshock infinite on high settings and get 40fps ! !Save your money, Just Cause 2 is much cheaper and the online play is brilliant. Lets hope GTA Vs port will be made much better.
