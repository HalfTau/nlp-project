for those would like to make a little havoc and chaos. it has a really nice story line, and the gameplay is nice.let me put it this wayI played the game a while back on ps3, like 2 years after it came out. at the time it was still stunning. the game was outstanding, and i wish i still had my playstation 3 so i could truly get that experince i had again. it had an amazing story line, great psyhics system and damn can i say that it must have taken Rockstar all they could muster, to be able to make GtaV better. that said GtaIV was one of the best games i have ever played...you see i had bought the game on steam in hopes that i could relive the memories that me and my friends had playing it. but i was saddly mistake. you see this game uses GFWL, thats the short term for Games For Windows Live witch not only is dead. BUT IS ALSO SERVICE THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CREATED. i mean seriously. its a very bad port of the gamenow so farProsgraphics are too outdatedgameplay and story are stunninggreat sandbox gamenot garbage on consoleConsGFWLGFWLSocialClub rockstars drm didnt mention it, but its bad toobonus  cant become a dedicted bowler
