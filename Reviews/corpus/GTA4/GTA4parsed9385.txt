This is game is very good on its own, however Steam really needs to work with rockstar on making a version that doesnt require social club or Games for Windows LIVE DRM. It does not work anymore. Fortunately, I did not pay retail price for this, I feel bad for those who did. Go buy this game on PS3 or xbox 360 and save yourself an hour of your life.
