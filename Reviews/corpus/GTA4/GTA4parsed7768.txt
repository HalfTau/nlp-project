Its a great game, dont get me wrong, but oh my god is it broken. It was so broken to the fact that i spent around 3 hours switching files and downloading patches to get the game RUN!!! Once I played the game a wee bit I loved it, but when I tried installing the native trainer, IT BROKE THE GAME. DO NOT BUY THIS ON PC!!!! It is broken, that is that.
