Even though this game is initially a pain to get working well enough to enjoy it, the content and gameplay you get from it makes it worthwhile.I wouldnt say expect to be playing this game the same day you install it, as messing about with Games for Windows Live and graphical issues is gonna eat some time, and even still the multiplayer aspect of this game is something i couldnt get to work.If you can endure getting it to run efficiently, and dont plan on playing multiplayer or heavily modding it, i dont see why you shouldnt get this game.
