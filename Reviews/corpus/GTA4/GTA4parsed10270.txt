I spent 1 hour trying to make Games for Windows Live working and i gave up. GFWL didnt recognize my Live account. This is why Microsoft is a disease to the gaming industry. They need to die.Rockstar, you need to stop hiring R3Trd5. Why do you even need GFWL to save game progress? You cant even save the game progress to local harddrive.NEVER HIRE FULL R3Trd5.
