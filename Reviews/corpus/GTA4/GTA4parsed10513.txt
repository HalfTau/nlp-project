Bad port, decent game, plays for crap on PC. I played this game originally on Xbox 360 where it wasnt absolute crap, but the PC port of this game is filthy, and gets bad framerates even on a system with more then enough power to run it.Also point out the fact that you have to add shortcut commands in steam to disable the memory checking system since any graphics card with more then 2GB of ram it says you are over your memory limit even though you are barely using a gig.This game can in no way be compared to the masterpiece that is GTA 5 PC.
