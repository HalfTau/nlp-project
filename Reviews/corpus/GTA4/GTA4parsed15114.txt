Hmmm GTA IV. GTA IV is a game with a compelling and nonlinear storyline, a game with a great protagonist who you cant help but like, and a game that boasts a plethora of online multiplayer features in addition to its lengthy story mode. Its not without some flaws, but GTA IV is undoubtedly the best Grand Theft Auto yet Justin Calvert, Gamespot executive editor.That pretty much sums up the whole game. I had a really good experience with GTA IV, and it was very fun to play. I have invested 34 hours on this game now, and I do not regret buying this game. At first, Nico main character may be slow in movement, and it will be hard to drive cars. Once, you get used to the game, it will really fun to play. There so many missions ta you can choose from eg. Go bowling with Roman, go on a date with Michelle, go beat up some people for Vlad and do jobs and earn money for Roman.A game that offers this much is a really good buy. I very much suggest buying this game!The only big issue with this game is the DOWNLOAD and RUNNING the game. It was very annoying that when I downloaded it, I couldnt run this game due to a bunch of errors. THIS IS HOW TO SOLVE IT. Download those files, extract them and put ALL of those files into your GTAIV Folder.If you dont know where your GTAIV Folder is, well, its here OS Hard Drive  Program Filesx86  Steam  SteamApps  Common  Grand Theft Auto IV  GTAIV. Put all those files there and your game will workScore 9/10 still has some minor flaws and the download is corrupted
