TakeTwo completely ruined its relationship with gamers as well as the lasting usability and entertainment of this game by forcefulling gutting the abililty to modify it. Where there was once an active fan community for Grand Theft Auto IV there is now a void of nothing, for no good reason other than greed. Do not support any other TakeTwo games, their selfishness has ruined one of the best aspects of this title and GTA V.
