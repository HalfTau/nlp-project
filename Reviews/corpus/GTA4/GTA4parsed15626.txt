So let me get this straight. I buy the complete edition, which includes GTA IV and Episodes from Liberty City, but when I to play either of the Episodes from Liberty City ballad of gay tony or lost and the damned, I have to buy them again ?Am  I missing something ? Why should I buy it again to get the extra episodes which supposedly come as part of this Complete Edition ?Bought it awhile ago for full price, too.
