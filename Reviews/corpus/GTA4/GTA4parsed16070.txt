i loved this game like all the gta games i have played before but. i wanted to give new purchasers fair warning this game may not play when you buy it on steam. i have the gta complete edition on steam or whatever its called and currently only vice city will start. there are many posts on steam about people having similar issues and has been for a while , and after spending 30 mins  trying to find heelp with steam support and rockstar still i cant play 2 of the bundle . very annoying up to now ive loved steam but now im livid. no effort seemigly on steams part on a long standing issue.
