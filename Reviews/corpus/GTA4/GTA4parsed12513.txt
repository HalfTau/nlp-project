A challenge to get working, but once you do it is worth it. I have already played this game on PS3 but I always prefer to play GTA on PC.What worked for me thanks to the forumsFirst thing you will need to do is install the game through Steam.2nd, uninstall Games For Windows Live Because the game wont even launch3rd, Download the new version of Games For Windows Live There will be an additional updated needed before you can begin playing4th, Open the properties window for GTA IV within Steam and add nomemrestrict norestrictions  quotes within the Launch Options. this fixes the graphics issue regarding newer and more powerfull GPUsOverall I am very happy with the game and the way it runs on my PC. I recommend it to all GTA fans.
