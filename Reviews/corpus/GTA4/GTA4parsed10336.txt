After downloading it took me 1.5hours befor i could eventually start the game.I needed some Rockstar profile with a strict password protection. Why do I need a cryptic password for an account nobody wants? Why would anybody waste his time to hack this?But wait! Theres more!Not only do I need this Rockstar socialI also need a Windows Live account for which I also have to install a software and which has to be registered as a gaming account.Isnt steam supposed to do all this connect with friends stuff?Why the  do I need 3 communities to play a single player game?
