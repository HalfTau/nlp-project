Okay, to all of the ers who think this game is broken andand such. THE GAME WAS RELEASED IN 2008, NO WINDOWS 10 WAS RELEASED THEN! Secondly, the meory problem can be easily fixed. Its 2016, we have youtube people. Steam Workshop wasnt released in 2008 on my knowledge and if it was then GTA IV was crossplatform, with exeptions of mods it would be unfair for console players. Overall Im here to say that people who think the game is bad because it has some errors and it doesnt run on Windows 10, please, ing YouTube exists. There are so many people who dont cry over oh this game said i have wrong password, BROKEN GAMEProsIts cool.Conslmao what?
