Im going to start off with how ridiculous it is to get this game running, the game cant launch Without You installing a third party directory instructions i.e  basically a mod  to get the game running after completing that you need to go into the steam property settings for the game, because the game seems to think you have a 120mb graphics card. which you wouldnt know unless you did some research. first and foremost it is not my job to fix the game, especially when I am the person who purchased it. secondly of all if the game doesnt work then steam should have prompted me  umm I dont know the game doesnt work you sure you want to buy  this is a blatant ripoff.this is in no way a reflection of the actual game GTA 4 is a wonderful experience, its just the steam version will have you doing ridiculous things just to get it running. do not buy it on Steam, it does not work
