Was a very lackluster gta, a dissappointing link in an otherwise great chain of games. Trying to play it now is impossible you cant even save your game because of the involvement with windows live which is always broken. So unless you feel like starting over each time you start the game you will never be able to finish it. Dont buy it, game sucks and is broken. Even when it worked it was impossible to finish because of how insanely hard it is to fly helicopters without a controller.
