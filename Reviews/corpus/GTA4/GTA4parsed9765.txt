I love the GTA franchise, but this one is the worst of all of them. I didnt like so much the history and the game has a lot bugs. Its a fun game, but the bugs and friends calling all the time asking to see them, makes the game extress.Some bugsCars that i stolen just disapear after cut scenesOne of the last missions just bugged on one part that says to repeatly press jump key to get in the chopter and no matter how fast i press never is enough i couldnt finish the game because of this bugOne time i went drink with Roman and aftes the cut scene the police apears and rest me without reason
