GTA IV remains to this date my favorite GTA game. It has great physics, great combat, a great story and fun activites. Although its not as polished as GTA V it still has this charm that in my opinion is unbeatable. There are a few issues that plague the PC version however and id like to start with GFWL. GFWL is arguably one of the worst online gaming services to ever come over the PC market, if you want to get this game to run you will have to try a number of different fixes, however it isnt the worst or hardest thing to do to get a game running, but realistically the game should run right off the bat. Another issue is the terrible texture glitches, regardless of your PC specs there will be a number of texture bugs that really ruin immersion and can make the game look ugly at times. Finally the last issue is in regards to the FPS and its pretty shocking even with good hardware. Dont let this put you off though, because honestly this game is something worth all the issues. Id recommend buying this whilst its on sale or from a 3rd party website.
