Mechanicly a fine GTA game, but lacks all the soul and interesting characters that made all previous GTA games special. The maincharacters especially Niko Bellic were so bland or when they went with ridiculous comedic relief it just wasent funny. The dialog just wasent up to par what ive been used to in GTA games and what was always my favorite part about them.But I guess it is an allright GTA sandbox to mess around in, but honestly you are just better off playing GTA V for that.Not outright bad, just innoffensive. The Rice Cake of the GTA franchise.
