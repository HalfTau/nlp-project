I had both this and gta 5 on consol a few years back. the only reason i bought them on pc is to  play with the mods. a week after i got gta 5 they destroyed open vi and now i cannot play those mods. literally the only reason i bought them again was taken away from me. i will never buy another take two game after this. they have destroyed my trust.
