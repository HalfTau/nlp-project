Grand Theft Auto IV greatly blends a reallife criminal simulator with satire of the American culture and view of life, however, as you advance deeper and deeper in the games realistic part you begin to wonder was all of this necessary?Let me begin by furtherly analyzing the above the game starts and you are Niko Bellic, a Serbian immigrant who, after repeatedly hearing from his cousin Roman about how great life in America is, decides to go live in Liberty City a fictional New York to find a better life, while also having his own secret motives, that reveal themselves later in the game.Its the land of opportunity!, as Roman points out many times in the game, but is it really? Is everything so perfect as Roman describes it? As the story progresses on we find out that this utopia does not exist and only the few get to really realize the dreams of their lives, pretty much like in the rest of the world.This motive is played really well in the game, pretty much like in all the previous games of the series, but even more so, thanks to its added realism.Speaking of the latter, GTA IV manages to improve in mainly two fields, compared to its predecessors Graphics and Realism.The graphics are great, after all its the game that began the transition of the series in its HD universe, from the cartoony 3D universe of the previous games. The city feels very nice, with the weather occasionally changing and a miniature world unfolding every day, with very realistic behaviors from the people inhabiting it.The car models however are the true beauty of the game the shininess they emanate, especially the racing ones, makes you really feel like you are watching an HD movie, instead of a video game.The added realism, on the other hand, at first really catches your attention as it pushes the limits far more than any other of the series games attempted you can now watch the TV, with so many fictional programs that it would take you many hours to see them all, while all the same you can browse the internet in the games fictional web, but with so many reallike sites from daily news and food ads to... prn websites! that it makes you realize that Rockstar did a lot of effort to make the game feel more real than ever.Among other things, you also get a mobile phone this time, with which you can contact people you meet in the game either friends or girlfriends and engage in all kinds of activities bowling, darts, pool, eating, drinking to the point of getting drunk and getting chased by the police, should you decide to drive personally, while feeling nauseated by the hangover induced shakycam, go to stand up comedy shows, cabarets and, last but not least, strip clubs!The famous heart shaped health which you found in the previous games in random spots in the city is now gone and instead you have to find hot dog stands or restaurants to replenish your health or, of course, get a good nap in your designated houses and the badge icon that lowered your wanted level is also absent, since this time you have to actually evade the police and hide from their radar range for some seconds, to get rid of them.Even stealing the cars feels more realistic, as the main character now smashes the windows of parked cars to enter them, or points a gun to the drivers of moving ones.To conclude, you can also dress your character, like in some of its predecessors, to make the game feel even more realistic, but thank god they removed the going to the gym to get fit part of the game, present in GTA San Andreas.With all that in mind and many other reallife simulations the game has, but I feel dont need to be described, but played instead you initially feel in awe with what GTA IV offers and how closer are games getting to our lives, but as the story progresses you begin to wonder is all of this necessary? Do I really have to socialize with the ingame friends and engage in various activities even if there are rewards from said socializing, wasting my time instead of getting ahead with the missions and story?At a certain point I realized that Rockstar went too far this time I play games to escape reality, not to find myself in a second one. As such, the more time I spent in the game, the less of these social activities I took part on.In fact, graphics and realism were the only parts the game improved compared to the rest, since the combat mechanics and car models were mostly the same, or even less... Im looking at you, Rhino Tank, which was scrapped in the name of realism truly a pity, driving it was one of the most fun parts in the other games!The game even has the now famous moral dilemmas with which you have to choose whether to kill a character or let him live to kill another instead! and subsequently set in motion a different turn of events each time, which I found to be OK, not bad, but probably unecessary for the likes of a GTA game, where most of its characters are far from saints heck, even normal people with flaws, far from it!. The revenge motive plays a lot in the game too again, not so successfully as in other games in my opinion, like Bioshock, while the games protagonist gets to work with or against many types of mafias and mob bosses Russian, Albanian, Irish, Chinese Triads, Gangstas and, of course, Italian only the Japanese Yakuza was absent.The ending too, feels a bit sad and doesnt deliver the same closure the previous games had, thats realism for you.The radio stations are, of course, present here as well, though I did not find most of the songs as catchy as in GTA Vice City with few exceptions Ruslanas eurovision winner song, Wild Dances was great to hear, so I got to prefer the custom station instead, Indipendent FM.Some easter eggs are there too check inside the Statue of Liberty lookalike, if you dont believe me!.I truly enjoyed the foreign accents of the various characters by the way, especially the angry taxi driver that Roman sent you again and again, realy funny guy.There is also an online multiplayer component, but I didnt get even close to trying it, Im not quite sure its still active anyway, especially now with GTA Vs appearance.To sum it all, GTA IV is a great game, with beautiful graphics, many jokes and references to the American way of life, loads of awesome action as per tradition and a nice story, however the continuous need to improve the way the game simulates real life went too far this time and ruined part of it.Hopefully GTA V corrected this part, all I hear is praise after all... with that said, weve reached the end of this review quick, wasnt it?. If you managed to read up till now I hope well catch up again in the next one, when I complete GTA V!Until then... game on!
