GTA IV is a great game, if a little difficult. Its 3rd person open world style adds to its grit. However the game doesnt take itself seriously. A man using bull shark testosterone to get high? Its starting to sound like Saints Row. I digress, GTA IV is a great game and you should get it. but only on sale
