I bought this game to play with all the cool mods but its not worth it at all, its a bad port that steam needs to fix it has all sorts of problem like needing games for windows live and a rockstar social club. If you dont have both these things the  game wont run at all and if you do it wont stop there it just get worst and worst. Just avoid this, the mods are the worth trying to get this game to work and if you do want to play this game, buy it for the console
