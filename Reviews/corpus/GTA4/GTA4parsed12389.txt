I seriously would not recommend this game on steam. It was on sale so I bought it and I was really disappointed. This game includes a lot of problems which are failing to login in to games, failing to recognize social club account. I have watched many youtube videos, read solutions from social club themselves and nothing helped. I was just downloading a bunch of new programs and still could not make the game run. DONT BUY THIS GAME. SAVE YOUR 3 EVEN IT IS ON SALE.
