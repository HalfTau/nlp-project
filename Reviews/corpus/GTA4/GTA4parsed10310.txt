Okay, people complain about this game being horrible for pc. And i understand, the time required to fix the games problems is boring and fustrating. Even i could not get the game to run in steam, so i dont get the overlay and it wont record my playtime. All of that aside i had a blast with this game. This is the second best GTA today. I bought gta 4 to jump straight into modding the game but i decided to replay the whole story again because it was so much fun. Even after beating the game there  is still alot to do. For example there are side middions, flying rats, dates, BOWLING, darts, night clubs, strip clubs and lets not forget, MAYHEM. In conclusion this game gets a 8 out of 10 because the game kicks butwastingthe process to get the game to run is stupid, boring and timewasting. Rockstar needs to stop being greedy s and make a patch. Rockstar is so greedy that the 25 off on gta 5 meant nothing because they changed the price to 90 dollers so the toltal price was the same ammount as the original price for gta 5.Edit well i actually fixed this game up to as much as i could, Razer game booster is also a must for this game, even with a good computer it is needed. I can launch it in the steam libary now, i can get get overlay and count my playtime. I still use the trainer with this game to kinda battle with all of the crashes andbut what ever, i love this game and so should you 3Edit2 I know the 2016 patch came out, first patch in 6 years. pretty good patch, blocks all ASI LOADERS though so no more trainers or mods FOR NOW. windows 810 compatibility was added for gfwl, so multiplayer will be back and thriving shortly. Minor performance, as in no more crashes when alttabbing.
