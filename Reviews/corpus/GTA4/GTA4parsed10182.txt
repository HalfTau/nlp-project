Grand Theft Auto IV stars foreign Niko Bellic in the brown Liberty City along with his bowling obsessed cousin to actually try and have a decent life in a  city. Of course no task as of that is real easy to do, many enemies will encounter Niko such as inexperinced cops, gangsters that have him surrounded 360, pigeons, Games for Windows Live, Optimization issues, the AutoAim system, the person telling me that free aim was in the options in the entire time even after looking and after I completed the game, the person scolding me for using a controller on GTA IV, etc. However Niko soon finds out about the hidden secret in LC known as modding and he finally unlocks the secrets to living in Liberty City peacefully.Okay but seriously, GTA IV on itself is a pretty decent game with its flaws, but modding pretty much turns it into a huge sandbox with so many things to do and experiment. Graphical mods, weapons, vehicles to things that give Niko new abilities or maybe turn him into a cop or something like that. Skys the limit.
