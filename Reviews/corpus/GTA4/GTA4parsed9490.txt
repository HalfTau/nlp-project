I dont even have to play this game to tell you that it is great.  I have, but I dont need to.  Grand Theft Auto is a legendary series and this is probably one of their best games.  Ofcourse, GTA 5 has alot more features and blows this one out of the park, but the story to this one is longer, less rich. THey both have their pros and cons...  However, this is a great game.
