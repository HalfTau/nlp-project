Although there are definitely some issues with this PC port, I found myself having much more fun with GTA 4 on PC than I did with GTA 4 on the Xbox 360. Although the multiplayer which was excellent is now dead, the game still offers a compelling singleplayer experience that I think is wellworth its current price.Just be wary of the Games for Windows Live issues. Those may completely destroy the experience if you are unable to get them working.
