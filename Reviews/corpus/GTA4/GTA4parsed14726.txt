GTA4 is a great game and is hardly comparable to JC2 simply because its a totally different game and experience all together. I felt more restricted in GTA4 than I did in San Andreas. There were no vehicle modification options and the outfits were very limited. JC2 has no options like this either but its not the kind of game that you would really desire it.
