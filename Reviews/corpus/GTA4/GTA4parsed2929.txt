TakeTwo are really screwing over  the people making them money, consumer.Hope to see major changes, but this will of course never happen.. After the statement from Rockstar that refused to acknowledge that OpenIV was just for singleplayer, I now consider that Rockstar is also to blame for this.Great game otherwise. If you canget the game without giving TakeTwo or Rockstar money and that will also avoid the numerous DRMs that the game has, do try it out.
