I loved Grand Theft Auto V, and so I finally decided to come back and write this.You play as Niko Bellic, a European guy whom must survive with his cousin Roman.The gameplay was fairly cliche, rather vauge as well...didnt really like it very well. I managed through the WHOLE campaign, but regretted it soon after the ending was worse than Twighlights love story..
