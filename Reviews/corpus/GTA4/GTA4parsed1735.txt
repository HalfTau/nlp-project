My game crashed several times throughout the storyline. Saving was tedious because you can only save at a safehouse which doesnt help when the game constantly crashes. I managed to complete the game and it was a great story. The game also crashed when I tried for the highest video/graphical settings despite having a toptier card in 2017.
