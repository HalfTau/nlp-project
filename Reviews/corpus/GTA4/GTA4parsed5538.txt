Top price and you have to how over your head to just run this game. Outdated technologies, which does not work anymore on modern os, outdated almost mandatory logins, which , of course, dose not work at this date. And then horible controls, very mediocre graphics and subpar story. At a lot of times just boring. With enemies teleporting at your locations. Wow, I did not even know that mafia had teleporters at 2000..something.
