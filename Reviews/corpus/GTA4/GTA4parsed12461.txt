Id like to say something about this, This game has Games for Windows Live, which we all know, got shut down... It also does not run well on 8.1, an operating system that was not around when the game was released. Despite these two things, people buy it and complain that it wont run on 8.1. I have 8.1 and cannot get it to work, nor am i supprised. If you want this game and are willing to put in the time and effort to make it work, get it. if not, dont complain when it refuses to cooperate.
