Honestly, Im 26 hours in and Im bored out of my mind. Missions are repetitive and simple and most of them lack any kind of real action. Go here kill this guy. Follow this guy and kill him. Also what the hell is with the driving mechanics in these games? Go give the saints row series a try at least those are fun. I know gta is the bees knees and all that but seriously, its overrated.
