Boring story. Boring single player. Boring side quests. Irritating secondary characters. Bad game mechanics. Bad aiming. Bad weapons. Poor handling on most cars.And yet cops and robbers might just be the most intense multiplayer game you will ever play.Play single player once. Play cops and robbers until you die.
