I recommend this game because its a good game, singleplayer is very viloent, multiplayer, isnt so bad. So, I recommend multiplayer. Set all grahic levers to low for you wont disconnect. If it does not do right, keep on clicking until it takes affect. Like, left mouse, space, doesnt work? Try again till it works, still wont work? Restart the game and bam, there you go.
