In general, its not a bad game. However its getting really old really fast, especially if youre in gaming from GTA 1.Cosidering main character is somewhere from Balkans and I understand the language, voiceover actor did extremely poor job. Just terrible, completely destroys any possibility to emerse in game. I feel like playing some Bgrade game thank to him. I hope they hire a native speaker in future projects. However I doubt I will play any of them.GTA...I played all of them. In my long gaming career, a new GTA is simply becoming a new chore list of go there  kill that. Its in boring.Story is lets say interesting, but not interesting enough to make me finish the game.Friendly NPC in the game are such a nuisance, I dont feel they add to reality.. Character like Niko Bellic oh yes, nothing more anoying then hearing Niko himself mispronounce his surname with BeliK, also there is not double LL in surnames of locals where he comes from....Where was I? Oh yes. Boring NPCs. Too bad you cant kill them, I would have... especially that Brucie to whom character like Niko would never in his life hang out, never...period. Or cousine Roman...Best aspect of the game for me are some hillarous radio or TV shows. All other is nothing new and seen thousand times in games.Also, Rockstar is really getting on my nerves with promoting thug life and criminals.So all about this game was a paininthefrom my point of view. To bad, money badly spent. Comparisonwise, I enjoyed much more playing Just Cause 2. With GTA IV I struggled for months to finish it, just for the sake of completing the story. I could not. Simply not worth my time. Uninstalled, 80 through the game.Yeah, that would be it... I guess, not bad game if you never played any other GTAs or similar games... but otherwise its nothing new and gives feeling like heathy crap food that your parents made you eat. Its good, but its crap.
