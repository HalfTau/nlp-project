OK, i will give it to rockstar, they made the game work in windows 10. However, the game runs like dog i would like my money back but since i have spent more than a few hours making it fricking work, i cant get a refund, i can only pull about 15 fps in this game. and I know its not my computer because i can run GTA V at ultra settings 1080p at 80100 fps. this game is just the absolute worst pc port of all time. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! !
