Grand Theft Auto IV it is an awesome game throughout experiance and never let me down. The story is not too engaging but it is definately fun to play and experiance. The vehicles at best are decent but often feel like the wheels are made of butter. The multiplayer is not working for me and the port for this game is not good at all. In fact when I first bought this game it would not launch. If u are having this problem message me and I can fix it. Also if its cheap and you know how to fix the launch problem then buy this. Also the port is bad. very bad. 9/10
