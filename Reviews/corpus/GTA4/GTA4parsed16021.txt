Grand Theft Auto IV is a very fun game. Although i have seen better graphics before in does not change the fact that it is one of my favourite games. The story is very interesting you are a russian who comes to america on a boat because your cousin tells you that he is rich and has nice cars, a mansion and hot girls but when you finally get to his house you are not happy with what you see. that is only a very vague idea of the actual story. the gameplay is very fun and i would highly recommend it to anyone.
