I dont recommend this game because it doesnt work, I havent been able to play it. I paid 20.00 for nothing. I spent 12 hours looking for solutions to my problem. Nothing came up, the steam support team is almost impossible to contact. Overall, steam isnt good and GTA IV is a waste of time and money.
