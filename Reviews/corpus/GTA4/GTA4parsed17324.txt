Many people sau that this game is over rated. Its not. Its amazing. The graphics suck, there are ftons of glitches, but DAMN is it fun or what! You drive around, you do stuff for people, eventually this ends up in a shootout, you shoot the people, you get bored, you get a hooker, you kill the hooker and take their money. 10/10
