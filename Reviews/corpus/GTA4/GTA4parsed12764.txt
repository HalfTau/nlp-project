After i got the Grand Theft Auto Complete Pack as a gift from a very special person ive got more time to finish GTA IV and also complete GTA IV collection... My personal favorite is San Andreas and course GTA IV so far. But there also cons and pros for  it so ill start with pros for GTA IV PROS Beautiful graphicsPromise of mods and DLCSame fantastic game in new packagingOffers 32 player MP supportCustom ingame music via Independence FMVideo Editor now allows you to capture and share gameplay footageSuperb character driven storyLiberty City feels aliveMultiplayer modes that let 32 players go wild across the entire cityGenuinely funny radio and TV shows, comedy acts, and character dialogueAmazing writingIncredibly detailed worldBowlingDartsPool TableMultiplayer feels alive on many modes whoever said MP is dead is surely a GTA hater and funny things to do in free modeLets not forget about the cons CONS Technical issuesPoor control schemePoor portOccasional problems with friendly AISome minor visual quirksWindows Live account needed to save progressMouse and keyboard controls arent nearly as good as Xbox 360 controllerNot for the easily offendedNight Shadow causes heavy lagg on highly optimized PCWhere is AntiAliasing choppy details on Very High SettingsBadly optimized for PCNeeds optimized updates for a PCI would recommend the game for the people who loves GTA series and if you do like and love it, buy the complete collection for having lots of fun. I hope updates will keep on going for GTA IV because its poorly optimized for PC after many years of release.GTA  San Andreas  CONS  PROSPROS 3 Huge city areas to explore with countryside missions and desertHuge list to complete for 100Knownable movie actors with Samuel L.
