After installing the game it will not run. After a quick google search I find that a lot of people have experienced the same thing. By default the game install is broken, fixing it requires you to modify game files. If you are not willing to modify game files stay away from this game. For that reason this game gets a thumbs down as it was very unpleasant to have to fix the game myself just to play something I paid for. Rockstar, you suck.
