This has tons of mixed reviews.ProsOne of the better stories in the GTA seriesGraphics are nice and atmosphereicWeapons are fun and its better than the older games to go on shootoutsCheats are way more accessible than the previous games, and in the latest GTACars from GTA SA are updated and look more like the cars they were based off ofConsNot much clothes varietyDriving is like Disney Princesses on iceLimited Ammo with weaponsTaking any sort of damage, being pushed lightly, hitting the wrong thing, or falling slightly can get rid of the cheat menu in an instantLess unique vehicles, more generic carsSometimes confusing mission objectives and overall confusing mapIt may seem like more cons than pros, but its up to you. For me, the pros outweigh the cons and this game is one of my favorites in the series with Vice City. All in all, this game is up to the player, not just me.TLDR  Buy it, play it yourself. If it sucks or doesnt work tweak the experience/game or refund.
