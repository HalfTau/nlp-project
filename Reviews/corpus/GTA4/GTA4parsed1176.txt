Without a doubt, GTA IV is a legendary game and will STILL be for years to come. It caused Rockstar to continue on devoloping on the HD Universe and to create amazing storylines. Both DLCs reconmended as well.However, there are cons to go along with the pros that I will mention belowPROS Graphics quality is amazing considering the fact that this game was from 2008 Doesnt require a dedicated graphics card can play happly on Intel HD 530 with an i5 6200U Laptop CPU. Set expectations low though! Set all settings to low, 800x600 Resoloution with 43 Aspect ratio, I can still happly play GTA 4 floating at 4070 FPS! Cheap, especially on sales Heads up guys, Halloween is coming One of the best stories, but most balanced by GameplayStory ratio Chinatowns story was better, but gameplay was poop.CONS Multiplayer? Forget about it. Unless you got yourself a Windows Live ID, which Im sure you cant obtain now. Autosave disabled without Windows Live ID, BUT you can get a local ID, but no Multiplayer is a deal breaker for some Not a lot of mods to be seen, most of them are either broken, dead, or doesnt exist on the internet anymore.Overall?If you are used to playing Offline Whats up GTA SA iPad players!, and you dont bother playing online This kid who lives down my street screams on his mic, please send help, get the complete GTA IV Set. Yeah, no jokes. GTA IV, Ballad of Gay Tony and The Lost and The Damned. They go cheap on Steam sales. Be paitent. Definetly worth more than GTA V.
