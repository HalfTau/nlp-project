Grand Theft Auto IV is a very fun game, period. Throughout the GTA series, we have seen openworld settings and sandbox style gameplay. GTA IV has these qualities, but not to the same extent as other titles in the series.ProsGTA IV manages to retain the satirical style of past titles, and takes it to a whole new level. Often times I sit in my vehicle, not doing the objective because I want to listen to the hilariouson the radio, such as Integrity 2.0 or Judge Grady. Also they added TV, which can be pretty funny as well.Grand Theft Auto IV has a strong campaign mode, which has a variety of different style missions, not just the same thing over and over. It has strong character development across the board with only a few exceptions.GTA easter eggs are everywhere and they are often very clever. I could spend hours on the ingame internet just reading funnyand looking for easter eggs.ConsThe game has a lot of focus on the story, limiting many of the activities previously available on other titles, such as being a cabbie, a paramedic, or changing your appearence to appeal more to others. GTA San Andreas is probably the second best or best title in the series, and from San An to IV Rockstar cut a lot of stuff which they couldve added to make the game so much better.My main issue with GTA is that often I found myself always doing the campaign because there was nothing else to do. Once I beat the game, which was pretty fast, the only thing to make it fun was modding. Modding is by far the best part of gta 4 for pc. There are so many creative mods out there that completely change the game for the better. But I shouldnt have to mod to fix Rockstars mistakes.In summary, the game has a fun campaign with many hidden secrets, but after thats over theres nothing to do and you have to turn to modding. I give the game a 7 out of 10 because of its lack of freedom outside of the campaign. Other than that I still recommend it because, you know. Its GTA
