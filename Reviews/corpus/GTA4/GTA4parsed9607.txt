awful. It wont start after HOURS of trouble shooting tutorials, walkthroughs, downloads, etc... I feel robbed and rockstar has yet to make it up to millions of customers who bought this game and who havent played a single minute. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME, I WAS YOU A WEEK AGO WHO THOGUHT oh, this will probably work for me and if not it wont be to hard to fix. JUST WALK AWAY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE
