Let me start by saying Windows Live doesnt ruin the game at all, its just people being whiny about not being able to jump into the game, first time loading it, instantly and you only need to do it once, after that, you can basically jump into your game instantaniously.GTA IV is an amazing game and Ive completed it multiple times on Console along with TBoGT and TLaD and theyre both amazingly good fun, Its a game that you can play for hours on end and not get bored with.not to mention the mods you can get for this game and the physics.Pick this game up if youre into glitchy swingsets, Yugoslavian accents and most importantly...... bowling.
