To new buyers. Be prepared to a madness of the failed Windows Live accounting. I was first informed that autosave would not be possible without an ancount, okay, could deal with that, then same thing with the manual save. So, i tried creating the account. I might have been able to, but after ten minutes of fiddling around, i stoped. I had a problem because i have had no microsoft account before, i did however have a Skype account, which is now Microsoft. And instead a creating a new one which to be fair, could be an issue for piracy i had to merge, and create new passwords, over and over, until i quit in frustration. I counted four times, where i hade to minimize the game, and maximize again, hoping to get on, only to get frustrated by a new popupHad Rockstar lifted some of the need for Windows Live, i would not have given this a bad review. Windows Live did not become mainstream, they could have abondoned it with a patch.Im going to play San Andreas now.
