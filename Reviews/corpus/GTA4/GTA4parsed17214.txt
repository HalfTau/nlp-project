GTA IV was probably one of the good/bad games of its time, but its more good than bad, so ill go through pros and cons on itPROSCHARACTERS Every character you meet has emotion and you make bonds with them, and if you had to make a choice with something it was hard to do.  Each character you meet has a different feel to them, and they are all loveable.GUNS The guns were good in this game, when you shot someone it did feel like you did damage, and it showed, the guns in the beginning suck, but when you get the stronger guns you can do much more damage to someone.RELATIONSHIPS You can have relationships with people you meet in the story, and so far every one you meet I have loved.GRAPHICS The graphics are good, even though I seriously hate people that think Oh the graphics look terrible the game must suck Thats a huge lie, look at Minecraft, Half Life 1, DOOM, those games looked like pure crap, but they are still fun, and if you do say you are a true gamer and you care for graphics then you arent a true gamer.FIGHTING I love this, I know im gonna get hate for saying this but GTA Vs fighting is so boring, its just duck, counter, hit, hit, duck, counter, dead.  Atleast in this one if you picked a fight with a old guy sometimes, he would kick the crap out of you.EXPLORATION There are so many things in this game I havent noticed even when I first bought it till now, you can ride the railcars going from one island to another, I NEVER knew about that, and there are so many places you can go.ITEMS LYING AROUND Throughout the city Items are scattered everywhere, to meleeing weapons to actual guns and grenades, and medkits, but they arent easy to find, at all, and some are in such a annoying spot, I found body armor on a high way sign with no latter up, and they expect me to get that HOW?!CONSDRIVING Driving in this game feels so weird, its like you have 2 dryers on the front of your car, and if you hit something at a angle you can spin the car out pretty badly, that and when you hit something your car dead stops, seriously, and I hate the fact that if you flipped the car on its roof you are basically screwed.RUNNING AND JUMPING These mechanics are kind of weird...you feel so slow when you jump over something or have to climb over, it takes forever, and you dont even get that much sprint if you are trying to run away from something or someone.COPS In almost EVERY GTA game the cops can be a pain, but in this it feels like they are more of a pain, not only if they do something to you, IE you are sitting in a car and a cop runs into your car you get a wanted level, but if you are wanted and try to run its really annoying, the radar you have will make a blue and red flashing outline to show that you have to get out of it to get away from the cops.  Dont get me wrong, its kind of nice, but it sucks when you are outside of the line, are waiting for a few seconds, you have 1 SECOND LEFT before it goes away, and some cop just Happens to come around the corner and see you, and you gotta start the WHOLE THING OVER AGAIN, not to mention when you get a max of 6 stars you may as well just die, no way you are getting out of that, or a PayNSpray.RELATIONSHIPS WITH FRIENDS I like the fact you can have fun with the characters you meet in the story, but jesus they pester you ALL THE TIME, and they get all upset that you dont want to go bowling AGAIN, Seriously Roman, go away.HEALTH SYSTEM This is another thing that aggrivated me, the health goes away SO fast, even if you have armor, you get hit by a car while running it can take away a good half of your health or more, and really, food to heal? Yes there are medkits lying around the city but its not like they are THAT easy to find in the first place.FLYING The PC controls for flying just suck, I suggest you change the keys around to maybe Saints Row 3 flying controls, VERY nice if you do it that way.MONEY I know getting money in ANY game is nice, but in this it feels so heavy, if you dont buy ANYTHING and just do all the missions, you can get almost 1 million bucks, but what are you supposed to spend money on in the first place? All you really need is strong guns and some armor, as well as food for health, thats really it, the rest is just worthless.There are ALOT of bad things and good things about this game, but if you get a config tool you can ignore most of them and just focus on the fun! 8/10EDIT 1 Niko isnt russian, hes siberian, I know its crazy.
