How do I start...Oh, maybe like this. This game is a 50/50. What do I mean by that? Well, it was good for the first month or two but last week it suddenly stopped working, it was fun while it lasted I guess. Im really dissapointed, I always play relatively old games because I think theyll be more fun/elaborated, especially the GTA franchise. I actually would NEVER recommend this game to anyone who wants a game that works.
