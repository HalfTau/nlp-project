After buying this game off Steam, not once have I been able to load it. I get the window for Rockstars Social Club, create two different accounts just for  and giggles, download the Social Club app from their website, and still no go. Way to go, Rockstar. If it wasnt obvious you didnt care about the PC community before, it is now... The game is awesome. But I cant even play it. Means I spent 20 bucks on NOTHING. Enjoy my money, because I wont be enjoying your game.
