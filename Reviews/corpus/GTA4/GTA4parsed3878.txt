One of my favorite game right now, i really enjoyed playing this.Even it was soooo long, it wasnt boring, so story was great only at the end i gets same mission, find someone, kill someone and etc.Unfortunately, i completed gta4 after gta5 because my pc was so bad for gta4 and i played gta5 on my old xbox 360.Car physics even better then in gta5 xD.Theres one big problem, its GFWLBut i disabled it with patch, and its works fine. Also optimisation is not good, I have 3560 fps on my gtx 1060, but i think its because my old amd athlon II X4 635 but ofc its was playble. And its in 2017, i cant even imagine what it was in 2008.So my score is.
