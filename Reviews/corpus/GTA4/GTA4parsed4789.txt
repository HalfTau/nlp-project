GTA IV is a great game. Its been out for a long time now and its a game Ive played a lot with friends. GTA IVs MP is different than GTA V where its a lot more caotic. Why? Because theres a lot more people sticking in one area destroying each other. If youre far away, expect someone to hunt you down lol. Anyway, I highly recommend this game.
