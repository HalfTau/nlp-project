I bought this game because it is summer sale and I thought just buy it! its just 6....After installing I was hyped to play GTA IV once more and men was Iafter this BSwith socialclub and windowslive...Once you overcame this you might think yeah Im finally going to play this gameBut you get punched right in the face for that... You have to spend alot of time finding outhow to change your graphics unless you live under a rock and want to play this in 800x600on lowest settings. to fix this I right clicked on GTA IV in steam propertiesstarting options norestrictionsAfter that initial pain in thei could finally play this ing game on highest settings.So if you arent willing to spend several hours just to get this piece offixed do yourselfa favor and dont but this. If you say I dont care go ahead and buy this..
