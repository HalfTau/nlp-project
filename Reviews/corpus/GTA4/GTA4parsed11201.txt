I bought this game thinking I would be able to play it on my PC as I loved the game while playing it on Xbox at a friends. However, Windows Live will not allow me to even begin playing the game. I just struggle to even get to the menu. Wish I could get my money back as I spent 20. Do not buy this game for PC.
