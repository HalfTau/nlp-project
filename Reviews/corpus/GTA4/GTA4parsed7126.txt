Id always thought people were just being picky when they said something was a bad port. Never have I been so unpleasantly surprised. This game is a pain to get working and to set up, all of the time I have logged onto the game was time spent trying to get the game to work to absolutely no avail. Should you seriously want to play this game, youd be better off buying the PS3 or XBox 360 versions as those are what the game was obviously made for granted other game stores might rip you off and still charge relatively outrageous prices for such an old game, I know GameStop does.
