Games for Windows Live is... Interesting.I run patch 1.0.4.0, so Windows Live is no bother to me. If you have problems with Windows Live, check this link out.As of gameplay, this game is amazing. An interesting story line filled with relatable characters, and edge of your seat moments. Its packed with a lot of jokes, and just a really fun game to play.The driving is really bad. Other than that, its a great game.
