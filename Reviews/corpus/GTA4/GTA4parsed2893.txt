Purchased this on PC for the mods had already owned it on PS4. Very disappointed with Take Two and whomever elses decision it was to hurt the modding community. Cant recommend another GTA until its resolved which sucks, because I was going to buy a shark card for reasons and now I have to be all political and hold off.
