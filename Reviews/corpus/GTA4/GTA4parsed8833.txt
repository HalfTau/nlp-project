I spent around 4 hours just trying to get the game to work. If it wasnt Social Club causing me problems, it was the stupid SecuROM DRM. Isnt Steam supposed to be DRM in itself? I finally managed to get the game running but it is so horribly optimised that I dont think Im going to bother playing it. I tried some mods to improve the visuals which worked to some extent but the real problem is the FPS issue. Its constantly up and down between 5 and 60, which makes it very unplayable. A shame as Ive just finished GTAV which played perfectly.
