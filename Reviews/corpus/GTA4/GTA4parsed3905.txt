This port is notoriously bad even after the recent update. Bug on the last mission required a workaround to beat the game. The game itself is fun when it works, but poor optimization and bugs hold it back. Has the best story of any GTA game though. Also requires GFWL, which is always a con. Rockstar reallythe bed on this port, and its a shame because the game itself is good.
