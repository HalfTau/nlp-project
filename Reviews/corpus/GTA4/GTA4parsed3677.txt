Im looking for someone. Looking? Found someone you have Id say hmmm. Niko Bellic, a Serbian with no sympathy for human beings. I just completed this game, after playing it for the past couple of days.Its a good way to go to a less crowded and kinder New York state than in real life. Except of course the cab drivers, the uptight people, the jerks on the street, the high level of crime, and theres a lot of parody in both the things said and the advertisements that have a similarity to real life. Pick this game up if you have a disdain for Russians or just want to see how long you can survive an onslaught on a six star wanted level.
