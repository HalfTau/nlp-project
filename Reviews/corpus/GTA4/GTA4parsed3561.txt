Set in a farcical version of NYC, Rockstars 4th installment in the GTA franchise tells an interesting story about an immigrant moving to a post9/11 America. Overthetop humor and sterotypes are used to deliver commentary of the social and political climate of the early to mid oughts.What shines about this game is the story telling. The game follows a man drug into a life of crime by his circumstances and attitude which disallows him to be held down. Finding out that a man who betrayed his village is also in the city, the protagonist also seeks retribution.The controls can be frustrating at times, with cars often feeling like theyre on ice and the main character moving just a bit further than you intended due to a large turn radius or finishing a walking animation. Another issue Which is resolved in the add on campaigns for the game, is that the save points within missions are too far apart. If you die in a gunfight that required driving across the city, instead of placing you where you drove, it will make you go the whole distance again.However, these annoyances can be tolerated to experience the comedy in the game that is both intentional and unintentional. All of the talk radio stations have caricatures of all types of people liberals, conservatives, starlets, ect. and all of the main characters and generic npcs have tons of dialogue that is equal parts humorous, biting, and fitting thematically.
