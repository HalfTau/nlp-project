This is a sham, GFWL and GFWM are basically broken.Ive been mired in a cycle of this game not launching, GFWL not authenticating my account, and Microsoft discontinuing diagnostic services for GFWL. The discussion board is choked with people encountering a menagerie of problems with the games DRM, unfortunately after a few hours of combing through the compiled misery I couldnt find any solutions.Avoid this game unless it can be found DRM free, otherwise its a ing scalping.P.S.They wont refund me, Im salty as hell.
