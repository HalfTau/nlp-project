Unplayable on Windows 10. Game wont launch. At fault is something called Securom. I bought the game fairly on Steam, I dont expect it to be crippled with invasive broken DRM. Id like a refund. A required security module cannot be activated. This program cannot be executed 8016. Please have a look atfor further, more detailed information.
