Bought this game to kill people, sell drugs and  s. Playing bowling with my brother and friends instead. Best GTA story! Great atmosphere, weather, music. I love the city! Got a lot of money from missions, but there is nothing to spend them for. Riding a car a lot. A LOT! Driving from one side of city to another all the time.
