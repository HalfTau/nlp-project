Ive only had this for about 10 minutes, and boy was it a nightmare.SPECSDell Inspiron 1515576th Gen i7 2.20ghz16gb RAM DDR3AMD Radeon M335 4gbREASONSIve been on the Internet for the past hour and it seems like Windows 10 isnt allowing people to play this game. Im no tech expert you can turn to the Web for that. Somehow, when I click the blue Play button, and I sign in for Social Club, I click Play, right? Once I do that, the screen freezes and doesnt do anything. After a few seconds, it returns to its normal state without GTAV launched.
