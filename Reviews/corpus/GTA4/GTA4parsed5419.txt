The game is shipped with an outdated version of the GFWL. It was too hard for morons at Rockstar to just update an installer.Social Club service does not work anymore. Gives login error.Graphics are a mess. Most of the user wont be able to adjust anything.GFWL will require an update which probably  wont download.
