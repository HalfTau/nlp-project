Dont know if was any good back in the day, but today its rubbish.  Acquired all 4 GTAs in a bundle about 4 years ago and decided to fire them up tonight.  Only reason I have 15 mins on this thing is due to the slow and boring cut scene.  Eventually bugged out in the first room when I got into a loop of autosave failed, do you want to retry/login some other thing  no, no, no. repeat.  Would be a waste of money if it was free!
