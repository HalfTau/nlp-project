This is the second game Ive played from Rockstar, being GTAV the first one. And I have to say this is a master piece.PROSGreat storyInteresting charactersLots of misionsVariety of misions you never feel like youre doing the sameover and againGreat weaponsThe city actually feels more alive than GTAVChoices that lead you to different endings, misions and more.Every car handles differentlyCONSCouldve last less and it would have still being a great storyCar handling feels weird, slow and not funCant own a car, but hey its grand theft auto thats the point, right GTAV?Sometimes the game makes you go from one end to the other in the map like for no reason...Very few bugsI feel like this game was so good Rockstar went a step back with GTAV because of the followingAs you play GTAIV you feel like youre actually working hard for your character to become that guy with lots of woman, cars, and gangster stuff. The story takes you through a lot to get to that point, the game makes you feel like youve worked hard to get to the highest point of the story and makes you work a little more to finish the story.In GTAV you dont get this kind of excitement because youre already that guy retired from all thatand wants to make it back to the real world. The missions only consist of only getting ready to make a heist and doesnt feel like youre doing better or working harder to get to the last heist.They are completely two different games Im aware of that but somehow for me GTAV feels like anyother open world game, while GTAIV feels more like a grand theft auto from the old games. I would have like to see an improvement over the storyline, rather than an improvement to the overall world that GTAV offers to the players. It has a lot ofto do, but lets be honest, most of the activities feel like minigames rather than something that adds up to the experience of the game.At the end of the day If you really like GTA youll love this game and probably enjoy V as much as I did. Both games have very good mechanics and will make you want to play more GTA.
