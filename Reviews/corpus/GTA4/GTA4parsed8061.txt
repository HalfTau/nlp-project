Most of the reviews Ive seen here are possibly coming from idiots who doesnt know how to fix their game.Notably the problems that most people are having right now is about the dreadedthat Microsoft doesnt really care anymore.You have to put a code in GFWL otherwise not only you cant play Multiplayer but it wont let your save files and whoever came up with that idea is a . Whats worse is that many users complained that the code that comes with IV doesnt even work.But that can be easily fixed with the use of a tool called Xliveless for some reason, Steam censors that word but its perfectly safe and it allows you to bypass the annoying GFWL Code Authentication/Login.You can download Xliveless hereHowever, if you really want to play GTA IVs official multiplayer mode then I heard that using GTA Episodes from Liberty Citys activation code instead would actually work.Aside from that  GTA IV has been poorly optimised, giving users with low FPS even if you are using an highend PC.But once youre able to get the game playable then Im sure you will enjoy this game a lot better than playing on a console since you get to play with mods such as LCPDFR, Simple Native Trainer, Tsunami, ENB/Graphical Enhancements and many more.I recommend this game because it doesnt feel right that this games Users Reviews score is Mixed just because so many dumbasses doesnt know how to fix the game.You should buy this game if you have a brain that has a good mindset of fixing things while having a PC that could run this game with more 2030FPSOtherwise, purchase this game on a console instead.I heard that downgrading the game from 1.0.7.0 the current patch that Steam is using to 1.0.4.0 would give you more FPS as well as able to get the game compatible with certain mods that are only playable on 1.0.4.0.Just read the instructions hereNow unfortunately, you can no longer buy this game on Steam currently since it ran out of keys for the game.Could this be our chance? That Rockstar Games/TakeTwo Interactive would fix the issues for the game while stocking more keys?Or will they just let the game unbuyable since they no longer support it.
