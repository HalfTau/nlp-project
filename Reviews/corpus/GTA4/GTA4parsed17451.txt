Alright, Has a good graphic appeal to it, guns are fun, dating engine decent. Some things that are lacking is the upgradable vehicles which one would have expected they would have expanded upon. There is no faction base like in GTASA and the quest line seems rather shallow. I would recommend if you bored looking for a cheap game to run through... if you looking for a solid game there are others... Saints Row 3 a better option.
