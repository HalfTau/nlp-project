This game is  trash. Quite franckly I dont know why steam sells it. It took my 5 hourse to download tis game. Then I spent 2 hours trying to make the game finally work. After 2 hourse I finally got the game to open. Then when I try to actually enter the game, it does not let me. It simply throughs me into an endless loading screen of GTA 4 screenshots or whatever you want to call the loading page. By no means am I trashing GTA its self as a game, I personally love the GTA series but this game for the PC jut doesnt work. An i also think it a whole bigg bunch of bullsht that steam selling this. Whats even worse is that I spent 20 on this game and i have neer even gotten to play it and steam will not give me a refund. Its total horse If this game has so many ing problems then just ing stop selling it. Or at least warn people that it might not work. I want my money back. I dont think that I can trust steam games if they just willing sell this
