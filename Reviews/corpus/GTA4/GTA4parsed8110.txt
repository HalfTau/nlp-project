Grand Theft Auto 4 is the first GTA series game that I have ever played, being popular among many i decided to give it a try. One thing I was irritated by at the start was the numerous accounts you need to make in order to play the game through microsofts online gaming platform. The game itself has a great story to follow but also plenty of fun things to do to goof off when you dont want to follow the story all the time. It has plenty of action moments and car chases that have become the motif of the GTA games. Concering the vehicles of GTA 4 most of them handle decently, with motorcycles and helicopters being the exception and being quite frustrating to pilot. In summation, once you get past the annoying startup interface, and a few buggy controls GTA 4 is a fun and enjoyable game that will occupy you for hours on end.
