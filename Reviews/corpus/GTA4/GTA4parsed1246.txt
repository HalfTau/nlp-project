Everything is great about this GTA except for the PC performance optimisation, do not buy if you expect the performance to be on par with the GTA 5 PC Port. If wonky performance doesnt bother you I dont see anything else that should stop you from buying the game it has a great storyline and its one of my favourite GTAs.
