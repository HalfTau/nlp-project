after several sessions of installing and uninstalling the game, of hours spent trying to get it to work, i had finally found a workaround allowing me to play EFLC and GTA IV  games i bought twice, once in retail and once on steam.then rockstar patched it, removing the play offline button of the social club launcher in the process and it wont launch anymore.instead of removing those ridiculous antipiracy measures they made it even more impossible to play the game, paradoxically making pirating it the more convenient option.cant say anything bad about either the main game or any of the two episodes. the whole biker setting of the lost and damned wasnt my cup of tea, but it was still a decent game. the ballad of gay tony was amazing and in my opinion with a little more content it could have been a fullblown entry to the main series instead of an afterthought to IV.still i cant recommend it in its current condition as it wont launch anymore.
