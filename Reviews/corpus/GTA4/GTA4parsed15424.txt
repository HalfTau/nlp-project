GET A GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE ACCOUNT BEFORE OPENING THE GAME. youll thank me later.... i lost 2 hours of progress because i had to quit the ing game to update GFWL aka pile ofDRM required to ing save offline just to ing sign in and lose the progress i was originally trying to save in the first ing place.  you microsoft..... i bought the ing game, i shouldnt need to sign in to ing save.....i thought the product key being used was inconvenient but this takes the ing cake. microsoft a major up with basic game functions since 2008..... now the DRM with the xbox 72ahem xbox one actually makes sense! signing in to save? what the ? i wouldnt mind it it would let me update without closing the ing game without saving..... but, after losing over 2 hours of progress and unskippable cutscenes, imenough to write this review in the hopes that in another steam sale someone will read this and sign up for GFWL and updating the program before starting the ing game.now that the huge negatives are out of the way hows the game? roman is funny as hell..... scratch that, most of the characters are funny as hell. its fun to just play the story.... oraround/cause utter chaos..... and bowling. game looks likegraphics look the same as xbox verson, maybe slightly better but its fun as hell. i bought this game on a whim and it was worth it...... now i just have to restart because of GFWL. haha  you microsoft..... now im really not gonna get an xbox one.... go  yourselves, ill stick to my ps3.EDIT LIKE A YEAR LATERGame no longer wants to run and when it does run its at 27 fps tops.... what the ?
