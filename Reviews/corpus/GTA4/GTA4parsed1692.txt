The game had problems back in the previous update and still does now, most people like me cant even start the game because it freezes on the first screen that pops up. People will tell you to add a command line txt in the main folder or set launch options, but none of those work. I strongly advise to not buy this game on steam, it is the most horrid port of a game ive ever seen, and the developers do not care because they are too busy making money off of shark cards. If you wish to play this game, do the right thing and buy it on console.
