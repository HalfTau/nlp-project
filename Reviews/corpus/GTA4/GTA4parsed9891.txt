Id like to say I spent hours playing this game getting immersed in the storylines, graphics and just messing about but I didnt get past the loading screen. First had to make a Social Club account, then fix those sign in problems, then download GFWL, then make a live account, then an xbox account, then update GFWL. If you want a game where you spend hours trying to get it to work, this is for you. Otherwise, dont waste your money. Buy beer instead.
