I originally had this on PS3,and after almost giving up on getting this to run on PC 2 different rigs,X Live Less saved the day. I was also expecting it to be capped at 30fps like L.A. Noire,but it runs smooth as maxed out at 60fps my monitors refresh rate,stoked! Some Steam achievements would have been nice,and driving vehicles is annoying as hell,but Its a great story/game overall.
