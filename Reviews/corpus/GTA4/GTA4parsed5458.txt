This is the best game ever! Man I just spent 20 on all the GTA one weekend. And I get around to wanting to play this game. And I just have the best experience ever! I open the game and then do a 5 step installation and then wait for it! It asks me for my Rockstar Social Club login! The same one I use for GTA 5 doesnt work! Now after spending 2 hours wondering why its not working is BECAUSE OF THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER! GAMES WITH GOD DAMN WINDOWS LIVE!!! Thanks Dickrosoft!! Your the best! !
