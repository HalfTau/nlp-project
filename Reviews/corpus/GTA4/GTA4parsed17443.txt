Grand Theft Auto IV 4 is a really fun game but it also has some mature content and strong language. I play it with modifacations but you can play it how ever you want. Its multiplayer features are really great to play with people but you must have a Live account Microsoft which is a downside. Also Rockstar Social Club is really annoying at times but you get use to it. All and all this game is great and I reccomend it to everyone 18 Because of the mature content.
