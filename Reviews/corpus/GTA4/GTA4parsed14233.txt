If you enjoyed the game on console and fancied playing it on the pc like I did, then the game looks great although its still all grey and gloomy, but a warning for you out there, if you have a graphics card that has more than 2Gb of VRAM then you will be unable change the settings to anything above the lowest of the low. But there is a fix to it, just follow this guide and you will able to play on high settingsFix It is very simple and doesnt take long at all. But there is also another problem, you cannot save the game without a Games for Windows Live account, which is a nightmare to sort out, but once its done you shouldnt experience too many other problems, although in cut scenes the characters do seem to have this odd clip/vibration to them which does look rather peculiar.If you are willing to put up with all the problems then get it, but if you want a hassle free gaming experience dont pick it up/Hope I was able to help.
