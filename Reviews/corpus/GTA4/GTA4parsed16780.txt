My favorite Grand Theft Auto. Ive yet to uninstall this after buying it a year ago thanks to a great 30 hour campaign, fun multiplayer, and an endless number of mods. Its a shame that this an extremely unoptimized port of a game that already ran poorly on the 360/PS3. For reference, I get 3070 fps on a mix of medium to max settings with a 560 Ti and an AMD Phenom 965 BE. Bottom line I highly recommend this game, but only if you can play it on relatively modern hardware.
