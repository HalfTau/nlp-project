A wonderful classic, if youve never played this game, but enjoyed any other Grand Theft Auto titles I really reccomend purchasing the complete edition. Although, I will warn you, nearly everyone has problems starting the game, most often users of Windows 10. I have windows 10 and ran into problems. But, I was able to fix them with a quick google search and maybe a youtube tutorial. I even got an ENB working with it also, to make this game not so 2008. You can enjoy this classic with a minimal amount of downloading things and sticking them where they need to go, or changing some start up setting. Very simple tasks to enjoy this title!
