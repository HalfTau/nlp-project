For as much as I love the GTA series, Im incredibly disappointed. And the game isnt even the reason! I bought GTAIV in a bundle of numerous other GTA titles and I cant even open the program on my computer without an error closing it immediately. Hours of my time have gone into researching the problem and consulting a tech directly about my issue. It has something to do with the players club or whatever and it seems to be a common problem. Anyway, Ive yet to reach any resolution despite everything Ive tried and I cant play the game. Talk about a huge letdown.As Ive played GTAIV in the past, Id recommend the game to anyone who likes GTA. As far as buying it goes... Ill say that there are some who have found a solution to the issue Ive described. Theres also a chance you might not encounter the issue at all. But know upon going into it that theres a chance you might be stuck wasting your money or investing a significant amount of time in getting the game to run.TLDR I recommend the game. Actually buying it for PC is another story.
