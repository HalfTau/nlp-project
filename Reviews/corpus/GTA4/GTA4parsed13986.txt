WOW, seems like Steam and R blow things up...Everyone who has Windows 8 and above, please dont pay your money to get this game.Its not even working. It will ask to log in in Social Club and then BAAAAAAAAAAAAM  nothing it never come up. It never runs..Money wasted...I would recommend game itself, because it is awesome!Also I found the fix for it.. so now it is working. thanks god.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 0/10 NOT RECOMMENDING unless they would release a patch to fix the problem, otherwise finding it yourself will take some time and it may not work...
