Grand Theft Auto 4 is, pretty good in my opinion. The main game GTA 4 has a nice story, of Niko getting invited to America from his cousin Roman. From violence, to strip clubs. This game is actionpacked with the missions it brings. GTA 4 is not even close as good as GTA SA. That blew away my mind. But one thing I have to say... I enjoyed all of this beautiful moments on the XBOX 360. I couldnt play GTA 4 on PC! It was fine at first, but then the roads, cars, building, starting to become ivis. GTA EFLC is actually really good on PC. Awesome FPS, no glitches at all! Do I recommend picking up the complete edition on PC? No, if you do wanna play GTA on PC pick up San Andreas, Vice City or EFLC, just NOT GTA 4. GET IT ON CONSOLES!
