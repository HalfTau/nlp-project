Exactly how I remember it on Ps3.Ds4 Windows made things like riding bikes and helicopters funneralthough using a Mouse  Keyboard feels better for the shooting IMO.The Story is better and more memorable than its successor GTA V,but that just might be my nostalgia talking.Nikos story interests me more than all three GTA V protagonists combined.
