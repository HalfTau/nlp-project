ok, so usually if you wanted to play online, you would go on the game and just press multiplayer, but if it was a lets say rockstar game, you would sign in on your rockstar account, then you would play. Not i gta 4 though, in gta 4, I signed in and I pressed play, and the game didnt load. I would then press offline and it would work. Well, turns out if you want to have autosave enabled in the game, you need to sign in and sign in for games windows marketplace t, and that takes aton of time to do too, so the online and autosave is ed. Next, I have an alienware 17 17.3 inch laptop, so you know my PC is savage, but according to GTA 4, my PC cant have 1920x1080 P, and have good textures either! Well wow, I can play any high end game on the ultra setting and it would ing work at 60 frames per second easily. Also the game is ing slow, and I only got it because of it being 5, but I regret it, so  off GTA 4 with your t.
