If you want a GTA that is less overthetop like GTA V, has a great story, and good gameplay, well GTA IV fits your criteria.I liked the more serious approach of GTA IV. Of course it had its funny moments, but it was deeper, and more story based.The only reason i have less hours on this game is the opimization. Seriously, i run GTA V med/high settings on 40/60 fpsOn this game, im lucky if i hit 30 on low.
