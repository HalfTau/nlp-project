Well, yeah the Windows Live thing.  Even worse than Ubisofts uplay and thats saying something.But even if you COULD get it to run..... why?  The earlier GTAs were so much better.  Its like they took out all the coolest aspects of the game and just left in the most mundane, generic, open world vehicular shooter.  Really should just skip this one.
