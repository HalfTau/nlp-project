Was a very impressive leap, from SA to IV, when it came out but I felt the game was somewhat disappointing. Side missions feel very unrewarding, for example there are double the amount of hidden packages 200 seagulls, in this case compared to previous games but 1/10, at best, the rewards you get one useless chopper compared to all the weapon spawns, tanks, choppers, armour, etc, of previous games. This was something Rockstar addressed in varying degrees in the DLC and subsequent games. The radio stations, one of my favourite features from GTA games, were also underwhelming. Niko isnt the most interesting protagonist and his story is a rather sour one. Still, it is a good game and well worth your time. Its just not the best the franchise has to offer and couldnt match previous standouts, like Vice City, and was surpassed in every way by the spectacular GTA V.
