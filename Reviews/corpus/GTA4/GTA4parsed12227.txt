Let me say that Rockstar is possibly the worst big game maker, aside from Ubisoft and EA. Instead of addressing all of the issues with this game, they just left everybody to fend for themselves. No updates, no customer support, not even any fixes for incredibly simple issues with the game. FIrst, you need to manually tell the game you dont have the lowest system specs throughoptions so that it doesnt lock your settings to the lowest if you have more than 2gb vram. Theres no included anti aliasing. The game looks like they put a grey filter over it just toeveryone off. SLI support is almost non existant in this game, although it is possible to force it through nvidiainspector. Finally, if you have any performance issues and have optimized the game the best you can, turn off shadows. I dont get why they dont even acknoledge that the shadow system ingame is completely screwed up, possibly exclusive to GTX 9 cards. WIth 2 970 in sli, I was getting as low as 30fps in some places, until I set the shadows off. Im getting better frame rates in Unigine Heaven with everything maxed out. Why is rockstar afriad to address all of these problems? They already spent 100,000,00 on the game alone, and they now only want to focus on GTA Online with their tech support geared to GTA 5. The storyline of the game is great, but the game itself is so badly optimized it needs its own gpu fan curve so that my cards dont boost to 90c.
