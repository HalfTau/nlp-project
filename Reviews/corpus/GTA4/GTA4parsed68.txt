Dont know why people say the game wont start for them or crashes on them. Does not do that for me at all, It plays like because its a terrible port. Not my pc. Besides that this is one of my favorite gtas. I love the story to the game. I love this version of Liberty City, Niko is a straight savage and all around badass. For some reason the game sits in between 70100 If Im outside, then it goes down to 40. My brothers pc I played it on his, It rus like a dream, he has a 980ti and an i7 I forgot the rest on the name and a 1440p moniter, so he runs the game at 144 frames.My specs aregtx970 4vrami5 4690k8ram.Its such a mystery to me why the game plays so bad. I think Rockstar should send out a big performance update.But, seriously one of the best gta games ever. 9.5/10 for performance issues. And I dont know why people make such a big deal out of the GFWL just make an account and itll work. I made one and it works fine.
