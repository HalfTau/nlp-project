For a start, this game doesnt even work without you manually going to download the latest games for windows live. After downloading that, I had to update GFWL. Then restart the game. Took me 10 minutes before I even got to play the game and guess what? Its the most unoptimised pile of wank console port ive played to date. This game is 7 years old so you can excuse the graphics but it still runs like crap even to this day. The cars are awful. The handling is so bad, you can only turn the wheel about 1 degree either side so you have to turn corners at about 2mph. The AI are terrible. Oh no were being chased. Quick drive away. The AI literally run straight past me even though I was parked up to hop into a car down the road and even though I was getting away at about 5mph crashing into everything they didnt ever seem to be behind me. The combat is clunky. You got your typical linear chase scene where if you get too far behind, the AI will kindly slow down for you to catch up. But you cant ever actually catch them until the game gets to a certain point. Honestly, really dissapointing in my opinion. Although, I did enjoy the cut scenes. I thought they were pretty funny. But hey, this is just my opinion. The games got a metacritic of 90/100 and steam reviews are mostly positive. So, maybe its a great game. But from my personal experience, not worth buying.
