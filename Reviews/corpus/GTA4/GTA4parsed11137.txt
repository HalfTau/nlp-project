Love this game. Great mods no problems. Anyone who complains does not have a gaming pc or a brain. Besides im sure that any crashes may be their fault. But back to positives the game can feel so great to play even with the upcoming release of GTA V PC. So for what its worth you should still buy GTA IV.10/10 Game1/10 Bowling Simulator
