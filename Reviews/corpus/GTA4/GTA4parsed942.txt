about 9 years ago i played for about 40 hours and then i got jammed in one mission that would not complete even though i was in the complete mission checkpoint.thought to give this a go on Win 10 game crashes on launch steam said i cannot review game since i played only one minute bought this game like 9 years ago so i think its not appropriate to ask for refund rockstar support page refreshes itself in endless loop so i cannot ask for support in fact, i barely could even scroll to gta 4 support page launched game multiple times to get it to crash so that i can see 5 minute counter so that i can write review dunno if i should recommend or not. would be easier to recommend if the game would work.
