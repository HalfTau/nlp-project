The game content itself was totally fine, but Y THE SETTING UP GOING TO BE SO TROUBLESOME? what the  is the Windows Live Marketplace? Why the  nothing tells me I need to have that to run the game when installing GTAIV? After I wasted half hour attempting to run the game but nothing happens, and finally found a nice dudes posted saying i have to install that, I did, from the offical site, still CANNOT loging by random errorcods showing up, with a click here to resole buttom below but has been bring to a site that already not exist after click on that.Y the  we need to burning gigantic amount of time for Googling for a solution that how to run a genuine game that just properly purchased and installed by following instructions come with it, but still refuse to run. And the version that downloaded from little crappy Chinese game cracking site runs without any problem by just double click the icon????? Cant we just make the things easier?
