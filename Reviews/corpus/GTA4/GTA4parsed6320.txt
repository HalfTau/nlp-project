For all of the negative reviews on here about how Windows 10 cant handle this. Not true at all. Windows 10 can handle this game perfectly and you just need to use google a bit and youll have it up and running in no time. This game is a classic compared to gta 5 and honestly after playing this again i forgot how good it was and some of the features that rockstar forgot to bring over to gta 5. Its worth buying when on sale of course and there are a ton of mods for this game that make it better. Like I mentioned in my gta 5 review when will rockstar learn that not all pc players want forced updates and online functions. Most want to mod and make the vinilla single player game better. Maybe Rockstar you should learn from other games to create the workshop function integration but that probably is to much to ask for.
