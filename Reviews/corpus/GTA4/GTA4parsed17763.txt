This game is beautiful, im gta fan, san andreas was my first game and still my favorite one, i still remember when i saw gta 4 for the first time, i was crazy about the graphics haha, if you ever got to play another gta game before, this one is kinda different, of course is the same type of gta game, stealing cars, killing people, going around a full city to explore whenever you want, but this one is more realistic, theres no army, and the cops are kinda silly, missions are all fun, but feel really similar, you go to a place, kill someone and thats almost it, some missions have other objectives but most of them are almost like that, unlike gta san andreas, in one mission you had to get in a plane, plant a bomb and then parachute, in other one you had to get to a pier, kill everyone in the rooftops with a sniper, then go inside there kill the remaining people with a weapon of your choice and then follow a traitor in a boat until you kill him, but this game has amazing graphics even for now, a really deep and amazing story that will cautivate you, niko is a more believable character and that makes it great for us, there not many ways to spend your money, you can only buy food and clothes, but at the end of the game you will have soo much money and nothing to do with it, the multiplayer experiance is even more fun you can get to play with your friends all around the city, and races and deathmatches are really fun, although this is a really good game, worth buying and definitely worth playing all day haha, some people may get angry because i was kinda saying bad things about the game comparing it with san andreas, but im trying to give an idea to new players who already play other games in the series of whats the game about, even if you have gta 5 this game is worth your time, because of the great history and incredible characters, the main story is about 30 hours normally, depending on how much you spend doing other stuff, secundary missions can get you up to 20 hours gameplay, thats about 50 hours completing the game to a 100 but just ing around the city and making chaos in a cool car is incredibly fun, and multiplayer is amazing, i recommend you watching gtamissions videos in youtube for giving yourself an idea of whats the multiplayer about, hope you enjoy this game as much as i have for a lot of time, and blessings, PD i have play 16.3 hours of this game in steam, but before i had it in another way hehe, probably i have played more than 70 hours of gameplay soo i can say i know this game pretty good, take care people and have a good time!
