Ran fine in Windows 10 on a GTX 970 with the 11/29/2016 patch.  The controls are a bit clunky but the Wiki usually has tips to get through.  Used an xbox controller except for a few sniper missions.  I eventually got the hang of targeting.  Crashed a couple times during a completionist run, not too bad considering how many hours of gameplay I got between crashes.The graphics are good enough but far from gorgeous.  If youve never played GTA, this is definitely the right one to start with!  I played San Andreas back in the day, but got stuck.  This is a definitely good refinement without going crazy in new features.  It would probably be hard to like if you played later GTA games.Biggest pet peeve was driving across toll bridges.  Second biggest pet peeve is just how much of a hassle it is to finish a mission, get armor via gun shop vest, and to a safe house to save without getting two stars cop chasing along the way.  At least you can actually shake the cops in this one without a paint shop San Andreas was cruel.Races and chases usually are NOT fullthrottle affairs... control of your vehicle is key.  And without spoiling too much, one of the two endings involves a series futile chases where you should not waste your time trying to get close enough to kill the vehicle you chase.Use cabs to get to destinations!  Worst fare is 60 in game money.Overall this game is a fun way to spend your time without caring about how every character is evil, worth 10.
