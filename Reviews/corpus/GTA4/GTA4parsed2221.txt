Still cant get this game to actually run VDS10 error, wont start at all. Installed new version of GWFL, reran DX installs, nothing. It is bad enough they have a pinned message in the forum for trying to troubleshoot this. I dont know how Valve can get away with selling something that apparently doesnt even run on a lot of systems or Rockstar for not being able to write a working installer. It has been gooing on for years check out the dates in the forum posts. The 3rd party DRM should have been a sign not to bother. I  wouldnt waste your money or time on it.Plus  Rockstar apparently doesnt like letting people play mods. Which explains all of the DRM I guess.
