Ive been waiting days for a steam key fix and there are no updates as to when I can actually play the game. This is after I went through the trouble of making three different accounts just so I can play multiplayer and use the game. Ill recommend the game when I can actually use it but is very non player friendly right now between the annoying amount of accounts I am froced to make just to use a game I payed for and the lack of updates on when the CD code will be able to activate.
