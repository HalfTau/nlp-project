If your into GTA its a great game, if you know how to mod games and manually set them up you can play the game, I have it on windows 8.1 and it works fine. I cant play online but i got the game to modd not to play online thats what GTA V is for. If you can get past GFWL, make it compatable for windows 8.1, and download and install the right microsoft visuall Cs its worth a buy if you have no idea what im talking about dont buy the game because u wont get it working.
