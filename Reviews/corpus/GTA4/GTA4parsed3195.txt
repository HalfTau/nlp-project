Must have spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours with this game back in the day on xbox 360, it is still a fun game and if you can manage to pick it up on sale or something I whould say it is worth the time and money invested. Too bad The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony expasion/DLC do not exist for the PC version or else this whould be the best thing on Steam.
