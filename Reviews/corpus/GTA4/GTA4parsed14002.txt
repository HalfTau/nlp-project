I originally beat this on console, probably spending 50 hours or so just enjoying the sandbox. I still think of this game as one of the top 10 games of all time, although I couldnt really identify with the characters, I was able to role play with some decent immersion.What really impressed me with this game, and continues to do so, is the gigantic vibrant world of AI. Im surprised that there are programmers brilliant enough to be able to make that all work... its just amazing. Rockstar deserves some elite global Nobel type prize for their contributions to gaming and advancing AI.
