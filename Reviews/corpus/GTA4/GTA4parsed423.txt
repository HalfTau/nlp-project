Coming from 5 years experience of GTA IV on console, GTA IV is my favourite GTA it incorporates great driving which is defined on the way the user enjoys driving, A lot of people look negatively on this I dont I think its 9/10 and involves way more skin then GTA Vs driving. The story is detailed and makes you fall in love with some of the characters. Im suprised this has such a mixed review on the community its has been voted top 10 games of all time on review websites. Anyway 100 recommend.
