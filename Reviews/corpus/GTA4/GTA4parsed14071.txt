WARNING While I recommend this game, I do NOT recommend it on PC. It is a good game, but GFWL just screws EVERYTHING up. If you are going to play it use an offline profile, this sometimes lets you save your game.Also, I cannot get this to run smoothly even on the lowest settings, it is just so taxing I cant even begin to describe it. But thats probably just meRight, this game is awesome if you look at the game itself and not that crap up there Its really fun to go around shooting things and stealing cars and everything else you want to doI recommend it... but not on PC.
