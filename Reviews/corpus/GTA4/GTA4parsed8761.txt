Grand Theft Auto IV has odd glitches in Windows 10. Games with Windows Live no longer works, so getting that in is a hassle. Also, with my computer, it ran fine in Windows 7, but on Windows 10 there are terrible lag spikes, textures may not show up at all, and the worst thing is a crash that will lock up my computer and I have to manually reboot. Get Grand Theft Auto IV on console, its a great game on the Xbox 360 and PS3, but I wouldnt recommend the PC version at all, especially on Windows 10.Specsi52320 3.0GHZ QuadCore8GB DDR31333 RAMGTX 750 Ti 2GB Overclocked 300MHZ from base and 200MHZ from memory1TB HDD500W PSU
