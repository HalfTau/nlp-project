Hey! Wanna buy a game that doesnt even work! Wanna spam rock stars stupid play button for it to simply do nothing. I mean you can get it to work if you spend about an hour or so of your time which then if you do get it running its a peice ofwhich eithera. Doesnt load.b.Doesnt savec. framesd.Lets just say you did all this and you can finally run the game and not needing windows 95 or a potato to run it.Congrats. You played a game that was made in 2008 that will bring you like 4 hours of gameplay.Before you spend 20 dollars invest in a ps3. Because unless you wanna take a metaphorical rockstarbetween your cheek I doubt you wanna die by trying to maybe get the game to even ing play.Buy the older ps2 gtas. Atleast they ing work without the chore.
