GTA IV returns to Liberty City, however this is not the same city that we saw in GTA III but instead based on the Big Apple New York City. The main protagonist this time around is Niko Bellic, fresh off the boat from Eastern Europe and under the assumption hell be living a life of luxury with his cousin Roman. The reality is Liberty City isnt all it was made out to be and Niko quickly finds himself mixing with the wrong crowd just trying to make a quick buck. Its a crime drama of epic proportions and one that will have you gripped from start to finish. My favourite game.
