Great GTA game. The mayhem you can cause with explosions and attack helecoptors is great fun. However, after playing Sleeping Doges, the character controls feel sluggish and all the cars handle like underpowered boats here. I find myself only going to GTA to blow things up, which gets old fast. I spent a lot more time in Sleeping Dogs due to its agine controls.
