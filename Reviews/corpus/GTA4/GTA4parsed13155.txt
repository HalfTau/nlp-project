I made a big mistake purchasing this one. I spent around three hours trying to get past the RockStar Social club and Games for Windows live logins. The game crashes without even a message saying what went wrong. Then after I finally got it to work I tried to play online only for Game for Windows live to force update itself. Now the game stops working again.Quite literally unplayable. I want my money back.
