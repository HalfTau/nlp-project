Let me start by saying that the graphics of this game are terrible on max settings unless you use the graphics enhancer mod. I found Niko to be a bland character, and Roman to be just plain annoying. This game doesnt have too many weapons and the map is small. This game also lacks watercrafts and I kept seeing the same palate of vehicles on the road. This game sadly lacked aircraft. Aircraft in the Grand Theft Auto series is a big thing for me.I know that Grand Theft Auto 5 is the sequel to this and is supposed to have more content but the games feel like different worlds. This game has a small map, not many vehicles, minimal aircraft, and bland character. Grand Theft Auto 5 is the exact opposite.This game has even worse graphics on PC when using max settings without mods because it was a poor port. The PC version of this game has too much yellow in its color palate. It feels like a permament sunset.
