I really liked GTA3 and Vice City. And then San Andreas and GTA4 came out. While they are more comprehensive games, theyre a bit too open. Ive found them to be more repetitive and tedious.This is more of a game to be enjoyed if you have hundreds of hours of time to waste and dont mind repetition.Its like Skyrim in terms of gameplay speed.
