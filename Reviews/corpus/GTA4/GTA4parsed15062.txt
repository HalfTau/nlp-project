This is a bad console port. I cant beat the last mission because no matter how fast I spam the bound key Niko wont climb into the chopper, and I have a feeling the frequency of the keypresses correlates with the framerate, and because my framerate is far from a paultry 30fps that you would get on an Xbox, this makes the climbing impossible. I have a feeling that GTA V will be another bad console port, and therefore I will not wast my money with such an incompetent company that cannot output a quality product. You have lost another customer, Rockstar.
