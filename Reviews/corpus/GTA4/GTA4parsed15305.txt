Story was a major bummer. I liked the older story lines better. Felt like you were moving to the top of the crime world. This one plays out more like a tragedy.Gameplay is pretty fun. I liked the new cover system and the combat was pretty simple.I tried to play with keyboard/mouse...bad move. I purchased a 360 controller and it was much more fun.Overall, if you like GTA, then youll like it. But, you might not LOVE it.
