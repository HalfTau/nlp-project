I would recommend this game for ps3 or xbox, but not on PC. Rockstar has ruined this franchise with the Social Club...which barely works half of the time. It completely prevents you from playing the game all together if it decides to not let you log in. GTA 5 has been a complete waste of ing money because of this. Rockstar Wont even bother to fix it. They got my money so why would they give a Will not be giving them anymore of my money for future games. This game company is ing dead to me.
