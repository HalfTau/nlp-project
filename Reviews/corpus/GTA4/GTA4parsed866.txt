Bought this in a sale expecting to refund because the game wouldnt work on Windows 10, but to my suprise I bought the game and it works perfectly even on Windows 10. I can even use Games for Windows Live. So to say Im pleasantly suprised. The game even runs at 100 FPS on Very High with GTX 970 and i5
