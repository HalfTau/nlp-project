I love this game, but if you are thinking about getting it, WARNING, windows live is crap. After hours of hard work, I got it to work by doing the following Downloading games for windows live, downloading an update for windows live that crashed my computer, redownloading the update for windows live, realise the game keeps crashing because of windows live, then uninstalling GTA and windows live, redownloading the both of them, and then downloading the update again. Finally, the game actually worked.
