For all of Its flaws like GFWL and being a bad console port, Its still a great game and up until GTA V was my favorite Grand Theft Auto game. I hope rockstar will ditch GFWL for steamworks soon, as the game is unplayable online and not able to save without a mod. But with GTA V coming to steam soon, Im sure there more focused on that so I wouldnt bet on it.
