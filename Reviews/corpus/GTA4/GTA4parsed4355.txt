This game is great. There are definitely pros as well as cons, but the pros outweigh the cons. Having played this game for almost 120 hours now, I felt it was time to write a proper review.ProsHilarious AIAll kinds of pastimesHookersKilling hookersEasier to evade police than GTA VOpen worldEntrable buildings with explorable interiorsGreat fightingPlenty of modsRealistic driving thanks to the euphoria engineFood as an easy way to regain healthRuns on lowend computersConsMultiplayer is garbage/deadNot the best graphicsRomanVery linear storylineWeirdly rendered cutscenes that cause lag on some graphics cardsThis game is definitely worth grabbing on a sale for about 6 dollars USD if youve got the money. If you have 30 dollars USD, then buy Grand Theft Auto V. Its a better game in more ways than one.
