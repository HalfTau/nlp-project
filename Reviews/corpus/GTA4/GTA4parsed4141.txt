I regret to say that while the game is/was great, its not playable anymore. To save your progress it wants you to register a Windows Live account. Unfortunately the registration website does not exist anymore, so obviously theres no way to register the site is just a 404, theres no redirection to any replacement service nor even a farewell message which is a shame. Unfortunately the game cannot comprehend the situation and it falls into an infinite loop as you cannot even just quit. I had to restart my Windows because I couldnt even start the Task Manager to shoot down GTA4 for some weird reason.I have owned GTA4 years ago when it came out and I enjoyed it very much. Its very unfortunate that the developers didnt expect that the registration website would ever be shut down. Let this be a lesson for everyone if you create a game, make sure its fully playable offline!
