GREAT GREAT GAME! i was never into GTA until Saints Row 4 got me into open world games. and wow gta4 is one of the best open world games not just because of its sophisticated design and structures of New York but the storyline... damn it was a good story. i honestly dont like how enemys literrally just sit behind the wall sometimes which makes it annoying to kill but not a hard game at all but make sure you take off that auto aim that feature is very unnecessary and stupid as hell. and i wish they had enemy indicator or atleast tell you which direction the shot is coming from. that is one point which i really didnt like but goddamn the STORY! lol SUCKS HOW YOU CANT COMPLETE THE LAST 2 MISSIONS DUE TO GLITCH!!! i didnt realize and i went through mission Out of Commission like 5 times all screwed over at heli jump... so i just went to youtube and watched last of it. very dissappointing how last 2 missions are glitched out but never the less great great experience. excitied for GTA 5. now im onto Episodes From Liberty City D GG
