Massive let down to say the least. ALL OF THE REVIEWS OF THE GAME BEING FAULTY AND CRASHING ARE, UNFORTINATLY, TRUE. Such a fantastic game so many good childhood memories were coming through waiting for this to download. But then it wouldnt start crashed instantly, managed to fix it got into game. Graphics were all wrong, couldnt be changed and had to change files to get it to work. Then stuttering/ lag after about 2 minutes of playing. Lowered all settings FAR beyond what I should have to, I should be able to beast this game, but that didnt help either. SO sad to see how ed this game is. Huge disapointment, will be refunding. Im no noob when it comes to fixing things like this, which is why I ignored the reviews but they are correct. I didnt want to spend any longer trying to fix this just in case I couldnt refund. Not worth your trouble. Apparently Rockstar didnt make enough money to port the game properly...
