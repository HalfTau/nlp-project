One of my favorite grand theft autos of all time, more realistic than gta v, but the map is not as good, and there is no fun cheats if your into that, and no customization besides cloths even then is little, i would recommend getting realistic graphic mods and some other cool mods for vehicles and cloths and all that great stuff that this is lacking. fun to play the story but after that vanilla gta iv is just boring.7/10 without mods9/10 with mods because map doesnt change and there is no plane mods i could find, if you fins any please let me know
