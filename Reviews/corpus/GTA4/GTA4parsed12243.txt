tried to play this game twice and I really tried to like it but I just gave up in the end, its simply unplayable on PC.Whoever ported this to PC hasnt touched a keyboard in his entire life or is a mentally handicapped person.If you were intending to customize the game with mods to get rid of its  control mechanics then thats not going to happen either, there is no script loader that works after the latest update, meaning you either have to downgrade it, which is an ordeal by itself or play it like your both hands are tied behind your back.Trying to sell this on PC in this state should be considered a crime.
