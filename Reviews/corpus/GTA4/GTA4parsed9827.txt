Very badly ported to pc. It has performance issues on most PCs, doesnt matter how good your hardware is. If you really want to play GTA 4 and it is a good game, I also own it on PS3, I suggest buying 1 of the console versions as this one is really crap.it does have Windows Live but that shouldnt be much of a problem anymore since the service stopped? I at least didnt have problems.
