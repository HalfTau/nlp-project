This game has many ups and downs to be honest. Obiously compared to GTA Vice City, GTA San Andres, and GTA China Town Wars, the graphics are supremely better, again this game came out 4 years ago so nowadays graphics are even better cant wait for GTA 5 on PC. Now a major compliant from a lot of people, myself included would be the driving concept. It is very realistic, from car alarms, to hot wiring, getting thrown out a windsheild, and getting thrown like a football off a motercyle, the reason why that is bad, is because during missions that can make or break you. For example on a mission were you have to ridea moter cycle, lets say youre full speed and you bump into a car, you will be ejected like a bomb away from your vehicle. By the time you walk back to the bike, get on and drive off, normally it will say, Such and Such got away. So that is a plus and a minus. The story is very well written, A leads to B and B to C and so on. Another bad thing more annoying than anything is that you have to ditch the cops after every single mission, it gets old after a while. And if youre in the mood to have some fun or just be lazy the cheats were kinda of stale, so you need to use mods, to get the full potential out of the game. Dont let my review keep you from buying the game, its well worthit. ALSO BE MOTHER FCIG WARNED, this game requires high PC specs, when I first bought this game I couldnt play it on a 700 dollar computer, I had to buy a 1000 dollar computer to be able to play it.
