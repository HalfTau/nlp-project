This review is more for Steams poor policy rather than for GTAIV. Of course Rockstar Social Club is also to blame. I tried all the fixes and nothing worked. GTAIV will not play on windows 10 and steam will not refund because too much time has elapsed since I purchased it. I purchased it along with several other games and was just now getting time to play it.
