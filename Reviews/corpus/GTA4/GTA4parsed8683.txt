So I bought this game thinking it would be amzing at the time. Turns out gta 5 can run SMOOTHER and FASTER on the same desktop. I stopped playing this game due to my desktop couldnt handle it. I asked for a refund mostly because I couldnt play it and didnt quite enjoy it. I was refused and offer so I just have it collecting dust on my library.
