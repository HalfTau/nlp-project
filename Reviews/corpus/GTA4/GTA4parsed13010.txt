Grand Theft Auto IV is an open world sandbox game by Rockstar Games. I just play it for the open world buy Ive heard from friends that the story is amazing. Mods give this game a great replay value.Some people have had issues launching the game. To fix this download . This disables the need for the Games for Windows Live client.Now for the final verdict! Wait for the sales or try to find it cheap. Its an amazing game but its not worth its current price. I got the complete pack for about 10.Some great mods to try are LCPDFR and Simple Native Trainer.10/10 would get run over by a taxi again.
