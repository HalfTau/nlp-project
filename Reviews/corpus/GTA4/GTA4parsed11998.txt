You might not have the same issues I did but I was not able to save or load a game unless being logged into a microsoft live account. This is required! The only problem is that when trying to login to my account it wouldnt recognize it. Recovered password, made sure account info was correct, wasted too much time on this. Cant save the game or load a game..... lame. But I shouldnt expect anything different from MS by now.Another thing...  they update your machine with some windows live patch and during the update it crashed my machine. What a waste of money.
