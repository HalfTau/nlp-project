This game sucks, modding is dead which makes this game redundant all the companies want is our god dam money and using useless microtransaticons, shutting harmless people. This is a game which should be refunded on all platforms all players need to stand down from online and need to not buy any games by T2 etc! OPEN IV needs to come back! YOU GUYS WANT OUR MONEY AND SOME OF US DO NOT EARN ENOUGH TO FEED AND GIVE MONEY TO YOU WHO DO NOT CARE ABOUT US AS A COMUNITY! GOOD THING YOU ALL HAVE BAD REVIEWS, MONEY HOGGERS YOU HORRIBLE PEOPLE!
