Game 10/10its GTAIV, everyones played it, everyone likes it I think.This particular version Bowling with Roman/10 Bought it on sale for 5 to play through the story again which Ive done countless times on Xbox and play around with some mods. By sticking to single player, I dont have to screw around with Gaymes for Winderps live. Its just a shame Rockstar cant be arsed to remove it from the game...Dirt 3 finally did, and I rewarded them with 15 of my hardearned money.
