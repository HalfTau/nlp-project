Grand Theft Auto IV was good for the time it came out, but attempted to take itself too seriously. The phyics were great, and the multiplayer was even better. It was fun having a free roam with custom settings, hell even modders made the game fun. Past its time, however, if you want to experience fun, cop free, anything goes, free roam or free aim lobbies I would suggest trying this out. Its probably not the same as far as server stability goes with gamespy shutting its servers down and all. But regardless, if youre a GTA fan this isnt something you should pass on experiencing before its too late.
