A way to get this to work with windows 10. First, go to contol panel and programs and features and uninstall all versions of c 2005 redistributable. Then go into the game files, and inside the install folder youll see the vcredist install it. Then, on the control panel, go to turn windows features on/off. Turn off .NET 4.7/4.6 and 3.5. Then download 3.5 from Microsoft website, install, and then turn on 4.6/4.7 again. If these do not work, uninstall GFWL and reinstall from Microsoft. If you have a Skylake CPU/ z170 mobo, you may need a BiOS update.
