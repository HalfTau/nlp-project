RockStar really dropped the ball on this one. I boughtt this game in December of 2014 and have spent probably over 5 hours with installation and trying to get the game to run which is next to impossible. I have never been able to even spend a single seccond playing this game, Probably the worst game on Steam right now. 1/10 Complete waste of time and Money. DO NOT BUY UNTIL PATCH
