Great game, loving the storymode so far. Just a struggle to get online for windows live. I have been given the product/cd key to enter for the game. Saved it an all but since I have played it, they have not asked me to enter the product key to verifiy I purchased it. No notification at the start of the game or anything. Just the social club and the game launches fine but no message. It just keeps showing me my key whilst it loads up. Until then I cant play online which is . Anyone know what I should do?
