Great story with a badass grim feeling to it, one of the best physics system in any game to this day, the game was revolutionary back in the day and i still love it, tons of mods who just make it 10x better, arguably has the best main character in all of the Grand Theft Auto series in Niko.Soundtrack is definetly the best of all the GTA games to this day, only have good things to say about this game, although the performance can be a bit  at times depending on your specsStill an amazing game though.
