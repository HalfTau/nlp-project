I feel like GTA IV did climbing up the ladder from some sap working for a couple of big guys, to being the head honcho working for the police and also the Mafia. It just feels. . .right. Just climbing up the ladder/food chain just feels so GOOD in this game. No other game has really matched it SRTT maybe, but, eh.Everything feels really good in this game. Shooting with your handgun feels nice, driving people over actually makes the person ran over feel like they have weight.Feels good/10
