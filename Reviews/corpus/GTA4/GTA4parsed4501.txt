2 days ago I would have given this game a negative review because of the Games for Windows Live problem, which WAS a stupid obstacle for those who wanted to play multiplayer GTA IV.But the developers have fixed that problem FINALLY and its fully playable now, so I can give this game what it deserves a big YES.Though nobody plays online anymore because of the problem that doesnt exist anymore... Hopefully some people will come and we will revive this game once again.
