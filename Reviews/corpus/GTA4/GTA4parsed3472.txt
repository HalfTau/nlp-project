Great gameTerrible portSeriously this game is so amazing and in my opinion way better than the joke of gta 5. But the port... this terrible port rockstar made without effort just ruins the whole game, like, even a PC with a GTX 1080 graphics card and a i7 processor can barely run this game because of the terrible portIn conclusion, I do recommend this game on consoles, but not the steam version
