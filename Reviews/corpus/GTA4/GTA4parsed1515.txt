Recommended if on Sale, otherwise it depends.Game is infamously unoptimized, however its from 2008 and Rockstar did their best to fix it. Engine limitations prevent the game from runnin any better and it drops below 60 even on my GTX 1080ti.You also need to download Games For Windows Live in order to play this, which takes 2 minutes. GFWL is the preceding program to the current Xbox app for windows 10.This game is from 2008 when PC ports were generally bad. So if thats a problem dont buy it. Some bad PC ports from the time that I know of DeadSpace, Fallout 3 crashes without ini fix.
