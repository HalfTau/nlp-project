Downloaded last night because today was gonna be my day off and I figured Id nerd out.Now its 311PM and game will not launch after having tried every fix I could find for the last 6 hours. DO NOT BUY this game, its not working in its current state.From what I understand, it either has to do with Microsoft live marketplace, Securom, Rockstar social club, or visual c 2005 redistributables. Ive altered/changed/downloaded/uninstalled/reinstalled/restarted/reupdated these elements all day long and set permissions this way, that way, and the other way to no avail.This game WILL NOT LAUNCH, period. What a shame that Steam is still offering this for sale. I find that to be reprehensible enough for me to leave steam altogether.
