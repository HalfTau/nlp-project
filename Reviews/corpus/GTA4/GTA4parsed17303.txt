GTA 4 is a broken down disfunctional load of the game barley ing starts without having to run to some  roadblock before you have to troubleshoot for 1,000,000 hours untill finally you find a fix to your problem, and everyones problems are always different. So there is no ing gurantee that you EVER EVER EVER be able to ing play GTA4 on PC, funny enough the entire game itself cant even run on windows 8 wich is complete t.Constant  error messages, that NEVER go away, and trying to fix them is like trying to take astanding up. IT WONT ING WORK. Only on rare occassions I have managed to get the game to get past the rockstart social club screen, and the rest of the times I try, the game dosnt even ing launch, I paid 5.00 for thisload of ?! Aswell you cant even launch the game from the ing steam menu, thats great huh? Why not put a game that barley even starts let alone you have to GOOGLE search how to ing launch the damn game. Switching compatibility modes are ing stupid. Trying to reinstall directx nope, C nope, run as admin nope, update GPU drivers nope. Overall this game can go suck abrFrom a ing mad consumerFix your ing game steam
