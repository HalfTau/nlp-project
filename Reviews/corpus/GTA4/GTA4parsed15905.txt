Great game. Maybe the best part of the series, only the annoying pseudosocialinteractions Hey Cousin! Lets go bowling!, the disappointing climax and the general fact, that this is a bad pc port, are kind of getting in the way of a top score GTA San Andreas had a better ending and better miniquests and games. Otherwise, this is fanatastic. Great physics, nice graphics with or without mods. Looking at the skyline at night, while listening to Terry Riley, Steve Roach and Jean Michel Jarre on The Journey while driving away from the cops is creating an unbeatable atmosphere almost as good as listening to A Horse with No Name while driving through the desert in San Andreas D. Great shooutoutsequences indoor missions and AI is a little weak though, great pursuits, best crashes and pursuits in GTAhistory and  the cherry on top Multiplayer! Ram your friends to death in a heavyweighttruck. Dont  with Niko Bellic!.
