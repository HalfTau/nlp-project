Dont let my hours fool you, I played this game for 300 hours back in 2008 prior to the Steam purchase.This is still one of THE best crime stories Ive EVER had the pleasure of experiencing. That includes medium such as movies and TV shows this one takes the cake.Many people think the games story revolves around Niko, a Serbian immigrant running from a wartorn country. Or Johnny, an allAmerican biker. Or even Luis, a Dominican womanizer. The game doesnt revolve around any of these people.The game revolves around diamonds.You heard it diamonds. Once you uncover the full picture playing all 3 GTA IV games, you will realize the root of all the problems for the three characters is essentially the diamonds. In the story, the diamonds are constantly changing hands and the people hiring you all secretly want to find it. Your character is oblivious to this just like you would be in real life.You might think this is a spoiler but it really isnt. It was meant to help you understand how expansive the story will be. If I could erase my memory and replay these three games, I would do it again in a heartbeat.Gameplaywise, this game is comparatively boring to its successor GTA V. I would say the missions in this one are more realistic in that your character tries to avoid conflict and only engages in gunfights when necessary. Even then, gunfights are realistic there are very few explosions and more exchanges of gunfire.Live the life of an underdog and work your way up the ranks. The storys twists and turns will leave you wanting more. You will not see the events in this game coming unless youve played it before.I give this game a 15/10  a masterpiece.
