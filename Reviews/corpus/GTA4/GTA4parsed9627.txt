I would not recommend this game if your buying this past 2008. This game is just horrible and the graphics are not that good. Compared to Grand Theft Auto V, it is way better with graphics and psyhcs. People who are into the GTA series have already bought GTA 5. Ever since GTA V came out, people stoped playing GTA 4. I think this is a horrible game.I would ONLY RECOMMEND this game for people who mod. If youre modding, then yes, you should get it. Its very easy to mod.
