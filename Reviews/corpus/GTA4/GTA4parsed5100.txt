Its really difficult to get it working, usually it requieres like 35 attempts until it stops crashing on startup. I would recommend getting  haha, it censors the mods name, how funny, just google for an asi loader, you will find it to get rid of the stupid windows live crap.Once you get it somewhat limping and could call it running somewhat stable it looks pretty decent, but then it crashes.If you want to mod it and can stand having to tinker with it constantly to get it running get it on PC. If you dont care about mods and just want to play it for the story or whatever, get it on ps3 or xbox360.
