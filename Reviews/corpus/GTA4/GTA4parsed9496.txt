wont play.I cant get past the social club log in pagetried to read and follow the forum directions but im no programer so that was a dead end and i dont feel like i should have to mod or fix a game i paid for to get it to work.Steam needs to do like they did with DEAD RISING 2 and just fix the game themselves.
