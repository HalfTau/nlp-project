In all honesty, I found this game a bit frustrating to play.  There were points where the character couldnt figure out how to get out of cover and as a result was completely incapable of fighting back.  Other times, it was just a dull storyline that dragged on for no reason other than to fill time.  I especially found it frustrating how you start a mission, drive to the location where the mission starts, and then if you happen to die you have to drive there again.  Honestly, driving from point A to point B is not a critical task  if it takes 10 minutes to do, why do I have to repeat it each time?Got this on sale, so Im not too upset about the price.  Theres certainly some entertainment to be had in freeroam.  The story felt too cookiecutter style for me.  Wouldnt recommend this unless you get it for a good price.
