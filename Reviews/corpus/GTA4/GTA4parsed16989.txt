If you want constant crashes due to GFWL DRM and major conflicts then by all means waste you money on this game. This game needs to be removed from steam. It is an absolutely dreadful excuse for a xb360 port. Whats worse is that if you want to have any chance of playing this game you will have to download countless tools to keep it from Fing up, such as contig or even create a notepad file that does nothing at all.  Remember that any game with Games for Windows Live from Steam, is going to be problematic. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!
