Complete garbage! I have spent one hour now just trying to get the game to turn on. Its a total rip off buying this as it doesnt even work. Its possible to get it working after giving an arm, a leg, your first born child, and selling your wife off to slavery. I have grown a beard as long as the Empire State building trying to get this to work. There was a time that this didnt work so bad but they must of did an update and ruined it.GTA IV itself is a good game but if you want a good experience buy it for console as the PC version works like that asthmatic kid in the wheelchair in Malcolm In The Middle.
