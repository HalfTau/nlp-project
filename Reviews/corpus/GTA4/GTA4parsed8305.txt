Its hard to see that people are leaving negative reviews on this game when their reason is because they cant open the game or save it, when all they had to do was look it up on YouTube or look at the fing guides.It took me 4 minutes to fix the Game is incompatible with this version of Windows problem and 3 minutes to fix the Failed To Autosave problem. I spent more time on trying to figure out on how to mod this game then fixing the problems themself.If you cant fix 2 little issues with the game then youre dumber then Kim Kardashian when it comes to choosing baby names...like seriously North West? What a stupid...I cant even...fing stupid a name.I only bought this game for the LCPDFR Mod...and some other mods...okay maybe I just wanted to mod the living hell out of this game BUT it works perfectly fine for me.Game is doing what I want it to do and thats all that matters to me.
