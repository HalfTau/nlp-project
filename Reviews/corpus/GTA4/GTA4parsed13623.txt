Grand Theft Auto IV is just one of the best PC open world. It has people with diffrent skins in every part of the city, great storyline, and amazing mods that just make the game worth playing. But they are some problems with Windows Live which you can easily get past and mod it out, but other than that complaint I would reccomend this game just for the modding itself. You can be a cop, fight off zombies, use voice command, and so many more mods that make this game itself worth playing.
