This game was good for its time, however the only reason one would get this version is because of mods, and thats the only reasonPROS Mods Controller Support Big Game with a long story Basically GTA 3 but more advancedCONS Frame rate issues Graphic setting are screwed up Terrible PC Port Chance of a invisible overworld which can be fixed Uses GFWL instead of Steamworks Has trouble running on Windows 8 and 10Bottom line, unless you want mods, go buy the PS3 or XBOX 360 version.
