Grand Theft Auto IV ReviewApart from some Slight Issues with the annoying cousin and little bugs, this game is a good, funny, awesome storyline game that has great land, sea and air physics and alsothe Map is great because its split into 3 parts. This game is really addictive and ive enjoyed the Online mods. would highly recommend if willing to mod for better graphics.8/10, 69 Hours
