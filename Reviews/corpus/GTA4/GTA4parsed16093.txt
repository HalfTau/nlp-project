Honestly, whats there not to like?First of all, the characters in this game surpass even the characters in GTA V. I mean sure Trevor is fun and all, but that game gets really boring after a while compared to San Andreas and this game.Second of all, its not super demanding for specs.Only thing that sucks is the Windows Live crap.
