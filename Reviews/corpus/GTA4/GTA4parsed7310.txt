to me this game really defines a true Grand Theft Auto experience. from a small time crook slowly climbing up to the top into a successful criminal and terminate anyone who gets in your way, and there was a lot of conflict and surprising events throughout the whole story.besides the story of the game, this is the first GTA game on the HD universe so this is a rather special one because of its revolutionary leap from GTASA to this, like GTA III first appear on the 3D universe. The Graphics are not bad compare to any other games but what we get instead is the brilliant gameplay that GTAIV delivers also the character Niko Bellic is a very unusual compare to any other GTA protagonist. Through out the whole game i have a feel for Niko, little by little pieces of the puzzle started to come together and revealed a lot to tell about the characters background.and nowadays GTAIV can even look better than GTA V with the ENB mod community providing different presets according to your liking/taste and graphic card capabilities and tons of vehicle mods and scripts to complete your GTA experience whether to make it more realistic or more fun to play. overall its a brilliant game sadly Niko Bellic wouldnt be appearing in any other Grand Theft Auto series until Rockstar have found a new replacement for the voice acting of Niko BellicNiko Bellic is faaar way my favourite character after Carl Johnson appears on GTASA, but CJ will always have a special place in my heart, no homo!
