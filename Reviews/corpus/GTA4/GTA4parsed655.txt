Game still stuns me now as it did back in 2008, GREAT STORY, one of the BEST in the entire series with the dark and gloomy feel of Liberty City surrounding you wherever you go. But be careful as this game is horribly unoptimized on PC, God damn you Rockstar. Make sure you got some NASA tech to run this game but once you manage to fix all the bugs and actually be able to play the game, its simply amazing with a huge library of mods including my favourite, LCPDFR. Best buy honestly.
