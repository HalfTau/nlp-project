Compatibility problems  on a Windows 7 system which can run Fallout New Vegas, Elders Scrolls Oblivion, Batman Arkham city. but could not run this game. This was the one and ONLY time I received a refund from Steam. I think your max refund is one time. My experience is tha anything that requires Windows Live account is trouble you dont need.
