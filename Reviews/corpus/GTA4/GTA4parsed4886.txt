People who complain about the DRM probably havent even actually looked up the one EXTREMELY EASY fix for the game. . On a better note, the game itself is amazing, especially with mods and stuff, provided you have ten minutes to set things up by a simple google search, this is the game for everyone with an IQ above 95.
