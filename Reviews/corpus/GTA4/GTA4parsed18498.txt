GTA IVs single player campaign has a strong story with memorable characters and sharp satire on the American Dream.  But its missions are repetitive and it drags more than it should.  The overworld of Liberty City is visaully impressive as well as immersive, but theres not a whole lot to do in it when youre by yourself.Thankfully the online multiplayer portion of this game is robust and the true fun of this game is when youre online with 15 other people in structured contests or just causing mayhem in a way thats true to the series strengths.  It makes the game worthwhile for sure, as theres very little in the action game genre that can compete with all that you can do in Liberty City with some friends.8.5/10
