This is a great game, good story, detailed map for 2008, i have lots of fun playing it, and the dlcs where great. The only major problems i see is that you are forced to use windows live games, which is annoying to set up.I have heard of people having proplems with windows live games, but i think its a windows 8/10 problem. Also the dmr, if you arent online, you cant save, very frustrating.
