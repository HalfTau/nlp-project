Runs like rawnowadays.This was never the best port but now its a flat out chore to play. I dont know if its the windows 10 upgrade, games for Windows live being discontinued or a combination, but the amount of hoops you have to go through to get this game running decently is pretty maddening.First of all, it wouldnt launch until I went into the file and set the compatibility to windows 7.Then I couldnt log into gfwl so I skipped that step, and it wouldnt let me save. Thats right, you have to log in to an outdated drm to SAVE the game.So I had to figure out my login and download an update which was a chore since most of the links are dead now.Then after you go through all that you are treated to a game with a nice story, but a myriad of bugs and a framerate that rapidly players hopscotch between 20 and 60 fps and game play that is better in some choice areas, but is overall rendered slow and outdated by its predecessor.Save yourself time and stress and get it on sale for a console if you have one. Its hard to recommend this port right now.
