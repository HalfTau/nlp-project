Sorry to say bad things about a game I have played on XBox for years, but this is what I have experienced on my Next Gen PC.Pros Billions of mods to play with. You think it will be awesome. Have it on Xbox 360. Refund is still possible.Cons You have a Windows 8.1/10? Wasted your money. Game itself is dead and not updated anymore. Ram is ok but it still uses old drivers  new Nvidia stuff isnt compatible anymore. Compatibility options dont work either. All command lines are outdated, so you shouldnt even bother. Old GFW Live is dead too, new version isnt for this game. No well known fix actually works anymore. Spent a whole day trying all possible solutions. No good.This kind of ghost products shouldnt be on Steam anymore. Its sad, because Rockstar is working on GTA V only and have forgotten of this piece of art completely Im surprised that GTA SA still works... You should still buy it for Xbox since its a really good game. Spread the world, people.
