GTA IV is the biggest jump in graphic changes Rockstar has ever made in between GTAs and the story line is a plus too. Alot of action filled experiences with a path chooser to sort of create your own endings so that after you beat it once, youll want to play it again so you can live the other path for a different ending! SO1. Great Story line2. Player friendly3. Really interesting aspects that most games dont have4. Has a really fun online experience so you can hang out with friends on5. Just altogether fun!Totally recommended! Wont waste your time at all!
