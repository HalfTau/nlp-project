Its a really fun game.I got to hit someone with a car. After he got up, I kept on shooting him in the leg, everytime that he stood I would shoot him again. When he could no longer stand, I started shooting at his arms, making sure that he wouldnt die. A paramedic came and save him by giving him first aid, then I started torturing him all over again. Like I said, FUN.Okay jokes aside, its a good game. The plot is wonderful, there is attention to detail, the physics are possibly the best that I ever encountered on a game, and in overall, you cant go wrong with playing. Time and money well wasted.
