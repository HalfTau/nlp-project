Avoid this game at all cost.Dont buy this even on sale. This game does not work on Windows 10 despite all the efforts.And you know what? Downloading this crap and fixing it is a waste of time. I can see now why the rating of this game on Steam is very low.Social club is broken. Multiplayer is dead. Also, getting this game to work is not worth it.EDIT If you managed to get it working, well, play it! I heard that the storyline is pretty good.If youre using windows other than Windows 10, then you can try your luck by buying this game and trying it out
