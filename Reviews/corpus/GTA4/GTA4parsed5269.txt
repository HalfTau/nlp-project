RIP OPENIV, Screw T2.Loved the story of this and TBOGT, now Ill have to play TLAD.I played it on W10 and worked perfectly, no random crash or any problem like that, I managed even to play online without any problem. Without applying any path, as far as I can remember. Just play it on version 1.0.7.0. True is that Windows Live sucks, I hate it, and I hope Rockstar will change it or smth because right now it sucks, hope they do something like what happened to Dark Souls PTDE, transfering the achievments and all to Steam.
