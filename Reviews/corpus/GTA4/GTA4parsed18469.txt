Horrific walking controls as per usual in a Rockstar game, however they have gone and destroyed the driving controls as well. The cars control like they are on ice with oil covered tires. On top of that, the game takes up an appauling amount of hard drive space, and the visuals seem lazy, though Ive found that common in Rockstar games as well. I would critique the story however I cant stand the controls enough to get that far.
