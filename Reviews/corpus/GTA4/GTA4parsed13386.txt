To start with, You have a 1/100 chance of starting the game and it working.Then you have GFWL.If you can get it to launch, its a kinda meh game at best, some people are so generic it hurts. Multiplayer is cool if you can get a couple friends on LAN to play. Overall, avoid, buy Saints Row 3 or 4 if you want a sandbox crime shooter, that was ported to PC the right way, or save your money and buy something else. I hope they dont  up the port of GTA V.
