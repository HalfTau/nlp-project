Good Game but terrible PC Port!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !The game itself is amazing its just a terrible PC port. Dont expect to have a steady fps even if you have an highend PC also I can no longer play the game and need to purchase it again if I want to play it even after playing a dozen or so hours. Very disapointing Ive tried resolving the solution and have got no where follow my advice if you want to buy GTA on PC go for GTA 5 that is an excellent port and defintely the best version of that game. But as for GTA IV dont waste your money on this game for PC even if you just want mods as they are plenty of them on GTA 5 instead buy it on console.
