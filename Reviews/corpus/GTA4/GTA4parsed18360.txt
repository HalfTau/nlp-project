Grand Theft Auto IV is a very well polished game. When a game gets a 90 on metacritic, It basically means that you need to have this on your library if you are a real gamer.This game is a lot of fun. You can basically just play around and roam around the city and do your own thing or go and follow the story line which is decent.All the things you liked on the previous version was retained on this game with better graphics since the older version is a few years old already. You will still enjoy driving around the city, killing people, or running away from the police. You can go on dates, stroll around and have other miscellaneous games that you can spend and waste your time on. This is the epitome of fun that you create on your own.The bad parts that I can think of would be the average story line and the occasional graphics bug or physics bug that happens at several points of the game.Buy the game and have fun!
