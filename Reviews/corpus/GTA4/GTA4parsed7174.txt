I had to make a deal with a demon to get this game working. Because of this I have strange nightmares every night, and hear a whispering coming from the woods. My bed is occasionally covered with a bloody pentagram, which is annoying since I have to clean the sheets. The game itself is pretty fun. 10/10, Totally worth it.
