Its and amazing game, but Social Club ruins EVERYTHINGI have played this game on xbox years ago, and i thought it would be nice to get it on pc too also since there was a discount. I got everythying set up, but then this Social Club Login appeared, i thought nothing of it and just created an account. Now when everything is finished and i write my login it just saysSocial Club failed. Please try againAnd guess what happens when you try it again?The same thing happens!I literally wasted my money on this and the other GTA games since i bought the collection so i DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GARBAGE SYSTEM.And if you want to lay Offline option on the launcher IT STILL DOESNT WORK BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE LOGGED IN, BUT IF YOU TRY TO LOGIN IT WONT WORK!Dont even bother buying this trash, unless you want to get upset or waste your hardearned money.You have to put in so much work and effort just to run this game which i gave up onSo if any of you guys have a clue to remove this tumor, then please tell me, because its growinhg into cancer.ROCKSTARSFIX. THIS.
