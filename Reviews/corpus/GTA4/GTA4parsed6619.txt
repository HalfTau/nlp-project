Hello I have edited my review I still would have to point out that the game may require tampering with, sometimes simple and sometimes complicated depending on your luck and knowledge, but after awhile I have managed to come back n figure it out. If you get past the obstacle of fixing up the game, I have to say it is quite enjoyable. To be honest I wasnt expecting anything all too spectacular. I bought it on sale for like two dollars and thought Id get a couple of hours out of it, but so far I have been liking it a lot. I am happy I managed to get it to work. So, if you are confident that you can manage to make the game work properly, Id have to say it is really nice to play. The combat is a bit simple but not too much in a bad way, and so far the story seems interesting enough especially with the characters, Id say. Mostly all of the missions have been entertaining both with the cutscenes as well as the gameplay, too. Overall I havent had anything to really complain about once I have managed to get the game to work, so if you are interested in it and have not played this game before Id have to say it would be worth the try, especially if it is on sale. Thank you for your time, and have a nice evening.
