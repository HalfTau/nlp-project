I have not been able to even play this game.  I have windows 7 64 bit  after I log in to social club it does not even boot the game.  The process in task manager literally disapeers.   I have looked this issue up and it seems to be prevailant  there is no clear working solution.  I even contacted Rockstar support and their advice did not help.I wish I could get this to work.  REALLY disappointed in the lack of good support here!
