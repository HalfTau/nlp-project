If i could, i would give this game a mixed review because the game itself is great, but the PC version isnt. Ill write about the game first. GTA 4 for me is a fantastic game, especially considering that it was originally released in 2008! The game takes place in Liberty City, a parody of New York and Jersey City. And the map is big. Not as big as San Andreas, but more dense and filled with content. The story and voice acting is very good, and you can even make some important choices. The graphics are good, although the game is very grayish. Theres an extensive soundtrack, and i liked it overall. The gameplay is also decent. Theres a cover mechanic, autoaim makes things a lot easier, and driving is a bit slippery but i quickly got used to it. What i hated was firing while driving, but the game only sometimes asks you to do it. But perphaps the most amazing aspect for me is its attention to detail in a lot of small things. Theres plenty of things to do for 100, but unfortunately most of them feel repetitive. The story missions lack variety hanging with friends is boring the side missions lack innovation the worst being to steal 40 cars and shooting 200 pigeons. But theres plenty to do if youre bored. The PC version is bad however. Its optimization sucks, and it uses an unsupported form of DRM for multiplayer and achievements, which i havent tried but people still play and like. A recent patch fixed many issues with modern hardware and software, but it still uses GFWL and it broke the mod support, which is one of the main points of playing it on PC. For the story mode, you can use an offline profile, but its still a bit annoying. If youre aware of that, youll have a good experience with GTA 4, even with its PC problems.
