Again, I bought this game on sale. It took weeks for it to download for me. And now the frickin liaucher wont work for me. I even signed up in scoial club. I click play, it closes the launcher and nothing happens. I waited 1 hour for a single thing to happen. Even if I play offline, it does the same thing. I WANT A REFUND!
