Oh, how I love this game. Such a wonderful game. Even if Im taking into account all the possible features it missed out on. I understand there are priorities in creating a new game engine, and adding features into that engine. I even say so considering the disastrous port to PC, which took 3 years to sort out.Rockstar like developing games on console, I can tell. I can understand why, too. But PC is obviously where its at, and I think theyre finally starting to realize it. as of 11.11.14 were a week from GTA V launching on current gen consoles, and two months from launch on PC.GTA IV recieved the heaviest criticism of any Grand Theft Auto, and I never thought it deserved that. Everything about it with the exception of flight was a leap forward. Im amazed it raised standards as much as it did, while staying so well rounded. No part of the game outweighs another. And Im even more impressed that Rockstar could make not one but three characters that would otherwise be alien to most people, but make them seem so relateable and familiar.Grand Theft Auto burns through societal narratives like a laser and calls social justice warriors on their bluff. Art imitating life, thats what pisses so many people off and thats why I love it.
