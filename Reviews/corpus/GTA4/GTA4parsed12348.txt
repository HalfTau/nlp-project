If tirelessly working on the numerous fixes youll need to play this game isnt a problem for you, then get it. GFWL, and an awful port job left this game virtually unplayable for most. The way I see it, I paid for the opportunity to try and figure out how to get this terrible port working on my Windows 8.1 Asus. I uninstalled it about 6 months ago after finally getting it working, and discovered that Steam was unable to sync any of my save data due to GFWL. My recommendation Stay away from Games for Windows Live. Period.Gamma
