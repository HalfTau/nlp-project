Buy game. Install game. Start game. Wonder why game isnt working. Try again. Try everything you can think of. Google for solutions. Try every solution. Install various other things that dont work. Give up a weekend to trying to get the damn thing to work. Give up.Is it really too much to ask that Steam shouldnt be selling things that dont work, or at the very least, should say when buying WARNING IF YOU HAVE A MODERN COMPUTER, THIS WILL NOT WORK. At least I didnt pay much for it.But frankly, however much you pay, this isnt good enough. In what other industry would this be deemed acceptable, to sell things without a care about whether or not they work, to sell software with elements that can no longer function?If you want to play GTA4, get a console of suitable vintage and do it that way. Dont get this through Steam, no matter how cheap this is.And in future, any time I buy a game more than a year or two old, Im going to make sure its known to work before I pay, given that Steam refuse to do any checks themselves.
