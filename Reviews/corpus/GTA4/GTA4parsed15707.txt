WARNING! WARNING! THIS GAME HAS GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE CHAOS!!! Game is enjoyable but be prepared for a very stressful experience getting the F thing working properly. Please vote up so people know. Got the game for 6, wouldve avoided it if I had known. Not to mention my 7970 GPU can only run the game at 800600 i am told, low settings. Maybe this is why rockstar doesnt release games on PC. They are useless.
