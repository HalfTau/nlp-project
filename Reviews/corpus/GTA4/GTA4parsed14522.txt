I ignored the MANY negative reviews telling me not to buy this game on account of GFWL preventing GTA IV from playing. I thought that with GFWL discontinued and with me buying this game directly from Steam, I would have no trouble getting this game to work.Absolutely nothing works. I have tried working through GFWL. I tried uninstalling GFWL and going though this  troubleshooter. I verified Cache Integrity and redownloading the game.Nothing works. I want a refund. Without a refund, I will probably never buy any game with even the slightest negative review about game doesnt work ever again. 2 hours later and Ive learned my lesson
