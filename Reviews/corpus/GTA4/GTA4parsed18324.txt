Grand Theft Auto is a series that needs little introduction. In this installment, the player takes on the roll of Nico Bellic, a russian with a dark past. Overall, I feel the game is quite fun, letting you work your way through the underground buisnesses of liberty city. On the downside, I dont like it as much as games like Just Cause 2 and Saints Row The Third because it takes a much more realistic and serious apporach to the genre and I rarely find myself lauging while playing it. But also because of this, the immersion of the game is unparralleled and you feel like your actions have consequences.
