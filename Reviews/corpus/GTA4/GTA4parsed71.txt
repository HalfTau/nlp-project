I used to kindof enjoy driving the cars around and doing whatever random stuff I wanted.The dialogue was always highly cringe. I had the PS3 version before this and played through it. I played through the other games as well.These days I cant bring myself to enjoy it. The protagonists are supposed to be idiots, but I cant excuse how racist and awful the dialogue is.I guess this is supposed to be some commentary on criminals, but its not clever or funny. Its just... bad.The open world is neat, but the story that ties it together isnt.
