This game is doomed to be buried by the story of GTA V. If you enjoy the comedy of other GTAs, or perhaps youre an Opie and Anthony fan this one is a gold mine. Lots of voice cameos and inside jokes. Also, the story has a few great moments. Game mechanics are meh, especially driving. Sadly, GTA V quickly aged this game, and it doesnt have the timeless appeal youd get from San Andreas.
