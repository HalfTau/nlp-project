Literally THE BEST game Ive played since Wind Waker came out. However, if your PC isnt pretty decent at least a GTX 660, or equivilent, I wouldnt suggest it to you. Frame rate issues are horrifying, to the point that on an R9 290x it sometimes dips below 20 FPS with everything maxed out, 1080p.I give it a 9.5/10, but PLEASE consider the power of your machine before buying.
