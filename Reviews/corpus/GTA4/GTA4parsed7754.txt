Everytime I go back to play this game it updates a copy of Windows Live that locks up the game. I have to find and reinstall another version in order for it to work.  Fun game when it works but unwilling to do this everytime I stop playing for awhile.   Problems playing a Microsoft game on a Microsoft system shouldnt happen.  Im done.
