Story is amazing and dark.A great cast of characters.The graphics are good and fits perfectly into the story.Tons of amazing mods.But sadly the multiplayer has ben completely left behind by tar because its something really fun but if you have a ps3 or xbox 360 and you want to play the game how it is without mods its better you buy the console version because its a bad pc port and the multiplayer is still alive on the console version. other then that, buy the game.UPDATEThe login issue and almost all of the other bugs are fixed  some slight optimization.The game is now officialy superior then the console version in every way.
