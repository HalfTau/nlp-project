Aweful game. Got to a section of the city where there seems to be bombs randomly placed in the street. Hit one and you car blows up, failing your mission. The mission structure is terrible and you can waste half an hour only to have the game freak out and kill you for a random reason and you have to start again. There are numerous places where you could checkpoint the levels but it doesnt. It just becomes unfair and horribly unfair to play. Its painfully reminiscent of GTA III which I just gave up on because of tedious levels. Man they just didnt learn.
