This game received an update from R after who knows how many years. Previously you had to use hacks and mods to get the game playable on modern systems...NOT ANYMORE!!. To be honest the game still runs like crap if you max everything out on high end modern systems. I think the culprit is view distance b/c setting it to low had the biggest impact on my framerate. The game is now able to successfuly connect to GFWL and even the GFWL achievements work!Long story short if you were EVER hesitant to get into GTA IV, Id like to say that the game is definitely in better shape than it was before. Its not perfect but, hey, at least the update helped it run better on modern windows systems.
