Its a really, really good game. But its a really, really bad port.Grand Theft Auto IV is my favourite game of all time, however this port really doesnt do it justice. Its a real shame because it puts a damper on an experience like no other. Highly recommend the game, but if you have a 360 or PS3, get it there instead of PC, unless youre planning to play with PC friends.
