To save, you must be logged in to a service called Game for Windows Live, expect that service closed for good. Ive tried multiple bypasses and nothing work. And when I did play the singleplayer despite knowing that I couldnt save, the world was completly blank. All I could see was other cards and objects but not the world, building and roads themselves. So save your money and get a game that works.
