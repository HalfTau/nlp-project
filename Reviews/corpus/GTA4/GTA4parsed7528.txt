Every time I try to play this game I get a prompt that says I must be logged in to the Rockstar Social Club. I regd a new account there, logged into my new account, then tried to load the game and it STILL says Im not logged in to the social club. No matter what I do or try it will not let me play this game. Im on Windows 10.So for that reason I cant recommend this game. Im still searching for a solution that works, but at this point its been a waste of my time and money. Other steam games load and work for me no problem, including other games in the GTA series. Just not this one, because it appears that some idiot over at Rockstar decided to try and force everyone to join their social BS network.I was thinking of buying GTA V as well, but I doubt thats going to happen.
