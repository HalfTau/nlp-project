Ill keep this short. Dont bother getting it if your operating system is windows 8. It will cause your computer to crash and infuriate your temper. Thank god steam has a refund policy. If you feel its worth the risk , try it. Who knows , maybe itll be different for you. What sucks is i really was looking forward to playing this game. Anyway , purchase at your own risk!
