After playing this game on my xnox 360 it was fun and I had one of the best experiences with a game. Now when I first opened it up I had to download games for windows live and so I did. After opening it and angry with windows live I just skipped those steps. When the game finally loaded I was in a new game. Normal driving Roman to the apartment.So I pressed on the gas on my controller I was playing with an xbox one controller and WOW THE LAG. Now I thought this was due to my computer so I kept lowering settings till I got to the minimal. Now my computer can run Skyrim on Medium settings with no lag at all. So I went and read all the reviews for this game and its a normal thing to have a poor frame rate. Also considering buying San Andreas but that game has problems.
