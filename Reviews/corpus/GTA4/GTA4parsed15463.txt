I would like to recommend this game, but I cant. Know why? Because of all the crazy DRM crap you have to go through just to get the game to play. Ok so heres the rundown. Not only do you have to log into Steam, You also have to be logged into this service called Social Club but wait, thats not it. You also have to be signed into Games for Windows Live ....all just to save the game and save your achievements....DO YOU THINK THATS ENOUGH?? WHAT WERE THEY F THINKING?? On top of that, in order to get the GFWL service to work correctly you have to disable Twostep verification which is weirdly funny since they brow beat you into enabling it when going through initial setup. So whats the deal? Is it too much to ask to require the basic functions of a game to work correctly? Especially one thats been out for several years? Not only that, I also had to run 3 other installers manually just to get the game to launch on my PC.Game looks cool but all this stuff has me EXTREMELY frustrated.Do yourself a favor and dont buy this game. Its not worth the frustration required just to start playing.
