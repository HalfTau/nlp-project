A REVIEW FOR SOMEONE THATS ABOUT TO BUY THE GAMEInstalling There is Windiws live which you cannot play with out xbox live accout there are many problems with Windows live, updates which took me an hour on how to download, multiple problems while logging in, but after all I logged in.Offline mode campain very nice game lots of funOnline mode multiplayer I played about an hour and every single lobby I would join there is a hacker, hacher that If you try to kick him he will put you in a place were you cant escape, kill you over and over while using god more dont even try playing online its a waste of timeover all the game is better to be played in campain mode, easy to mod the game get some fun mods and enjoy the campain i give it a 8/10
