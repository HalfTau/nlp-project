Dont buy this game!  I love GTA, but you just cant play it with Windows Live and other annoying features that COMPLETELY PREVENT YOU FROM PLAYING THE GAME.  If you have a graphics card with vram above 2 gb, the game thinks you have to play at the LOWEST graphics settings, which is horrible.  My rig should be able to easily max out this game, but it makes me play at the lowest settings possible.  Waste of money.
