Good to hear that GFWL is dead, only problem now is that GTA IV is now broken on my system, stuck on that loading screen when you press start on the main menu. I could have truly enjoyed this games story, gameplay, and even the mods out there for it, but now all it is is a waste of space. 30I bought this in 2013 down the drain.
