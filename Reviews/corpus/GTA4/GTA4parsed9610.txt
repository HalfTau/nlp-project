This game should be renamed DRM IV.You are thinking of purchasing this game for your Steam account  a form of DRM.Then you look at the specifications, oh, it requires SecuRom for activation, fine  DRM.From the launcher, it says you need a Rockstar Social Club account in order to access online multiplayer, right  DRM?In game, it tells you you require a Game for Windows Live account which links your CD Key to that account and is nontransferrable in order to save the game  DRM, again.So, you need three seperate accounts, plus SecuROM, in order to access the full content of this game.That is four layers of DRM.Now, the theme.The glorification of gang culture, the objectification of women and sex, and the constant violence, along with the desensitization.Then you look at pop culture and the social unrest along with gun violence in Murica..Chicken or egg? Who is influencing who?Makes you wonder.
