You need a crack to get rid of Games for Windows Live which is already closed down for a legit copy, what an irony.On top of that  poor optimization  still cant get stable 60 FPS on a 10 year old game.Mods  broken by the patch so you need to revert to one patch ago if you want to use mods  which are pretty essential to fixing this crap
