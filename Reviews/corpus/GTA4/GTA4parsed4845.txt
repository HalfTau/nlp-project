So i just got this game along with episodes of liberty city because they were on sale for 9 dollars. I loved both of these games back then and i wanted to replay the series. Dont buy these games unless you want to struggle. I have windows 10 and it was not starting up until i changed some file extension after trying to figure out what was wrong for like 20 minutes. Once i finally got it to work, the graphics were horrible so i tried to raise them up but it did not let me du to me exceeding my resources even though i could handle black ops 3 and other graphic heavy games. Also, the map would be missing as i would try to play so i just refunded the game. NOT WORTH IT.
