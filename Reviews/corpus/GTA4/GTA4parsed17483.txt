While waiting for GTA V for the PC, this can be possibly the ultimate timekiller. With a world to explore, and experiencing the crumbling city life of Liberty City, this might surely brighten up your day.Of course, its the PC, so mods are a must for this game to supplement your gaming experience! Whether its the texture enhancer like iCEnhancer, which makes the game so much realistic because it can be realistic, but the the results are way beyond realistic, or swapping dreary cars into reallife modernday supercars,  the possibilities are endless!Well, if youre much of a speeddemon gamer, who can finish games fast, the DLCs are also there for you to try em out!Overall, the game is old, yes because its around the 20082009 era, but it never forgets to put a smile on your face.
