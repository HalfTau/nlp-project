Hi for those who are trying to play this game and didnt work, perhaps this youtube video will help,. However bear in mind this will mean that you cant play multiplayer. When i want to play multiplayer i just spam the play button to log in until it is successful. Sounds silly but it works trust me! Do install the latest windows live in order to play the game though. Make sure you have C Redistributable 2008  maybe 2005 too  and the latest GFWL . If this doesnt fix your problem then just search Google for it.
