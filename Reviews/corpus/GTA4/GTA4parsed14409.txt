Makes you sign up to two seperate useless accounts.I couldnt actually play it for about five hours after I bought it, most of which time I spent messing around with their stupid accounts.And then the gameplay was clunky and difficult with a keyboard and mouse, and the mulitplayer servers stop working half the time.Im not saying that this game is bad, but DO NOT BUY IT ON PC.
