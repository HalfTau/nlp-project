Grand theft auto IV was definitely a big step in the GTA series due to its visuals but the game is somewhat of a let down.. An open world Liberty City to explore but only 5 of the buildings are accessable. The story of Niko Bellic is pretty good and the voice acting is great. The multiplayer free roam is definitely where this game shines. You basically just do stupid stuff with your friends. Blow up cars or blow up the Cluckin Bell.
