This game has given me one of the best times Ive had when I had alaptop. This game looks good for its time and its physics are great as well. The story is intriguing and fun, it really reminds me of GTA San Andreas where you are forced out of Los Santos and everything is going to hell.Id recommend this game to everyone.
