I love the freedom of roaming the large world of GTA4, driving at speed along scenic roads among skyscrapers, through parks, and along waterfronts. But the missions are just as malicious and hateful as in San Andreas, the mechanics of the game have not advanced at all, and the motion of your avatar in the thirdperson perspective is as clunky as it always was.I completed San Andreas despite these flaws, but I turned my back on GTA4 after a small number of hours. It just felt like the same flaws wearing a different outfit.
