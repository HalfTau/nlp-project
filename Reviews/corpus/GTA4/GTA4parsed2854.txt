Take Two have demonstrated theyre more interested in impressing investors than letting their customers enjoy the products theyve purchased.Edit It seems Take Two might be relenting on their cease and desist, but only after the negative reviews, and only after Rockstar begged them, and coincidentally during the Summer Sale. Hmm. Im not changing my recommendation. TT and other lazy, greedy, entitled publishers need to learn the lesson.
