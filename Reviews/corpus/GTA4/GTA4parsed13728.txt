I bought the orginal CD for Grand Theft Auto and it sits beside my gaming station for the last 17 years.Grand Theft Auto was the first open world action game I feel in love with it and the closest game to it I played was Fallout 2 oddly enough. Due to its dark nature and enabling you do all sorts of hellish things you wouldnt due in the real world.GTA4 should be called GTA Simulation as it really left alot of the arcade elements behind. You die from bullets alot quicker. You can no longer turn on a dime. Due to this alot of people didnt like this version as much. Personnally I loved the changed to a more realistic world. For me the results are more satisfying when you escape the police in a epic car chase or survive a grueling war in a warehouse.I found the story to be fantastic with many intresting characters. You are a badimigrant looking for change. You regret you actions bit too much for my liking but otherwise a great story. There is still humour through out the game.Warning....you never wear a seat belt. Bewary when hitting other vehicles as you may travel 100 feet in slow motion into the building infront of you. Realism that I like to see in a game. Also be wary of bikes outside of the DLC  you will die easily at high speeds.This game is on my top 10 all time games. Highly recommended.
