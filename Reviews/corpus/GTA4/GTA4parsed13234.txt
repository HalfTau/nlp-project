Its gta what else is there to say,... The single player is always good but the Multi is let down with crap like gfwl and some people have problems joining in due to a strtict nat access/connection i had this issue and had to mess around with the router but it was never perfect.. its old but on sale for 4.99 so it is still worth it.
