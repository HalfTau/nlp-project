The game its self is very good. However Rockstars Social Club and the abortion that is Games for Windows Live means youll spend more time ripping you hair out stumbling over log ins, authentication errors, and loss of saves than actually enjoying the game.On top of that, Games for Windows live is practically unusable with windows 10, but that doesnt mean its gone. Youll either have to fight tooth and nail to sign in for multiplayer and to SAVE YOUR GAME, or you can download a third party program which removes GFWL all together.Do not get this game on PC, it is a waste of time and money. Thanks to GFWLs innability to perform, Ive lost my 24 hour game and can no longer sign in to start a new. All in all, a very good game, but an absolute abhorrent travesty of a port.Repeat  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC.
