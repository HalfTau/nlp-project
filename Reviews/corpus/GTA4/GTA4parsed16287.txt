overall game 8/10this port 7/10I loved grand theft auto 4, and it gets even better on pc with mods, however other than that, i cant really recommend this version that much for a couple reasons. 1. This game is very DRM heavy, first you have to set up windows live in order to save, and you need a rockstar social club account to play online. 2. This port was HORRIBLY optimized, even the best gaming pcs have trouble running this game.So if you can deal with these issues, then go ahead and buy it, but if you cant and dont really care for mods, then just stick to the console versions.
