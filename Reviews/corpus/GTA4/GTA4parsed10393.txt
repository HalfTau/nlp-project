wow this game is awesome and best on PC of course. Once you figure out how to get the game to play, then you have the best version. I can fire up my PC and get in game in minutes. The game isnt perfectly optimized, I run 1080p max settings at 60 a sec. but I actually only get 52 a sec.. If I switch off vsync, Ill get an average of about 160 frames a sec. but there are screen tares. So vsync on the game is smooth and that is like butter putting the ps3 version to shame.As for the actual game, if you havnt played this you must have been living under a rock. This game is a classic.10 out of 10 game.
