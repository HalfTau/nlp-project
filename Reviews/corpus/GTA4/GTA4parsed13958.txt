ok, we all know this is a good game but some are complaining that you need a windows live acc.... that can be easily solved, if youre using windows 8.1, you can make a windows live acc. after that you just download windows live and sign in. note that the game will not appear in the windows live window but that is ok cause you can start the game now.ps for some reason my game is stuck in pillar box screen but i can still play smoothly.hope that helped
