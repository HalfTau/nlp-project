This is the Best Grand Theft Autos Ive played. I love the graphics to it, and the detail to the cars are awesome. I like that if you hit your car going fast Niko will actually fly out of the windshield, very cool and realistic. The only 2 things I wish Rockstar did was name the city New York City instead of Liberty City and have all the real brand name cars in the game. But it is still a great game and I give it 5 stars.
