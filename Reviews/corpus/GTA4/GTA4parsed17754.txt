Overall I enjoyed my time in GTA IV.  However, there were a number of significant annoyances the whole having social encounters with people  basically you stop shooting people, committing crimes etc to go and pick up a friend, drive them somewhere to play a silly mini game and then drive them back.  I understand what they were trying to do, but it just became extremely annoying the overall product is clearly not optimised for PC and should run better the save points  there are certain triggers to save the game.  I personally see no point to not giving people the ability to save when they want. Motorbikes  I just hate motorbikes Rockstar social clubThe good a full city of misfits and criminals lots of nice fast cars  although some were a bit easy to find early on
