I bought GTA IV in a sale a few months back, and when i installed it to play, i was unpleasantly suprsied to find rockstar games had installed their own social club network into the game which you HAVE to join to play.When i did that, and social clubs terrible software actually worked and stopped freezing, GTA would load and then blackscreen as soon as the initial diaglogue started.Searched forums and such for solutions, all of which either didnt work, or required downloading multiple programs/patches which I honestly cbfd doing after ing round with it for 2 hours.If you can be bothered spending a decent bit of time looking for solutions then yeah go and buy it, otherwise just play Vice City, the music is probably better anyway.
