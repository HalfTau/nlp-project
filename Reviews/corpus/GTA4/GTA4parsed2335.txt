I find it rather ridiculous that people are ripping GTA IV due to the end of OpenIV. Try looking at it as a game and not a ing modding blowup doll, please. GTA IV is an amazing game. You can enjoy the deep story, amazing visuals and audio and humour without modding there to obstruct beauty. Please, stop it.
