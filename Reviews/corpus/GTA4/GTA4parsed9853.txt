This review is not based on the game itself but more on my experience with steam and you RWhen i first purchased this game Grand Theft Auto IV The Complete Edition i was happy but now not so much. Because when i bought the game then downloaded it right away i got what i paid for GTA IV TLAD  TBOGT, Then my PC Fd up and i lost everything not because of the game i had to reinstall everything including this game not a big deal but then after this game was finished i was happy to go back and play. but then i noticed something i only have GTA IV and not the other stories WTF ok so i look around for some answer but get nothing. so then i uninstall the game then reinstall from the store page of Grand Theft Auto IV Complete Edition but still only get the base game and no stories! So basically got the old royal screwjob. thank you steam.if anyone sees this and can help me it would be very greatly appreciated
