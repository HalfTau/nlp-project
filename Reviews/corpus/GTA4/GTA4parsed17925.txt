Honestly, this isnt a bad game in anyway but without mods... The PC version is horrible. Lots of frame skips, glitchy textures, horrible vehicle handling and more. However if you have a group of friends to play with and you get some mods off the workshop then it becomes a pretty enjoyable game for the PC.I, along with many other gamers wish that Rockstar would stop porting over the Xbox 360 versions of their games over to the PC, they instead need to solely develop versions for the PC. Hopefully Grand Theft Auto V will finally deliver what weve all been waiting more than a decade for.Xbox 360 Version 8/10PS3 Version 7/10PC Version Nonmodded 6.5/10PC Version Modded 9.4/10
