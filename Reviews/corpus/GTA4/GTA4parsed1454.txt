Even though this game is poorly optimised and needs help from a few external files to actually play and startup, its still my favourite GTA game of all time, the story in this game is so much better than the one in GTA V and the mechanics were really good for their time too, if you can look past the poor optimisation then youll really enjoy playing this game! Just make sure you buy it during a sale because its ridiculous charging people 19.99 for a game that came out in 2008.
