In game help for controls is a joke. Loved the game but is worse and worse every month. Paid 60 for new one hope to one day play it. GTA 5 been out 2 years might make it to cpu spent alot of money hopeing so. I tink I want my money back at this point free ingame money is not really that much. Do I recommend GTA 4 no. It is so old. I regret buying it at a discount. If GTA 5 ever makes it before 6 might enjoy. At this point more likley GTA 6 comes out before 5 for the computerIf GTA 5 is delayed again can I buy another game? waist of money at this point?
