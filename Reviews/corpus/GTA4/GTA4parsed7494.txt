While everyone has moved on and GTAIV Multiplayer is pretty much somewhat dead, the singleplayer experience is amazing. The driving and the shooting are  bit funky, but once you get used to it its very funny to watch crash into a post and see Niko fly out the windshield or push people down the stairs.ProsInteresting story Episodes from Liberty City tie into GTAIVNew York style cityLoveable charactersMod supportEasy to mod the gameConsUnoptimizedModding can be a pain Sometimes mods uses so much RAM the world dissapearsLatest version of the game is unoptimized, but has lots of mods, while earlier versions are optimized better, but lack mods.Overall good game, pick it up during a sale maybe even Episodes from Libery City, it includes all 3 games
