This is a game you shouldve played at least once. Trust me, you wont regret it.I decided to pick up this game since it has the title The worst PC port ever. given by many users over the internet seriously though, google for the worst pc port and youll see gta iv often.This review is not about the story, its more about how it runs in 2017 and so on.I had put about 30 hours into the story From beginning to credits and I encountered a few issues while playing those missions.Lets talk about the worst issue in a mission, the last mission. Theres a quicktime event which requires your game to run on 30 FPS max. or else its close to impossible to complete it unless you want to smash your keyboard. I am wondered why they havent fixed this one yet.In other missions, the friendly AI may screw you over which results in your mission failing.Outside of missions you will encounter probably even more bugs, but they are not that much of an issue.The other thing is the performance. I got fairly low hardware intel i3 and amd radeon r7 240 and I often drop below 60 fps on lowest settings. It helped me to downgrade my game to the 1.0.4.0 version, but keep in mind that this version may contain more bugs.After finishing the game, I couldnt stop listening to this oneBy the way, you probably found this review under the funny section because I wrote this silly review two years ago and I decided to keep it for memoriesConsWindows LiveThere is roman
