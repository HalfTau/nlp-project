GTA IV is the 4th game in the entire GTA numerical line, and is a real fun game to play. The only problem with this game I have are the controls and the graphics. Poorly exported overall, and recquires a really good machine to run. It currently recquires you to make a Windows Live Gaming account, which is a bit bad. I would give it a 7/10, just because of the storyline and general game. If you are to buy it, dont buy it here, but for the PS3 or Xbox if you have either of them.
