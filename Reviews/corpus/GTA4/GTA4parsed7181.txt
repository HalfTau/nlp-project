In its current state I would not reccomend buying this game. It relies on multiple DRM which are all unreliable apart from Steam. First you need to sign in to Rockstar Social Club to play the game online but the login client fails the majority of the time. Then you need to have Games For Windows Live installed and running which is not supported anymore so If you cant get it to work you are pretty much out of luck. Then there is the case of the game failing to start. I login to social club or choose offline play and the Windows closes and the game fails to even launch.I played this game on 360 and it is one of my favourite games of all time but there is so many pointless barriers to play this game that many players are probably forced to pirate it.
