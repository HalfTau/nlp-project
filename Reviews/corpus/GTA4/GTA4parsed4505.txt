Rockstar recently released an update for gta 4 that supposedly optimizes it to work with Windows 8  10 OSs and support modern hardware especially video cards. After playing for a bit on a Windows 10 64 bit system  I can confirm that it is indeed playable and better optimized than it was previously. The only issue that still remains is that GFWL is still incorperated into it so youll still need an acccount in order to save your game. Other than that I would recommened this game when it goes on sale.
