I really like this game this is my second time playing it first I played it on Xbox 360 and then I wanted to pick it up on pc but I was really disappointed when I came upon many issues that I had to fix and solve. The first of them being the social club not logging in and the second issue was that I could not change the graphics. But anyway I have solved these issues now and can play but from what I can tell when I was playing this game that this is poorly optimized because i constantly get frame drops no matter the settings and I have pretty good hardware in my system enough to run this game maxed at 60 fps. I cant say that  this has ruined my gaming experience but Im not going to recommend this game just because of it havering bad optimization and a bunch of issues. I mean this game is fun and love the story but once again if you want to purchase this game beware of the issue that you will meet.
