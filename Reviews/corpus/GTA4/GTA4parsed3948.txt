The game is really good, its fun, you get to do many things, but ... when you get a patch that stops you from modding, then you are ed ! Modding is the thing that makes gamers buy open world games, that awesome feel when you are Iron Man, or Look at my new car  or role playing. The new patch ed it up. I love it, but if you buy for mods, just dont do it until they fix it.
