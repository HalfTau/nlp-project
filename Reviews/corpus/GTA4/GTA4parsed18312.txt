This game is a masterpiece. As yet we have Grand Theft Auto V out,h This remains to be my favorite Grand Theft Auto In the  entire series. This was not only The GTA I grew up with, but it has a great storyline, Good characters, An Amazing atagonist, and  allows you to take out your anger on bots. This game has to be one of the best games of all time. I hope rockstar revives niko and bring him back in a future Grand Theft Auto. This game is well worth 19.99.
