Amazing loading simulator, Rockstar may have pulled it off with GTA V  but nothing is as astounding as this, baby! Nothing like waiting hours or days just looking at a russian people slideshow, it really gets my spirit on. Its so realistic it actually feels and acts like there is a game after the loading screen but so far I have not been able to get to that point, probably just a gaming myth, Im sure. I played GTA IV on consoles and let me tell you, that crap aint  half as fun as this little gem, 8/8.
