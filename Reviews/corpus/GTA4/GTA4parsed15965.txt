Im sorry but as much as I like GTA, and as much as others love the series, this is inexcussable. The gameplay is boring, limited, and repeatitive, the story is boring and forgettable, and the characters are uninteresting. If a game cant draw you in with its gamplay or story 2 hours into it, then something is seriously wrong with the game. The modding community may have a ball with this game, but thats because of how absolutly bland it is, it literally needs ghost chili extract just to get the slightest semblance of flavor into it. The game may eventually get good, but that doesnt excuse how bad this game really is. Truly a low, if not the lowest, point in the series. 3 out of 10. And Im being generous.Oh, plus theres that whole debacle of the whole internet online play key that has to be entered and the only way around it being extremely well hidden. The entire system is beyond convoluted and whoever developed it was clearly a madman. If you want to get this game, buy it on Xbox, not PC. Save yourself the extra nightmare of having to deal with the incorrect ID key
