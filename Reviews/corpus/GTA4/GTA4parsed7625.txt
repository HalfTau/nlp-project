I run a FX 4300 with an AMD 7870 on Windows 10 and consistently get 45 fps. The Games for Windows Live was a pain in theto get running for the first, but after the initial setup...Everything runs fine. Smooth. Playable. Zero CTDs. No glitches. No extremely frame drops. I did nothing special at all. Run it on about MedHigh settings.Other than that...I enjoy GTA IV on the PC.
