Although its 5 years old the graphics arent that bad.The story can be very interesting and certain scenes will make you laugh.If you dont like the story, you can always horse around in Liberty City.You can meet people at certain locations, for instance the bowling alley.For the modders theres  a lot of choise.I definitely recommend this game.
