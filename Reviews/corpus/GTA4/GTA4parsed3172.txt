This game used to work for me, everything was perfect. But then Microsoft discontinued GFWL and the game would no longer work. After hours upon hours oftrying to fix this game, Ive gotten past problems only to have two more problems shove theirup my Ive gotten past my problem with the social club login, but now the game freezes before I can even get to the Rockstar logo. It freezes on the copyright warning. Im ing tired of trying to fix this game. If nobody can help me on here, there is no hope.
