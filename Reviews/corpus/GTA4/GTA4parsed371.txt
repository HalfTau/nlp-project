ugh, the game play makes me want to shoot myself. I cant even comment on anything else about the game because its so difficult to do the most basic things. I asked someone who played gta on xbox if it was supposed to be this difficult to move around the world and he was like, omg, no, this is awful. My mouse movement is so. slow. And the mechanics of walking and driving are totally different. There were times I found it nearly impossible to run down the sidewalk without knocking over every. single. person. And driving is significantly more difficult than running because with running you control where you run with the camera angle/mouse. Driving is controlled entirely with the arrow keys, and then you have to move the camera so you can see where youre going. It seemed like no matter what I did I fishtailed continuously the entire time, and I always turned corners way too tightly. I even stopped to install a controller, but that didnt make it any easier. The first four police chases I was involved in werent because of my criminal activity, but just because I slammed into a cop car while driving like a grandma.A lot of people have complained that the game doesnt work, but I didnt have any trouble setting it up other than having to allow it through my firewall.
