Open IV was the reason I bought this game for PC, however my computer couldnt handle the game yet. However, now the reason that I got this game was just banned 10 !ing years after it was started. Rethink procedures, Rockstar Gaming and Take Money Interactive.EDIT Since Rockstar and Take Two took back their previous procedures, mods are officially back! Still cant wait to finally try out this game fully. To everyone else, the storyline is great, there are many things to do during and after campaign. The mods, as with any other GTA, can be one of the greatest reasons to buy on PC.
