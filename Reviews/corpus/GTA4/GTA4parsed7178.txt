The game is a 10/10 on consoles. But a 6/10 on the PC. It was a fing hassle trying to get this game up and running. Even though I got it working, It still stutters and crashes sometimes. Instead of reviewing the PC port, ill review the actual game itself. If youre expecting a San Andreas type game with chainsaws, flamethrowers, and jetpacks, Youre not gonna be impressed. GTA IV has a dark story and very interesting characters throughout. It pretty much plays like a movie basically. The missions do get a little repetitive but the story really makes up for it. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous for its time. GTA IV in my opinion of all the GTAs has the best physics. The game is pretty much the most realistic out of all of them. The game does get very boring after the main story and all of the side missions. So the only thing that i guess is fun doing is trying to 100. Otherwise, install insanely cool mods. So overall if you have a console I would HIGHLY suggest getting the game for that. But if you only have a PC, I would stick with another GTA game, unless you wanna go through all the sht that i had to start the damn game.
