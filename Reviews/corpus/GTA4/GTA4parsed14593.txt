Everyone knows what GTA IV is and what kind of games they are. I dont have to explain that.Anyways, this may be the worst version of the GTA IV... Laggy, crashes sometimes and has kinda bad graphics for a PC release but the mods are the catch in this version. No need for hombrew consoles! Just download the mods and enjoy them with no fear of messing up your console or getting your console locked.
