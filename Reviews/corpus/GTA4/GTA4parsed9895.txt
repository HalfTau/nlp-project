I thouroughly enjoyed this game. The story is thoughtful, graphics are nice, and theres a lot you can do in the open world. The only thing I wasnt a fan of was the fact that you make a whole bunch of money but you have next to nothing to spend it on but guns and ammo, and taxi rides around the city, which come in handy a lot of the time.One bad thing I have to say about playing this game on PC is that, Im on the very last mission, and Im unable to beat the game due to a glitch you might come across. I can just see the end but my keyboard disables me from making it through, and its ever so frustrating. I dont know if that can be fixed or not by Rockstar or by myself, but that would make a hell of a difference in my life. Overall, I loved this game and put in way too much of my time into it.
