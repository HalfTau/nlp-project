this GTAIV title worked fine for me. i logged into my XBLA account for it and had no problems but cannot find a session with many players because people complain too much about Microsoft Games for Windows Live being shutdown, but it is not dead service its just people that have moved to GTAV. this game took me 7 years to finally get a working PC compatible to play this and yeah i have no problems now... this windows release it 10xs better than the Xbox/PS3 version due to less bugs and massive uncompressed quality. shame they wont do a remastared edition for PS4/X1.
