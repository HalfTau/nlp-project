Its hard to really write a review for a game such as Grand Theft Auto IV.At its release in 2008 it was a technical marvel graphically astonishing, a living world and an intriguing physics engine  akin to that of Half Life 2 back in 2004.I thoroughly enjoyed its overall gameplay structure, storyline, the protagonist Nikos early struggle and subsequent rise to power, and of course its ability to turn your Xbox 360 into a personal heater after 10 minutes of playing at only 30 if lucky frames per second.Nowadays on PC, the story is... unfortunately not too different. Minus the aforementioned MASS overheating of a far supassed generation of consoles, the game still technically performs like a severely intoxicated beaver swimming through a river consiting solely of molasses.It almost seems to function even worse, as crashes and freezes are the main offenders. The game itself is still fantastic! However, you cannot fully appreciate what is happening on screen due to the many bugs and optimization issues that still remain so many years later.From we have seen from its sequel, GTA V, it appears that these issues are no longer a problem in any capacity across multiple platforms at multiple performance tiers. Its saddening that Rockstar has not come back and fully paid GTA IV the maintenence and care it deserves after all these years.However, the game remains brilliant still in its current form. I recommend it on PC  there is far more definition in general  but this comes with a warning. The GTA IV experience is still there, it is just hindered by a cavalcade of technical problems that require a considerable amount of patience to endure and ultimately enjoy.360 9/10PC 8/10
