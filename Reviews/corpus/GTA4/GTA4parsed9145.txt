Ive owned this game for a year now and in that time Ive tried every fix thats come out in an attempt to make it run, at best it crashes on startup. Recently 40 minutes ago the problems have escalated to causing my computer to completely crash and making it unusable for half an hour while windows repairs itself. I rate it slightly above mcaffee in terms of usefullness only because it is easier to uninstall.
