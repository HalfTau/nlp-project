Very good game, with some flaws. The presentation is top notch the graphics for its time, the voice acting, the cutscenes, the story, it is all very well done.At first the big city was cool, but after a few hours I got tired of taking a bit to drive everywhere. Also, I did not like how there is no midmission checkpoints. So if you die towards the end of the mission, you go right to the beginning and need to drive all over again.The shooting was OK.Overall, great game! YAY!
