Had nothing against GFWL, because Ive been thinking that all my saved positions are being uploaded and synchronized via this service, Now installed after almost a year with a new PC, logged in and have to start from the first mission. Seriously? Whats the purpose of GFWL then, just to earn several achievements and thats all? Definitely NOT gonna play it through again, not worth it.
