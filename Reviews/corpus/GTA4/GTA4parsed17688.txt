Save your money for something better even if you feel your confident your PC can run itI bought it for ten dollars, spent almost a full day to download it, and then spent another few hours trying to play it. I had startup problems, unfixable resolution issues, and the game never got past the first loading screen after starting a new game similar problems a bunch of other gamers had...dont believe me look it up on the internet and the disscussion boards and Ive never had any problems  with any other games except thismy opinion  it should be pulled from the store until these bugs and glitches are patched
