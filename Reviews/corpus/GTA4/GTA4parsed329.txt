I was skeptical of buying this on PC, as I read of all the issues and people saying it is un playable on windows 10. But I bought due to having the option of a refund if it doesnt. I have had no issues getting the game to work on windows 10, it just required me to log into my old xbox account and it works fine.  This is not a a great port however and does hold quite a few graphical errors and I have been quite alot of bugged out sound in doors, but the game is still playable, espcially if youre a fan of GTA IV, it was deffo one of my faves.
