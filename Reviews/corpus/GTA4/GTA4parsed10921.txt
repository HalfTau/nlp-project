When I bought GTA 4, my friends told me it was a game about stealing cars. When I played GTA 4, I found out that it was actually a puzzle game, where you play as a frustrated customer trying to get the ing thing to work. The enemies both Games for Windows Live and Rockstars Social Club are memorable if nothing else, as Im sure that I will remember the massive ing headache they offer. Just buy GTA 5, I hear it actually works.
