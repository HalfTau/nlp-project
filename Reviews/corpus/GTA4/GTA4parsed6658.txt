Cant play this old game because of bad optimization on FX8350  R9 280x.Found some tutorial on the internet but all required me to download some cracks, bloatware yes, social club is bloatware imho and dlls so i gave up. I didnt play 5 minutes until i quit.Well Done RockStar Games. Actually fixing this game is easy but why do I have to download and run files from untrusted sources?And dont forget that command to be even access higher settings with newer cards.I really dont get,  why everything isnt already included? Why do we even have an updatefunction built into steam?
