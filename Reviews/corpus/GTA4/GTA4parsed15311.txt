Despite all the DRM , after making GFWL  Rocstar social club accounts  which i didnt think were that hard .... i mean if you can make a STEAM account ... you can make an account on these sites That being said , I think this game was great for purchasing it on sale for less that 7. I am running a dual core with a 550 ti and i run this game perfectly fine . granted im running on med/low settings i feel like there was barely any graphical slow downs in this game like i read in previous reviews.AFter all is said  done i feel like they have PATCHED a lot of the problems this game used to have and i was very happy with my purchase considering i got both games in a bundle.If you see this on sale during summer sale id suggest picking it up as i was online and playing within 45 min of buying the game  already had a rockstar social club from max payne 3 All in all GREAT GAME 10/10 especially when you get some buddies and go online XD
