This is not the first time Ive played GTA IV, but I still feels so new for me. The thing which I dont like is that the game is soo unoptimized, I have a decent PC and I cant get a stable 60fps on it I have all the settings on high.Also if you are looking to be playing Multiplayer, have a friend with you since there isnt alot of people playing online.I would give multiplayer a 4/5.And the Singleplayer in this game, oh the nostalgia. I will give the story a 4,5/5.Windows Live, the program made to hate games that uses it. Windows Live gets a 2/5.Overall I give the game a 7,5/10.Other then that, I would recommend you to buy this game.
