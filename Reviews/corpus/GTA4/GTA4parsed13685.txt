People complain about this game having optimization problems and being laggy and glitchy, however, my game has gone one step further and wont even start at all!EDIT So eventually I got the game working, I ended up installing Rockstar Social Club and Games for Windows Live both of which make me want to vomit.After a bit more verification and stuff I got it working... sort of. The game booted up into an 800x600 window. I went into the settings to fiddle with the graphics, but it wouldnt let me. Turns out my computer didnt have enough VRAM. Well thats what it said, turns out Rockstar had failed to realise that computers with more than 2GB of VRAM exist. So I had to edit a configure file restricting the game to 2GB of VRAM, annoying because my R9 280X has 3GB.
