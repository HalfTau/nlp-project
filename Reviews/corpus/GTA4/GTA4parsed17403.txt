fun, fun, fun... good guy, bad guy... I still punch out the street preacher in front of my apartment....keeps me from doing it in real life...only complaints need more instructions to help noobs to get the game to run on the new systems... especially those withsolid state drives that have limited space and is/are listed as the OS drive drive Cmost installers default to the C drive as the route for installing the game... not good!also experiencing lag in my system which has mor than enough horsepower to play this game...is it my drivers?,... is it my system setup?..., is it something else?!?Ill figure it out, but these need to be addressed without having to go through piles of forum tech talk...
