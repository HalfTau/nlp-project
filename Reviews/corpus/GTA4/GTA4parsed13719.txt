Okay, this is, hands, and pants, down, an awesome game.I know theres this violence issue, but hey, Ive been playing this for over a hundred hours on Steam alone I also have it on disc, and I dont feel any urge to pull random strangers out of their cars and go for a ride. At least not more so than before playing GTA 4.Not only do you get a ton of missions, a really long story and lots of sidequests, its also set in a pretty big city. Itll take you quite a while to drive from one end of town to the other. If youve ever played Ultima 9, this is the complete opposite!And aside from the main story theres lots of stuff to do, likeYou can also be a taxidriver, a cop and possible other stuff. Even after over a hundred hours I still have a lot to explore.The reason for that pretty much is the ingame video editor. You can actually record clips of all the crazy stuff you do and edit them. Cut out useless material, edit your best stunts into a single video, play with cameraangles and movement, add music and export it as WMV.So, to sum it all up GTA 4 is an awesome game, and if you dont mind the violence it really is a game you should check out.
