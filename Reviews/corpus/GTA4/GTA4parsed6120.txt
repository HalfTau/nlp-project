Well.. it sucks, plain and simple. And its hard to say this, cause I love the GTA series, played almost all of them, GTA 1, GTA 2, vice city, san andreas, GTA V...Maybe if you could actually play the game, it would be fine. But this is not the case.So here are the steps I had to do to play the game First of all, you have to log in to Rockstar social club, which fails 90 of the times. Then, when you run the game, you realise that this piece of crap does not really recognize your dedicated graphics card full amount of memory. So when you first run the game, it will be on crappy settings, 800x600, low texture, etc. So you have to manually create a .txt to fix the problem Once you fixed the graphics card memory issue, you can modify the graphics settings. But of course, nothing works as it should. When you try to save the settings, the game freezes.. It saves the settings, but you have to manually kill the process and run the game again. Now, time to play the game right? WRONG! Now you have to log into Games for windows Live, which sucks btw.And Im getting some weird fps drops when I move the camera.Plus, the game freezes everytime you AltTab!So, dont buy this piece of Even on sale, its not worth it, at all!The only reason I didnt ask for a refund is because I bought in a bundle with GTA San Andreas.TLDRIt sucks. You have to do a bunch of things to make the game work. And it reallyme off. DO NOT BUY THIS! Save some more money and buy GTA V
