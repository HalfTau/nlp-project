A review for this game is definitely long overdue. Ive enjoyed playing this game much more than any of the games that came before it. All of the GTA series is wonderful but GTA IV tops all the ones before it. I didnt actually expect a great story from a GTA game but it was one I definitely enjoyed following along with on top of all the side missions and crazy antics of any other GTA game. The gameplay mechanics are done really well and allow you to not get caught up with confusing controls and jerky movements. The vehicles handle really well and give a much more realistic and experience than what I initially expected from the game. Fun all around for those who enjoyed the previous games, you wont be disappointed.
