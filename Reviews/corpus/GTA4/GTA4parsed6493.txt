Ive always wanted to play the game when it first came out. Ive finally played it through on PC and its by far one of the best games Ive ever played and I already have nostalgia after playing it. I highly recommend everyone to play the game if ya havent already. Its always fun to complete missions, earn money, and run over people lol. The story mode really got me super interested in it and there were a lot of scary/shocking moments in the game. I definitely give this game a 10/10 D
