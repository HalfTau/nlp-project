Game is not optimised for PC which for some users is a let down, however i am reviewing my time with the game.I do feel this game is below the bar in regards to content vs San Andreas, however it does make up for it with a great physics engine, robust characters, and a genuinely interesting place, even NPCs have their own little personalities, watch cops do their thing on NPCs, some will run some will stop for the cops, it feels like a living breathing world.For its time this was unprescedented and many games even now are not close to as great with AI.Graphically its a mixed bag, i like its art style, is suits the game well, i capped FPS to 33FPS and cranked all settings, this gives me a consistent FPS without that horrible stutter which happens on all systems, and also have enhanced graphics thanks to some small mods like RealityIV 2.0. The FPS is perfectly fine since using a controller is the best way in this game.The game is great, Roman is annoying but demands some heart, will never get tired of going bowling.. .LOLGame runs without issues on Windows 10 x64 Pro for me.Intel XEON  GTX 670 2GB.
