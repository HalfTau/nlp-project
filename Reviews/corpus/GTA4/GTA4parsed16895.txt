its stupid that you need so many account just to play a game! social club if u want to play with your friends, games for windows, i might be mistaken but when i was trying to make a games for windows account i needed to make a microsoft account and xbox account. ALL THAT JUST TO PLAY A GAME! you basicly spend 20 dollars for accounts. each account provides a thing that u can do. social club to play with friends or on the internet. games for windows account to PLAY THE GAME. yep, u cant play the game without a games for windows account, well, u can but nothing saves.
