So I purchased the game, and heres somewith this game I occured, I will never change this to positive even if I like the game, because of Rockstar doing all this1. Social Clubdoesnt work, we need to find a patch for ourselves, and my Social Club account with GTA V got locked because of too many tries to log in.2. Cant play multiplayer because of the first reasons patches.3. I finally got it patched, but the game didnt work because it doesnt support Windows 10, so I had to get another patch.4. Finally game is open, cant change any graphical options, here comes another patch.5. Changed the graphics but it says my video card memory is 107MB, which looks like was locked. So I had to get another  patch to change it to 2048.6. Stuck on loading screens. Yep, you guessed it right. Its time for another patch.So if you are okay with patching the game for 1.3 hours, its up to you.
