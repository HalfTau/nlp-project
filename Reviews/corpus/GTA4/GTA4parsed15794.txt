Runs likeon AMD hardware a A85600k  HD 7850 1GB combo runs the game at 3045 fps in outdoor areas with everything on low/off except for textures being on high, AF x16, draw distance at 25 and detail distance at 30. if you want this game to run properly youll need a highend Intel  Nvidia PC.The game itself is okay I give it a 10/10
