this game is great but it is not outstanding,ive seen people online saying that its a rip off because the game crashes at start so what i did was a made sure before i got the game that i had GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE!!! if you have windows 8 it is easy to get. also have a social club account.onto the game, you are niko bellic a russian dude who came to america to get away from crime but within 5 minutes you are already killing people. the gun play is good with an OK cover system. the driving is behond bad. and the missions are basically arons for other people. there is bear bones customization of your character meaning no haircuts or tatoos. not even any car customization but you can change the paint and repair it.the story is good and tells a story of niko becoming an american and living the dream. there is only one heist mission. after that you have loads of money, but you dont have any thing to spend it on!!!! you cant buy cars or houses.this game is very fun, but not for everyone there is lots of brutal violence, LOTS OF DRUGS!!! sexuality but no nudity, and a hefty amount of language.but the best part is your ability to mod the game but i do suggest doing so after the story.this game is a 7/10
