Im recommending this game under very specific circumstances. Be informed before making any decisions.Firstly, this game is horribly optimized. It shouldnt need half the resources it does, but if your computer is good you can still run it. For those thinking that theyll pick up an older GTA for their older computer or laptop not specifically designed for gaming, dont bother.Youll likely also likely want to look up some custom settings online for best performance. Basically using the ingame menu to change your graphics gives less than optimal results. There are workarounds, but youll need to look them up specifically, because its going to vary from rig to rig. You can play without doing this, it just gives you better bang for your buck.Next youll need to navigate a few broken systems that are required to play. A quick googling will easily give you all the information you need in order to get this thing up and running, and honestly shouldnt take you more than 1015 minutes maximum. Still if it isnt your cup of tea to have to basically trick the game in order to get it running then go ahead and give this a pass.If you can get passed all of that youll find an interesting and well made game. While the technical side of their port to PC is a how, gameplay is well ported. Controls are smooth and intiutive, load times are minimal to nonexistant, and the story is as good as youd expect from a AAA game studio. Theres enough content to keep you fat, dumb, and happy for at least a few dozen hours depending on how much of a completionist you are and lots of interesting mods to extend your games lifespan.tldrThis is a really good game hidden behind several problematic, albiet solvable, issues. Seriously though, be informed before you buy. Though if your computer can run this game youre probably better off just getting GTA V.
