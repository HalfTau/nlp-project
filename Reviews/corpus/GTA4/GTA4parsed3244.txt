I played GTA V for a while, I decided to go back to the classics! Here is why this game is great1.Physics EngineCars fly and realistic crashes make for a good time!Since Niko Doesnt like putting on seatbelts if you hit something hard enough you go out the window shield!2. GameplayStorymode is amazing!Characters are funny, and attachable!Somethings they could improve onFix the weird building dissaperance glitch!Fix the phone buzzing sound!Overall great game! I totally recommend it!
