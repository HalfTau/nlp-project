Grand Theft Auto IV isnt just about reaking havoc on the city with helicopters, or stealing police cars. Theres much more to the game than that.Ive been a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series ever since I was little. But Grand Theft Auto isnt the only game Ive enjoyed, Rockstar Games puts out amazing and utterly amazing titles. From Max Payne, to Red Dead Redemption, to my favorite L.A.Noire, this company knows how to deliver games that put you at the edge of your seat.I play Grand Theft Auto IV for mods. I love playing as an Officer and helping out the city. LCPDFR is probably the deepest mod out there for Grand Theft Auto IV.I would strongly recommend this game to anyone who loves the show COPS, or just someone who loves role playing as a cop. Just be sure to install LCPDFR at
