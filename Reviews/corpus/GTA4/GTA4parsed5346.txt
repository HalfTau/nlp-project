I have to say, when I read the reviews, I hesitated purchasing the game. I am glad that I bought it. I didnt need to get  for the game to work, as I was able to log into Games for Windows Live without any trouble. People have been talking about lag on newer computers. I got some lag, but my hardware isnt the greatest. My only complaint is that Social Club is not working.
