The fact that you have to create a microsoft live account just to save your progress is more frustrating than my cat havingunder the table. Saving is a basic feature that every game should have, regardless of wether or not someone wants to have a microsoft live account, or any online account for that matter. It took me 29 minutes until i eventually gave up. If you do try to create an account, good luck. Youll need it. Maybe it just doesnt work for me because im doing something wrong, but you shouldnt even have to in the first place. If you really want to play GTA, wait for a sale on 5. Please dont put yourself what i went through trying to get the game to use one of the most basic features of all time. There are plenty of other offline games that dont need any sort of account to save with. Buying 21.99 worth of cat litter is a better investment. Just dont.
