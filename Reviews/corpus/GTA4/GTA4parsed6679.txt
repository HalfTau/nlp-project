My only experience with GTA IV was with PC and while it looks slightly better than its console counterpart, the poor optimization really ruined the overall experience for me.  I get that PC users have to take it upon themselves sometimes to find the sweet spot to get the game to run smoothly, but even highend systems have trouble running this game smoothly.  There is a fix which you can try provided by RockStar, but I still experienced significant drops in performance despite my hardware being well over the recommended specs this game requires.  The host of pages and forum posts about this issue is mindboggling and nothing seemed to work to alleviate the performance issues I was having.Another annoying facet about this game is the requirement for you to log into Games For Windows Live GFWL.  If you dont have an account, youll have to set up one up as well as having to set up an XBox gamer tag regardless if you have an XBox or not.  This is required if you want to save your game progress.  What is actually a pretty good game is ruined by how it was executed and ported to PC.  Im glad RockStar didnt follow the same path with GTA V.If you really want to play this game, console might be a better choice.  If you do end up getting it for PC, be warned that you may possibly have to spend a good amount of time scouring the web to find answers to get this game to even run smoothly.
