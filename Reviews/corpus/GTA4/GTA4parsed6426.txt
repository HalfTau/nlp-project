Grand Theft Auto IV, the Fourth Main Game in the Infamous Grand Theft Auto Series.The game itself, is legendary for its Story, Protagonist and Memorable Characters in one of 2008s GOTYs.However, this PC version, I cannot recommend.Unless you have a supercomputer, or have the patience to install a bunch of performance increasing mods, dont buy it for PC.Instead, buy a cheap Xbox 360/PS3 and buy GTA IV.Its good enough that its worth buying an old Xbox 360 to play, rather than spend hours fiddling around with the settings and patches to find the perfect match.
