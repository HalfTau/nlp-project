GFWL completely ruined the game. You cant even log in or create an account. You have to go through the hassle of manually adding files in the game, modifying some text files so the game can run in an acceptable performance.You wanna play multiplayer?! Too bad! Cause social club has been down for a while now for this game.Oh! Multiplayer is not fun anyway! We are here for the single player! Too bad! Unless you can log in to GFWL, you cant save your progress...Unless you add2017 this is still a thing...They dropped support on GFWL, so you areout of luck to play online.Oh yeah! This comes with secuROM as well. A DRM which doesnt work in WIN 10. Whats worse? Even if you uninstall the game, it still sticks to your PC. You need to use a tool to remove it.4 DRMs in one game...Definitely not recommended, you are better off pirating it so you dont have to deal with all these DRM problems. Its a real mystery how is this game still up in the steam store...
