This game, actually isnt as bad as the news and all over protective parents make it out to be. The thing that makes the game bad is the player. You see Im playing this game for the story. Not to just go around shooting every  I see and blowing up cop cars unless im being chased and going to the strip club after every consecutive mission. The story is pretty intriguing and the side missions are pretty fun.The game is as violent as you make it, so its not the games fault.10/10
