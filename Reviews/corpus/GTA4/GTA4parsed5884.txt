As several people have already mentioned, be prepared to spend some time trying I use the word trying, as I havent actually been able to get it running yet to set up everything you need to play the game before you actually play the game.If youre undecided between this game and another which doesnt place ridiculous obstacles to people ust picking up the game and playing it and theres an enormous selection of titles here on steam Id encourage you to give this one a pass.
