No matter what I try, I cant get this game to work on Windows 8.1. Unless I followed the instructions wrong though you shouldnt need user created instructions to make a huge game like GTA IV to work, it should be made to work on anything, I spent 16 During the black friday sale with Episodes From Liberty City included on a nonworking game. Dont get me wrong though, the game itself is great, I completed it on the Xbox 360. If anyone has tips or a definite working guide, please message me. Until then, dont get this game until Rockstar releases a patch that makes that makes the game work on Windows 8/8.1. If you have XP or Vista, Im pretty sure the game should work for you.Also if youre wondering where the playtime comes from, that was me on the Social Club login screen trying to log in everytime a tried something new to help make this work. Thanks if you can help UPDATE I got the game to work! It took forever, but finally it does work! But really, it took me hours, so dont buy this game if you have Windows 88.1 or you might not be so lucky as to find the forums I did.
