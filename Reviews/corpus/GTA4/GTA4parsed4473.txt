If you want to play this game then youre gonna have to put some effort into getting it to work. The game itself is easily a 9/10 game, the story is gripping and the gameplay is better than you might expect. Getting the game to work does take 30 minutes of researching and fixing but its well worth it. It does have a few bugs even after you fix it but theyre not too annoying, bugs include cutscenes taking way too long to fade out, mixed render distance that makes most objects render in at the normal distance whilst sometimes cars and people appear 20 metres infront of you. Also a wierd texture glitch that makes doors and entrances grey out for a split second. Otherwise this game is well worth it. If you see it on sale get it. Its worth atleast 20
