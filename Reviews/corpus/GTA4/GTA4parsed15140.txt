I loved grand theft auto 4, even though I have not played it on steam much, I love it on xbox 360. Its a game I would tell anyone to play. The episodes from liberty city is a bit of an add on, I wouldnt say they are needed, but it adds onto the game. I have played both GTA4 and GTA5 on the xbox and I can most certainly say that both are great games on Xbox or steam. If the game is on sale its worth a shot. I dont see why you should not buy the game. Game play is great, there is almost something going on in the game. There are also a lot of side stuff, you should try the side stuff out such as hanging out with friends, instead of just doing it mission by mission, it makes the game funner in my mind. 9/10
