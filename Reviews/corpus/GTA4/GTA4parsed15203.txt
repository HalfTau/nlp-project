This may or may not be a good game I cant tell you. I cant tell you becuase this game has cancer.  THat cancer is Games for Windows Live.  Its either down, malfunctioning or some other Microsoft BS.I cant play the dame thing with out Live and so there we go. Im done I want a refund.Do your self a favor and stay far far away from this.  Go buy a 360 and play it that way if you have to.
