this game gets a lot of criticism because its a lot more serious than GTA games normally are but i think that criticism is  unfair.It has the best story of any GTA game in my opinion with characters that actually act like real people, yes Roman calling you every five minutes and asking to hangout is annoying but guess what people in real life are annoying too.Yes Niko is miserable but its  because he doesnt want to be involved in any of this, he just wants to start a new life away from killing but keeps getting sucked back in of course he is miserable.also driving as fast as possible and slamming into a wall so you can launch Niko through the car windshield will never not be funny!On the negative side of things it hasnt aged well, all the faces look horrendous and i had to cap the frame rate at 50 because running at higher framerates ed up the cutscenes.I honestly i think this game is great and definitely worth playing.It took me a long time to appreciate just how good this game is, when i first played it i also thought it was too serious but coming back to it now i realise just how great it actually is.You should definitely buy it when its on sale, 19.99 is way too much for a game thats nearly 10 years old!
