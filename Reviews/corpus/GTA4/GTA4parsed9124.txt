EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ON SALE GTA IV is the worst PC port I have ever played in my life. Confusing, as GTA V is the best PC port I have ever played. Long story short, this game is broken. It seems theyre trying to milk every last penny out of this game. Upon launching the game, I couldnt play online and my resolution was locked to 800x600. Pretty crappy as I know my R9 280 is capable of running this game Which launched in 2008 at 1080p, max textures. Even though it seems like a steal, the game is horribly optimized and youd be better of spending your money elsewhere.PROS Its GTACONS You cant play it, unless you want to sign into 5 different accounts and spend the best part of 10 hours trying to fix it and then have it crash on you.
