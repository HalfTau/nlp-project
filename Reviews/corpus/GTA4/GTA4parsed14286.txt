On Steam, its marketed by pirates who sell a nonworking game. Being a fan of Rockstar for years, the fact this game doesnt even run puts it to shame. To the pirates who are selling this game, get your crap together or perhaps jump off a roof. How you idiots decided to run the game on such a conflicting platform is beyond me. Though I imagine pirates do what pirates do best steal.
