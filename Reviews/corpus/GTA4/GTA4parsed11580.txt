Havent had less fun with any other GTA title.Repetitive missionsAlmost every mission is like drive a long way  kill/get X and kill everyone in your way  doneMissleading instructionsExample Hurry up, that guy is running away, leading you into running after him an getting killed, because you run right into a horde of enemies. And even better, your target is invulnerable until it reaches the point you are supposed to kill it. So sometimes its more about figuring out what the game designers intended you to do, than just doing it the way you want to do it. During your second try of said example you will notice that the guy you are following actually pauses while running away, giving you all the time you need to follow him and kill every enemy on your way.Phone call spamYou want to progress in story? Not without being annoyed by constant phone calls of some npc wanting you to waste your time with him.Ridiculous driving physicsIn some cases a little corner can make your car flip over.And the one thing that was just too much and led me into writing this. Even that long after release I couldnt finish the last mission because of a known bug.
