GTA IV itself is a great game with good story and some fun action.However ...The PC version is such a mess with bad and inconsistent frame rate which really make the game rather unenjoyable. Though there are many ways to help with this issue or are supposed to help, I didnt find them useful at all. Overall, this is a poorly ported game.Shame on you Rockstars.
