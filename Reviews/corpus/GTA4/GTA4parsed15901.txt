Rockstar gets a lot of flak from the performance of this port but the controls in GTA games on the PC have always been the best. Since this game is mostly driving from one point to other, that is the thing that makes or breaks it for me.Besides that, the world is big and immersive, the graphics are beautiful even without mods. Story and general gameplay is top notch too. More PC ports please Rockstar!
