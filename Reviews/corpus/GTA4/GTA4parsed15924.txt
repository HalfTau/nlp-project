I havent even played the game. You wanna know why? Because of that piece of  GFWL. I spent an entire day, half of it downloading the game and the other half fighting with GFML. In the end, all I could do is uninstall everything. Dont buy this, unless Rockstar tells GFWL to  off. Untill that happens, save your money, dont waste it.
