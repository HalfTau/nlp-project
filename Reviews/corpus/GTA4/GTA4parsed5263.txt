Now lucky me I figured out a way to play this game again. From downloading GWL and  making my account just to save. Now would I recommend this game YES. Does it excuse itself for not working iin the beginning, NO. As of now I am very happy with my purchase. Not only are the graphics set to the ultra there was no lag and the game is a beatiful masterpiece.This has been my childhood game and playing on the pc does not dissapoint. Especially when your playing this game on 4k ultra and a stable 60 fps. Good going Rockstar! But dont screw your customers again!
