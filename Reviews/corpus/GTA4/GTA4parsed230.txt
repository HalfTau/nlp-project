Right. my review. Ever since I started playing GTA IV when it was released back on the Xbox 360 and PS3 ive been hooked to it. It has a rugged, realistic storyline which is one of the best in the series. You face many challenges, like that one bank heist which if youve played it, you know whats up. It has a good diversity of characters that youll encounter as you play through the game. The physics are great considering the time it was released. And well now the physics are just hilirious online. Unlike GTA V online, there is no grind for money, everything is free. However GTA IVs online can be a bit annoying if you dont have a mod menu, and about every freemode lobby is a deathmatch. Overall. Its a good, solid experience.
