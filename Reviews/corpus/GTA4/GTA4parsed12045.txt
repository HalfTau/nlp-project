Although its a bad port, its still an amazing game that Ive replayed several times. Some of my fondest gaming memories come from the Free Mode multiplayer gamemode that I always played with friends. I would also recommend Episodes From Liberty City, those campaigns are also amazing, and the multiplayer is actually a bit better than in this game. If you havent played this game before, youre crazy. I give it a 9/10, since it is a bad port. Still a great game though, would highly recommend it.
