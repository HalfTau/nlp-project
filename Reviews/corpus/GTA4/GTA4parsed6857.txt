This is a game about a angry Serbian man everyone calls a Russian and has a Russian accent moving to America and realizing his cousin was a idiot. Big surprise. So he does what he does best become a action antihero that goes and does heists, accepts assassinations and gets to drive Batmobiles and turn into a giraffe. Not to mention chilling in a nightclub with tornadoes while his cousin drunkingly asks to go bowling even though he has no money.Dont forget that you cant save because Games for Windows shut down!
