AVOID THIS RELEASE!!!By all means, this game doesnt work at all since it is packed with DRM to the brim. The Securom acticvation isnt working what so ever and the Games for Windows Life Mess isnt even patched out for the Steam release. You CANNOT even save your gamestate without a Games for Windows Live account.... Which leaves you with a completely unusable copy of a game thats not even fully optimized for PCs. Save your money and buy a used copy for the consoles, instead. Dont feed Rockstar with your money. They dont give a damn about you. And they will never give a damn about patching this game to make it run.This release is a blatant slap in the face of EVERY single honest gamer who actually spends money for a game he is interested in. Avoid anything made by Rockstar!! And avoid this release!
