While I prefer Saints Row to the GTA games for the very reason that you can pick male or female as well as customize your character to look how you want, the GTA games are still usually pretty awesome. Not this one, at least not this version. On my old computer I actually got it working after two migraines and the urge to take a sledgehammer to my computer...every five minutes. It was a windows 8 machine that I really hated. So, I built my own computer from scratch and no matter what I do, I can not get this working on Windows 10 despite following the same directions as before to the letter. If I didnt get this game on sale in a package with the other GTA games I would have asked for a refund. It is NOT Steams fault though as they are more or less a digital version of a video game store for the most part. Yeah they have their own products, but most of these games are provided as a digital release from the publisher and from what I have heard, Rockstar is notorious about not caring about its customers or its games after a few months to a year. Is that true about Rockstar, I have no idea, but from what I have been seeing it does seem that way.In the end, all I can say is use extreme caution when buying this game itself. And best to buy it in the package when on sale because it is not worth the headaches it causes trying to get the stupid thing up and running. Really wish Steam let you do tradeins...
