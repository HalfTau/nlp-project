After many attempts at reinstallation, troubleshooting, etc, this game still does not work for me. There is no instruction to install Games for Windows, which is required. And once thats installed, the game launches in 800x600 mode, the settings cannot be changed in game, and the executable crashes once the first loading screen is done.To put this in perspective, I am an onsite computer tech. I spend all day driving around and going to businesses and fixing messed up programs and systems... and I still could not get this game to work. Im not willing to spend multiple hours to troubleshoot a game that I paid for. It took 5 minutes to find the game on bittorrent and it installed flawlessly and works without any fuss. Go figure.
