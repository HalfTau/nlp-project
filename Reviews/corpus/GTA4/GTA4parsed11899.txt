This game is very fun! I have a lot of time in it. Although I never got past LV. 10 on the story. The modding in this is really fun! I have played so much of LCPDFR. The only downside is the fact that it is unstable. Once you add mods it can crash so much it becomes unplayable but that can be fixed with a reset of your files. I would recommend that you keep a backup of the orignal game before you mod it. Overall it is very fun, I would recommend it a lot. I would say it is about a 8/10 and I think you should pick it up if it ever goes on sale.
