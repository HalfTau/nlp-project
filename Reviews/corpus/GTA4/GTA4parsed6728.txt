DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Especially if you have Windows 7. It uses Games for Windows a decommisioned program that does not longer function to save game progress. Basically, you cant save your game progress, and thats if you even manage to log into the game by some miracle of god. Rockstar and Valve are using this sorryexcuse of a game to get some last minute money out of your wallet. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
