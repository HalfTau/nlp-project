Ok first of all The port was bad but the game still functioned properly, Now most of the people giving a thumbs down have about an average of 6 hours which in my opinion means 1.They have bad PCs. 2.They are too lazy to install windows live which takes almost no time to do. 3.They are just lazy, Period. Take it from me i have over 200 hrs, I have modded the game and Its extremely better on the PC, Just be sure to backup your game before you mod. Happy Gaming!
