I cant review it, because it wont ing work. I had to type in the CD key in the rockstar thing, tried it multiple times and didnt work. What the  rockstar? The game is good, PC port is garbage. Even if it would work I would be experiencing a glitch mess. Stuff like this makes me want to stop playing video games.
