Ultimately the game is good but the story is horrible. If you are someone who likes the protagonist to have a modicum of wit you will eventually wonder just how dumb everyone in gta world must be for niko to be a rising star.As a sandbox it was enjoyable. However, I didnt like the game. In fact I grew to loathe it. The main character never rises above being an thugish idiot. I kept hoping that at some point he would stop and say to a quest giver You want me to do what? Are you stupid? I could get better results a thousand different ways... that is it. Im goint to have to shoot you now for being so stupid. Perhaps Im expecting too much from my criminals and murderers but I dont think im expecting too much from a crimelord.In the end, for me, this became a driving sim.
