They finally fixed it so it works on Windows 10. Going back and finally finishing this game, I realize I really love this game. However, while this does work on Windows 10 now, it is still horribly optimized and has a lot of issues with stuttering and massive fluctuations in frame rate. Also cheats are easy to find and the health one can really help since without it some of the missions are super annoying.
