Okay, so the game itself is fine Fun Missions, Great Story, Good Character Development, ect...But all thats useless if you cant play it, I USED to be able to play it on my old laptop but it only ran at like 7 frames per second. Now with my new PC theres just way too many problems, and on my laptop there were STILL tons of problems.Theres a problem going around with a thing called SecuRom, if you have a 6th Generation Skylake Intel prosessor, then SecuRom just refuses to let you play the game, and even IF you manage to launch it you probably have to recode it so it can use more RAM for the graphics because the game presets it to 512MB I think and youll have to set it to 2GB or whatever you want it to be.This game is a sorry exuse for a port, just use the money to buy the console version, youll have a much better time.Or you could just buy GTA III, GTA SA, or GTA Vice City instead.
