This is the only Steam Game I havent been able to get running. Tried a bunch of different things including downloading Games For Windows Live, various compatibility fixes, Administrator mode, etc etc etc. Now at 1.5 hours and counting. Im going to keep trying but it really shouldnt be this hard......
