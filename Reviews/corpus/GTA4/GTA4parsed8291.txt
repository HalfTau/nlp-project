Normally I dont give reviews, because all players are different and what one player likes, the other doesnt.But this one is special...During installation I had almost every bug and error this game has to offer.First problem it doesnt use your dedicated video card memory if you have a good video card.Second problem you have to make an account with rockstar if you want to safe your game.third problem you have to manually install the latest xbox life market.and last problem after 3 minutes in game, it asks for your CD key for windows LIVE, I use the CDkey steam gave me and it doesnt accept it.Rockstar knows all this problems but doesnt want to fix this in a patch.Also you need 3 acounts to play this game, thats not very user friendly.After 4 hours trying to repair the bugs I just asked my money back played it for 20 minutes, 3 minutes in gameIs this a good game? No idea, never had the chance to play it.If you want to fix all these problems, good luck. I just take my money and buy a different game.
