2K Take 2 games became absolute garbage for removing OpenIV and killing the GTA Mod community. We need to stand up to this and making modding a tool to make your games better. This was the reason why i bought GTA 4 on PC, was for modding. I got this game last week so i could play it over the summer and enjoy modding. Right when my vacation started, 2K attacks OpenIV and discontinues it. GTAModsMatter
