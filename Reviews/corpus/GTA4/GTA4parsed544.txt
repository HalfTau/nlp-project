Worst GTA game i played and the only one i never bothered to finish to this day.Also it aged terribly even compared to older games like GTA San Andreas, Vice City and GTA III.ProPhysics are better than GTA V but thats the only pro i can think of this game.Cons This game have that terrible Games for Windows Live service rockstar didnt even bothered to patch it out when the service got abandoned. Horrible optimization a straight up console port with little care done for PC get GTA V instead if you can its infinitely better. The main character Nikko is boring he acts like he regrets what he is doing storywise but dont mind doing bad stuff and acting like a psycho when someone offers him a job the tone is very inconsistent and the game takes itself too seriously and have a very boring dry sarcastic humor tone. Too much chores between little fun bits it tried too much to be a real life criminal sim i personally play GTA to relax and have some chaos and fun not do chores like drive all the time point to point then deliver a npc from pont to point, thats boring stuff that i do in real life already.I dont recommed this game at all, i love GTA series specially Vice City, SA and GTA V but this one is the black sheep of the series in my opinion.
