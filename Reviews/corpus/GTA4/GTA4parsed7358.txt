One of the best games I played. It was great and fun playing it. The story was okay.Too bad I cant play it anymore. Its been years, I tried again today because I got a new laptop with Windows 10 and better CPU and GPU. After a few fixes couldnt change any graphic settings, I managed to launch it, even played it. A lot of stuff was invisible so after some tweaks in the graphics settings had to put everything on high, I got it to work decently even if the frame rate wasnt the best.I dont know what happened, I changed a settings, restarted the game and I got infinite loading screens. Even changing back what I changed did nothing.Its official I give up with this game. Looks like Rockstar did the same.
