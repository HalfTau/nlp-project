Great game, with fantastic graphics. The cons are that it is poorly optimized for PC so if you have a decent PC, you get a strange stutter in your framerate every few seconds which can be annoying, but you get used to it. However, if you have a fantastic PC, then playing the game on max graphics looks amazing and colorful. I think that the graphics definitely compete with GTA V.I have over 100 hours on this game and have completed the storyline, but it downloads its own launcher that counts your hours incorrectly.
