Alright. Theres so much one can say about this game. This game is an emotional roller coaster. Most will tell you that Grand Theft Auto V is the greatest game ever. Personally, I believe that GTAIV is a far more superior game. GTAV has a predictable, lazy, story that follows three dudes who rob banks, murder people, etc., and thats pretty much the whole premise for GTAV Prosperity. GTAIV takes a completely different route in its storytelling. The main story isnt  to become prosperous, but it is merely the story of a man facing the harsh times of his life. Although the visuals in the game arent as pleasing as its predecessor, it still holds a place in my heart, as a classic.9.5/10
