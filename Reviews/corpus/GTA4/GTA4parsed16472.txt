Grand Theft Auto IV Is a cool game, It currently offers the most open world sandbox experience there is to the PC franchise until Grand Theft Auto V comes out.The story is awesome if you play it for the first time but you must not skip the storyline otherwise you dont know where it is all about, something that is improved in GTA 5.If you finished the game and play the story more times it is getting more repetive meet him, do missions for him, he betrays you.There are several mods made by the community that you can install to make the game more interesting or more fun.Overall it is a fun game to do and for 20 it is definitely worth it.
