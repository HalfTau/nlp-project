Still the best GTA game after 9 years.The story and the writing are the best the series has to offer, the world is extremely detailed, with tons of enterable buildings though the interiors are copy n paste, mostly.The driving is still some of the best ever featured in a game, as is the damage model the only games that exceed it in damage are Rigs of Rods and its spiritual successor, BeamNG Drive
