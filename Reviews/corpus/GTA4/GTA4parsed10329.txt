I downloaded this game last night and played it for awhile. I bought the summer sale pack that includes the other GTA games. This is the only one I have tested so far. Ive read a lot of reviews on all the GTA games and issues with them. Heres my take on it.After purchasing the games, I was given an option to click one button and start downloading all of them automatically. This doesnt work because for some stupid reason mac versions of the games were included in the pack, and that caused errors. I was able to go my list and download them one at a time with no issues.I decided to start with GTA IV. It takes some time to get setup before you can play. You have to sign up for Rockstars Social Club and GFWL. That part wasnt too bad, but then GFWL forces you to do an update right away. This is stupid because for one thing I just fking installed it! Why am I having to update it!? Secondly, it makes you close the game to do it. Of course, by that time the intro to the game has started, and you have to wait for it to finish before you can exit out. The GFWL update goes pretty fast, but then it has issues. First, it forgets the account name and password that you just entered! Then, it flashes an error and closes the game! I see why people  about it so much. Fortunately, when I tried to start the game again all went smoothly.The game is great after you get past all that bs. It automatically went to full screen and the highest graphics settings after install. It looks great and runs smooth!
