wont let me sign into social club come to think of it i never have, even though i JUST changed my password five minutes ago, type in the password to sign in, then get the invalid password remark. i say screw it and try to play offline and then the  sign in window closes and nothing else. nothing at all launches. wasted 6 bucks for a game i cant even play, thanks rockstar you always seem to ruin the best games.
