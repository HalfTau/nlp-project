I like to shoot the birds around the town and spawn in the best heli to kill people xDBut anyways I love GTA 4 and and if you love a good story you should pick this game up. The only thing I dont like is just like most GTAs before it the hole town is not unlocked at the start, BUT THAT GIVES YOU STUFF TO DO FIRST and the story has reasons to make you go to the next island.The shooting in this game is a bit ehh and is very easy, but the cars are awesome and feel a littlle more realistic than gta 5.
