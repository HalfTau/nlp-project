Possibly the worst PC port Ive ever played. It takes numerous steps just to get the game running, and even when it is running it is hit with a wildly varying framerate and various bugs, several of them gamebreaking.The game has a dreadfully slow start, with boring minigames, horrible characters and a tediously drawnout tutorial  combine that with the performance issues, and theres little incentive to keep playing and see why the game was so acclaimed.
