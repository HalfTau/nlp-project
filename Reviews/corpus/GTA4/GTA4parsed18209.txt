This game pretty much sucks, but it didnt stop me from buying three copies across PS3/X360/PC. With GTA V out its obviously obsolete, it also uses GFWL and Im not sure if they patched it to take away that stupid crap, but if its on sale for 5 or less Id consider getting it for the LCPDFR mod worth Googling, which turns it into a pretty nifty openworld cop game.
