Grand Theft Auto IV is a decent game. However, the distributor and parent to Rockstar Games  TakeTwo Interactive  is a greedy, immoral bully of a company. They forced the popular modding tool Open IV to shut down, using legal waffle to declare its mods an illegal violation of their rights.This sort of corporate bullying and sleaze is exactly the sort of crap that Rockstar lampoons in the GTA games. So its ironic that TakeTwo, which has grossed billions of dollars from GTA games as it is, has now acted against modders in such a pathetic way. Most weirdly of all, this happened after Rockstar themselves praised and encouraged modding as something that enhances and enlivens the GTA series.Until this decision is reversed, I and many other gamers will not purchase any further titles from Rockstar or other TakeTwo companies. I cannot in good faith recommend any GTA game to anybody until TakeTwo Interactives petty and mean decision against Open IV is reversed.
