Decided finally to try one of the GTA titles. Purchased GTA IV via Steam for 19.99, downloaded it took 7 hours!, got it running. Then the fun began!Rockstar demanding I join their socalled Social Club  WTF, I just want to play the SP game, screw the Social Club. Pressed play offline, get another screaming window telling me of the dire consequences of not joining their club. Pressed Esc, continued to the next window... Which was the first in a whole set of windows from Microsoft LIVE insisting that any game progress will be lost unless I  yep, you got it  join their MS LIVE , ahem, community. Remembered that sometime ago I actually joined this happy crowd god knows WHY?, so, after going through the laborious process of reestablishing a password, signed in.MS LIVE then says that MS LIVE must be updated, otherwise nothing would work. OK, do your stuff, little window. Machine froze up, so had to force a cold start. Go through the entire above once more. Get told, after the update ran through that, although I have a valid MS LIVE account, this is not at all the same thing as a MS LIVE gaming account, and therefore I would have to register there and... You get the idea.Thats when I decided to have no more to do with the GTA game, or franchise, or Social Club, or MS LIVE gaming crap, and delete the GTA IV game from my computer, put up with the loss of 19.99 and open a beer to cool down.Conclusion dont bother with GTA IV, save your money and your sanity!
