If you are a filthy GTA fanboy like me, you mightve already played this game. If you did not, you might want to consider playing this.Alternatively, you dont like the GTA series that much, understandable!See past the awful optimization, miserable foggyera Rockstar graphics, sloppy mechanics, godawful A.I. design and play this for the story of a man, runnig away from his past to start a new life in America, to live the American dream. Watch as Liberty City slowly dissapoint him as he kills innocent bystanders, then cops, then himself and ressurects in front of a Hospital with no negative effects of the previous night he spent with his cousin playing bowling because his cousin called him and suggested NIKO, COUSIN, LETS GO BOWLING!.Jokes aside, this game is not perfect for sure. Actually it is pretty ing far from perfect. But I remember scavenging my parents old house for bills and coins that mightve been forgotten around the house just to go buy a pirated CD of this game from the corner shop of my old neighborhood and I remember it fondly. After playing GTA V for a long time and playing this game again, I realize how much progress we achieved in video gaming.Now before hugging your GTA V CD, remember If it wasnt for this game paving the way, you wouldnt have your beloved modern era masterpieces like GTA V.But do I recommend this game? Its all up to you. Like I mentioned earlier, this game is majorly flawed in nearly every aspect. But if you can see past its flaws, pick this game up. Its story is worth your time.
