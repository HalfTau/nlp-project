This was a console port that I feel was slightly better done than its predecessor. The boating and helicopter sections was still a pain but much more manageable this time around. The improved graphics were a nice change however I felt they were a little too real. My favorite thing about the previous games were the crazy shenanigans that occured often due to a graphical glitch here or there. I wasnt a big fan of Niko as the main character but he fit well into the story and when you add cheats this game gets a whole lot crazier and enjoyable!
