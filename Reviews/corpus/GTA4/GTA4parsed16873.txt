I love GTA... IV and V. But apparently, You cannot change your graphics options if you exceed its performance needs.Really Rockstar? Seriously?I also dont want to go through various youtube tutorials to fix a game I DIDNT ING PIRATE. Told myself I wouldnt do it anymore and look what I ing get. Stuck on lowest settings and cannot change it only because i spent a great deal on my PC parts. you Rockstar. Release GTA V on PC working. This was 20 bucks literally vanishing from my fingertips for no return
