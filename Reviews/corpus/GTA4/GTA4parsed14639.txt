I got this game and loved it. Got passed all the services easy peasze. Kept going throughout the story and I was loving it. UNTIL... the WORSED THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME IN GAMING! One morning I was starting up GTA 4 like any normal person playing GTA 4 would do when suddenely out of nowhere came a terrifing beast not really but it was terriffing that said Load Failed, please check your hard drive I was shocked! I open again same thing happened and so on. I went to the forums with people saying all these confusing things. I found one that I could do quick and easy. Did it work? Well what do you think bozo, IM WRITING A NEGATIVE REVIEW HERE! yeah so it didnt work I tried the same thing again over and over again!So thats my ed up GTA 4.Thank you for reading and listening to my story/review!
