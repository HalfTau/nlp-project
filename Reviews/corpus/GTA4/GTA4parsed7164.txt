I have just finished this game, and I have to admit it its really huge and polished. This game will always have a special place in my heart. I think its the most grown up part of all the series and plot is the best of all. I have a feeling, that other parts was just a stories for kids compared to this title. It is really nice, mature and addictive game, which I was waiting for since I launched first game with Grand Theft Auto in title. Characters are interesting and well crafted, fits nicely this setting. Nico is character, that you can identify with, my favourite of all rockstar games. Graphics are also really good, even now 8 years after premiere. Only thing which bothered me were boring missions at the end, I think it was too much missions just to kill time. Mature game for mature players.
