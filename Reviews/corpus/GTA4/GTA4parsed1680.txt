This is one of the best games I have ever played. Regardless of the mixed reviews the game is very good and touches my heart at the ending of the game. Very good game i would recomend it to anyone that it old enough to understand the game. I would give this game a 10/10 beaten this game 5 times and i loved every moment of all of them. For speed runners its a 9.5/10 for me.
