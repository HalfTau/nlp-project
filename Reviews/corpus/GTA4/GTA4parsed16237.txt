This game is a piece of crap, at least from the technical point of view. Rockstar mistreats PC users with this awful version of the game. First of all, I couldnt launch the game and I had to look for on internet the file that the game needs and not carry with it when you buy it on Steam. Second, I got launch the game, but when I try to start a new game, the game stays loading eternally and I cant play at all. And third, if you are a very lucky person and you get launch the game, you will need a 22 century pc in order to play it properly, since the game is awful optimized.So the game dont deserve to pay a  at least in its PC version.PD Ive got windows 8.1. May be all this problems disappears with other windows versions or other kind of operating system.
