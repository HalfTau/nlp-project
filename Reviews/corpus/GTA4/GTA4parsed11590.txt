one of my favorite games of all time. great atmosphere and excellent controls. i played it on the ps3 without any doubt 1000hrsBUT on the pc this is one of the technically most awful games ever.lag, lag and god damn lag. its not because of my system. im running it on a 270x oc 2gb, xeon 1230v2, 2x4gb 1600mhz cl9 rams, on win7 64bitthere shouldnt be any lag, not even close...oddly elfc is running acceptable, only negligible micro stutters. on my previus hard disk system same speces! it was running almost smooth, but now i cant run it well on my ssd! ?i tried every fix, nothing workedthere is also another minus. its called gfwl
