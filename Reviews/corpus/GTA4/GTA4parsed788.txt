Much better than GTA 5 in my personal opinion.All 3 stories in the game if you buy the dlcs tell drastically different stories from the perspective of drastically different groups of people in the same city, Liberty City.Combat and ragdoll physics are much more realistic and more fun to  around with in generalCity has an immense amount of detail, feels much more lived in than GTA 5s Los Santos, you exit your apartment building and it feels like youre really there standing in Liberty City, while GTAs Los Santos sort of just feels like a playground for players to have some fun in, and as for the surrounding area of Los Santos, it was amazing at release but as we have had 4 years to have some fun in it, its no longer anything special at all and once again feels very fictional or like a giant playground.Driving in this game however, does not meet the standards GTA 5 set, it constantly feels like youre driving on ice unless youre in a heavy vehicleOverall a great GTA game, if you havent played it yet its definitely worth giving a try!
