Great game, the only problem is poor optimization. The game has good graphics for 2008, but compared to now, it is very outdated. Most pcs SHOULD be able to run this well, but alot cant. Optimization level 5/10. You also will probaly need windows live to play it its free though. I still reccommend this game.
