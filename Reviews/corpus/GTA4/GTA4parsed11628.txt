I love this game now that I have a much better computer since I purchased this game. This game was and still is  poorly optimized, but if you can run it at High FPS, you wont regret it, plus... the mods make it that much better!Another con... need I say it?... GFWL! That measely little piece of software t can put you off really quick.
