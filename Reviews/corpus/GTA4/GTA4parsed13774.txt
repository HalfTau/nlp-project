Missions in GTA4 are quite thrilling and entertaining. However if you take a moment to look at the big picture you will see a lot of repetition, and at times even predict what will happen next. Go somewhere, kill/steal, escape  thats the general layout. But Rockstar has managed to keep things fresh, even though they overuse the formula during the whole game, by changing locales, characters and reasons behind your actions. Youll probably notice the similar mission pattern, but you wont be bored by it.
