Ive beaten this game several times, although not on this steam account, and while sometimes I felt that the missions were pretty much the same shooting, pursuit, etc it was still great. The car physics just blow my mind. Crashing with cars is so much fun. If you can remove the horrible optimization on pc out of the equation you have a very good game.From having played Vice City, San Andreas, GTA III, this one is still capable of living up to its predecesors.
