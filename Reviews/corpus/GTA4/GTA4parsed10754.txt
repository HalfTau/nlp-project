Why do I have to install Games for Windows Live in order to play? And what is that annoying message which wants to force me to login to GFWL to save? I dont want any trophy or such, I just want to install and play, no accounts no crap. But this doesnt seem possible.The game itself is great, but too muchadded to it. Starting for that useless Social Club application which asks you to sign in to do some stuff, or Games for Windows Live which wants you to sign in to autosave. This is terrible, the business idiots ruined an entire application.
