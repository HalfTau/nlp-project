Initially, I was hesitant whether to buy this game in view of many negative reviews, particularly on the difficulty of installation. While I did experience a bit hiccup when started the game for the first time, but that was solved within a couple of minutes and the game just works fine until today. Nevertheless, I do agree with most other reviews that a game should be userfriendly and easy to kick off after downloading. If you are a fan of GTA series, robably you just need a little patience to bear with initial setup process. Apart from that, it is indeed a nice game to play. Furthermore, at a discounted price, you should have nothing to complain about.
