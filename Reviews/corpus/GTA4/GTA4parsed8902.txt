So, GTA IV is probably one of my favorite games of ALL TIME. But lets put those good times aside and lets talk seriously about this game. Great story Great Characters Liberty City has been improved. Cars drive pretty okay Okay radio stations Okay missions. They mostly involve shooting something that lived Great voiceacting Good UI AMAZING graphics for the time. Ragdolls beyond reproach. Swingsets D Satisfying ending There two different endings. Not drasticly different though. New York based city. Yay. Great Mod support. Terrible port. The framerate is all over the place and it took me 5 years to make it run properly. I had the game on physcal disk but its the same story. I have friends with more powerfull rigs, that run GTA V with no problems, but cant get a higher framerate then 45 FPS On higest settings. And this game comes from 2008!!!! Multiplayer is fun, but almost dead. DRM Tycoon 2008 Steam, SecuROM, Games for Windows LIVE, Rockstar Games Social Club GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE Yes, this removes 3 points from the games final rating. Roman Bellic To much going out with friends Forced mission starts.This game is great. Really. But not this version. Play it on console. In this case, its better. Cuz it doesnt lagg... As much...If you think you have a powerfull enough rig, then buy it. The game is great with keyboard  mouse controls D!
