Why does the social club thing ask me to log in for online features, when I select to play offline? Finally assemble a decent computer  now I cannot play it due to all this drm nonsense.Dont buy this game. Dont buy it now, dont buy it on special, dont buy it EVER. Unless this sht is fixed, spend your money elsewhere.
