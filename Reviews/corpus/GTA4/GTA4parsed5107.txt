Rockstar absolutely screwed people and Steam should be ahsamed of themselves for selling a game that clearly does not work for 20UPDATESince a new update release the game still does not work. I finally got the game to work and rockstar had to screw everything up with an update. Now the game crashes at the loading screen and is literally unplayable. Thank You Rockstar Games
