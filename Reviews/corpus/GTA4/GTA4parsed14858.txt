This game is so bad, I cant even play it not because of my PC hardwareFirst I tried to install the game, oke that worked fine through Steam.I tried to start the game, but had to create a SocialClub account for Rockstar.Then I tried to start the game again, but it didnt start.I found out on the internet that you needed the worst platform ever called Games For Windows Live.After struggeling with Games for Windows Live, I could finally really start the game.But then, my game just randomly crashes at early game point, and never able to start again.This means 1 thing, I never gonna buy any Rockstar PC game ever.GARBAGE PORT.For what did I pay? A crashing game? Wasting 23 hours for trying to fix this game?Score 0/10
