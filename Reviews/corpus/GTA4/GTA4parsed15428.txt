This game is Heaven and Hell, really.When you try driving with a mouse/keyboard your camera hangs in place and does not follow the car, forcing you to turn it with the mouse. Is this innovative? Hell, yes! Is this fun? Heavens, no!If you prefer a gamepad the camera will follow your car smoothly, but it will hang above andof your car. Is this cinematic? Hell, yes! Is this fun? Heavens, no!As a new immigrant you will be constantly pestered by your cousin and his friends and forced to drive them somewhere or go on boring dates with ugly girls because you must support the community. Is this realistic? Hell, yes! Is this fun? Heavens, no!So do yourself a favor and buy Saints Row instead. That game is actually fun.
