OpenIV, the main software that enables modding for this and other GTA games, has been shut down due to Take Two Interactive decision to send a CeaseandDesist notification to OpenIVs developer.This kind of behaviour is unacceptable, given the fact that GTA IV and GTA V sales figures continue to be high to this day thanks to a thriving mod community, willing to spend time and money to provide FREE content to players.DONT buy these games until Take Two and Rockstar are willing to revert their decision.P.S. Great game, shady behaviour by the publisher and the developer.
