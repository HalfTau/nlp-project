This game is truly fantastic. Although it may come off a bit badly due to the dated graphics and awkward popins, the game really has a great underlying story and fantastic missions. I would recommend it to anyone for under 15. The characters are fantastic and the dialogue is great.As seen, most of the cons to the game are to do with game mechanics. If you have the game on Xbox 360 or PS3 I would play it there.
