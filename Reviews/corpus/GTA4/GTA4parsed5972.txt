This is an instance where I really wish there was a middle ground between recommending a game and not recommending it. The compatibility issues with Windows 8 and 10 are ridiculous, I dont understand why Rockstar doesnt release a patch for GFWL and the Rockstar sign in issues. I would think its simple enough. Aside from all of that, if you can find a fix that works for you, then this is a great game. There are framrate issues on systems that are more than able to withstand this game, but it only runs with a 40 fps average, not awful, but pretty subpar if you are used to 60 fps or above. Ill make sure to update if it somehow stops working.
