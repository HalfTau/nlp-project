I bought this because I cant afford GTA V, but it was so worth it.You can hang out with in game friends and go bowling, shoot pool, hit the club or the bar, etc.You can drive as fast as you want and the cops dont care.The characters and the voice acting are fantastic.The game looks great, especially for a game released in 08.Basically, you should get GTA IV. Youll love it. I guarantee it.
