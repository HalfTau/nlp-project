Fun game and nice environment, but everything gets old after a while. The storyline is boring and the open world feel really gets boring after a little while. Overall its a cool game, but feels like a fling. 4/10 for me. Fun gameplay, I really like how Rockstar makes its open worlds. Its just fun and freedom with no strings attached. I like the driving! Storyline is pretty boring. The story itself may not be bad but you just do a bunch of missions that are pretty much all the same, and all equally unrealistic. Theres no development or real fulfillment. For example, with cars, I cant even buy cars and I just have to steal them. I end up with like a million bucks with nothing to spend it on. Like shooting strippers and escaping the police get old when its literally the same thing every time and you dont get to do anything that sticks. Also, dating. No spoilers but like it just feels really detached. Rockstar treats it like a mission, and so you finish them and it doesnt really affect the storyline at all.So, yeah, I like open world games, but after spending an x amount of hours on this game, I ran out of things to do. Kinda wish I still had it installed so I could open it up and mess around for 15 minutes, but thats all the game is to me. Doesnt really change.
