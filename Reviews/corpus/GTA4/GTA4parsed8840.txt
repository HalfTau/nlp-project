This is one of the best games Ive ever played. Almost everything here is good beautiful, living, overwhelming Liberty City a.k.a. New York, memorable characters, a lot of vehicles, interesting places to visit, missions and activities... And the most important plot. Its like a great gangster movie  but even better, cause YOU are the one who writes the scenario. There are also some plot twists and moments when you decide whose life will be spared and who will die. And those decisions will have an influence in the future. The only things I missed in GTA IV are some elements introduced in GTA VC and SA like buying properties, more girls to date or driving Phantom with trailer.No matter if youre into GTA series or not  this is a game that truly deserves to be played.9/10
