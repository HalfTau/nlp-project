In this simulation/glitchy/active/crazy world, anything could go down. The world map is a nice size and it is a huge upgrade from its previous GTA game, GTA III. It runs great on my pc, never any lag. The missions are fun and exciting. The GFX go deep into detail.The one main downer i see in this game would be when roman wants to go bowling or your girlfriend wants to go get waisted and its not just once or twice a week, its every day of every week and for me, it really tires me out bores me. I still recommend.
