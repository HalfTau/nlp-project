The game itself is wonderful, story, atmosphere, gameplay but, this game has got to be the worst freaking port i have ever seen, first of all, i used to be able to run this game on my old potato pc with a gt 130m gpu on lowest setting and get like 17 fps. I decided to never play it again until i would get a more capable pc. Then after 2 years, i get a beasty laptop. This baby is rockin a GTX 950M with 4GB vram, I7 6700 etc. But, it also has an intel gpu for some reason in it for low power mode or smth. That intel gpu only has 120mb vram, so it is nowhere capable of running this game. The stupid game tries to use my weak intel gpu while my beasty GTX 950M is sitting there in the corner crying. I tried EVERYTHING to get thisto work. I deleted my intel gpus drivers, typed all sorts ofon the launch options, typed all sorts of nonsence in the games main directory. And yet, the game says i only have 120m vram whereas i have 4000. Rockstar is too god damn lazy to fix this issue.  them right in the ear.
