The story is great and the campaign is very fun! As long as you play it, you are getting more addicted to the game and more connected with the story and the characters.The multiplayer is sooo fun especially with friends, and trust me, there are enough people who are still playing this game, even tho GTA V came out.Nonstop fun!Is it worth a buy?Why am I even asking it? It is Grand Theft Auto game, duhhh.10/10
