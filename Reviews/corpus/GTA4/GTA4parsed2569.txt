The only time I spent in this game was trying to get windows live to work. Honestly this is more stress inducing than turned my cars steering wheel 90 degrees do 120 on the highway.My recomendation? Buy xbox 360. gfwl is cancer and microsoft should literally kill themselves for conceiving this horrible idea for a game launcher. I hope the dev team dies tragically from something related to this cancerous pile of toxic fetuses
