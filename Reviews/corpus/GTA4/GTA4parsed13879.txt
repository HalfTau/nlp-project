After many hours on this game, yes Id overall recommend it.HOWEVERAdmittadly the whole GFWL crap is extremely annoying, and it is very difficult to play multiplayer without the game crashing on a regular basis. The firsttime start up is very time consuming GFWL and having to create a social club account if you dont have one already is a difficult task or at least for me. But once you get into the game, although clearly dated, the singleplayer and if it works, multiplayer are really quite fun.But if you have mediocre  internet, be prepared to leave the rig on. 24 hour download for me, and then another hour for the things above.8/10
