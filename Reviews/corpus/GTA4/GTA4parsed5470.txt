Bought this while it was on sale, I hadnt played this since the Xbox 360 game which was a numder of years ago.Anyway I installed it  it requires a windows live update before itll save any game progress, to which my PC does not want to do.Another problem with it are the settings, say for example the graphics texture settings are on low, you change them to very high cause your PC is top of the range  as soon as you let go of the mouse button it instantly reverts back to low. So youre stuck with low settings.Requested a refund off Steam, however they werent prepared to grant my request. So that was money well spent.Personally I wouldnt recommend buying this game, just stick to the old 360 version.
