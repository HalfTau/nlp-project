Story ?/?  Never completed due to frustration with how boring and bland the start is.Graphics 7/10  Good for its time, but severly lacking in the performance section.Gameplay 6/10  Cars feels very bouncy, but with mod support theres allot that can be done.Overall level of fun 5/10  Its okay to screw around on but it gets boring fairly quickly.
