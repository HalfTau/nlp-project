Games for Windows Live has entirely broken the game. You can still play, but at the lowest settings possible.For some reason I cant change the graphics settings, and its displaying the warning for my settings being close to or over the limit of my gpus ability. I know for a fact that its nowhere close. Im using a GTX 970 yes I know about the false advertising But seeing as it says on the screen 242 MB used, Im pretty sure its not at its limit.GFWL has ruined the game, dont buy it.
