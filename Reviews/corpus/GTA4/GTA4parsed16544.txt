Brought this game and after downloading twice. Hour of troubleshooting............. Still cant play. Thanks Windows Live for ruining a game and wasting my money.Edit.After finally getting it to work. The graphics are set the lowest settings and I get a warning saying its my machine cant go any higher. Im running the i7 4770k, gtx 780 classified, both liquid cooled. So yea Im really disappointed.
