Its amazing how this game crash every time I try to launch it. Ive contacted support, do reinstallation, updated the game, and even updated my drivers. None have worked. Ive the latest Intel Core i7 7700K, MSI GeForce GTX 1070, Corsair 16 GB memory, Logitech G502 mouse, Seagate Firecuda 2 TB, and 32 inch Full HD monitor. With this high tech PC at this moment, the game cannot work. Oddly, GTA 5 runs perfectly in my PC with stunning visual graphics.
