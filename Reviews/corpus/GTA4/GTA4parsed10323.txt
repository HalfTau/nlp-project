This game is actually good, many people say thats the worst GTA ever, yeah, probably it is not as good as were GTA III, Vice City at their primes, but this game, at least for me, is at least way better than Vice City that I think was the worst in series, maybe not better as GTA III.The huge disappointment in this game is due terrible optimization, sounds fun that this old GTA IV runs terrible compared to my new GTA V, even GTA IV having weak graphics even maxed out compared to GTA V, sounds that Rockstar did something lazy only to say that they released it for PC, people will say that consoles version was better, but I played it also in consoles and the game looks terrible with frame stuttering even being most of the time at horrible 30FPS.This game has a decent plot, a nice main character, nice villains, the best driving gameplay realistic, the improvement shooting scenes, taking cover, a nice map, but the performance, graphics and glitches made this game worst than GTA III, II, maybe in pair with GTA I.Im not talking about San Andreas or GTA V, cause both are the best GTAs at this time.
