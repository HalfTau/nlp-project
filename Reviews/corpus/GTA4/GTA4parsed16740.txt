I love this game!!  The city is alive, people will respond to the actions you do around them whether it be hitting somebody with a car or killing another civilian, the people will respond how you would expect them to.  The driving mechanic is very difficult without a controller and even with one in some cases which is the downfall of this game on all platforms.  The PC version fails due to GFWL and requiring social club for multiplayer, which doesnt work very well.  The game is horribly optimized also, I have a 6800k paired with a gt 640 Yes, I know it is lowend and I am upgrading to 7790 this week and I have to run with shadows off and everything else at low and textures at medium.  I have even done the contig, commandline.txt, and turned the view distance down to very low levels, yet I still get around 30 fps maybe a little higher indoors.  The game is held back tremendously by this, the modding community is amazing for this game, but when no one can play at an acceptable framerate, that cant really do anything for the game except hold it back.  Overall, if you have a medium to highend card that can run this game, I would definitely recommend it and lets hope that Rockstar doesnt  up the port for Grand Theft Auto V when ever it comes out.
