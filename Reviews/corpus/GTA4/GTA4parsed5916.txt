Good game. However this game is broken as hell. When I first started the game it had an issue with my Skylake cpu, so I had to update my BIOS. Then I couldnt login to social club so I played it in offline, after that it wouldnt start so I had to install Windows Live. Once I finally got in the game it wouldnt let me turn up my graphics settings so I had to work magic with the norestrictions command. After I turned up the settings and set my resolution to 1080 I lagged to death, and I stil lag to death with a 980ti but I suck it up and deal with it. 15/10 would pay for again...
