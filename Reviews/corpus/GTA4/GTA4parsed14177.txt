I can NOT recommend this game but I really wish I could. First off, the game is amazing and one of the best in the series, but this port is humiliating. The controlls just dont feel right. But thats not why I am writing this negitave review. Its because I cant EVEN PLAY IT. Social Club is terrible and should not have even became a thing. And what makes it worse is that Games For Windows Live no longer exsits! Thats right, you cant playnow! And if you have Windows 8 or later DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It will not work at all. However, I have found a way for it to work but you can not save so every time you launch it you start from the start you know, when your driving to Hoves Beach? If you are going to buy this game on windows 7 I wouldnt recommend it, it will work but you must make a social club account or play offline. Buy the PS3 or Xbox360 Version. You wouldnt regret it. A total peice of dog
