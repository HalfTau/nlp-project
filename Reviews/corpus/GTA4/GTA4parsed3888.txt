I loved this game on PS3, and even moreso when I swapped it for Complete Edition. The PC version, or, rather, the one on Steam, I cannot reccomend. I cannot tell you how many hoops I had to jump through, and for how long I searched for these hoops, only for not a single one to succeed. Whoever made the decision to make it mandatory to link the game to GFWL is seriously touched in the head. I would reccomend an MRI and extensive therapy and/or surgery for the apparent mental patient in question. GFWL is a failure, and it always will be.
