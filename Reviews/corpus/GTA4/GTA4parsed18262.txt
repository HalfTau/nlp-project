Requires aton of edits to actually make the game run on ur pc smoothly. my laptop can play pretty much any game on it except this one so i had to google the problem and fix the ram space the game needs.overall a very enjoyable game!the accents in the game made me have an accent for playing it too much. very annoying after much competetive playing, with roman asking me to go bowling with his immigrantconstantly.i decided to play saints row 3 with my gf..... and since then i havnt touched GTA4 /to be continued....
