The game works great in 2018. A friend and I bought it to play online and it works fine. I see reviews here complaining, and it had me worried but my game starts and runs fine without me needing to do anything.You dont need Windows Live to play. It says in the description you just go to, make an account, and login to that account when it prompts you to login to what used to be Windows Live. Works just like it did back then. Game on, friends.
