First of all let me say something about overall BAD reviews ratingIf you will do read all those negative reviews carefuly then you soon will know that those bad reviews og GTA IV are from people who1 like to play online which is a bit problem in this game as services are dead or changed, so if game cant be played online it probably deserves a negative review no matter there is a lot of fun even in singleplayer walkthroughor2 who dont go beyond i bought a product, it is not working, yes, i know it can be made working by replacing one library and adding startup paramaeters to the game, but why i would bother?So what to say to the game itself? Another GTA game . Good story and characters and yet it is 8 years old it looks and feels very nice even today, even unmodded at all. Oh, character animations are a bit quirky and sometimes laughable, but i suppose it is something we already got used in GTA series . good story well done characters not that bad feel of living city considering it is 8 years old game awesome soundtrack and mix of radio stations even today still nice visuals, even completely unmodded graphical glitches here and there, mostly in night when under some circumstances lightmaps blink could imagine much better character animation overall GTA series had allways sort of actual substandard character animationsI was fan of GTA, GTA 2 as it was something pretty uncommon in gaming world, then played GTA III when fun somehow disappeared so i have fun again with GTA IV after long years .
