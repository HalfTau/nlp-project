Grand Theft Auto 4 was the first game in the series that I purchased. I had always played free roam at friends houses on Xbox, just shooting people and not playing the campaign. I was gifted this game by a friend and I thought it would just be a fun mayhem game. What I got was not what I expected.GTA4 is one of the best gaming stories Ive ever encountered. Ignore my 2.2 hours, Im not sure why it didnt record my time correctly but I have easily over 40 just completing the campaign. Yes, you can just play it to shoot people and raise hell, but the story itself is rich. The reason I prefer this installment in the series over GTA5 or San Andreas is because the story actually has a moral at the end. In GTA V, the moral is just kill everybody who gets in your way of stealingtons of money. GTA IVs moral is not easily found, but look at it this way Nicos actions affected himself directly and those around him indirectly, and revenge is not the answer. I give this game a 5/5.
