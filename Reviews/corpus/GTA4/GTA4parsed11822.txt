Unlike others I can at least get the game to boot up however my machine apparently doesnt meet the minimum specs? o.0Being that Im running an ASUS/AMD based system with a Quad 4.2Ghz CPU with 16Gigs of ballistix performance RAm and a MSi R9 270x 2Gb DDR5 VRAM ? ?I cant even change the graphic options they all instantly revert to the minimum settings without any way to override them. bought this to get caught up on the GTA series....guess Ill got bargain bin a Xbox copy instead.
