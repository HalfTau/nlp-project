Use to work with just a little file crack on my Windows 10. Now the game doesnt start AT ALL! Supposedly Rockstar released a patch for GTA IV where it would play on Windows 10, but I didnt see any update anywhere nor did I see any update on Rockstars website. I guess it was all bullcrap. Its really such a shame too. I really was looking forward to having fun with this game I had received as a gift, but I guess that opportunity has gone down the drain. I dont like GTA V nearly as much as this game and really enjoyed the hell out of modding it. Now I cant do that anymore. WTH.
