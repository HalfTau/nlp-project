Getting a game to run shouldnt feel like rocket science. Of the 40something minutes logged for this game, 39.5 have been spent figuring out how to actually get it to work. Id expect this sort of technical dysfunction from a new dev, not Rockstar. If youre techsavvy and prepared to fight with graphics cards, code, and all sorts of other stuff, go ahead and get the game. If not, Id stick to GTAIV on consoles.
