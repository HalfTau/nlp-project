I am unable to play this game because rockstar social club doesnt let me log on even though i reset my password and it works fine on their website.update.i found a stickied post in the forums, but be warned this game still relies on the gfwl bleep so this will take a while to get running, unless youve only just bought it.heres the threadit tells you to download a new, working gfwl client which you can find heregood luck.
