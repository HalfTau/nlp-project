Although we already got GTA V, I still love GTA IV a little more Not because it is cheap.... PBTW, who doesnt like a maniac russian exsoildier currentfixer that protects his family and himself by killing those who got his way.... XDOverall, this is a good GTA game that u may want to try before experience the HD universe of GTA V
