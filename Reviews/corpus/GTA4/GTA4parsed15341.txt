Complete garbage. The game is suffering from gamebreaking bugs despite being a mature game that has been out for awhile. In my case, its not properly detecting my video card, a Nvidia 760 GTX, and its forcing me to only run the game at bare minimum settings, despite getting 1,000 frames per second.
