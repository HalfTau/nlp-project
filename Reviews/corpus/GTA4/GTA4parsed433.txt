Better than GTAV in almost every way except for the multiplayer customization/shopping that GTAV has. Which is probably the only thing it has over GTAIV, which is really saying something. Oh and you can actually host servers, install mods, and have fun with your friends without worrying about other hackers, rockstars terrible game design, fake gta money, or any of the other cancerous parts of Vs hellish tribulation that is its online mode.Oh and the story mode is clearly better.I cant believe Im saying this finally but play this instead of GTAV, forget GTAV has an online mode. Stop giving rockstar and their trash publisher money.
