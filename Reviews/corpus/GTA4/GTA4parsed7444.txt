Can hardly play the game.Issues with signing into rockstar social club, After hours of trundling through forums and disabling dll in the directory. I finally managed to get the game working, only to find there were issues with resource limits and resolution. Back to hours of sifting through forums finally finding a solution by creating a commandline text file and writing scripts. After all this I can finally play the game, however it is unplayable as there were  issues with missing textures solution is to write another thing in the commandline file.After a lot of time and effort, the game finally works. I drove roman to his house and the game prompts me to save, however I cannot save unless Im signed in to microsoft games marketplace. And after a few failed attempts to sign in to my account I decided to call it a day and uninstall the game.
