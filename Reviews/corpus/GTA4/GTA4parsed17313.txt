The big world of Liberty City has never looked so good. Sadly the missions and driving were not quite enough to keep it up to par in my books with GTA San Andreas. No diving, planes, bikes, or any real customization left me wanting. A solid mod community and some great DLC make this game into a whole new animal though that you can kill hours in.
