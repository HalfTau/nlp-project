After many years playing GTA VC  SA, i found that this game is very empty.It has very good, but short story and its really easy lmao. Probably when i was a kid, games seemed qute harder, but still.. this is very easy game with no actuall challenge and those frustrations when you repeat mission 5 times.Driving is something i liked most in this game, after all its quite realistic which means its quite harder!Arsenal of weapons is quite small if we look back to older GTA games with no possibilite to double them. Their damage is also quite equal to each other, only difference i found between SMG  Rifle is rate of fire xDMoney in game is quite weird, you get it a lot in main missions but you have nothing to spend it on. Cab fares, meals, dates are very cheap, and even buying weapons wont really make you problem with it. Finished game with 500.000 with nothing to spend it on.No need to mention removing skill system which was in GTASA.As i said, very empty game with only nice singleplayer story, multiplayer is also dead.
