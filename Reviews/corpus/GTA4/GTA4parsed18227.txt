Still a great game after GTA Vs release . When my Internet connection goes off, i play this . Anyway i played this allot when i got it as a Christmas gift back in 2010 . I had allot of fun, even when i had a lowend laptop, i mean REALLY lowend laptop for today and pasts standarts, but i still got like 1524 FPS on 64mb GPU with the lowest settings as possible .
