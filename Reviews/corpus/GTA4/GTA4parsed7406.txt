I was not able to get this game to run. Getting it to display the home screen required some arcane tinkering with Windows Live Game.Then I had to create online accounts in order to be able to save the game locally. I also had to input a serial key manually and wondered if I was back in 2000. Then my online account was not recognized by the game even though it worked fine in a browser.Then I gave up.
