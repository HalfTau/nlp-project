overall solid game, niko is one of the best dudes ever i really fell in love with his character. very good mentally, as hes able to slaughter thousands of people and ruin many lives and can continue to deal with roman, his  cousin. he is quite impressive and recommend the game simply due to niko. niko makes this game what it is. Also the game without niko would actually still be incredibly good. if ur looking for a new game and ur reading this review, buy, it good. 9.3/10very solid gameniko
