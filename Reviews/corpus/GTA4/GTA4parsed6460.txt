Seriously...  this piece of and  you rockstar for making thisunplayable. all i wanted to do was play with friends and i cant and i cant even play the singleplayer... Why do we need Social Club for the ing single player of a game... I got this during the summer sale excited as hell to play one of my all time favorites but instead I gotandon by everyone in the rockstar corporation. If this was playable i would make a good review but jesus just  this ing game and it hurts to say that. Just pleeaase fix this i dont want to refund this game i still want iit please fix this.
