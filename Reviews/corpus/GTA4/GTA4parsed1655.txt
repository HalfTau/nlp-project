It is not optimized from anything past Windows Vista and you will most likely have a hard time getting the game to actually run. The game will constantly crash in the menu and loading screen. After searching online, I found that a lot of people have similar problems and the available patches DO NOT help. Despite all efforts, I was only able to get as far as the first cutscene before the game froze. Luckily, I got a refund, but these technical issues are unforgivable. Rockstar, YOU NEED to take this off of Steam and fix this. You have a completely broken product available on Steam.  The Dog
