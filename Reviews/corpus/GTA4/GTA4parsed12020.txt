Still broken after all this time. Limited install DRM, Games for Windows Live manual install required, Rockstar Social begging for passwords, doesnt detect my graphics RAM and sticks me in 800x600 mode, GFWL wants to update and restart all the time, GFWL password reset link is broken, have to manually enter CD key... Absolutely terrible user experience, I hope whoever was responsible for these UX failures was fired for incompetence.
