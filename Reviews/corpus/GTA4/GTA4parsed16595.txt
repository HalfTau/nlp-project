i love this game but steam completely messed it up for one you cant even sign into rockstar social club which is the first step in accessing the game and while there is a play offline button clicking it does absolutely nothing it just shuts down the gta sofware ive looked online for solutions and none of them have worked so far i dont know how to get my money back or contact rockstar so im kind of screwed here steam has severely dissapointed me this time
