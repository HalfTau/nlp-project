This game has a very intense storyline that immerses you in Nikos twisted life. However, the actual mechanics of the game were terrible. The cars did not handle well and the game as a whole takes itself too seriously. They forget that they are a game and it makes the game has a dark feeling to it. At least the story was very good.TLDR Come for the story leave for the mechanics.
