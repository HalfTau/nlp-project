I am amazed social club allowed me to log in, and even windows games live worked, but then the game crashed, and it was the fault of neither of those two services, but rockstars actual game, first it wouldnt load any textures, and now this, just get GTA V on a sale, its much better in everywayedit dont get GTA V for PC, unless you are willing to fight taketwo everytime they get the bright  idea to stop allowing modders to mod GTA V
