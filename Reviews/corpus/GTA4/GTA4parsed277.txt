It is a very good game, but its not well optimized for PC, as many claim to be, and its true. Minimum specs show that you dont require a lot of power to run it, so it means you can run it on potato PCs and laptops on minimum settings without problems. So, if you really want a good experience of this game, go buy a consolePS3 or Xbox 360 and have fun. But dont play it on PC. Otherwise, the storyline is magnificent, its so well made. I really love this game, but not the PC port.
