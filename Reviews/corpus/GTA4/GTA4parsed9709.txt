Before actually start playing this game nowadays requires some extra work, get fixed windows live, sign into multiple other accounts and get them work properly. Otherwise this game was pretty damn good and a lot of fun. Nice graphics, awesome gameplay possibilities cars were extra cool and huge radio offer. Thats almoust everything you can ask in GTA. Maybe only with storyline you can takeaway away a little bit for IV. Sometimes there was just too much FPS and IMO wasted some offers of huge gameplay possibilities.
