The only way I could get this game to work was to download a crack and I dont even feel bad for pirating, I recommend it to everyone whos about to buy it. The registration is POOR. Once you have the game on steam, you can start it. You will have to register with windows live, which requires a MICROSOFT ACCOUNT Now I have a windows live account, a microsoft account, a social club account, a steam account and my mail to sign up for these AND THE GAME WONT WORK because I cant login while Im pretty sure my password is right when I try to retrieve my password Im redirected to an offline websiteEITHER UPDATE YOUR PLATFORM OR QUIT THE GAMING BUSINESS, MICROSOFT.While I recommend this game, I do not recommend anyone to buy this. Pirate it, which is easier than going trough the registration of 5 accounts to hopefully be able to play.
