Even after all the years I still recommend the game. Great story, great memories. THE DAMN GAME WORKS. Everybody saying all kind of. the game works! You just hit play and it works. No accounts needed or other bs. Yes the optimization may be bad.. but you can easy run it on mediumhigh with 3040 fps small drops sometimes. But its alright.
