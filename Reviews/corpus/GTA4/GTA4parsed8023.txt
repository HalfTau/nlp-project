Unable to play on my Windows 7 PC due to broken SecuROM, which detects some of my system software as prohibited and prevents the game from running. Just like that. Please go to hell SecuROM and Sony.Steam support is just as usefull as always there is notice in store saying GTA4 uses SecuROM, so please GTFO. Yes it is, but I havent seen any notice saying you need a clean installation of Windows without ANYTHING ELSE INSTALLED to be able to run this SecuROM crap!
