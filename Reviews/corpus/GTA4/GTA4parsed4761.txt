This is a very late review for GTA IV, but after playing both this game and all other GTA games for hours upon hours I have to say that I still believe GTA IV is the superior game when the singleplayer is taken into account. I know GTA is about over the top protagonists in crazy situations but the best thing about Niko Bellic is that hes by and large a well meaning person with a bad past who comes to America and sees a pretty stark reality of what the American dream really equates to. GTA V does the same thing, but with basically no really likeable characters to me. Gameplay is very comparable between the two games, with GTA V having a more typical GTA goofy vibe and GTA IV having a darker starker tone.GTA IVs gunplay, driving, shopping, open world gameplay and mission structure holds up very well and all of these systrems were pretty much copied in GTA V. While most people would give GTA V a nod as one of the greatest games ever made, I would say GTA IV holds that title for me not just because of the gameplay improvements over previous games but because of the emotional and generally more realistic for GTA storyline.It should be noted that there are various technical optimization issues with GTA IV for PC which have by and large been ironed out. The DRM SecuROM associated with the games PC port along with Rockstar Social Club and GFW Live accounts needed to play the game really crippled the games acceptance on PC. I havent had any issues with these features and a Rockstar Social Club account is also used for GTA V but I can see where people are coming from regarding this. The game takes to modification very well and can look amazing given some graphical enhancement.I would say the game is worth buying! At time of writing its 6.99 so you cant very well beat that price.
