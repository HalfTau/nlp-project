Its impossible to play this singleplayerpart game offline! You have to install games for windows live and have to be online to save your gameprogress, a fact thats not mentioned on the main store page. Though it says that you should be able to create a offline profile for the xbox live thing, it is not possible at least not for me. Furthermore, though my settings are set to english language, the game itself, the rockstar gameclub and the XBox live app automatically starts up in german for me guess its because, Im in this area at the time I write this. The ingamelanguage you can change to english after searching through the menues. The legal notes in the beginning, alongside RSsocial club and XBOx live stay in german, a fact i dont know how to change....
