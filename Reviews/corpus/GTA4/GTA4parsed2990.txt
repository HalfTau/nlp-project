I love this game, but unfortunately the actions of TakeTwo Interactive require me to not recomend this game to anyone.Before I go into why, this game is amazing. From the story to the dating to the vehical control, its a work of art. I was engrossed in the socialization side quests that let you build your reputation with NPCs. That along took moments of my life I will never get back, and I regret nothing!Modding is essental to keep gamers engaged in old products, and the Grand Thef Auto Series has exploded in popularity due to the community of content creators who, in there spare time, build content for ageing games. I cannot in good conscious publish videos of a product by a company that wont allow me to mod and display the awesome modification that make the GTA series a draw for consumers, as this would encourage Take Twos aggregious behavior but finacially support a compaby that spits in the face of its fans. Companys that send out CD against their modders are in for a world of hurt, and hopeful this review will encourage you to make a decision not to buy any of the GTA series unless Take Two starts support modders instead of issuing legal summons. Rockstar, please help them understand modders love you and want your games to succeed, and without them you do not have the content you need to keep regular now a like us buying.
