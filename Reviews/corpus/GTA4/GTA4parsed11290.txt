I dont understand why Rockstar released this game at all. Bug ridden unpatched piece of garbage. If you have too modern computer with gpu which has 4 gigs of vram  you will need to find a solution how to even launch this game. Of course those problems dont exist in games tens of years older than this Rockstar masterpiece.Poor optimization even on super over the top hardware. Theres a certain critical, unpatched bug i know of that exists since the release of this game 7 years ago. It makes impossible to complete the final mission without external software help. Hell, i wont even bother to do that, because i hate bad games. Other than that its a major step backwards in every direction. RPGesque elemets of stats  gone. Stealth missions  gone. Airplanes  gone. Bicycles  gone. Meaningful customization of the main character  gone. Properties and business services to be bought and managed  gone. Parachutes  gone. Fun, crazy, over the top action packed missions  gone. 3 DRM services  check.This is the worst Grand Theft Auto ever, and its not even worth 5 on sale. Who the hell sells broken games?! You are not better than EA or Ubisoft, Rockstar.
