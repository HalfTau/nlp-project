Game runs pretty good on my system and I have no issues with GFWL. I prefer GTA 4 over atleast the PS3/Xbox360 version of GTA 5 in alot of ways. GTA 5 seemed unfinished and lacking alot of content while having particular things like car customizations and better graphics that made it better in some ways to GTA 4, also GTAO is amazing IMO and Ive spent 100s of hours on that with my PS3. I love playing GTA 4 on my PC with my mouse and keyboard because the camera always wanting to auto center its self is alot easier to counter with the mouse, granted driving motorcycles is a pain in thewithout the use of my gamepad. Everyone has played GTA in one way or another so what do I really have to say about it!? Its GTA 4 on your PC! Get it!
