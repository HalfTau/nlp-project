So recently, I thought Now that I have a powerful PC, lets try to play GTA IV again.I was greeted by Rockstar social club. I hate Rockstar social club. So I told RSC to bugger off and let me play offline.Seculauncher failed to start application. 2000I dont care what their bloody excuse is, I paid to get a god damn working game and got a buggy piece of garbage which I cant even get close to play because of crap like this.And to put a cherry on top of a giant heap of excrement, theyve forced a crappy PC port of a crappy mobile port of a barely playable PC port of GTA San Andreas upon those unfortunate to have bought GTA San Andreas on Steam.This was the last game Ill ever buy from Rockstar. Ive had it with their bullcrap. Rockstar is dead.EDITNice, Rockstar. Really nice. I can play this ripoff for TEN ENTIRE SECONDS before it crashes.Its so many years since this game was release, you could at least have bothered to patch this piece of garbage. But no, you got our dosh, so we can  off, right?Go  yourself, tar.Edit They released an update nuking scripthook. GG.
