I bought the GTA bundle, 14, only tried GTA4, it keeps freezing and crashing to desktop, I read online that many people running windows 8  8.1 have the same problem. I am on windows 8.1, so it seems that I have just wasted money. In future I will try and find out if a game is compatible before I buy it.The game itself looks good, but I would not recommend it for windows 8 users.
