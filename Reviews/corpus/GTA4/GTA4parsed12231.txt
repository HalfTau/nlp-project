This game is wonderful, but dont buy it on the PC EDIT Do not buy if you have Windows 8. You have to manually configure the game to make it compatible with Windows 8 if you have it. For some reason, to save your progress you must create a Games for Windows Live account. Which barely matters, seeing you cant start the game without GFWL if you have Windows 8. The only reason I have about 25 hours on this game is me trying to fix it/having it on an old Win 7 PC. I lost a good 20 on this game, dont waste your money.EDIT Got a PC with Windows 7. Great game if you have Win7/XP, if not, dont bother buying.
