Simply a continuation of the GTA franchise. Atmosphere graphics are improved as expected, but the rest of the game is rather disappointing. The story is dull and generic. The characters are the same as alwaysracist archetypes with little to no depth. And there is no evidence of any huge gaming improvement over San Andreas. If you already own a GTA game, theres no reason to get this, unless you have an unhealthy desire to be an Eastern European immigrant.
