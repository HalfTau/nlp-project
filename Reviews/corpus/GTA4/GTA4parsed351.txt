Not sure whats up with the mixed reviews however I heard from plenty of people that the port was awful and didnt run well, I decided to try for myself since it was on sale Im not sure if it was fixed but the game runs awesome on my PC. GTX 1080 i7 16 gb ram A few frame dips here and there however it isnt that serious. This is my favorite GTA of all time. Im only here to review the singleplayer and not the MP since Id assume the MP is dead/just modders etc. The singleplayer is phenomenal and I love how gritty it is compared to other GTA games, the characters have their own certain personalities it makes the story a lot better since youll grow to really like some of these characters/really hate them and adds a lot more to the story. Gunplay for whatever reason feels so much more realistic than GTA 5 as well as the weapon sounds are a lot more distinctive and actually sound like they pack a punch. Not to mention the ragdolls here are amazing. Shooting someone makes them hold their chest/start walking slower and crippling them instead of just straight up hitting the floor. Cops feel like a larger threat in this game which is amazing. The driving is pretty atrocious as the turning/spinning out is really exaggerated however its still manageable and can be fun but makes some missions a little tedious. Strongly recommend this game. Just as good if not better than when I played it for the 360. Now lets go bowling!
