Personnaly Ive played the heck out of this game not just on pc but on ps3 as well and I have just the best to say about it.Nice for passing your time and to entertain yourself.A little bad optimization so I wouldnt recommend it for weak systems, but overall a great game with a great story.Definetly buy it
