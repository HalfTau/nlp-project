First I was very skeptical about buying this game, because previously I wasnt able to play it on my past rigs. Im writing a positive a review, because just recently Ive done a little research and was able to start playing the game. I literally just uninstalled two programs for games for windows live, then installed the updated ones and it worked. Now Im modding the game and having a ton of fun for a game that is pretty old.
