The developers made a great game the publisher has hidden it behind trash. Worst version of GTA so far.If you get a buzz out of playing password hockey, enjoy marketing data collecting puzzles and get a kick from entering multiple email and passwords then this is the game for you. Windows Live/Xbox login thing is such great fun, not.If however you like to load a game and then get to play it within 10 minutes without having to remember passwords for accounts that have no benefit for you then drive about having fun this game is not recommended.
