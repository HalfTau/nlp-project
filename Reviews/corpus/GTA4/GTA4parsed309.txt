A great game in and of itself, it is marred by the great legacies that came before it, Vice City and San Andreas, meaning that because of the high hopes that you had, this game will fall short. It also has a lot of technical issues and the biggest turd on the planet, Games for Windows Live.The game is grey and boring to look at and runs poorly because of bad optimization. The Ballad of Gay Tony is somewhat of a saving grace.
