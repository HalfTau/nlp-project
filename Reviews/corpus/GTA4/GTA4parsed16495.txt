This is terrible Ive bought the for online gaming and I cant even login to my Games For Windows Live account. Because the GFWL in my game is an old version. It gives me a warning that, says I should update. I accept and try to update then I get connection error ALL THE TIME. No matter what I do and how I update it. I still get this damn error. WASTE OF MONEY
