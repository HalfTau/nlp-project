I like this game, the story is interesting and overall its fun to play, but the amount of work i had to do to make this run is unbelievable. I am running windows 10, beacuse of that i have major problems, the framerate is chopy and it took me a lot of hours just to get it running. I just wish that rockstar games would spend a little money to get it optimized, beacuse it feels like they just dont care anymore.
