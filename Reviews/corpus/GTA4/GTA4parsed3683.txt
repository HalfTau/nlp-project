THIS IS A ED UP GAME. I REINSTALLED THIS GAME LAST NIGHT ONTO MY COMPUTER AND WHEN I GOT UP THIS MORNING I TRIED TO LAUNCH THE GAME. AS USUAL IT WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO PLAY THE GAME AND THEIR STUPIDROCKSTAR SEVER BOX CONTINEOUSLY POPS UP ASKING ME TO LINK MY ACCOUNT WHICH I HAVE ALREADY DID. IN THE BOX IT CLEARLY SAYS  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO LINK YOUR ACCOUNT TO PLAY THIS GAME  WELL THAT IS COMPLETELY FALST AND INACCURATE AND MISLEADING TO ALL CONSUMERS. I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO GET THIS STUPIDPIECE OFGAME TO WORK ON MY COMPUTER AND NOTHING IS WORKING OUT IN MY FAVOR. I HAVE LINKED MY ACCOUNT AND STILL NOTHING. I WENT TO STEAM DIRECTLY AND LAUCHED THE GAME TO SEE HOW IT RESPONDS. WHEN THE BOX APPEARS AGAIN I CLICK PLAY GAME AND SECONDS LATER WHERE IT SHOWS THE GAME RUNNING IN MY STEAM LIBRARAY IT GOES AWAY. SO SOMETHING IS WRONG AND IT IS REALLY INGME THE HELL OFF. WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY MAKE A GAME TO MISLEAD THE CONSUMERS. THEY ARE GOING TO FIX THIS ISSUE OR I WILL BE CONTACTING A LAWYER AND BRING THIS TO A COURT ROOM BECAUSE I HAVE THE PROOF TO PROOVE THAT THEY ARE MISLEADING THE CONSUMER IN ADVERTISING THEIR GAME TO THE PUBLIC AND THEIR CHOICE OF WORDS ARE MISLEADING AND INACCURATESOMEONE HELP ME OUT GETTING THIS GAYPIECE OFGAME RUNNING
