I have played every GTA so i think i am allowed to guide you if you want to buy this gameProsGood crashesgreat varity of npcslots of missionsthe graphics are all rightpolice is very, very dumb and slowConsphisics are limitedno airplanespolice is dumb and slow which means it makes it a bit easyConclusionI would buy this game if i have finished playing gta v because this is pretty expensive for a game of this age while gta v is more recent and has better graphics. If you buy this game i reccomend you buy the ballad of gay tony with it because that was very enjoyable
