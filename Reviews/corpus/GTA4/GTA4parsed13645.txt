This one was quite hard to decide on, Whilst the game is indeed gritty and marks a rather jarring change in tone for the GTA franchise thats worth noting whether you like it or not Unfortunately didnt quite make the grade in technical terms.This definately feels like a PC Port that was pushed out on a very tight schedule, Whilst all the menus may well support mouse movement something thats sadly lacking from many ports and the graphics settings scale very well from top to bottom, the actual optimisation for this game is rather poor.In my eyes, a rig running an FX4130  4.3GHz backed with a GeForce GTX980 struggling to achieve over 24fps doesnt spell lacking hardware, but rather poor optimisation. Its a real shame to admit this but the console versions are a lot more consistent, my minimum frame rate in benchmarks flickered from 13fps to 19fps, no matter how far i tried to scale the settings.In terms of actual gameplay though?Its got a fantastic story of discovery, betrayal, disappointment and sheer grittyness thats worth playing through to the end even with the hardware difficulties, if youre after a great story buy this. If youre after a smooth, pretty title, avoid this.
