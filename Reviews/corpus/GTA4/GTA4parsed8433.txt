GTA IV is a poorly optimized PC game, it requires Rockstar Games Social Club and Games for Windows Live.But I love it to death. It works just fine on Windows 10, the online multiplayer still works and people play it.To fix GfWL and Social Club I recommend the guide Problems with opening GTAIV? SC and GFWL errors w/ fixes!. You can also play without those but you lose achievements and online so I dont recommend it.Its one of the best games ever, get it.
