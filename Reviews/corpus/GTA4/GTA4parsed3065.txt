I love GTA IV as well as GTA V as much as the next guy but one of my sole reasons for purchasing either games twice once on xbox 360 and second on pc was for the modding potential. Mods made these already great games into something of a powerhouse. With the removal of openIV purely due to TakeTwo Interactives greed and desire for money from these games One being the 4th most sold game in history I feel that I can no longer recommend this game to anyone anymore.
