Pretty stupid. Cant sign in. I know I have to do something to make it work. But what I am expecting from a game thats not in early access is that when I press play  I can play it. And thats not the case here. Instead youll have to  with socialo club and windows live and to be honest... I payed 20 euros for a game which is about 8 years old and wont start...0/10
