This is one of the most frustratingly bad game to get running on steam. I dont know why but The GFWL setup that came with this game kept giving me nightmares. I tried multiple times before finally being able to fix it. the horrible thing is that most popular internet solutions are either too tedious or didnt work. GFWL straight up wouldnt install it would say installed but the folders would be empty this messed up a few other games of mine too. Finally I removed, deleted the contents of GFWL and installed the one that came with an old setup of dirt game. which finally worked. Its a shame cause th game feels really great. I have played through it multiple times with tons of mods with a disc based version of it. he funny thing is. Piracy version of it runs far better and is much easier to install than this crap. I hope this info was useful for anyone facing similar issue. Im only criticizing the steam  GFWL service not the game itself. The game is really a master piece.
