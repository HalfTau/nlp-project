I buy legal copies precisely to avoid the need to go to forums, follow tutorials on how to fix game launch errors, having to download third party crapware, having to look up and install old versions of c redistributable trash... This game wont run on Windows 10. Could I eventually find the right solution and fix it? probably, but I wont do it because I shouldnt have to. An official fix/update from the developers would be great to simply install, click  play on newer OS, but that wont happen. I understand it was released on 2008, but I have even older games that run just fine so IMO thats no excuse. I bought it. Tried to run it. Error message. Uninstall. Ask for refund.
