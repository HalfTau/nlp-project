This is one of the most serious grand theft autos there is. You really take the role of Niko Bellic in a way that seems plausible in real life. The driving isnt all arcadey and fun in comparison to GTAV and the story is of a more serious tone. That said, the gameplay is still enjoyable and the satire is as entertaining as always.
