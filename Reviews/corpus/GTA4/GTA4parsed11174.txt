I am at a loss for words on how ridiculously difficult it is to start this game. I mean, seriously, wtf? Create a log in, ok, log in failed. Are you freaking kidding me? Play the game offline, ok, it defulst to a lame resolution and you cant make any adjustments unless you get online.  I am totally annoyed at this point and if this is whay GTA V is going to be like on PC, I will have to pass.
