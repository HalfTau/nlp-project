A perfect junkction of art and technology!Despite being released back in 2008 GTA IV has the most impressing ingame physics. Picking figts with pedestrians, getting into shootouts with police or simply cruising around Liberty City in a vehicle will make you wow and then scratch your head around how come up in 2013 gta 5 cant match its predecessor in many departments when being looked more closely uponwatch a YouTube video called GTA IV is better than GTA V for more information on that matter.Generally speaking the game itself represents the good timessince 2011 most AAA games is a pitful parody of what they could have been when upon being released games turned out to be even better than you expected.If it wasnt up to R giving zero s about supporting this game after 2010 thus not addressing terrible optimization and DRM issues this masterpiece of a game whouldnt have been so overshined by its successor.
