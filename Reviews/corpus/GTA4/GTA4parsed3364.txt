Note Im reviewing Grand Theft Auto IV Complete Edition, not just the main game.Pros Amazing stories and characters across all three games. Very immersive and detailed world to explore All sorts of little things to do when youre not causing chaos or playing through the storyWonderful voice acting and writing across the board GTA Radio expands into television, with shows like Republican Space Rangers, Princess Robot Bubblegum, and others Decent port after the late2016 patch was releasedCons There are still some issues with the PC Port, such as GFWL and SecuROM still being in place 100 only gets you infinite ammo which you still have to purchase at AmmuNation Friend system can get annoying very quickly Driving/flying controls are wonky. For example, driving cars feels more like driving a boatLove It or Hate It/ The stories in IV and TLAD can be too depressing and almost nihilistic, which may be a turnoff for some people/ The soundtrack is a lot more niche than previous GTA games, which were mostly comprised of nothing but hits from whatever era the game was set in. Its not a bad soundtrack by any means, but it may not be for everyoneOverall, I highly reccomend Grand Theft Auto IV Complete Edition. It may not be as great as San Andreas or V, but it is worth the money.
