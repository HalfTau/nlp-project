Im lucky, I got it running on Windows 10.GTA IV is a gem. If it runs, its totally worth your time and money.First of all, its a brilliant singleplayer game. If you want multiplayer go for GTA Online, as it is miles better and works.It is kind of surprising, that a game released in 2008 feels still quite fresh. Things arent particulary great if you are after graphics, but the engine and gameplay make it really like REALLY enjoyable even in 2017. Story is absolutely brilliant, attention to detail is absolutely brilliant, cutscenes are absolutely brilliant, shooting is absolutely brilliant, driving is absolutely brilliant.If only there was more bowling.
