GTA IV was a great game, like any other GTA Game, and by that I mean GTA V, GTA IV, San Andreas and every GTA before. I only bought GTA IV on Steam, so I can only review that.The Publishers AND Producers of this game DO NOT KNOW how to treat their community AT ALL, and made it hard for their community to still like them. But since they went complete Nazi with restricting OpenIV, this game is dead, as well as GTA V.R.I.P. Grand Theft Auto IVR.I.P Grand Theft Auto VR.I.P TakeTwo  Rockstar GamesI liked you Niko Bellic.
