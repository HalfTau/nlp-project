2nd best Grand Theft Auto in my opinion, before Vice City. yes I know, SA is a very close thirdProsFantastic storyMature toneWellwritten characters, specifically NikoImmersive, detiled game worldGreat second partSmall details put into mapSoundtrackThe antagonistCover systemA.I.Ragdoll physicsRealistic physics engine and drivingDark, Gritty tone in the overall gameConsGames for Windows LiveRecent loss of mod supportPoor optimizationSlightly repetitive missionsBelow par 1st actAimed mostly only for mature, story focused gamersToneddown customization optionsCharacter inconsistencies in NikoWhile friendships help flesh out characters, they can be somewhat annoyingTLDR, Even with its flaws, Grand Theft Auto IV is an extremely solid game, and is better than Grand Theft Auto V in my own personal opinion. I recommend it for mature gamers that prioritize story over gameplay and not ridiculous things such as an empty map, three empty caricatures for protagonists, or a story trying too hard to entertain like a certain overrated sandbox game I know.Then again, thats just my own silly personal opinion.Edit 1 Grand Theft Auto IV was recently updated, effectively shutting down multiplayer.Edit 2 OpenIV a popular modding tool used for GTA IV and V was recently shut down by TakeTwo following a cease and desist. DO NOT buy this or Grand Theft Auto V for mods.Edit 3 Nomintated for Moms Spaghetti Award for Steam Awards 2017. Its that mesmerizing.
