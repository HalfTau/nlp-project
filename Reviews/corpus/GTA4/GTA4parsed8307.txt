Literally no longer playable due to DRM and Windows Live garbage.In the case that you manage to somehow start the game up, it does not get past the loading screen.By far the most disappointing purchase Ive made on steam and the most poorly optimized PC port of a game ever made. Rockstar refuses to fix it, and until they do, you should not buy this game.
