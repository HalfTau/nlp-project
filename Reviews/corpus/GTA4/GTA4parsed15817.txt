A classic in the series, a very good PC release of the game despite the waiting time.The story was paced well enough, there are plenty of side quests and progress packages to collect and a fair arsenal of weapons.Decent enough multiplayer, typical Rockstar humour and innovative engine and graphically wise for the series at the time of release.The DLC for the series is worth playing as well after finishing the game.GTA IV at its best would be with the Ballad Of Gay Tony DLC.
