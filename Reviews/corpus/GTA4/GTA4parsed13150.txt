The game is a hassle for any regular computer user. Its difficult to install. Once installed you must install directx9, install other requirements for game, update windows live marketplace, and sign in. The game itself might have unsolvable lag, mainly because the game was orginally for windows xp, and not windows 7, or 8. Unfortunantly for me this happened.  My recommendation is, if you have an xbox play it on there. Downloading these types of games off of steam are just not worth it.
