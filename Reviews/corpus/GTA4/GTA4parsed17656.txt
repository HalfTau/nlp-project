Brilliant game with 100s of hours of potential gameplay, also the modding scene is still active so you can add to the playing time. I have had some issues with it, where I have to run it with commands that do not limit any hardware. Though this is understandable as the game coming up to be 6 years old now. Also the visuals arent anything mind boggling but you look past this as you escape the police because you punched an old woman in the face. I would definatly recommend this game.
