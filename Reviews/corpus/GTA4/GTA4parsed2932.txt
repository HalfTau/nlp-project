I never reviewed this as I really had to no reason to given reviews pretty much covered what the game was like.Now I find out about Open IV has gotten a cease and desis order I feel compelled to share what I think...The game itself is hit or miss on the story depending on your view and so is some of the game play but that could be over looked because mods breath new life in the game,or they did up until this week.The thing that boggles me the most is why did they do this for GTA IV?What are they losing by modding GTA IV?It has been going on since like 2008 with this program now all of sudden they care?So now thanks to GTA V and R greedy bottom line we can not mod IV good thing it will still be easy to find said program.This just shows the true colors of the greed and now makes me wonder why I preordered RDR 2.I get they have the right but why do it?I mean clearly these resources could have been put to use to actually make a decent anticheat for V or could have used Denuvo which would have prevented use of trainers ect.Yeah so much for there we are for modding and willl not ban for single player mods So now we can not mod single player anymore then what is the point of mods at all.This really does little to deter modding from a cheating stand point as people can still use the current program to mod files just no new features or updates so bravo R your idiot lawyers did nothing to stop the real issue!
