Had issues with performance on this game in my old FX3600 PC, but now I am running a Ryzen 3 1200 overclocked with the same gtx 960 4 gb that I had in my old system I am noticing huge performance improvments, game still runs bad in some scenes and senarios sometimes dropping to 20 FPS or less whilst mid mission. Overall I love this game, I had it on the Xbox 360 years back and wanted to play it again to relive the experience.
