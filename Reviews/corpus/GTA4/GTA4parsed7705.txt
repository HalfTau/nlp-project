I dont know what is the difference between this version of GTA IV and a cracked one from torrent.I replaced so many files and uninstalled/reinstalled so many versions of Windows Live trying to get this to work,but with no luck. If you have Windows 8 or above it wont work or at least you will have alot of difficulties making it to work. For me...didnt even launch.Dont buy this,the game is broken.I can say the same about Grand Theft Auto Episodes From Liberty City.Update After many hours I managed to start the game only to find another 2 issues with this game.But let me tell you a funny story first, it seems my Windows Live password was too long for the ingame authenticator.Ive changed my password to a shorter one and after that the game started freezing my pc when trying to sign in. Good Job Microsoft!The game is poorly optimized too,which means you will encounter lots of stuttering.GTA V runs much better than this.I cannot recommend this game on PC. If you want it, get it on console.Despite its technical problems,the game has a good plot.The game is good,BUT not on PC
