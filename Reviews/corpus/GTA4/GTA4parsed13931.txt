Waste of money. Uses SecuRom DRM which is known to be problematic and Windows Live makes it even moreso. Have tried every fix and cannot get this game to work on my Windows 8.1 system. Steam should refuse to carry games that will not work due to third party DRM issues. Will never buy another Rockstar game.UPDATE Finally got the game working after deleting Windows Live and reinstalling a couple of times and making a few other changes that I cant recall at the moment. This should not be necessary, however. This issue has been known to exist for quite some time and a patch should have been made available or Live should have been removed as a requirement from the PC version. For this to be actively on sale for PC and and have such problems is irresponsible of the developer and publisher. I will never buy another Rockstar game as this has made me leary of their concerns for their customer base. Customers should always be concerned about a company who takes their money but refuses to fix a bugged, broken or problematic product.
