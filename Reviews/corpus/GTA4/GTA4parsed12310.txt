Pretty awesome game! I like how immersive the game is and the fact that even though is a 2008 game, the graphics are still very beautiful. You have many, many, many things to do in the city and many places to explore. It doesnt have as many missions as Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, but its still a lot. I recommend it very much, Ive played it a lot and I still do sometimes, because of the giant amount of mods that you can install in the game.I didnt play the multiplayer because it doesnt have any players and the game modes are very poor and not interesting, if compared to San Andreas Multiplayer. LIVE is VERY ANNOYING but you can always download a mod to disable it, so its okay.Besides that, awesome game, and I cant wait for GTA V to be released, I will definetely preorder.9.0/10 A masterpiece, but not perfect because of the bad multiplayer.
