Gta 4 wasnt just a game, it wasnt just another sequel, it was a legacy.It revolutionized the GTA series. If you dont already have gta 4, dont get it, its too late. Unless you are too poor to buy GTA 5, then i would suggest purchasing this game. Its worth way more hours than what I have logged into it. I havent played it much due to the port being terrible. With less than a month left until gta 5 I have to say that gta 4s time is now up. I hate to retire it but it was truly amazing and I am glad that I played it.
