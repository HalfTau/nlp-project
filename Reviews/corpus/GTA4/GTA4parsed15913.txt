Still better than watchdoges.EDIT Even thought I havent played WatchDogs, for me gta 4 will remain one of the best sandbox games on the market, with its huge moding community, interesting and fun storyline, characters that you will love and hate. Like Nico and Roman. That WatchDogs will probably never have.
