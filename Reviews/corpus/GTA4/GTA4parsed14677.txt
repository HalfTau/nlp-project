well i guess its not worth writing a big review explaining GTA. A special corner for GTA in my heart and mind though I was really disappointed with Rockstar as it is the worst port and so many of DRM services hooked which makes the game really crappy sometimes but I gotta say excellent storyline and they have focused on every minute details. A big thumbs up from my side and I even tried out the multiplayer which is fun too
