I would rate this game an overall 6/10 because mainly if someone has got a lower PC specs than like a quad core atleast then they are going to struggle with running the game. That is because it was badly converted from xbox/PS3 to PC in the first place. That said I still have some bad news for you. 6 out of 10 people experience an unfixable bug like me to do with finishing the game  In the last mission no spoilers here, you have to do something like climbing somewhere and when you press Space to climb, your camera changes to the side, not performing the action of climbing. Eventually you end up falling to death and being unable to finish the game.The bad things said, overall I do like the game, its very long and there are lots of sub missions.
