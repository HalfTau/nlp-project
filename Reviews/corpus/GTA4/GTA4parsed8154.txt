Read the reviews, and like many others i thought i could get it to run somehow like i could find something no one else could find. Well I was wrong, apparently Games For Windows Live does not install correctly. This makes it so that you cannot activate the game. I also have a copy on disc, which also wont activate. So im not sure if the game is completely screwed or not. Im running windows 8.1 for the record. A couple features did work however, which include the Uninstall button, and the Request Refund button. Do not buy.
