This was the first GTA I ever played. As a young kid i remember going to my friends house and playing this game. I beat this game once on the xbox 360 and im trying to complete it again on PC with mods Multiplayer is fun but would be even more fun if more people played it. It sucks that 12 year old CoD nerds are saying that the older gta games are terrible and that GTA V is the only good GTA game. Wrong, I like all GTA games, I even did a playthrough of GTA SA, GTA VC and GTA V on my youtube channel. If you like gta then buy this game.
