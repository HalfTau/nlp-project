Well, thats the most realistic game of the Grand Theft Auto series in my opinion with a lot of charismatic characters, an interesting storyline and a funny gameplay, which doesnt get boring after hours of playing. The physics and graphics are terrific for its own time 2008. But the coolest thing in that game is the atmosphere.9.5 / 10
