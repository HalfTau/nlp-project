I bought this piece of  game with all the money I spent months earning by selling those damn things in the inventory and after all my efforts I found that I wasted my time buying this crap because it simply does not work. Now its not like buying it from game or something and finding it does not work only to then take it back and get refund oh no no no thats it poof your moneys gone so take my advice if you are thinking about buying this game DO NOT BUY IT you will end up insanely regretting it. P.s I was earning 5p a piece by selling those things.
