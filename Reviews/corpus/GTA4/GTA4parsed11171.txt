Runs about as well as a potato trying to power a porchlight on my best. Hp envy with amd graphics card, 12gb ram, windows 8.1, quadcore processorWhoever says pc gaming is master race has never tried to play GTA IV on pc before. Please, save your frustration, and buy a used copy for your XB360 or PS3. Every 23 seconds my screen slightly lags, and Im playing single player, on a very low resolution.It sucks really, that this game still lags, even at its lowest settings. Im not sure if its the Rockstar Social Club, or GFWL, or windows 8.1, but Ive played smoother games before. This one will take a lot of patience, if youve already made the splurge to get it. Its like a mixed bag you win a little, you lose just as much or more. In this case, if you buy it on sale, Im sure the money saved will barely make the game worth the frustration.Also, Im using the commandline.txt and still see little to no difference.Its a shame really, I thought this would be hilarious to play, because I got a good chuckle from Roman, but sadly, the best thing you can do is steer clear of this one.
