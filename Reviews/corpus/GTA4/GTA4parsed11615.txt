To everyone complaining about Games for Windows Live, listen! You can just make an offline account. I have done this already with Resident Evil 5 and Dead Rising 2, and it worked just as well with GTA IV. Ive been able to play it fine, as well as save.My biggest problem with the game is how poorly optimized it is for PC. It lags and studders, especially while driving. However, if you can get past this, then youll be treated to one of Rockstars best games in my opinion.
