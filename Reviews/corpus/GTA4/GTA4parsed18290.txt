Worse than GTA 5 in every way but until thats released on the PC, this will have to do.Theres something magical about the GTA series that transforms peaceful adults / children / pensioners into murderous psychopaths. There are hundreds of well thoughtout and diverse missions to complete, though lets be honest nobody really cares about them that much. The real magic with GTA happens when you explore the city and get sidetracked by something small that quickly escalates into a 4star police chase with dozens of casualties. I cant help myself, and I dont know anybody who can!The gameplay is clunky and the graphics are blocky, though the sheer scale and ambition of this game more than compensates. The PC version is a fairly lousy port. You have some additional graphics options but it isnt well optimised and you have to log in to 3 THINGS before you can play the game! Steam, Rockstar Social and Windows Live. At its launch it was also horribly buggy and I lost many a save from stupid game crashes and corruptions. Most of that is now sorted out, so theres probably not been a better time to play this game whilst waiting for the farsuperior 5th instalment to be released.No other series can come close to matching what the GTA series pulls off. Although controversial, the game has a sense of humour and is surprisingly likeable for a game that wants you to kill lots of innocent people. Perhaps its because the game can be played so peacefully. You can slowly drive about while listening to the hundreds of music tracks on offer, playing occasional games of pool or bowling. You can go get drunk in a bar and stumble about probably the best use of the freeform animation system, EVER or you can go and watch a comedy act. Its a living, breathing city where death and destruction are only ever seconds away.
