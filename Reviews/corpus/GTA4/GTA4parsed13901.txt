GTA IV offers a suprisingly large world to play in for the sake of doing the same stuff over and over again.  This game, honestly, is the first game that i actually didnt look forward to playing after each gaming session.  Although the look of the game itself is impressive and the freedom of choice/availabilty to online matches is adequate, the state of the campaign is a trainwreck.This is a summary of every mission layout in the gameRoman/Jamaican dude needs picked uppark outside some house and wait for a shootout/getaway chaseget thanked and get told to come back another time for the same goddamn mission.Im a big fan of the GTA series and most Rockstar works, for that matter, but this mess of a game lowered my expectations for future works.Overall, dont buy unless you enjoy looking forward to being bored  4/10
