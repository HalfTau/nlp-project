Want an amazing, yet hilariously bad PC port? A game that offers a mix of sometimes beautiful visuals, mediocre online play and an interesting, yet repetitive story line? look no further!On a serious note, the pc version of gta4 is possibly the most enjoyable moddablle game ive played in a very long time. The physics apparently abide by a completely different set of laws and, yes the multiplayer is plagued with obnoxious elitist who think theyre somehow the gods of pc modding for installing a native trainer, but even when taking that and the horrific social club into consideration... this is game is actually annoyingly addictive.
