What else could you expect othen than an excellent game coming from one of the bestselling game series ever? GTA IV opens up a new era for the series, with new characters, new physics, new graphics and new gameplay, but the same spirit that made it successfull from over 15 years. In my opinion, the game could count with some other abilities features present on past games, like driveable planes from San Andreas and the option to build your own empire from Vice City and Vice City Stories. But it comes with some amazing new things that fill that space, like the new vigilante system and multiplayer. While The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony put the game in two new perspectives, one from the bike gangs and the other from an exgangster who now works for the rich and powerful.
