When I tried to play this game, I was treated with the Rockstar Social Club sign in. I did and nothing happened. After around a month, I discovered that I needed Games for Windows Live. When I finally found the download for it, I tried to play the game. All I got was an endless loop of character artwork and the main theme of the game. I couldnt even get to the main menu.Buying this game for the PC is like setting a 20 bill on fire.
