You need to log in  Social Club to start the game and after you have to log in in another account windows live to save it. Is the first time in my life i play a game in solo missions and i need to log in to an inernet account to save it, crazy. And once you have created the account you have to a link this account with an other player account... going to the bank seems easier than all that crap.Windows Live Games is the worst idea ive ever seen. Dont buy it, buy Saints Row the Third or IV and have fun without interruptions
