Easily the worst of the GTA series.Pros Graphics are niceCons Too many missions have gimmics that you are not warned about. You basically have to guess what they want you to do via trial and error. Nothing to do with money. In previous GTA games, you could invest in businesses, and/or buy safehouses. Here? You can just buy guns and ammo. Thats it. The safehouses are boring. Theres just a little street parking, and thats it. None of the variety that the previous games had. No garages or anything. Its almost an afterthought. I want to throw the g d cell phone in the bay. You are constantly bombarded with useless crap while youre trying to get to the next mission. Worst decision in gaming history. This game has the worst radio stations. Yeah, its an opinion, deal with it. The story is pretty weak. Its basically all go an kill this person/people. Repeat. It doesnt feel nearly as cohesive or fun as the previous games. The character development is easily the worst as well.
