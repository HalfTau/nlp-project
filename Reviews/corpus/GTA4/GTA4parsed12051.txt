After a fair bit of playing this game, I thought Id write an honest review about it almost unheard of with me.A lot of people are saying how GFWL has broken this game and how it is the main reason to not buy this game. Honestly, GFWL doesnt affect my gameplay nor should it affect yours. I have gotten GFWL to work from the first day, but I never use it because literally no one plays multiplayer on this game anymore. So, therefore, GFWL is not needed.Also, people are saying that the PC version of this is broken. No, its not. So far, I have seen no extra bugs from what the other platforms already have with the exception of one  the fact that if you have a graphics card with 2GB or more for video memory, GTA IV is not going to pick it up. All you have to do is create a commandline.txt file in the game directory increasing the availablevidmem size. A lot of people dont know this and therefore, label the game as broken.My computer has a nVidia GeForce 830m with 2GB of graphics, and it runs like a dream on the highest settings.The number one reason I bought this game was to mod it with the LCPDFR mod. But since then, I have installed multiple mods and it makes the gameplay twice as fun as with no mods. I have also clocked the game three times as I really enjoy the storyline. For me personally, its a game that will never get old.The computer I have used to help with this reviewHP Pavilion 15P008TU laptopIntel Core i5  2.6Ghz processornVidia GeForce 830m graphics card8GB DDR3 memoryWin8.1 64bitNot a lot is required to run this game, as I could run it on medium graphics on a machine that was three times as weaker as this one above, using Win7 64bit.I legitimetely think this is a great game and I would seriously recommend it to anyone who is looking for an awesome game with a great storyline and freeplay as well as good modding capabilty.
