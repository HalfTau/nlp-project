I have this game on DVD.  But at 5 I figured I could save having to dig the disk out whenever I needed to install it on a new PC.  How wrong I was.At first I also couldnt edit the graphics settings, was stuck on 800x600.  This can be fixed by putting the following options into Game Properties  Set Lauch Options nomemrestrict norestrictionsHowever, the bigger problem is Games for Windows Live.GFWL no longer works and will be shut down by Microsoft in 2014.  I cant sign in with my existing profile, it fails when I try to create a new one.  So basically, you cannot save ANY progress in the campaign, making the game useless.When I try to play offline, the game crashes.In summary, this is a complete disaster.  This is the third game Ive bought on Steam recently that has been unplayable, or has major issues.  Steam is rapidly losing my respect, things used to just work, now its a crapshoot as to whether anything will.There is no sign of Rockstar removing the GFWL from this title, so I would AVOID this title.  In fact, it should be REMOVED from the Steam store, as it simply no longer works.
