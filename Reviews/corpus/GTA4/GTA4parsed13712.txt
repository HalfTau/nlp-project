My no has more to do with the glitches in the game  must run as administer instead of through Steam, must be logged into Windows Live to load properly, and the final mission of course, right? was bugged  some controller issue or something that doesnt register you getting into the helicopter so you can proceed. So about 2025 hours invested and I hung it up without being able to see the end which I never do.The game itself was okay. Better main character development, couple of good core characters, lots of bad sterotypical  ones, but left you feeling like you knew the main character well enough towards the end. I was not a fan of a failed mission restart which makes you go all the way back to the quest intro instead of any quick save or at least dropping you at the mission start. Made driving around the city tedious instead of the fun it was in past games in all the different rides.Loved the radio stations and the online portions were lots of fun  basically everything that was wrong with the internet in the 2000s is summed up here.
