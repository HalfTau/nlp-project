way too much DRM bs to jump through just to play this game. not only is it tied to steam, but you also need a rockstar social club account and an account on the horrible cancer that is windows live. isnt one DRM service enough? WHY DO I HAVE TO HAVE 3 DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS, ON 3 DIFFERENT SERVICES JUST TO PLAY ONE FREAKING GAME!?!?!?!?! WHY!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
