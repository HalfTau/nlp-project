Spent 3 hours so far trying to get this ing thing to work.If you want to try to play the game heres what youre up against.1. Game wont start up when you try to run it.2. Game wont let you change the graphic settings, it WILL be stuck on the lowest qualities This isnt a bug its seriously just putting a cap on your computer for some god forsaken reason.3. You will have to create a windows live account. It will ask for your phone number.4. You will be stuck on the first loading screen for the game.5. When you load the first scene nico will be floating in ing space. Im questioning if this will happen to other cutscenes or not im not bothering to look into it.6. When you fix the above the game wont run with steam so you wont be able to change the graphical settings AGAIN making full circle.These are all fixable, but you know what, I dont think its worth anyones effort to try and fix these issues, because this port is just THAT BAD. It has taken me 3 HOURS, including about an hour of gameplay according to the steams timer.I dont care if its 5 sheckles, I could of made 30 sheckles at work in this amount of time with less stress and frustation.
