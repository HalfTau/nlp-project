Great game, I have never tried the mods because Im scared it might mess up my Gta4 file but, Im willing to try to it one day. I like that the graphics are really polished for the pc, with occasional gltiches and the you can see really far into Libery City with the right settings. If you havent experienced this game, or maybe want to try this console counterpart, then please do so, the story is cool, with some funny parts in the script, voice acting is superb but it seems that comes with all RockStar games. I recommend the three pack though, and also try to find the sentinal Gt, it is the best car in the game, look for that in the third island. Happy gaming!
