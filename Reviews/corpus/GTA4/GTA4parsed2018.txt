Good game. Its fun as a sandbox even with no mods, but mods do make it 100 times better. The story is pretty good, Id say about an 8/10. The story can get boring at times, but its pretty enthralling overall.ProsFun as a sandboxDecent storyHey Niko, its Roman, lets go bowling!Runs pretty smoothly after a launch option is setMultiplayer is goodConsHad to set a launch option to get it to be playable, I believe its something like availablevidmemvideo memory Only have to do that on cards with a gigabyte or more of VRAM I believe.Take Two is garbageI dont have so much of an issue with this, but it makes you use Games for Windows LIVE.Overall, I like this game. Would recommend.
