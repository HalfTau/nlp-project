The worlds premier violent crime simulator is at it again. Is this one as good as GTAIII, SA or Vice City? Well... yes and no.On a personal level, I dont think I liked GTA IV. Its a very grey game in all senses of the word.Liberty City 2.0 is a surprisingly joyless place  all the hysterical guff you encounter, be it in the form of radio banter or maniacal characters, doesnt work in the same way it used to in offsetting the terribleness of the crime. GTA IV turns out to be surprisingly grim.If you were to bullet point the main parts of the story you would think mmm, sounds alright!, and thats all well and good, but the narrative, the way the story is told, is so up and down and all over the place that the actual experience of playing through the game becomes quite disconnected from the overall message and, in places, such as the infamous going bowling with roman friendship activities, laborious.Why am I recommending it then? Well... Its GTA. Theres nothing else like it. Its an extremely high quality crime sandbox with a plethora of visual and mechanical upgrades over its predecessors.Driving is improved, feeling more weighty and requiring more precision than the pedaltothemetal handbrake turn madness of the old games. Shooting and using cover all works as intended and the whole phone interface is really cool.The PC port seems fine, though requiring GFWL in order to save is a bit of a bummer. I played with a joypad so cant comment on Mouse  Keyboard controls.Overall, for me at least, this one didnt improve on the previous games for story and could have used some more mission variety, but the core gameplay is modernised and it was, for the most part, fun to play.
