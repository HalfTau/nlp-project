Grand Theft Auto IV is such a great game, which has a great story and gameplay. Youre playing as Niko Bellic, that visits his cousin Roman in Liberty City. Niko wants to start a fresh new life, but doesnt go like he expected. He starts to work for everyone that pays, and ends out in a lot of troubles.The Voice Acting and Graphics is great, there is nothing to complain about there. Its a old game from 2008, so of course the graphis might not be the best. But theyre stil really great. You can also download mods to the game, to make the game look even better.Also all the missions is very fun, there is always something to do. Even when  youre not on a mission, there is so much fun to do.Besides the good things, Grand Theft Auto IV is full of issues. Video Settings thats stuck, crashes, bugs, glitches and the last mission that cant be completed. Issues like this, should really be fixed. I used atleast 45 minutes to find a fix for all these issues, but thats also why I have made a list of the issues, and how to fix them. Clickto see the guide.To save the game and activate the game, youll have to install and register the game through Windows Live Marketplace which really is a mess. It takes so long time, because youll have to register a Windows Live Account, Xbox Account and then youll have to setup a Gamertag. You should really not go through all these things, just to play the story mode. That was really frustrating. But when you finally gets it to work, its a great experience!Of course its recommended, but be aware of these issues!7/10
