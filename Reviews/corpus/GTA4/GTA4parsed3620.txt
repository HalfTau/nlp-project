I love GTAIV, I have it originally for PlayStation 3, however, the PC version by all means is just as good.My only problem is Rockstars HORRIFIC Social Club launchers. Gta4/5 both have it,  its just aweful  extremely annoying when it does not want to login/register. I dont know what the deal with that is, asides for either bad service or programming but it really bugs me out when I would like to play.Asides for that the game is extremely fun,  I do recommend it. There will be modded players here or there in Multiplayer,  any other gamemode asides for Freemode is usually completely dead, I still do recommend the game for both the campaign  multiplayer experience.TLDR The game is quite fun, I do recommend it, fantastic campaign  a somewhat nice multiplayer mode.
