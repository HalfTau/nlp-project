GTA IVICEnhancer  GTA6, thats the basic math. Id recommend a slew of other mods as well, like the one that makes the cars actually drivable! Make sure you bring your overclocking utility for your CPU and GPU as all these mods can bring even well specd machines to their knees. The game is great, and while its no GTA V, its still very enjoyable to revisit  the graphics, setting, missions, and characters all add up to a world class AAA game that has few equals even years after its release.
