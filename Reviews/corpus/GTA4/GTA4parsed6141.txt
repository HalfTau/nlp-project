There is cloud saves Missions repetitive for those who cant understand english, but it is intresting story for those who like story.Game crashes on changing settings I play on potato.Main menu game start looks like Rockstar games web stub, because they stuck with microsoft garbage.Social club connectivity is very bad, but after 2 years I installed GTA4 again and it did not required any logins anymore.This game could be great meat for creating and expanding IVMP isnt this project dead ?, but game should have better optimization. GTA4 runs faster, but combat, driving is more realistic in GTA4.It doesnt have that good soundtrack comparing with GTASA, except loading music  its majestic.All in all, this game is lost and the damned for R, but still pretty good for highend stolymaining players.
