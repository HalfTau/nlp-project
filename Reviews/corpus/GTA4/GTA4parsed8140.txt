I just bought this game last night. When first logging on it takes a long time to create additional accounts and verify everything multiple times. This doesnt work well with me because I am impatient and I just wanted to get on some GTA and play. I log in through my multiple accounts and then try to verify my code that steam automatically inputs when you buy through them. It is telling me the code is invalid. How did I just buy a game off of steam and the key is invalid? Really? Garbage! Dont buy this game unless you want to pay money to never be able to save your progress.
