Well im sure this game is good but im thumbing it down because I cant play currently because I dont remember my GFWL password and I need that to save and the password recovery site is down.This uses two DRMs one for Multiplayer and Games For Windows Live which makes Uplay look like a chocolate cake. You have to log into both to play this, that is unless you pirate it which is what I should have done if I would have known this DRM was on here. That will teach me to read the negative reviews before I impulse buy. Happened with Batman as well.
