I still remember Vice and San Andreas, so as a GTA fan i really wanted to like this game. Though it is still a decent game i cannot in good consciense recommend it.On the positive side, it still has the Gta traditions of crazy missions and even crazier people. It also boasts more radio stations and better shooting mechanics.However this is all megated by poor graphics and many, many problems, from slow downs to slow graphic loadings. Worst of all, the driving mechanic feels really bad to me. The brakes barely work and cars slide far too much.To me, this game was a big disappointment.Btw i should note, that while my PC is not progamer class, it is still a fairly good one and was sufficient to run many other heavier games, so the problem is not on my side.
