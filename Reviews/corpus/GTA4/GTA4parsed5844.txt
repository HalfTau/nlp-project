What can you even say about gta 4 other than how incredibly important it is as an open world sandbox game that hasnt been said?Anyway, this port is absolutely horrendous, I have tried so much to get the game working, and I did! And you can play it! And it works! Up until the end of the ing game where theres a QTE and it becomes literally impossible to beat. I can excuse how much effort it took to run, I can excuse gfwl because its easy to get rid of, I can excuse social club because you can just ignore it, but I cant ignore the fact that the game is BROKEN BEYOND PLAYABILITY IN THE FINAL MISSION OF THE GAME. I thought I was just bad, but apparently a bunch of people have this same issue. Do not buy this uglyport, thanks.
