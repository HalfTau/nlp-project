This game, despite it being over 5 years old, is still one of the best games that Rockstar has ever made. It has endless replayability thanks to the modding community. The graphics can be made to look at least 10x better than some AAA titles that have come out in 2013. You are able to change the game in such as a way that you can more or less design something that is unique every time you play. Although the game is not without its flaws, game saves are link to one machine and cant be synced thanks to Games for Windows Live, extremely difficult to join a friends game and not end up disconnected and the worst one by far is the ridiculous amount of DRM protection on this game. Although if you remove GFWL you can at least launch the game quicker and save to a much easier to find location, this is also useful if you to play on another computer as you do not have to start the game from scratch. Aside for those, it is still one of my all time favourite games.
