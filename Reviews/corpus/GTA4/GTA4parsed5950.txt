I used to play the console version of GTA IV and everything worked fine, but when I play this version I cant even get to the title screen. Turns out in order to play GTA IV you may need a really beefy PC, which I dont own. My friend actually bought this game for me as a gift and I kind of feel bad because he wasted money on something I cant play, if anything dont get this version of GTA IV, its just not stable. But I do reccomend this game, its probably my favorite in the GTA series.
