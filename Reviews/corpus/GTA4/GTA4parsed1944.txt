The first class that I ever played in this game was the Scout. When I started playing with the Scout, I didnt like him much because he was a very hasty class. After about 50 hours in, I was finally able to get 3 kills without dying! This is epic, I thought to myself at the time not knowing what I got myself into. Ofcourse naturally, like everyother human being on this planet, I got addicted to this game and I even started skipping school inorder to play this game for hours upon hours upon hours!Now here I am, with my dear friend broken English, writing this review. I regret nothing!Best 1000 hours of my life.
