Grand Theft Auto IV is the most amazing GTA game I have played so far the story is excellent and Liberty City is just a beautiful location to explore. The games plot is fantastic and will get you hooked into it immediately most of the games missions are quite challenging but they really get you hooked in because after you finish the mission you will wonder what will happen next?.The multiplayer is marvelous just like in singleplayer you still in Liberty City and you can invite your friends to play gamemodes like cops and robbers with you, customize your character and all the locations in the single player is still accessible in multiplayer and all the features are still retained from the single player.The open world is fantastic exploring the huge Liberty City is great fun there are many things to do but in order to explore the world you must finish the game first or else some parts of the city will not be available for you to access. I think GTA IV is a great improvement over the old GTA games and I would still recommend you get the other GTA games as well because they are just as interesting and fun as GTA IV and they will be a great addition to your collection. So I really recommend you get this game it will blow you away!
