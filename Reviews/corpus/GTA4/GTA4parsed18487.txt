GTA 4 is probably the worst game you can get on pc. i cant believe that rockstar actually released this without it working properly. seriously, on my pc i can play Battlefield 3 on ultra settings with 30fps but when i attempt to play GTA4 with all settings low and off i literally get 23 fps. this game is unplayable and rockstar owes us all.
