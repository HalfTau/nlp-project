This version of the game is a big badly ported piece of I wasted my money buying and I cant even play it properly. You are required to login into a dead Microsoft service, also I cant even change the game resolution because it keeps pushing buttons by it self, in the main menu for example it took a bunch of screenshots because for some reason it thought that my Steam screenshot button was being pressed. Simply a terrible port, I wouldnt recomend this game to a friend at least not trough Steam.
