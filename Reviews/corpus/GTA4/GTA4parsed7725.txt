I was able to open it the first time without the need of that Social Club account, but after I had exited to try and fix my controller set up, multiple computer restarts involved mind you, and I go to make an account this time and log in, nothing.Absolutely nothing happened.Waste of money. I really was looking forward to playing it too. Sigh.
