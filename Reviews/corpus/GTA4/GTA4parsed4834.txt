This game has been the reason I play Rockstars games in the first place. It has been the core of open world games for me and it will keep living that on. This game has a great story, in my opinion, and there is nothing I would do to change that. Having it set in New York was risky, but it held the bridge up for a while and eventually collapsed. I find it really hard to review this game as I have played GTAV. So, my mind is comparing it to that and I dont want that I affect my review.
