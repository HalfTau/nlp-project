I would recommend this game if it was on Consoles. However this is PC and the PC version of this game is some of the worst PC porting Ive ever witnessed. This isnt a bad game but its probably 2nd to worst of the series Ive played and all the games are good so its okay still.I built my computer in 2014 and it can handle games like Alien Isolation and Dying Light on the highest settings and in GTA IV, it has low frames, the textures look bad even on high, and it takes wayyyyyy too much configuration to run it properly.My experience with GTA IV first running it on PCDoesnt open.Installs Games For Windows Live so I can open the game.Signs up for GWL so I can save the game. Yes, the game forces you to have a GWL account to save the game.Signs into Rockstar Social Club after going through all the finding out my account info processGraphics are on lowest and cant change them. This is because my Card is 4GB VRAM and not 2GBs and since GTA IV mainly supports 2GBs VRAM, it miscalulates my VRAM.Puts in two commands in the Steam settings for GTA IV to unrestrict the graphics settings.Low frames, game still doesnt look all that great, controls are floaty on keyboard.Not worth the hassle.GTA IV 4/10 on PC only because of mod support.GTA IV 7/10 on Consoles.
