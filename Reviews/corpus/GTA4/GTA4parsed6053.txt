Its not the GTA 4 I know and love. This version is just trash. I changed paul.dll to paul.dll.disabled. I put in the commandline.txt file. I put in norestrictions in the set launch on the game. I put the game on Windows Vista  Service Pack 1 and 2. I put the game on XP Service Pack 3. I put it on Windows 7 and 8. I turned off the shadow. I put everything either down to low or down to 1 on the graphics menu of the game. I tried the patch. I tried . I tried Contig. Ive watched videos on everything. Ive tried everything I could to get this game to work and it still lags every 2 minutes.Maybe its my CPU and the fact Im trying to play this on a laptop. Its not a problem with GTA 3, Vice City or San Andreas but its a problem with this game. I think Im good waiting until Rockstar Games finally puts it on Xbox One. If they can do it with Red Dead Redemption, why not GTA 4?
