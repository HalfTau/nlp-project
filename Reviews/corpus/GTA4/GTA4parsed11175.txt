Would fully recommend this game if they didnt get rid of Official Rockstar Servers. One negative thing about this game was the time I took just to save my game, GWFL is poorly made and they should just update the game to steamworks and stop being lazy. Other things I found were that the missions can not be played if you have els cars or modded ambulances, fire trucks, police cars Most ELS. 8/10 rating
