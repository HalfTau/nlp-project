This is a very hard one to determine for a number of reasons,PROS Amazing story line, I feel it is more in depth, but can be a little long and drawn out. Great ragdoll and car physics Fun to easter egg hunt and collect items around Liberty City Great radio stations with some AMAZING songs and funny DJsCONS Annoying map, hard to get from place to place Games for windows live, this ruined any possibility for online play Wonky contols Lots of bugs and game is not stable, lots of crashing, some missions you need mods to complete itOverall I give it a 7.5/10 due to the fact I can find my self playing for hours at a time.
