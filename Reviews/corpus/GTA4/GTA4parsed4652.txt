Amazing game. Its one of my favorites, and its worth it... on console. Get it on console. PS3 or Xbox 360.Just dont buy it if you dont feel like getting it to work. Its a real pain made worse if you dont have windows Vista/XP, and you need to find many workarounds to get it to work. If you can run GTA V on low, you can run this on low at the same framerate.Also, forced mouse acceleration that cant be turned off. Play with a controller AT LEAST.
