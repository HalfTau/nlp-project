Amazing!! Its not the best PC port, you will need a pretty powerful PC to run this game on high settings, getting 60fps is impossible. Ive never had a problem with GFWL, I bought the game then booted it up, and gfwl was working fine. I dont understand how so many people are having problems with it. Anyways, if you have a good PC, then get the game. Its amazing.
