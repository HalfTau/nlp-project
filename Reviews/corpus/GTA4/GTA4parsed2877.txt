I have lots of hours in this game. I loved to mod the single player of this game.Now the Rockstar Games and the Take Two Interactive destroyed the one and only working modding tool, the OpenIV, and they did not take into account what people think about it.The modding is bad for the business they said.Your steps against the modding community will be bad for the business. Youll see.Its a great game, but if you want to mod it, or play it your way, you shouldnt buy it...
