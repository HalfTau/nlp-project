The game itself is fine... on a console, or at least on a PlayStation. On Windows it requires you to set up multiple accounts, most of which youll never need.Then there is the Games for Windows Live, a product discontinued two years prior to this. The game wont let you SAVE you progress unless you have an account for it, and being discontinued just makes it that bit more annoying.I am looking forward to getting a refund for this. Its fine on consoles, just not the PC.
