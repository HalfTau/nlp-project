Grand Theft Auto IV is one of the best in the series, it tells a story like no other gta. The story takes quite a while to get interesting but when it kicks off it becomes quite a good story that will compell you to keep playing. The characters can be really funny and charismatic but also very boring and dull. The missions can get boring, going and killing a group of people can get dull after a while.In all its a good game if youre bored then I recommend it.
