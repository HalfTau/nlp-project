Got this game last Summer Sale, and its been fun when I could actually get on it. Took absolutely ages to get GFWL to work, and once it was working it often wont access properly, tries to make me play offline which means no saving the game  even in single player!, and when it does work its extremely slow at getting started. The game on the other hand hasnt given me any problems, and is really well optimised on the PC imo. GFWL is massive thorn in the games side that means I dont really even try to play it, even though its great once its going.Hopefully rockstar will patch the game when GFWL goes down to run without it, as I would like to be able to enjoy this game.
