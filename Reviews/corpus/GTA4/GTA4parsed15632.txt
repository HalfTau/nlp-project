I bought this game to give Rock Star a chance, I already do not like them but now I hate them. The reason I hate them is I have to have 2 accounts to play this piece ofgame, which would be fine they were optional or let me play after is made one, but no the game still will not launch even though I made the accounts needed to play. I would not get this game if it where free. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON  ROCK STAR GAMES!
