I paid 19.99 for a game that is impossible to play on PC due to the Games for Windows Live required play. By the time I found that it would be impossible to ever play on my pc due to the new update which renders any fixes for GfWL useless I was not able to get a refund because of the time the game spent not responding to being shut down. Dont waste your money, rockstar doesnt care enough to fix the game for you to be able to play it.
