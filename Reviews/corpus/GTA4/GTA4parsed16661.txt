If you value your sanity do not buy this game. Before you even see the game you have to sign into/up for a rockstar account, so you can play online...thats if you ever actually get to the game. Once that hurdle had been jumped and you sit though the unskippable legal warnings and logos There were two logos, both the same design, just one was purple instead of orange. My next task was to try to sort out my graphics settings, I like games to run windowed, thats a problem though cause our great overlords at rockstar want us to jump again. After restarting the game with the windowed flag, I tried to start playing the campaign. NOPE. If I want to be able to get achievements or save yes, save I have to have a LIVE account. Microsoft have deceided to try to do a steam, but its not worked for them. I have a steam account to consolidate all my games into one library. GAMES FOR LIVE WANT YOU. All thats missing is uncle sam. So I sign in I had an xbox so no sign up for this one. GAMES FOR LIVE NEEDS TO UPDATE. Ok. I try to restart the game and it wants me to sign in to live, nope, need to update. So I say no to signing in and it STARTS PLAYING THE GAME. And by game I mean a slideshow of pictures that you cant skip. At that point I gave up, started task manager, took GTAIV.exe out behind the shed and put a bullet in the back of its head. It was the humane thing to do. At this point Ive not even played the game yet, I dont want to, my blood boils with rage. I have played it on xbox though and it was pretty good.
