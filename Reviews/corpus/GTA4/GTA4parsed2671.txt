GTA is owned by a company that legitimately hates its own customers and just wants to squeeze them for every last penny. Dont give them a cent, and instead buy a game from a publisher that actually cares about you. I would have left a negative review for GTAV, but I was hesitant to give TakeTwo any more of my money. Looks like it was a good decision.
