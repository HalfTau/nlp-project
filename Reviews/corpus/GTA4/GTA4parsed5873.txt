Bought this game on the attractive steam summer sale. Doesnt run at all on WINDOWS 10 64 BIT. Dont even waste time trying to make it run if youve bought it i tried and exhausted all my options and took a month and i cant get a refund now. I highly suggest if youve already bought it IMMEDIATELY get a REFUND.
