Rockstar pretty much abandoned everyone after Windows 8 and 10.  Tried to install on Windows 10 for such a long time now and have spent hours online looking for fixes and tried everything and it doesnt work.  Rockstar has just avoided this problem altogether. Dont buy this game anymore. IT DOESNT WORK.
