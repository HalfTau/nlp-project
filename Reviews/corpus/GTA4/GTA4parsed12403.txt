This game does require a bit of maintenance to get started but in my opinion the game is worth it. Here is how I got it to work.First the game wouldnt start at all thanks to GFWL even after I made a profile. Thankfully I found this linkAfter downloading and extracting the files and moving them to the steam gta iv folder the game started right up and I didnt have to with that stupid windows menu anymore.At this point I hit another roadblock as I wasnt able to change the graphics settings which were stuck on the lowest available. The internet came to my rescue again however. I found that if I right clicked on gta iv in steam, went to properties and entered nomemrestrict norestrictions in the launch options the graphics became fully adjustable.Now the game works and looks great. Recommended if you dont mind the minor adjustments at the begining. Still recommended even if you do mind.
