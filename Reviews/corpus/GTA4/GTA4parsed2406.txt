I love this game, despite what Take Two did for mods, this game is still really fun and have played this game for 100s of hours on many devices, and a lot more then 8.6 on the pc. The story is great and in some ways better then GTA 5. If you can get passed the bugs and laggy performance of the game, this game is a must try
