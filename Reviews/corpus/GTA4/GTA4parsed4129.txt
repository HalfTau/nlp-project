The fact that the strangers you meet in this game mature throughout the story, is something that will make me keep playing this game more than Grand Theft Auto 5. Yes, Grand theft auto 5 has way more advanced graphics than this game, but this is just better for me. The story shows you about brotherhood, betrayal, and a little bit about the real world. About brotherhood, Roman may get you into some ed upand make you mad, but youll still save him when hes in trouble. Even if he doesnt help you at all. Betrayal, lots of people betray you in this game, Dimitri, and Michelle are only two of them. Im still young, but from what I have seen today, that if you owe a lot of people money, theyll lose patience and theyll bug you. This game just puts it in a fun way.I will always love this game and I will be glad to tell the story to kids about how beautiful this game is. If you have never played this game I suggest that you buy and play it because it will never get boring for you.
