Hi my name is zach martin, a Long time GTA player and fan and upon purchase of the 4th GTA for PC I was Dissapointed to have to spend have of the week trying to extract. extract extract to get the game to work their was several errors in the game to where it didnt want to run. I ended up nearly  trying to do everything to try and get a respectable refund on the game but then I decided to go to the Internet instead of the cheaply payed support team and thanks to the GTA Community of other players it runs great now, I dont Recommend this game if you arent a Professional Gamer or Computer Expert because it takes a few hours for  some people and it challenging at times, its a awesome game once you fix the errors they made on it, but you have to be experienced No wonder the game is  for Adults, or younger ones who are somehow the smartest and nonviolent kids, have a nice day and i wouldnt recommend due to Bugs, And Glitches every 5 seconds But...Its your Decision, Not mine.
