This game has its Pros and its cons. The Pros are the MASSIVE modding community, with thousands of mods to choose from LCPDFR, Graphic Enhancers, and Sweet looking cars. The cons would be that the game is badly ported. It drops in FPS, and crashes from time to time without an massive gaming system. If you would like to run this game without any of those problems I would recommend getting a state or the arc gaming laptop Alienware, ASUS as theyve worked best for me in the past. Overall, Excellent game. In my opinion, GTA IV will always be better than GTA V Not graphics wise, Just mainly storyline and depth of characters.
