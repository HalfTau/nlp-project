Absolutely ridiculous Steam... put a game that utilises a no longer functioing DRM up for sale.  And yes, Ive tried every damn guide and disabler out there.  I wonder if a classaction lawsuit will force you to pull your collective heads out of your arses and either stop selling software that doesnt work, or force the developer to remove deprecated DRMs
