To be quite honest.... I do love this game. But sice two years have passed since my original review ive learnt alot about gaming. This game i poorly made for pc, infact id call it the worst pc port ive ever seen. The problem i had when i first got the game was that the graphics didnt work... at all. I was easily able to fix this although recently it happpend again and aws a little bit harder to fix. The problem im facing now is the game wont load in after the charecter screen. It just keeps loading. In fact yesterday i started the game, went to school, came back 7 hrs later and it was acctually still going!!! So far ive found no soloution to this problem. But tbh gotta love this game anyways.
