Its a Grand Theft Auto game. If you need your specific GTA fix and dont want to play earlier titles, here you go. I suggest playing Saints Row 3 or 4 because they run better, are more interesting, have all the same features plus more, and came out about the same time as this game. This port runs really poorly because it was optimized likeIts not bad per se, its just not good.Edit Changed from thumbs up to thumbs down. This game is so poorly optimized and a  to even get running on todays systems. Oh yeah, it sucks a dirtytoo. So theres no reason why youd WANT to get it running.
