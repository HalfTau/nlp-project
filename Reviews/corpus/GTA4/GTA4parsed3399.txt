Well, It was great on xbox. Ran really bad on my computer, so i refunded it The story, the content, the theme song, sound effects, pedestrians, and of course the physics make the game 10x better than GTA V. The only things that GTA V did better with, were the multiplayer and graphics. But that doesnt mean GTA IV is worse... No no my friend, in my opinion, GTA IV is a much better game than GTA V. It is a great game that you should check out! Also, there is a big, hard process that makes you make an account for social club, and Windows Live. It really sucks, But its worth it.
