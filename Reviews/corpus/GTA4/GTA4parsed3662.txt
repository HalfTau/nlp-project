Ive owned GTAIV on Xbox 360 for years, its always been one of my favourite games. Compelling story, the gameplay is nice, and the openworld setting is fantastically detailed. Id heard about mods on the PC version, so I thought Id buy it on PC to check them out.Now heres where the main issue occurs GFWL isnt that bad, I used to have to use it on Dawn of War II. My problem with it here is that we get told on the menu that its still possible to save progress without signing in and that we only lose access to achievements, but in the actual game, you are completely blocked from saving any progress unless you sign into a GFWL account, that if youre like me, you wouldnt have used in years.
