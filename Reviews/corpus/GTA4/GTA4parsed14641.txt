This game is amazing, it is a great distance long, but has an amazing story line. There are a ton of very interesting and exciting characters inside of the game. However, there is only one real problem that I saw. That is, if you dont have interenet access, or a windows live account, you cannot save the game, at all. But other than that, the game has amazing graphics, very good physics, a great deal of gameplay, awesome voicing, and great characters. Even after waiting 2 years to get internet and beingto high hell when I I lost the serial number, then having to buy the game on steam, it is an amazing game and I love it.Depressing ending on GTA IV and on GTA IV The Lost and The Damned.
