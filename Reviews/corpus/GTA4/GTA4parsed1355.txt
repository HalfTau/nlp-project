Although I like this game to an extent, the first couple hours and potentially rest of the game. Im not sure I got too bored to be bothered to finish it are so ing boring.Missions are basically drive from A to B or Pick up some guy and drive him from A to B or Shoot a guy then drive from A to B and it drags on.Id also argue that GTAs overworld in general is lacking. The whole free roam aspect is extremely bland. Theres, like, a total of 5 things or possibly less to do in the overworld. You end up having to make your own fun but even then it cant stay fun for all that long. I do recommended buying this game if youre planning on installing mods. Ive got to say, I dont like GTA very much in general but mods really make a GTA game. On the subject of GTA mods, Remember that time when Rockstar took down OpenIV? Yeah, by doing that they risked making their game even more insipid then it already is. But hey, at least its all back. It makes GTA a little less painful to play!TLDR Buy this game if you want to play with mods. Dont buy this game if you dont want to play with mods.
