This game is fun and all and I had a great time playing it but most of the time I had mods installed like custom models to replace Niko, now that openIV is gone and illegal I cant enjoy the game anymore because I dont get the satisfaction out of it, sure you can install mods some how it was just way much easier and simple with OpenIV, would I recommend this game? Sure if you like action packed single player games with a lot of shooting, but if youre looking for a game with awesome mods then at the moment, no try other games like Garrys mod, but if you want a moddable gta game with a lot of mods already I would recommend GTA San Andreas because you dont need openIV and a lot of the mods have a self installer which can make it 1000 times easier to install mods. My rating on GTAIV without mods is 8/10 but my rating of GTAIV with mods is 10/10.UPDATE 6/29/2017Well Rockstar looks like you have added back mods after the out cry of mods for single player. great job so now I would definintley get this game if you dont have it and its also better with mod.P.S. for anyone who didnt know Rockstar made mods legal again and you can download openIV.
