GTA 4 just wasnt meant for PC. On console everything is perfect, optomized, online is always playable and all round its just pure fun. But when it comes to PC with Rockstar Social Club and Windows LIVE, its just not worth it. I bought this game with a bunch of friends in hopes of fun times and fond memories from 4 or 5 years ago. But all that was crushed when we all couldnt even open the game. Rockstar Social Club is honestly one of the worst things imaginable when it comes to playing online. It wont even let me log in to play the game. You seriously need to be somesort of idiot if you thought Rockstsr Social CLub was a god idea. ITs gotten in the way of almost every modern Rockstar game. Please, if you have a console, Im sure you can buy it much cheaper than Steam sells it for and it will actually work on Xbox 360 and PS3.
