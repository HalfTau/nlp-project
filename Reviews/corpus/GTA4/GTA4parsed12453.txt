This game doesnt even work. It launches a social club login screen then it says you are playing the game. After waiting a few seconds the green circle around your avatar turns into a blue circle which means the game either crashed or it just doesnt work. Do not buy this game, I recommend San Andreas since it might atleast work. If you do not have this error than enjoy your game but for me I got it.
