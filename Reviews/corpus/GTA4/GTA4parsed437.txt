It comes with the Games for Windos Live crap. Of course neither Steam, nor Rockstar bothers to mention what tonnage of crap that is.Ill explain it to youYou pay for the game, then when you try to play it, you get stuck in the loading screen and your only option is to restart your computer. After several restarts, you will google GTA 4 stuck loading screen. After wasting 20 minutes of your life reading several non working solutions, you will find someone nice enough to point you to the POS software of Micrsoft hey, if you are guy who designed WFGL and are reading this, die in a fire. After installing that POS software, your game may or may not start and your games may or may not will be saved.Rockstar, enough of this crap, patch the damm game and let us who PAID MONEY play the game.
