If the game runs its great  gameplay wise. But given the state the software has been left in, its not really worth buying. It crashes and can be a pain to run. I suppose if you have an older system Windows XP you may have more success but Rockstar clearly hasnt done any sort of upkeep on this.With Windows Vista SP2 and above youre likly to run in to some major issues  issues that prevent you from running the game. There are hacks out there but those only get you so far and crashes are still quite common.Right now for me, despite running fine last night it crashes at a specific point for no reason. Its disappointing because it otherwise seems like a great installment.
