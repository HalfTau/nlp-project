I have played this game before on my PS3. So, dont worry about my hours on Steam. This game is excellent, there are people who still play online in this game. I love the story and of course going hanging out with Roman playing bowlling. This game changed the series. In fact, I enjoy this game more than GTA 5.Now if youre wondering why this game has mixed reviews, people cannot run this game. It says in the bottom of the game that you need Games for windows live. If you setup your game for windows live then youre all set and ready to play. It also works for TBGOT and TLAD.
