Once this game starts, its amazing.When I purchased this game last year, I was shocked to find out that the game wasnt working. Following browsing on the internet I found the Windows Live, installed that, setup my account and I was straight into the action. Graphically I was impressed and following a few tweaks with the settings I found myself in a game I could enjoy and get use out of. Going back to having to install a third party application to run the app isnt on, Im unaware if this problem still persists but Steam/Rockstar should both concentrate on older games aswell as next generation ones. Overall 8/10.
