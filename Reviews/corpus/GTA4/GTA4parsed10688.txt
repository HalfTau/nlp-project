Social CLub Issues !! First off I hate having to make another account within steam for any game bought on steam. There should be some sort of Handshake going on where we dont have to. Secondly I created an account and it timed out even though I answered questions and moved from step to step quickly. Lastly I Cannot Log in !! I verified my email, but the password and email I put in says it is not found. I tried to create a new account again and My Nickname is unavailable ... because it was taken by me! This goes for GTA IV also which you cant play unless you sign into Social Club ! Now it seems like I wasted money on both and cannot play them !! Very frustrated.
