I get the game, It gives me the key, so I type in the key, then I gotta log into Social Club, not surprised so I type in my credentials and it wont log me in, I keep trying for a HALF HOUR with every version of my account, every password, every username/email and it refuses to even let me touch the title screen, dont buy this game. Keep your money for something else.
