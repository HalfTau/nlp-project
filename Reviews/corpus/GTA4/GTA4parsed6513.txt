What can I say about this game at the moment?  The multiplayer I cannot get to work for me which is not really that big a deal.  I have windows 10...... yes people I have windows 10.  Its not the OS, when the game boots I can hear sound and then it crashes.  IF GTA 2 RUNS THEN WHY THE  CANT THIS GAME RUN? Cannot recommend this game at the moment.  I am better of buying it on console for the PS3 or x360. Oh well I bought this game with the bundle so all is not lost only paid 8 for all the games even though only 2 games out of the bundle work.  So sad at the moment but oh well got most of my  worth of the games.  But still do not settle for less only get gta 2 and  San Andreas. The others get on consoles.
