Do I really need to say anything about the Game of the Year?Just amazing and masterpiece and its a gem added to the Grand Theft Auto Series made by Rockstar.I am trying to put all the Pros and Cons in my opinion, of this game below.Pros.1. Gameplay  An amazing gameplay, the story line is awersome and makes you overlook the QUIT BUTTON. D2. Graphics  Music  Just one Word. TOP NOTcH. Rockstar put almost 4 years in the devlopment of this game. So, definatly worth their efforts. And big respect from me. 3. OpenWorld/Sandbox Styles  Endless opportunities. Yeah, you guessed it right, so even if you are done playing with entire story mode, there are tones of things you can do besides, main missions.4. An american Dream  The liberty city is replica of NYC, and its so amazingly done, that even if you are not from America or NYC, you can still experience the american lifestyle, Virtually afcourse. XD5. and on and on and on....Cons.ARE YOU FING KINDING ME? THERE ARE NO CONS SO STOP EVEN ASKING FOR ONE. D10/10P.S. I alredy had non steam version, but still bought the whole GTA Franchise on Steam. So that now I have all the titles at one place. D
