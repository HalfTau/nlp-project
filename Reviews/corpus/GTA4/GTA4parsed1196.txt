This game is one of the best games in my whole life. It was perfect, when ive launched it for the first time. I remember, that it was just after i bought a new PC, so after playing A LOT OF San Andreas, it looked really realistic and the graphic was really great for me. But after all those years and after playing GTA V graphics arent so great anymore. But the game is still enjoyable. And after few hours, you dont see those details, but you just want to play more missions. Ive finished this game just now and, wow. Its quite depressing. Nevertheless its really a good game and i think ill play it again in future.My rating is 9/10 Rakijas. Would drink again.And the most important thing, this game is about Slav imigrants!
