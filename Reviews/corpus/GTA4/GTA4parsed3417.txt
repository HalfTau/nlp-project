This is a fantastic game. Truly lives up to the Grand Theft Auto name, in both gameplay and story. It was a massive step from San Andreas in terms of realism, graphics, physics, textures and character rendering, and it was the foundation for GTA 5. Yes, it requires Windows Live to run, you agree to that when you buy the game, it is clearly noted on the store sale page. Please do not give it a bad review simply because you are incompetant.
