GTA IV is an odd one, it has many flaws and many pros.First of all is performance, im using a i3 2120 and a 7870xt, i cant max this game for over 30fps, thats an issue a big one. Downloaded a gadget to see if its a cpu issue, the game uses two cores, no hyperthreading support here. Tested it on my fathers pc same gpu but with a i7 2600k  4.2ghz and oddly the frame rate didnt go up.Performance issues to the side this is a pretty nice game, the campaign first of all is way too serious and dark for my tastes, there wasnt that normal funny nature that the game had which sucks I guess but nothing can be done about that and its not the biggest issue in the world.So then modding, this is where it gets awesome, hundreds upon hundreds of cars to mod into the game, some are illegal converts which i dont like at all but the high quality mods with time and effort show in the quality of physics, visuals and shading. Then there are enbs, which really buff up the lighting system and the textures.There are a lot of bugs and ive had to restart the game a few times as areas would not load so it would be invisiable and it wouldnt end well.Im on the fence about recommending this, there are some great features and then others are annoying.Worst of all WINDOWS LIVE JUST DIE ALREADY DIEEEEE!! !
