After completing this game on the PS3, and completing GTA V on PS4, I can firmly say this game is better. This game doesnt have the bigger shock value, or the better graphics, but as an immersive experience, Grand Theft Auto IV puts you into its world and doesnt pull you out until the console is off. The character of Niko Bellic feels human, not just another throwaway character. He has emotions. Many of the choices are difficult. I wont spoil anything, but towards the end of the game, you have to choose whether to kill a certain character. It makes you think whether to not kill him, and bury your past as a killer, or kill him, and have your revenge. No game has made me think this much about killing someone in a video gameother than the Walking Dead.As with gameplay, I have a gaming desktop, and I have had no issues with the gameplay. Its smooth, it runs well. It takes a second to get going, but it works perfectly.In the end, this game is worth every penny. Grand Theft Auto IV is just as good as the day it came out. I cant recommend this game more. Ill give it a 98/100. No game is perfect, but this comes close.
