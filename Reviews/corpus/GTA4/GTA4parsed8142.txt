My GTA IV Story DONT BUY SEPARATELY BY THE Liberty City ComboExplanation Below.Launches on Windows 7Created Social AccountPlayed but cant save without signing in to MS Live Just like everyone CD Key invalidRead forms found that you have to redeem the code onand click your accountcode redeemsLaunched game still doesnt work still says code is invalidRead more forms I guess after you get the code to work you can launch the Windows live program from start menu and you will see it in your history, there will be a new code that will work on the gameUnfortunately windows live only states unable to access data at this timeRead more forms and it looks like this is the only possible solutionBuy the combo with the Episodes from liberty cityWhen you launch GTA IV and you sign into live delete the code that comes with 4 and replace with the code from Liberty City. This will unlock the live and provide the game with the upgrade.Unfortunately for me I am still waiting on a refund. It is in pending mode so I will probably miss the sale.Hope this helps some people out there.
