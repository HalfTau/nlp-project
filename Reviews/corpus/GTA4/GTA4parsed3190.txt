I just wanted to let people know that the game itself is great, obviously! Theres really not much to add that hasnt already been said. That being said beware when purchasing this game on steam/pc. It has a notorious studder when playing thru steam. There are many fixes out there  but the only one that worked for me was to launch the game outside of steam. This is why it says I only have a few hours of time played this time is actually the time I spent trying to get rid of the studder issue.Even after this the game does not run as good as it should. It just was not optimized for pc which is a shame. Also beware that it requires GFWL to play and many people have had trouble running that as well. I personally did not have trouble with GFWL. SO be aware of all this before purchasing.
