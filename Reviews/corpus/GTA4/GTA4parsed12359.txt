The single player campaign is good, especially for when the game was made, I like the fact you can customise your model in multiplayer, but more freedom in customisation would help, maybe a voice changing option, and more tops and hats.Another problem with the multiplayer is the fact that in free roam, all you can do is take cars, shoot, pick up weapons, etc etc, I would have liked to have been able to, buy things, go to places and interact with npcs as friends like in single player, I suppose I am just asking for what is coming in gta V , but it would be nice if they could add it before V comes out, so that this mechanic would work in Liberty City.
