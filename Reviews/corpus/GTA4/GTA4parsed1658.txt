When Grand Theft Auto IV came out in 2008, it was a masterpiece, but its age shows, and I would now clasify it as really good...     on console. The PC port is riddled with bugs and performance issues, hell this game caused my PC to blue screen nearly ten times. On console, this game is earns a 9/10, but on PC I can only give it a 7.5/10,a great game that is still totally worth buying on Steam, and completing in its entirety, but bugs and poor optimization prevent this game from reaching its full potential on PC.
