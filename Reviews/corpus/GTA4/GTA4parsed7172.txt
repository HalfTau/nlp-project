Game is overall great, but has very frequent issues. Some of these include a select few of people not being able to play online due to Windows Live requirements, activation issues, and very poor optimization. If you dont already have GTA San Andreas or GTA V, Id recommend buying one of those first or waiting for this game to go on sale.Other than that, brilliant story, and fun to mod.
