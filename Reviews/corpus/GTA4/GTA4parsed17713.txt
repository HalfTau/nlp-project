GTA IV is fun.Not on steam, though.It wont let me login with my correct social club username and password, and when I click Offline it doesnt even start.Nice job, Rockstar. Your failed DRM to keep pirates from playing keeps paid users from playing, too.Do I recommend this game... On console? Yes. On steam? No.
