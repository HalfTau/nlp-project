The characters!The storytelling!The atmosphere of the ugly city!The criticism of the american dream!It all works great and makes a masterpiece in the GTA series. If you manage to get over the problems with Games for Windows LIVE, Rockstar Social Club and the fact it is poorly optimized for PC in general, then I am sure, you will LOVE it!
