An unedited, repetitive loop of driving, shooting, and watching, with the game fighting you at every step.Core controls are broken, with animation lag, an unresponsive camera, and some of the most crippled shooting controls ever conceived. Auto aim that shoots at cover while limbs and heads are in clear view free aim that gets reset when the ultrasensitive triggers move by a hair blind fire that the game will only occasionally let you use reticule shift between aiming and shooting sticky free aiming that will magnetize to open geometry for no reason finicky cover implementation that occasionally locks you out of shooting running controls that violently swing the the camera to unwanted positions jumping that constantly hitches on geometry a button layout that swaps core action buttons between on foot and in car anaemic cars that drive like they have bald tires the list is endless.Thematic elements fair no better with a meandering, aimless storyline full of bloated, pointless missions. Awkwardly modelled and animated characters of every age, ethnicity, and criminal affiliation that all act and react with identical rage in every situation. A cardboard city built with boxy primitives, vacant pedestrians, and glitchy, flat atmospherics. Radio stations that are allergic to playing music and breathlessly in love with their own hacky satire.A vast theme park full of broken rides.
