This game feels like it just gave up on its own life. I couldnt start it to begin with. Had to download some t Windows Live Gaming app to be able to run it. Then after I got it working I found out that my savegame is gone. Why do you use 3 different apps when none of them is of any use?? How come that neither Social Club BS neither Windows Live BS nor Steam BS managed to save my files??? Then after I got into the game I found out that my graphics option were turned down to the lowest.... AND I CANNOT TURN THEM UP???? This game should be sponsored by google since Im spending more time with it than with the game .0/10 Will not buy anything from rockstar anymore .
