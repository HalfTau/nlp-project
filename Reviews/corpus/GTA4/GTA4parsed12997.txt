I would recomend this game on console. This game is amazing. The only problem is that you have to use GFWL Games for windows live in order to login. The problem with that is the fact that GFWL doesnt work anymore, so you need to google a way to bypass that. Once youve figured that out, you may have an infinite loading screen that takes some time to fix. And finally you will have to go into the launch options to allow you to change your graphics settings. After all this the game runs fine on windows 8. But I do recomend that you get it on a console rather than a PC.Or just pay 60 for GTA V.
