Its a really good game. I know it has Problems with Windows 10 and stuff, but I dont know if its a Miracle but I have a Windows 10 PC and until know the game works perfectly. But sometimes when I play to long GTA 4 crash and all my experience is gone  But its doesnt matter for me  Rockstar Games pleace make a last and the best Patch, that supports Windows 10 and fix some Bugs
