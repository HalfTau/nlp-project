This is truly a terrible port.poor optimisation on Rockstars part. Latest patch has serious performance issues, the game actually runs better on an earlier patch. Even still, It has about as many problems as the GTA III era pc ports issues with water, wonky physics and is prone to frequent crashing.  Its a great game, but just be warned that this port is one of the worst of all time.
