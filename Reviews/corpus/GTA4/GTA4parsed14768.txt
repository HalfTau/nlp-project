Grand Theft Auto 4 is a very awesome game.  Iv had so much fun playing dis game.  The storyline is pretty good for a gta game, the graphics  animation r much better then they were in the gta san andreas days.  U r capable of doing so much more then u could in the earlier gta games for example u can fly choppers.  I think rockstar games have rlly improved the gta series like ALOT.  Anyway hope dis review helped u, if u wanna c how much fun i had playing dis game click da link hereawesome game
