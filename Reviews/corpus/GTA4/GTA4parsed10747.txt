Even though the restriction on Mods has been Lifted, I will not be giving this game any prasie, from its colourless environment to its boring story, this game is just bad from the ground up, PC, Xbox 360, PS3 it doesnt matter, its bad.Id still reccomend GTA V over this, but even still, avoid Rockstar if youre looking for mods, you never know when theyll forget or thing weve forgotten and ban mods again.
