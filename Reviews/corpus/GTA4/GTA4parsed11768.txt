Let me just say, I have played a lot of bad games I have played a lot of good games. I have never felt compelled to write a review for anything. This game  I have played it on the ol Xbox. It was fun. I am a PC gamer though, so I dled this on steam.I have never spent so much time trying to get something to even run in my life. Between the integration with Microsofts Games for Windows Live and thebox of a port  this game is totally unrunnable. I have a monster machine 16 gigs of RAM, a nice dual video card setup from NVidia, 6 core i7 and I cannot get past the first few minutes of the game. It freezes and crashes whenever I take any action in game and will work for just long enough to infuriate me into believing I have finally fixed it.Honestly, Rockstar should have payed me to do this because every hour I have logged in this game is just me trying to get it to run. Total crap. Dont buy it.
