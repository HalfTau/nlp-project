Do NOT buy the game.I spent about an hour just downloading useless programs and creating accounts just to play the game.What I hated even more was that you can not save the game unless you sign in with your LIVE account. And to even get the game running, you need to download the microsoft games client. Then when youre finally in the game, and past the long intro, the game asks you to update your account because, somehow the account you just made 5 min ago is outdated. When it asks to close the game, you are not given that option and the game freezes with your mouse cursor gone.Highly frustrating and will not want to waste my time on this trash.
