Top Game!BUT if it doesnt let you play... thanks to Microsoft and their bugged outdated Games for Windows Live that they try to make you install.The easiest fix is, when in game, and gfwl is screaming about its bugs, press the home key, a tab should pop up, then press create a new profile, in the next pop up scroll down the text and hit the tiny hidden link make a local profile, then type in whatever name you want, press submit and then done. This creates an offline profile so you can save the game.Credits to Hampterfuppinshire for posting this on the steam forums!GLHF
