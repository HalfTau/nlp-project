I loved GTAIV on consoles PS3 and Xbox both, so I figured that getting it on PC would be great right? I mean... mods and stuff!Considering I cant even boot the game up, Id say I was robbed.Thank Games for Windows Live and Rockstar Social Club! Youre the best!Really though, Ive followed like 5 guides to try and get it to work.If you have windows 8, dont buy this. And besides, GTAV will be out on here by the end of the year anyways...
