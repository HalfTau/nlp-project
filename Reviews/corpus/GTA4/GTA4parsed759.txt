One of my first open world gamesThe story in this game is absolutely worth your money...worth enough for you to buy it even when it isnt on sale. With a decent system you shouldnt have much problems running this old game on max graphics. Gameplay is always entertaining and i dont remember finding it repetitive.BUTAfter i upgraded to windows 10 i cant seem to run the game. Lost all my progress in game TriggeredA proper fix still isnt out for this as far as i know so dont waste your  on this game if you still run Windows 10. If u dont, then go on, stop reading my review and buy the game already!
