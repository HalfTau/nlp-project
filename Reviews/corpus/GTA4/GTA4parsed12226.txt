Wow. Just wow. That is all have to say to the idiots who did this PC port. This is the buggiest, most broken system for a game I have ever seen. I spent almost six hours downloading programs, entering nearly ten launch commands, and forcing the game to even start without crashing. Even then, I still have not been able to even start the game portion, I am just presented with a everloading slideshow. What is so horrible is that some idiot ruined a game that is legitimately fun and enjoyable. Do not pay money for this game. If you can even call it that now.
