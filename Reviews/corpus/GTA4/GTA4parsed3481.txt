GTA 5I bought this game for the online cause  doing story mode.Im sure the story is good though.Only downside about this game really is loadtimes.I mean if you are into gta this is for sure the best Gta out of em all.You will deal with a modder every now and them.This game is a Blast if playing with friends.Id give this game a 8. 7/10Its for sure worth its full price but you should wait till its on sale since this game is always going on sale.
