You know, as the follow up to San Andreas, this game can be quite disappointing to some. It was for me, at least. Its a much darker and serious approach to Grand Theft Auto than any of the past games, and this can cause the feeling the game is boring.It doesnt help that shooting and driving are very different from past games, and youll get a game that a lot of people hate after they first hour. But if you keep playing, trying to unveil the story of Niko, getting used to the new mechanics, this will suddenly be one of the best openworld action games that you ever played. Driving can be weird at first, but after you get the grip of the cars and how they drive, it will be a lot of fun to drive around Liberty City, just like past games. Shooting has been just plain improved in every single way.And if after that, you still want the crazyness and irreverence of past games, the Ballad of Gay Tony got plenty of that, so be sure to check that out.
