I purchased this game as it was on sale. I logged quite a number of hours on the xbox version, so i figured what the hey. I purchased this SPECIFICALLY for multiplayer. But guess what? THERE IS NO MORE MULTIPLAYER. thats right, NO MULTIPLAYER AVAILABLE AT ALL.now, wouldnt you agree that listing multiplayer in the features but not actually having it is disingenuous? so i wasted my ing money. and i want my money back. but steam and rockstar could care less, im sure.SAVE YOUR MONEY.
