The gameplay of Grand Theft Auto 4 is very enjoyable. The campaign is engaging and entertaining. The ability to wait a while before doing certain missions gives you the ability to roam around Liberty City. Because this game was released earlier than Grand Theft Auto 5, the graphics and features are not matched with the newer game in the series. Activities separate from the campaign include vehicle theft, fighting, pool, darts, eating out, bowling, driving, freeroam, dating, shopping for clothes, and more! The final mission does contain a glitch. There are tutorials on YouTube explaining how to fix this problem.
