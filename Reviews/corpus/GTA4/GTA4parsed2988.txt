To Take Two,If you do not wish to have your games modded then you can skip the trouble and just not release your games on the PC. Modding is a cornerstone of the PC gaming community and if you want to actively pursue the modding community through legal recourse than you are a toxic company that we just dont need.To Rockstar,I am sorry you are in this abusive relationship. If you want to get out of it, I have a DVD Burner and my company allows me to print all the personal material that I want. I can be your new publisher.
