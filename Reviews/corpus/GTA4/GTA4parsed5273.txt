I absolutely loved this game. However I had to reformat my computer, and now it no longer works. For the longest time, even before I had to reformat, it would never log me into that club that it requires. Ok fine, it let me play offline. No big deal. Now however, I go to play, I get the login screen. I select play offline like I usually did, and it just shuts the game down and will not start it up. EXTREMELY unhappy, and would really like a refund since I cant play this game.
