All in all, this game isnt too bad. Ive put quite some hours in it and it probably still was worth its money  especially because I bought it during a sale  but I still felt really disappointed by it, having played SA a LOT when I was younger, and it was so good and omg iv is here lets play that and relive the good old SA days! Nope.What IV did wrong was going too realistic, especially on the graphics, they are really grayed out and boring, the sunny days feel more like a cloudy day, a lot of fun aspect was taken out, such as taxi, firefighter and ambulance missions, and one thing moreThe performance. Its hard to talk about because PCs vary wildly, but all in all, I have a decent enough pc  cant run everything on high but switching to low makes every game playable. Except this. Everything as low as can be, but still about 10 fps.To conclude this review, its a decent enough game if you want to have SOME fun, and dont care too much about raging at the lag, the realism, and... the GFWL. I could have recommended instead of notrecommended, but I feel like I said more negative than positive things about the game so I decided to go for notrecommending instead.
