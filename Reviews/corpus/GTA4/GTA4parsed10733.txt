Ive previously played this game with xbox360. I still think its a great game, but unfortunately it seems that getting pc version to work has too many obstacles in its pathetc.Despite being an avid pc gaming fan, I think that at the current state this game cant be called a smooth or even playable experience. Therefore I cannot recommend this version of the game.
