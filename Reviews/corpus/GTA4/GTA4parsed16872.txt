There isnt really much to say about GTA IV. It is an openworld adventure that takes place in New York City. The game deliberately avoids using actual geographical names but you can immediately recognise New York. You play a Serb guy, Niko Bellic, who arrives to Liberty City as he wants to change his life and he heard America was the land of opportunity. He visits his cousin, Roman, and eventually finds himself working for all kinds of criminals  achieving the American dream seems to be the easiest if you work for the bad guys.Liberty City is a breathing, living city. There are citizens walking and talking and driving their cars and you can pretty much interact with everybody. Beacons highlight various missions and you can launch these by approaching the icons  this is not mandatory you can complete the game at your own leisure. It should also be noted how many things you can do while not completing missions. You can participate in car racing, date girls, play darts, play snooker, drive a cab and deliver passengers to their destination. In fact, in GTA, you can pretty much commandeer all kinds of vehicles boats, police cars, helicopters etc.. You can hang out with Nikos friends and can even surf the Internet!Unfortunately, GTA IV is marred by technical issues. It is an almost a 6 year old game, yet, it is still not properly optimised. Even with todays highend systems you can experience some FPS drops with the highest settings turned on. Lets hope GTA V will be optimised much better this of course assumes the latest episode will get a PC port.Alternatively, you can pick up Sleeping Dogs or Saints Row. Both have the same approach but they run much better.
