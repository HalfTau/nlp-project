uhhhh hello rockstar, fix the damn game.....i know all yall care about is making money off gta 5 but all it would take would be a couple of devs and an update to play on win10....cant even play the story mode.....sad, sad....the same for red dead redemption, great game but yall never repair or update it....it was broken when you made it backwards compat on xbox one.....you were my favorite dev until gta5......peace chewie
