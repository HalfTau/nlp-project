I see why everyone hates the game now, it dosent work with Windows 8/10 But it is not Rockstars fault, the game was made on XBox 360/PS3 then ported to PC, THE GAME IS TOO OLD TO WORK ON NEW WINDOWS OS, THE GAME IS 8 YEARS OLD FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! Its your fault for not researching the information This should teach people to reserch ANYTHING before they buy it. Oh and all you butt hurt kids should learn to mod cause their are mods that let GTA4 work on Windows 8/10
