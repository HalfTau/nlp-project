Grand Theft Auto IV is a good game, and great for multiplayer, but you might have to do a couple stuff first in the folders to get it to work if you have some different stuff. Overall its a great singleplayer experience and a really good multiplayer one too its just you need a XBOX LIVE account and need to get over a few obstacles which might get just a little too annoying, but if you like these types of games then its worth the try, and really good to play wit your friends,
