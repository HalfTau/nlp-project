I wont upvote any game that requires social club, uplay, windows live or any of those virus your forced to install just to us a game. This game loaded for me then crashed right away.Yet I had no issues with Saint Rows 2, 3, and 4. If you want a good open world gang banger game grab Saints Rows and not this trash GTA crap.
