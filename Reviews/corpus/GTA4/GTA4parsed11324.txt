This game is ace on pc. granted most people have complained about it being laggy and poorly optimised as a pc port, i honestly have found the game to run alright. i even managed to get a tablet to run the game with a intel atom processor and a intel HD4000 and it played with playable fps. on lowest settings though, would recommend a higher spec deviceThe story is good, the gameplay is hilarious with the awesome ragdoll physics and fairly average but still fun multiplayer.What i dont understand though is why is this page full of negative reviews, i found all the things that were listed as issues to be complete BS. This game DOES work with windows 8.1 i have tried it myself to get it running all you have to do isopen the installers folder in the GTA IV game folderfind vcredistx86 or vecrdistx64install the file microsoft cAnd you should be good to go.overall i find the game to be a solid 8/10. great buy.
