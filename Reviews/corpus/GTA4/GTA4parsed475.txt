Games for Windows Lives ruined this game for me , had about 10 hours in game then i lost my save because of windows live , i coudnt sign in anymore , it was claiming i had a problem with my internet connection while it was working perfectly fine. I googled this problem and it happened to a lot of people , yet no working fix, its like they dont give aabout their game . Such a waste...
