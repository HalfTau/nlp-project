I have to say I would have given this game 5 stars if wasnt for the consistent crashes and the lack of playtesting when they ported this game from PS. It has a great story lines and awesome game play. Unfortunately I cant give it anything but one start because there is a fairly commonly experienced glitch in the last mission where you are required to press space bar to board a helicopter except that the space bar doesnt work most of the time. Ive played the mission better than 10 times and Ive only managed to get in once.This is a great game with poor execuation. If you buy it be forewarned that you may not be able to finish it as the port is so poorly exectuted.
