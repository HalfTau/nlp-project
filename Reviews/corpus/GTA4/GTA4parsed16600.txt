While unoptimized My friend with a Amd Phenom X II3.5 Ghz,8 GB RAM and a GTX 260 ran into lots of framerate drops and poor perfromance. If you have newer hardware past 2010 you will be fine and have a great experienceThis is the best GTA game ever until GTA 5 comes to PC.The story is the usual GTA story.You have to rise up through a criminal underworld from a random guy to a mobster boss at the top.What makes GTA is the original moments.When a police car chases you and ensures and epic chase of cars,helicopters and military. The missions ge tboring after the first 20 hours or so because of tired old concepts ofsomeone and run away.Now this is GTA 4 on PC and as two exclusive features 1.An amazing  video editor and 2.The Mods!You can find thousands of mods online and really get much more fun and lifts the graphics from just ok to amazing!You can switch between mousekeyboard or controller at any time and is a nice feature.TipDrive with a controller,On foot use keyboardmouse9.5/10 Great especially on sale
