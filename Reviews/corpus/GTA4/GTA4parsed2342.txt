I know that the thing to do with this game is give it a negative review because of the modding thing which is  but I just finished it for the first time and I wanted to review it.I know comparing to GTA V is inevitable, so here we go. I see a loit of people saying that the story of this game is better than the story of GTA V and I really dont see it. A lot of the missions felt insanely disconnected from the main thread of the game Niko searching for revenge and just made me feel like a constant hired hand rather than a player in all of this. It didnt so much feel like it was Nikos story as much as it felt like a bunch of things just kept happening to him and he just went along with it. That being said, the missions were incredibly fun, and full of great set pieces and mechanics. The lack of checkpoints is absolutely horrendous though, escpecially after having played GTA V.The games environments, though often very grey, felt very immersive and true to their reallife models. The characters were funny and interesting. The game itself was packed with a ton of flavor and jokes that its pretty much impossible to absorb them all.The controls can be a little bit wonky at times, and often make the cars feel downright sluggish. Turning is abysmally slow and imprecise in this game. Motorcycles are a nightmare and boats are even worse. It makes me happy that Rockstar noticed this flaw in game feel and remedied it to some extent in the sequel.Overall, Id say the game defies a bit of a shaky plotline and manages to stay worth it if only for the absurdity, spectacle, and depth of its characters.
