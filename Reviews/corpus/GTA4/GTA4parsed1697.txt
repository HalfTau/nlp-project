This was my first GTA game that is in the HD Universe. I had played III, Vice City and San Andreas, even 100ed them. I 100ed game and played every bit of this game too, but... lets talk about a fact.The game itself is overally great. Technical sides of it are acceptable. But there are more things that I didnt like than I like about it, which are the following In 3D universe game I played, there are memorable radio stations and songs that whenever I hear, makes me remember the memories of that particular game of mine. But in this game, I had absolutely no favorite radio station, therefore nothing memorable about the music of this game for me. They just... didnt fit. The atmosphere looked great, but still... I had felt more and different feelings from the atmosphere of the 3D games that this HD universe. There was something missing... And I still dont know what it is. The universe was just... blank for me... Just empty and not colorful... Storyline... do I even have to talk about this? Did it even exist? Side missions. Nothing special. Almost worse than the 3D Universe side missions. Even the car thefts are bad. In previous universes, when you complete the car thefts, you could choose a car whenever you want and they would deliver that particular car for you. In this game all you gain is money...But still I will recommend this game. Despite there are more to talk about and this game made me feel nearly absolutely nothing, it is still an experience to live through.P. S. GFWL sucks.P. S. S. Will all of the HD universe game feel like this? If they are, I will not buy any of them then. Like GTA V and upcoming GTA... VI?P. S. S. S. pls dont hurt me for liking 3D universe more than HD universe
