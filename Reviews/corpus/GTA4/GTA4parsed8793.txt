Worst game ever. In order to play you have to make two more accounts  Windows live and Social clubFor multiplayer. After installation, there was a problem in the screen resolution change problem which i had to fixed it mannually by watching a video on youtube. Gameplay is also not good it lags sometimes. Beating people is a complete joke here. It seems like that its a nulled game made by some developers to see how far they can copy the GTA.  This game has not worth better to buy Saint Rows 3 which is far better than this one
