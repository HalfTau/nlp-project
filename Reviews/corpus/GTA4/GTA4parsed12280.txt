Despite my computers specs being way over the requirements,  the game claims that Im still under the requirements, and when I installed this on my laptop to check, yes, the fraction indicator that shows how much of your computers processing power the game was using was SHOWING ABOUT THE SAME VALUE FOR THE PROCCESSING CAPABILITIES OF BOTH COMPUTERS. Is a GTX 660 with 3 GB vram the same as integrated intel graphics 4000? I dont think so. This problem is most likely a result of the game running as 32 bit, which basically means that it only uses about 3 GB of ram, making those other 13 GB on your highend computer completely irrelevant. Running in 32 bit is okay for a 2D platformer or a puzzle game, but its not suited for a 3D, extremely complex and badly optimized open world game.Update changed reccomendation to yesI discovered that, actually, the game runs fine on my system, my only problem was that the game was convinced that my system was underspec because I had over 2 GB of video ram, and because it was telling me that and keeping me from adjusting the graphics any higher than their lowest settings, I ended up reading the fraction backwards embarassingly, and read the hardware requirements for the lowest graphics settings instead of the computers capability. If you have the same problems, right click on the game in your library, go to properties, and on the first tab youll see set launch options, and enternomemrestrict norestrictionsin the window that comes up when you click on it. Its let me adjust the graphics settings, although it runs at about 30 fps at any setting.
