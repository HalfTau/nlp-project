So I heard they just updated the game, so I was kind of excited to go back to it and play since I could never really complete it due to the bad state it was in, I thought theyd fix the game with this new update after 6 years, but what did they do? well I dont know but as far as im concerned they didnt dowith it or at least nothing to actually fix it, I just installed the game... I literally just installed fresh, and first time I opened it asks me to log into the useless rockstar club app, which they had taken away in early updates and now they brought it back, and also into games for windows live which no one uses anymore, to then just get stuck in the login screen of GFWL, second try the game gets stuck in the steam overlay, third try the game gets stuck in the main menu, fourth try the game starts, it loaded a new game plays the intro and then minutes before i could actually start playing, the game minimizes and tells me that there have been some sort of critical error within GTA V and that I need to reinstall the game, at the end of the message i see this 3 which I dont why it made me think it was some kind of bad joke from the devs, so I clicked and went back in game just for it to actually crash within matter of seconds, so I just uninstalled it after just installing it, almost 3 years of looking at it like a pariah, but with this now this game in front of me is nothing but trash. im sorry if this offends anyon, like i really care about it, but its my truth and it just makes me hate the game, i would say not its story but i havent played it enough to know if its even good or not.If you want a good advice, dont bother with this game, dont buy, dont even look at it, if you have the console version PS3/XBOX 360 just stick with that because the PC version is a complete disaster, something id even dare to call a plain scam to be honest.And just to add a tiny bit more, there was a point with this game in which SecuROM wouldnt allow me to play the game, i was so frustrated and literally the only way i could play the game was by using a pirated executable, like seriously? that was the only way i managed to get the game running after i bought it.
