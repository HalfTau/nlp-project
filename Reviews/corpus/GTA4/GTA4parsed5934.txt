I got Windows Live and the Social Club to work for me, so no issues there.Grand Theft Auto IV is fun for those who like to shoot guns and drive cars. Essentially every 8 year olds imagination. Except dont get this if you are 8. Filthy language, gore, sex, drugs and alcohol plague the game. For the more mature players, this game offers that and more.Everyone knows the story. Niko Bellic escapes from a Yugoslavian country probably Serbia to America to live the American Dream. After learning his cousin Roman lied to him about his riches and dug a big hole for him and his cousin, Niko must attempt to undig the hole. How does he do that? By becoming a criminal and taking on multiple roles, both from old and new pals, and the government. After progressing through the game, you eventually kill the big villian and get millions of dollars in the process.MODS. Mods is what makes GTA IV on the PC GTA IV on the PC. Visual enhancements, scripts, and mods containing new maps, items, skins, tools, and gameplay perspectives are all done really well by the expansive community of modders. The LCPDFR mod and the Route 66 maps are my favourites of these enhancements. Some very nice ENBs out there as well.All in all, a welldone plot  a lot of mods  hours of fun. if your computer can run it. The graphics are great for 2008, but are ugly today. As it should be. The vehicle and player movements are weird with a mouse and keyboard, but can be fixed using scripts. 10/10 IGN
