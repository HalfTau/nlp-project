is this the shitiest port ever? I remember when this game came out. I was poor student so i pirated it...even that cracked game by then was running smothly than this MCLive/Steam piece of garbage.I want to play it so bad for the memories...There are few things you love to remember...few drops of pretty boring story that stuck in your memory....But jesus. I always get angry after few minutes of playing. I had to download like 5 mods to get better running, better looking game just get rid of that digusting NewYorkPuke filter in whole base game...eye. It is the worst GTA game...still has many unforgetable pieces but this Steam version is unplayable even with computer that tops recommended spec 3 times.Roman and BrucieLiberty CityNostalgyfew momentspolice missions i miss in GTA5you can say shooting is goodDLCs are decently okdriving physicswobly cars on icenonlikeable main hero if you are not Soviet kid living his AmericanGangsta RP dreampretty boring storyGLITCHES ...THEM ING MILLION GLITCHES IN THE CITYdigusting filter in whole game with washedout colours looks like pukedead city...no rly...this is the most boring city ever. There are no activities and if...they are so bad that nobody is doing it.camera settings, angles, everything wrongThis game is not perfect. But you will remember it and come back to it like me after years. But the port makes the play to be like torture and will learn you to hate this game. GJ Microsoft/Rockstar/Steamwhoever is responsible for this garbage.......gj indeed...
