Though while this can can be fun and can work well, it can have immense loading problems, not only have I seen many reviews where people couldnt get it to load or start I also experienced this first had when I got the game on my new computer and could not sign in or make a new account with rockstar, Im made 5 accounts and none worked and since you need to sign in to play I could never play
