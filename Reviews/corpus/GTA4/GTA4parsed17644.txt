I bought this game and Im having trouble running it in my windows 8! God dammit is it so hard to make an official patch that fixes the issues with Windows Live?After the game starts to load the application is closed and I got this messageGTA IV FATAL ERROR WTV190GTA IV FATAL ERROR WindowsTimerFunctionsValidatorCheck   ReadFromProtectedBuffer QPCFAILED!  Either reboot or reinstall Game For Windows LIVEOK
