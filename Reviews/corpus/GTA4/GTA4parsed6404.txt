Intel has resolved an issue related to games failing to launch with game error code 8016 on systems with Skylake CPUs6th Gen Intel Core ProcessorsIntel Xeon Processors E31200 v5Intel Xeon Processors1500M v5Please contact your system provider or motherboard manufacturer to ensure that you have the proper BIOS update installed.So, if you have like me, a almost 2k PC you cant just start the game... this is so sad, we have 2016 and this company isnt able to deliver us the game without any problems....Thank you securom
