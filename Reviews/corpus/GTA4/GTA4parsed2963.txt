The game is fantastic, has so much more character and depth than GTA Vs story. This dates back to when R cared about SP gaming.So why negative review?Port is still shocking etc so forth.But much more pressingly, the main modding tool for GTA IV, EFLC, and GTA V  OpenIV, has received a Cease  Desist. I dont own GTA V on Steam. So Im reviewing this instead. Take Two
