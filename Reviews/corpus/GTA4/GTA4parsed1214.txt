Grand Theft Auto IV is one of my favourite games in the gta franchise,especially on PC.But there are some major problems if you try to play the game in 2017!!Some people may not experience problems1.Some people cannot run it with Windows 10 Me.2.There are loads of game crashes.3.Social Club and Online features do not work.If Rockstar actually fixes all the problems mentioned in the list,then the game would run with 0 problems!!!
