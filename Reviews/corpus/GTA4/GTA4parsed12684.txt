I do recommend this game for any type of gamer,its a fun game with free roam included,glitches and bugs makes this game only funnier to play,the story is a well concepted one,im not going to spoil it for you 3,the characters were definetly the best part,graphics werent terrible on 2008,Rockstar made a good job,the price 4,99 is just perfect for holidays the only thing I wont recomend are the shadows,they eat alot of frames,test this game for your own and you will see what I am talking about.
