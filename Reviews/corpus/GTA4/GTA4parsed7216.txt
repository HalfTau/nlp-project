 THIS GAME WORKS WITH WINDOWS 10 YOU DONT HAVE TO CRACK, HACK ANYTHING OR SMASH YOUR MONITOR, JUST FOLLOW THE STEPS AND ENJOY THE GAMESo, I read many comments on Grand Theft Auto IVs store page. I was really surprised that many people couldnt open the game or should spend hours to play it. Then I wondered what would happen to me. I decided to download GTA IV when I would arrive home. Here is what happened.1. Bought the game.2. Downloaded the game.3. Pressed play and Steam started installing softwares like it does with every game. DirectX, VC Redist etc.4. While step 3 was in progress, Windows notified me with an error Games for Windows  Live is not be compatible with this version of Windows. Pressed on the notification and it downloaded the most updated version of Games for Windows  Live.5. Then I pressed again Play from Steam, and it first asked me to log in to Social Club in order to play multiplayer. Skipped it6. Game opened, logged in with my Microsoft account, entered my serial and it downloaded the update for Games for Windows  Live.7. Wanted me to restart the game. I did.8. Played for 1,5 hour, didnt even realize that. This game is wonderful.Summary Games for Windows  Live works with my Windows 10 PC like a charm. As I understand, whole problem is with this games files. I inspected the downloaded files in SteamApps/common, what I see was an outdated gfwlivesetup.exe. If Rockstar can upload the newer version, we all can play this game with a single press on Play. Microsoft or Steam are not guilty here. Rockstar Games should update their files with newer versions of Social Club and Games for Windows  Live. Dont be afraid to buy this game, buydownloaddownload last GFWLpress play and enjoy this wonderful game
