Overall, its a good enough game that I have been waning to play for years with an interesting story  satisfactory quests and progression.As far as gameplay goes, it takes some time to get used to the physics, but about 10 hours in I drove like a pro. Like the physics, the plot also strives to be more realistic than the others in the series. It is less comical and absurd, more dark and brooding although there are still some funny parts.It does suffer from being the most poorly ported game to PC that I have ever seen.The bad which there is no fix to1. The game is horribly optimized. It runs poorly on my i74770, 16gb RAM, GeFroce GTX 770.2. It requires you to log into the antiquated Microsoft Games for Windows Live, there is no other way around it besides installing some sort of 3rd party patch which seems very dangerous IMO3. There is a bug in the final mission which I think prevents people using a mouse and keyboard from completeing it. LOL!  I play with an xbox one controller on my PC, but mouse and keyboard users beware.
