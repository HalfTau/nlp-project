If you want to support a company which sends Cease and Desist letters to mod developers, go ahead and buy this and other Rockstar/Take Two games.If you want a game with an annoying securom that doesnt let you start the game if process explorer is running, forcing you to crack your legit copy so it doesnt annoy you with their random t, go ahead, buy it.Otherwise dont buy this, or any other Take Two games. At this point I wouldnt even care if they went bankrupt. Theyd deserve it.
