The reason I like GTA IV more than GTA V has nothing to do with the gameplay or graphics.Niko Beli is the only character in the GTA series that not wanted to be criminal. He was in the Yugoslavian civil war, did bad stuff after this and came to the USA for a better future. He just wanted to live in peace. But yes, stuff happend and he was again in that lodge. Trailer No. 1 is not without a reason called Things Will Be Different.The story, the location, the characters, the music... everything is perfect for people like me.I highly recommend this game. 110/10
