After hours of combing through page after page of advice on how to get this game to run smoothly, and finding nothing, Ive just given up. Jumpy framerate makes it unplayable, while my PC runs Max Payne 3 on the highest settings. I guess this is before Rockstar cared about ports. Wish I hadnt purchased through Amazon, or Id get a refund.
