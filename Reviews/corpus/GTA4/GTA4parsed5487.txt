I bought this game so I could have a fun time online with some friends....Guess what....I couldnt go online.The Social Club login is completely bugged. Every time I enter my credentials an error pops up, and Im not able to play multiplayer, which sucks. Ive looked everywhere for a fix, but so far, I havent found anything that actually works.Im writing this review so that you, the gamer who is contemplating buying this game, will know the risks. My friend seems to be able to play online just fine, but I cant.Im going to refund this game and instead buy GTA V in the hopes of playing multiplayer there.
