Dont bother buying, especially now that its on sale. Its broken. It requires Games for Windows Live and Social Club to be played, and both of these have many problems and GFWL isnt even supported from Microsoft anymore. In addition, the game runs really poorly even on a high end machine. You cant have more than 30 fps and the mouse movements feel sloppy. Too bad it has so many problems, because as a game it has a good story and multiplayer I have played it in other platforms and I was satisfied.
