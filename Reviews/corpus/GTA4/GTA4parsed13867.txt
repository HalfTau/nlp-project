This game is great, would recommend it to everyone, IF it wasnt games for windows live. I cant tell you how many times I have figured, HEY lets play GTA4 online, but then atleast one person got an issue with gfwl so that he cant play it, please, rockstar, if you are reading this, please convert the game to either steam or social club thats used with Max Payne 3 and LA Noire, I dont have an issue with those titles
