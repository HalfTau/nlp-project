Because of a bug I couldnt finish the game. Ive finished every possible quest but because of a bug the phone didnt ring and I didnt get the One Last Thing mission. 6 years after the release and it still has fatal bugs...Not to mention that the game itself forces on a player to play Sims which annoys the hell out of me constant calls from a bunch of people I dont want to waste my time on that can be ignored but it makes the plaer lose some useful perks and the city constructed in a way so that one has to ride a long distance to reach the other part of the city there arent many bridges here and roads that lead to them are inconvenient, there are also very few boats.
