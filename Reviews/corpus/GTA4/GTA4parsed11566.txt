I would love this game were it not for the sheer amount of ridiculous accounts and websites you have to go through to play it.Not ONLY that, but to even play it you have to manually alter the files to work and even get it running.I counted, and I had to make at least three accounts, then transfer another, and then enter a code. I literally did not even get to play it because of how much I had to go through to even get it working.2/10, the creators need to learn how to code for PC and learn not to make it require so many account.
