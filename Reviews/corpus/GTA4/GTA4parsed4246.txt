Thank you Rockstar for releasing the patch which finally enabled me to play the game. Previously before the patch I had to have the game refunded because Social Club never accepted my username and password and the game refused to launch. That bug has now been fixed.And for those who dont already know, the requirement to create a Social Club account and log in to it has now been removed. Download and installation of GFWL client is still required though. If for some reason GFWL doesnt accept your username and password, just create an offline ID, although you wont be able to save your game progression online.Rockstar, if you are reading this please remove the GFWL requirement as well. Its unnecessary at this point, and only creates more confusion. If you really need to give us DRM, give us Steam DRM instead because at least it works and GFWL doesntAs for the actual game itself, I have one word PHENOMENAL! Graphics, story, voiceovers and the ingame radio soundtracks...everything about the game is superb. The computeraided depiction of New York City and the story is very close to my heart and in many ways relates to my own past. The last time I played it, the year was 2008 I paid the full 60 for the PS3 version back then, and so I feel very nostalgic now when I play it. Well done Rockstar10/10
