GTA IV is excellent. However, it is impossible to increase the graphics beyond 800x600. Red writing suggests that 220MB is beyond 3000MB of my AMD 7979 GPU. That is ridiculous. This may be a matter of Windows Live. I woul look to that possibilty for other games which utilize the final days of Windows Live. However, if you enjoy 800x600 at lousy resolution, you can still play the game.
