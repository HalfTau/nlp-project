Thank God I bought this on sale because I have not been able to play it once.  No matter whether Social Club actually allows me to sign in or not, or I choose to play in single player only mode without signing in, the game simply does not load.  And with GTA V freshly released I dont see Rockstar attempting to fix this issue any time soon.  Save your money.  Dont buy this.
