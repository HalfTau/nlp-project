With Grand Theft Auto Five getting big on the pc I decided to come back and leave a reveiw for this game.I ve played for over 10 hours and I had a lot of fuin but there were a bunch of problems.And me writing this reveiw isnt going to be easy.GoodThis game had customizable car skins and was moddable which made the possibilitys unlimited.Also the online made it even more fun because you could hang around with your freinds and go skydiving and ect.Another good thing about this game is that there are a variety of vehicles.Now the story was good for a diffrent type of game the story was a good story but did not suit grand theft auto 4.BadI have so many bad things to say about this game.First of the driving,it is horrible it feels like your driving on ice and  it was really hard to make turns and I would always crash into a lamp post.Also it took so fCking long for the story to get into action and did I mention 6 missions into the game and it doesnt give you a gun,The only way you could get one without the game giving you one is getting it from killing a cop.Its so annoying and ruined the whole game for me and I was so happy rockstar made Grand Theft Auto 5 because they fixed everyhting that was wrong with Grand Theft Auto 4.My experience with game was okay it had a good story but took to long to get wepons and I feel like that they shouldnt have put the tag crime on this game.And for rockstar to top this game off with horrible driving mechanics and driving experience I would give this game a pathetic 4.2/10To see more reveiws and join events join my group Ostrich MLG!
