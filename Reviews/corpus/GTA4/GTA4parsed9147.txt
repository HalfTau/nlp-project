8/10Of course, its a waystone you cannot miss. The most of Rockstars GTA games feels like beginning and the end of all parodies and wannabe open world action games at ones time. Gameplots, mechanics, subsequential and miscellanious stuff  all openworld games developers imbibes and adopts every sip of that astonishing game series.But, hereafter, with GTA4 you have onetimethrough game. Storyline so dense, so alive... and weird for the most of us, that you need only one look at it. Vice City or San Andreas was very different, there was much more fun for returning in game in threefour years after the first time. Even knowing its teensoriented, even with all that PS2level graphics I still adore San Andreas most of all Rockstar series...Okay, back to GTA! Oh, sorry, GTA4, I mean. Its cool. And Episodes from LibertyCity are cool as well. But... They all are grim. Even horrid sometimes. And the worst part is that you most of you dont really like your protagonist. Hes proficient, even wised up guy, okay. He had a hard start, thats okay. Hes a psycho killer, fine, every main GTAguy goes like that. But besides all of that... there are big hole with vacuum. It drains emotions out of Nico Bellic, out of any of his companions, activities. It drains YOUR emotions, so you dont know how to get excitement out of this game. Onetime goer, for every opportunity in game. No more!Until mods came by, of course. But not for long again. GTA 4 is not a hit, not a brilliant of any kind. And those damned DRM protection you need to work out... Very soon this game will become completely obsolete, comparing to new games. All hails to GTA5, that is!
