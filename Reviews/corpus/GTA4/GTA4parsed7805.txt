Another jewel in the GTA series, with a bigger sentimental value to me than GTA V. Its perfect in its own way. It is true that the game itself is bad optimized for the PC port, but the story is the most realistic in the whole GTA series. I may be overreacting because the main character in the game is from the same country as I am Serbia and since it doesnt get mentioned a lot this really means to me. The war protagonist Niko went through actually happened in age of 19931995, which ended in a 5050 deal. There is one thing that Im not sure Rockstar did on purpose or not, its that he went to war very young. If he went to the army in the last year of war, 1995, he would be 17 at the time. If he was there since the beginning, he would be 15 years old happens, but really rare. A lot of them complain about the thing with WFGL Windows For Games Live and it is a bad thing, but its 1530min to set up and its worth the wait. I say Rockstar did a good job on making this game, and Id give it a straight 7/10.
