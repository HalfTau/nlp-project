I ing love this game. The people and your cousin Roman who wont stop calling you. The game missions are amazing, I love the bank heist. The game also lets you have friend with certian abilities that you can upgrade, like Romans taxi that drives you around when you kill millions of cops. The way that they let you choose who you want to live or who you want to kill, and it changes the game and its endings. It has a great way of playing with cheats and modsnot in he online portion If this game isnt in your steam library ITS A MUST OWN. Buy it now!
