I bought this game almost 6 years ago, and I should have played it back then on Windows XP/Vista. Fast forward to the present. It took me several hours to even get the game to run on Windows 10. Once I got it to run, I had to deal with all sorts of glitches, crashes, and BSODs. I stuck with it, because I had heard so many great things about the game.However, I didnt find the story very interesting or the characters likable. You spend WAY too much time shooting from cover and the shooting mechanics suck in this game. Add to that the fact that the mission structure has no checkpoints. If you fail a mission, you have to restart the ENTIRE THING. Does Rockstar think its fun to slowly drive for 10 minutes tailing another car? It isnt.The last straw was when I finally got to the final mission. After having to replay it several times, there was a gamebreaking bug which wouldnt allow me to climb into a helicopter, resulting in the character plumeting to the ground and me failing the mission. I retried it several times and the same glitch happened. Disgusted, I uninstalled the game.In its current state, I CANNOT recommend this game.
