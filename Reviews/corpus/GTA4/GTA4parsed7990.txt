Angrymode engagedSo. Downloaded and installed gta4 which id bought on steam a year ago. It suggested to make social club account for online crap. Ok. Did that successfully. Then it suggested to log in to windows live account to enter game key there. Did that. Key didnt work. Managed to find out that steam key may be an activation key and not s/n as it is supposed to. Activated it on. Installed games for windows live crap formcause its the only way to see s/n key from there. Got 80070005 error. Googled it. Tried everything, including registry editing, custom tools from ms and 3rd party stuff, scripts, reinstalling. Everything. Didnt work.So. Apparently ive wasted some money on gta4.
