GTA4 is a brillaint game in my opinion. Some people critisise it for being too small and not a lot to do but from my experience it is a brillaint piece of gaming. The downfall has to be the missions due to the repetative nature of kill these people and drive me here. There is hardly any choice and the choice i did get was let him live or kill him which, as far as i can tell, only changed a very small part of the game. The map looks quite small but feel quite big to me. It does take a while to unlock it but after that is is quite enjoyable. The car handeling has brought up a lot of angry conplains but again, after you master is it is really quite fun esspecially being able to drift the car. The multiplayer, i have to say, is not very good at all and i have not spent a lot of time on there but it is quite biggy and a lot of cheats go on. Overall this game is very good and for the price you pay it is well and truly worth it.
