I have Windows 10 and this game is absolutely unplayable unless you go through a HUGE process. So I just gave up. Also, apparently if you have a good size graphics card, something about the game makes it to where it cannot recognize it so the graphics are stuck at lowest possible settings. Absolutely love the game played it on XB360 but it cannot run on my machine, sadly.Windows 10i5 4690KMSi GTX97016gb RAM
