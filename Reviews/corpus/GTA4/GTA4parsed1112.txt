If you have a newer system like me, it can be hell to install this game, it also runs like garbage on  newer high end systems like mine. If youre having an issue launching the game and you have a newer system, try downloading a BIOS update, you can look up tutorials to do this if you dont already know how to do it. That is what worked for me after not being able to play this game after upgrading. The reason Im recommending the game is that GTAIV is a great game, it is one of if not the best GTA, and if you havent played it yet I totally recommend buying it. However be cautious because this game has a ton of issues when playing on a computer, if you have a older system that meets the requirements of this game you should be fine. But if you have a newer system you may have issues whilst playing this game. Also just to put this out there. The game does require Game for Windows Live which is a program made by Satan himself, so just a warning.
