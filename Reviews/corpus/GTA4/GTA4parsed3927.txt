Many other people have already reviewed this game, much better than I could ever hope to. I just want to add a very simple thumbs up and recommendation here as well. This is one of the finest games ever created. And thousands of mods created by the alwaysactive GTA community like iCEnhancer give it even more value. Ive probably spent more time enjoying Liberty City than any other game world, besides perhaps Fallouts wastelands. This is a mustplay game. My rating for GRAND THEFT AUTO IV 10 out of 10.
