Nope. Cant even. Bought the game, tried to make account, account gets messed up and locks me out, tried to launch singleplayer, wont even launch. Cant delete account without losing access to GTA. Dont recommend this game, too much hassle just to get it to work or even run. Was excited to finally get it, but...changed my mind.
