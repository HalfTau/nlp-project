This game really had the potential to be a legend, but Rockstar Games kind of failed to achieve that. The graphics are decent, the physics are very realistic and the story is fun but unfortunately the optimization is poor for PC and the map is small. Also the variety of vehicles couldve been broader. All in all its a good game, Id recommend it if you havent played it yet. Be aware that the multiplayer is problematic, think twice if youre planning to buy this game for multiplayer.
