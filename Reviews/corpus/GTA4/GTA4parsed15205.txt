GTA IV actually feels like a downgrade from its predecessor gameplaywise. Much of San Andreas content was cut off the game like planes and bikes. No driver licenses, no street races, no gym and no hairstyles.The world of GTA IV is dull and boring. No mountains, country sides or deserts. Its just city and asphalt. The different parts of the city have no remarkable identity of their own.The characters wont help either. Each one of them is pretty boring and unlikeable. There couldnt be any relationship estabilished between me and the characters. The protagonist, Niko is the only one remotelly likeable through the whole game, as the game does a good job telling Nikos story. Some characters are just easily forgettable.Gameplay is fun. Rockstar always does a good job with the physics. I like how the impact of car and guns feel in this game. The cover system is also a cool new addition to the gameplay mechanics.I hate how the game sort of forces you into engaging social activities with the other characters, such as bowling, strip clubs and all this bullsht. I dont feel like playing mini games with characters I dont give a damn.The story is good at least. I like how Rockstar told Nikos feelings of being a stranger in a stranger land. The game also delivers a good job at showing Nikos progression from being a small timer to a big gogetter.GTA IV feels like a close friends party with obnoxious people trying to hard to be your friends and boring you to death. The only reason you attented this party in the first place is that youre close friends with the host, but the overall experience is unappealing.You can still have fun with GTAIV and its gameplay and fun physics, but is by far the worst entry in the series. Get it really cheap and dont expect a San Andreas like experience.
