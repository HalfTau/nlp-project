This is a great GTA, but not as good as San Andreas and V.It has a great story and the characters are original. Gameplay control is fantastic except for vehicle driving which they finally fixed in V. The driving is doable, just more complicated than it should be.My main problem is the back tracking. Copying NY city is a cool idea at first, but it gets boring after a while. NY is basically just dumpy dark color buildings everywhere. But what sucks is having to constantly drive long distances to get somewhere so you can play a mission. Playing a mission is actually playing the game. Driving there is more of nothing. Your not actually playing. Its like driving your kids to school, it is a task, not fun. And it is worse when the mission is hard, and you have to keep driving back to do it again.You can take taxis, but only so often.Otherwise is good old GTA fun, just the previous and sequel are much better.
