Actually the game itself is good, you will enjoy every minute playing as Niko Bellic your Russian mate  live in Liberty City doing badassetc. But what it lacks is the steam version is badly optimized, here are some occurance on my PC Pros  Really nice story, enjoying each mission Openworld exploration Liberty City You can climbing building and enter building in various places Nice melee combat with pedestrian MODS really nice Car mod and etc. and of course your cousin Roman who always calling for fking play bowlingCons  Random Crash Random Stuttering / Lagging FPS though you have a good run to fix this just launch the game from GTAIVLauncher.exe directly not from Steam Fking annoying Steam Overlay popup in 34 minutes while playing the game using controller plugged in. Dead LIVE Multiplayer seriously I cant play with my friend coop like  using PeertoPeer method or something ? even LAN Multiplayer is DEAD, cant even find my mates room on server browser, this is the most frustating thing ever, my friend even claiming a refund for this the overall performance is really underwhelming though my potato PC can run BF4 in High Setting 4560 fpsIf you dont bother playing this in singleplayer then I might be reccomend this game in your library but if you want to pass time with your friends or squad better get yourself a GTA V copy its a lot better for MP.P.S  actually there is some method to play MP with some mods and tweaking but it really pain in theso dont bother to try it yourself, trust me
