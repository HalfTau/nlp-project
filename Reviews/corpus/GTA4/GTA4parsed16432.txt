The 2008 sequel to Boyz in the Hood The videogame, it follows the story of a man named Nikola Beli and his path to leave crime, but for some reason still accepts jobs even when he is rich.The story is rather serious potrayal of crime life in Liberty City, even though 99 of the brands have comedic names and Nikos cousin is only there for comedy.The physics are realistic and hilariously broken at the same time, and same goes for the AI, shooting, driving, and pretty much anything that is controllable by the player.PC port is so badly done it replaced Crysis in the famous line Can it run Crysis?. Updates did fix a lot of bugs and generally improved the port.
