Gameplay Ok, Story Nice, Online mode Nah, you can find one or two people there. The think that was a total shock to me, is the fact that money is NOTHING there. Ok, you can buy guns and clothes, other than this, money is useless. This mean, the moment you finish the game, you will have nothing more to do. I expected more.
