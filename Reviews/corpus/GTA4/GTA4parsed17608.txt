PSA. Do not purchase. The game is completely unplayable. Due to games for Windows live. Its unfortunate that Steam does not pull games like this. Or at least warn the consumer first. So purchase at your own risk. Other than that Grandy Theft Auto IV was a great game. Better than GTA 5 in my opinion.
