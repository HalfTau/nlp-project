well i black screen and havent even start the tutorial yet. luckily bought it on the summer steam sale. RAther play San Andreas and 5 anyway.LOL EDIt time It took me days just to get it working Wat the Actual ! Ugh I swear what a terrible port. My review is going to change right? Yes because it will take you hours just to get it working. Had to reinstall and uninstall the game just so it would work. I have windows 10 btw. I recommend it if you like to work around just to get the game working.
