Its pretty good if youve got a beefy computer for it. It has likable, diverse characters, and a pretty large world to explore. Also, this game is hilarious. It makes a huge parody of the world we live in, and I love it for that. Theres also a lot of mods for it, if you know where to look! Even if youve never played GTA before, play this. Its not as good as GTAV in my opinion, but this game has a special place in my heart.
