I bought this game for 12 dollars exspecting it to be amazing like the old days on xbox 360. but was shocked after waiting 3 hours for the download that i couldnt play the game. all i get is a error message. ive looked at a few you tube reviews but they arent useful. this game was a waste of time and money!
