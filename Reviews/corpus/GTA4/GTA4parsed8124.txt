Great game. Not sure why so many people are having issues. im on a windows 10 pc and it works fine for me. i was able to log into gfwl with no issues. havent tried multiplayer yet. i just did the play offline option when the rockstar social club login popped up. ill update if/when i try the multiplayer.edit I see more people saying this does not work on windows but this is not true. im using 10 and everything works fine. dont know what people are doing wrong.
