CriticThere is something new in this GTA, and what I felt playing for the first time was incredible, the physics of the people when hit by a car, ragdoll at his best, and i love ragdolls, the graphics was a revolution for the GTA series because it went from cube shape personages to round ones. There are many more secondary missions and jobs you can do than in GTA San Andreas. You gotta play it! Although the history is the second best in my opinion to the GTA series.Rating  93/100ConclusionThis is one of the best games that I ever played, so I highly recommend you to play this game!
