Broken piece of crap game wasted 8 on a game that thinks my GTX 770 has 54MB of memory stupid GFWL ruining every game it touches and to top it all off, the game doesnt even start. great job, rockstarUpdate After some modding and config, the game runs decently. the graphics are quite inefficient and choppy even at high settings
