I really like the gameplay a lot compare to GTA 3 and vice city that I played on my old PSP.Escaping from cops is a lot more easier than previous GTA and much more challenging. I like the story as well and I like how you can make certain choices to choose to proceed the story.I personally like to play single player than multi player.I have no problem installing GTA 4. Fixed it by upgrading my BIOS and also installed and signed in Games for Windows. I also signed up social club but never log in yet.So Im not sure why so many complain so much about unable to play the game when therere already solutions on the forum to fix the issue.Im waiting for GTA 5 on sales. Now its kinda expensive. Haha..
