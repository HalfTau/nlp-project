I love the game! Why negative?IT DOES NOT WORK ON W10/8/7 properly or absolutely RANDOM and Rockstar Games does not patch Securom/GFWL out of the game!It is RNG, if it does work or not mostly not!Same Problem on W7/8 RNG working, not working!Played it as retail version two timens through and also here on Steam purchased again as bundle with LC Stories.Still ROCKSTAR GAMES is not able to provide a patch removing Games for Windows Live, nor Securom copyprotection total BS!Unacceptable from my side.So a negative recommendation for this game actually for the Devs!.
