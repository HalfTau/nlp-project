I have not been able to launch this game since the first time I played it, which was the first and only successful launch I had just afer I purchased it. It crashed midgame so I exited out and rebooted. After going through the Social Club menu and logging in, it said successful login and then never booted up. I tried it offline and it only informed me I was offline, well no thats what I wanted to do. Either way, I got a beefyer coomputer and it still wont run. Dont waste your money.
