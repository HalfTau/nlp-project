Rockstar answer to the new physics and graphic improvements asked by the GTA community. It has a rich story line and unexpected turn of events. Great open world to explore. But not massive like San Andreas. Just aIittle glimpse of what New York is in the eyes of Rockstar developer. Immerse yourself in the glory of new graphics and driving experience in this game is really adaptable. Those who have drive a car in previous GTA might need to take another shot at the drivong license. Its gonna get bumpy! Get it!
