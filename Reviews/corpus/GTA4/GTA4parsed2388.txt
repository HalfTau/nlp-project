Grand Theft Auto IV on Xbox 360 is, in my own completely biased opinion, the best in the series. An interesting and immersive city, a tight plot with memorable characters and cool setpieces, a satisfying gunplay and driving component and a great soundtrack on top of that makes a recipe for success  on consoles. GTA IV on PC is a complete and utter shambles that I needed to get a refund for because it simply wouldnt work.I admittedly dont have the best computer, but Max Payne 3 is completely playable save for some stuttering during heavy gunfights. This games port is one of the worst ever released on Steam and its genuinely insane to believe Rockstar or whoever they outsourced this to didnt realise that something was seriously wrong with the game. If youve got a total powerhouse of a computer youll probably be able to run this. If you really, seriously want to play GTA IV and dont have a top of the line rig, get it on console. However, I have to say this  if you can get this working its an easy 10/10 game.
