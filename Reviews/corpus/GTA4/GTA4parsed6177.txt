Cant even launch the game by itself without altering anything, as a game should start up. Game is decent, but there are very serious issues on PC. Here I have issues regarding Securom DRM gone wrong?, while other people get GamesForWindowsLive and Social Club issues preventing them from playing. I have yet to find a solution, but the game lost its appeal for all the trouble it gives with this.Nevermind the 41 hours spent, this was on another PC, other windows and dirty laptopThankfully I have a console version.
