This is by far my favorite Grand Theft Auto game of all time including the dlc which is gay tony and lost in damned.Nothing could top this game for me.It is much better than gta 5 in my opinion.This is a game that i first played on xbox 360 and i had the time of my lives in the old days on xbox.Then i got this game on pc long time ago and it just brings back all the memories of the good times i played this game on both xbox and pc.Including the dlc.Its my favorite game of all time a game i can play forever.The story for all 3 games are amazing and the multiplayer of all 3 games are amazing 10/10 game for sure.
