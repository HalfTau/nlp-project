This game is quite fun, so much chaos.. but... it didnt age so well, even at 4K resolution, youll need to use ENB or some sort of other graphics mod to get rid of a low resolution haze. If you want anti Aliasing, you either use the ENB, or if you have dedicated card, you can force AA yes, even at 4k resolution it has aliasing issuesThe recent update fixed the GFWL problems, you no longer need to hunt for the latest GFWL from Microsoft to play, itll install and work now on windows 10. Rockstar also fixed the launcher, no need to login every time you start the game, just connect your Xbox Livegfwl gamertag to your Rockstar account once, and from then on, just click playBut.. even with all the issues, you get a really good game for the time it came out, but comparing it to modern games would be a mistake. If you love the GTA series, dont pass this up, but, if youre new to the series, just get GTAV.
