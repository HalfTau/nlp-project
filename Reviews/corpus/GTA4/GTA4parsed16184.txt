WELL THIS SUCKS!!! Let me explain i bought this game for 20 i install it and everthing is fine! until it ask me for a CD key and an activation code! it only gave me the CD key NOT the activation code! i looked it up and could not find any way to fix this! so now i just wasted 20 on a game i cant play because rockstar didnt give me the activation code! Guess i just have to play San Andreas.
