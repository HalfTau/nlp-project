Terrible console port, has issues running well even on modern PCs.Uses GFWL and rockstar social club.Graphical glitches like texture flashing and popups all the time.Slowdowns or even crashes with prolonged police chases due to crazy police spawn rates.Besides technical issues, the story is poor with plotholes and schizophrenic main character full of contradictions.
