I preowned the game on disc and got it from Steam on a bargain, because discs are a hassle.Cant get this st to work on steam. Errors, memory allocation problems and other  problems I never had with the discs I was using. So please, dont buy this wonderful game here unless you want to spend your evenings correcting problems you should not be having in the first place.Back to Google...
