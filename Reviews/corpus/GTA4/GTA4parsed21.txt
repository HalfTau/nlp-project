Im going to try not to bias this review, but it will end up being very nostalgic, so please, take this with a grain of salt.Grand Theft Auto IV is, as I like to call it, An oldie, but a goodie. Graphically, it aint all that bad, but others say otherwise because they want it to look like real life Hypocrites, praising VR games for realism when they look like cartoons and shunning decent looking games Anyway, I played this back in first grade on my new Xbox 360. I loved it,  Never finished the game, but I intend to now. Anyway, the gameplay mechanics are a little confusing at first Friends  Girlfriends I loved the friend mechanic, I remember eating microwaved leftover Little Caesars pizza while I bowled with roman I loved it, but I miss it, he never calls me I also remember hating certain characters Brucie and Michelle are prime examples I have a few major complaints. The damage to cars if you ram them into a wall is staggering. Engine is practically inside the dashboard after a major impact, Its uglier than any games destruction Ive ever seen. and I also hate the physics Werent bad for their time, just awful ex Rams bike into car at 10mph, goes flying into car a thousand feet away. Although, it did bring the hercules swing. Not all bad.Overall, I rate this game 9/10, Buy this game if it is on sale though, 19.99 is not a good price for a 10 year old game.
