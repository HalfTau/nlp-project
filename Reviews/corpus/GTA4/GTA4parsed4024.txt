After I saw the news that gta IV recieved an update that makes the game compatible with windows 10 and other fixes I decided that I would give the game one more chance.It didnt disapoint this time ! Great story and  lots of things to do across Liberty City.The only downside of the game is the requirement of an microsoft account in order to autosave.
