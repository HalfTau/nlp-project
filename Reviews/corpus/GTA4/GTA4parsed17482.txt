This game the sucsessor to the preious installment and spinoff, GTA San Andreas. Its engine is like no other engine out there. Each indivdual pedestrian have their own, fun personalities. Even though it can get a little boring and repetitive at times, the action will keep you playing. There are countless mods that will expand and enhance your experience, some of which are must haves. I would definitly reccomend  GTA IV to be added to your steam library.8/10
