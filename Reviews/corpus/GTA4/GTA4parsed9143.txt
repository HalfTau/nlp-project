The story in Grand Theft Auto IV is actually one my favorites so far. They put a lot of effort into the story like they did in San Andreas. This game has a lot of missions probably highest numbers of missions in any Grand Theft Auto game. The missions are not hard, just a bit tedious, because of no checkpoints. It goes back to Liberty City, which is the best interpretation of New York City to date. The controls of this game felt a bit off compared to the previous game. You turn slow, and the vehicles controls are a bit hard. They made it a bit more realistic and obvious to see, they wanted to do something new.It the first major title to use this engine. The graphics looks pretty good, but it was obviously more mindblowing back in 2008, because it went from 3D to HD graphics. Its still perfectly playable, but the textures are low quality and the colors are bit boring, because it takes place at autumn. Also the concrete buildings does not make it more attractive neither.Great talented voice actors, who matches they over the top stereotypes. All the humor in this game is wellwritten and it is incredible subtitle, but dark. I am not a huge fan of the songs played in the radio. I dont know any of the songs, which is the only negative thing. Vehicles and guns sounds authentic.IV disappointed me at first and in general it failed to live up to the expectations. After playing it a couple of times, I realize what direction Rockstar was going for and I actually quite enjoyed it. The more times I play it, the better it is. People should give it another chance instead of hating, because it is not a bad game.
