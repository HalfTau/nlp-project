Ive played this game more than the hours say  I had it on a different account.I never particularly liked it, since Nikos character irritates me and the missions are pretty repetitive, although the story is very well written, and the graphics are very impressive for the time.I would recommend this game if you can get a good deal for it, perhaps if its on sale or something.Also WELL DONE ROCKSTAR for actually making this game work on PC after several months of irritation. Kudos to Rockstar for bringing out a patch for an 8 year old game with very few dedicated players.
