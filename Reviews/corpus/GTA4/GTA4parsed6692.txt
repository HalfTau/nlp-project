This is maybe the worst pc port of all time. I ended up buying it because i have read that the launch issues where fixed but apparently im having this error Seculauncher Failed to start application 2000Yes i already uninstalled visual 2005 and reinstalled it but didnt fix it at all. I also reinstalled Grand Theft Auto 4 with the same results.How rockstar can have 4 drm included in 1 game is beyond me. Steam being drm is already enough but lets count shall we.Rockstar Social Club 1 Steam 2 Securom 3 and 4 Games for Windows live.How you can work so long on a game to trow it all in a bin with adding drm like this. 4 drm in 1 game can u even believe it?????????????????????Seriously how dumb and blind can you be?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????A day at Rockstar.Lets screw our customers who paid for it by adding ton of drm and let it be the worst optimized pc game of all time and lets sell it for the full price at that time. How dumb can you be by giving people who download the game huge advantage no drm.  I have nothing against pirating probably almost everyone in this world has pirated something including me. Developers should look at piracy with a different view. Look at Good Old Games they actually know how people who pirate think. Oh wait the ceo of CDProject Red was part of big cracking group. What a surprise?.Seriously Rockstar will probably never read this but if u will REMOVE DRM PLEASE its Customer unfriendly and it costs u  a ton while ADDING NOTHING. Securom should also be mentioned for making pc gaming worser then it can be. So now im off trying to fix which shouldnt even need to be fixed if u didnt make those stupid mistakes by just screwing over ur customers and making it harder for them to even play ur games and yes im on Windows 10.
