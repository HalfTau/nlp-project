Played though the story mode so far. Have not touched online outside of a handful of missions.This game absolutely channels the spirit of Saints Row 2 and GTASA in terms of creating a vibrant open world. The graphics are obviously currentgen, but the amount of detail Rockstar chose to go to in terms of creating an memorable and interactive world is astoudning. I feel like Im looking at a modders pet project, not a commercial release, except that it is an AAAquality release. The PC port has been fantastic for me, the story was good, the driving feels fantastic, and the combat is okay.I might put the shooting part of the combat in particular behind other current titles like the Saints Row series, but being a FPS/TPS really isnt what the core of this game is about. The 3 person protagonist is amazing and I hope to see it return. I missed the other 2 cities from San Andreas but I can certainly understand why they chose to just reprsent Los Santos and the Red County area. Nothing feels clonestamped, everything from the tangled mess of retrofit freeways to the placement of ing sand dunes out in the scrub/desert areas feels lovingly handmade, considered both from an aesthetic standpoint and a gameplay one.I obviously cant speak too much about the online as I havent put much time into it, but its extremely rare, especially today, to have a game with so much quality ooze out of every single aspect of the game, Especially from a AAA commercial title. Every single person listed in the credits should be proud of their part because as douchey as it sounds, this title is an honest to god masterpiece.
