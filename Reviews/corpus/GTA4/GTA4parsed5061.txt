I do know what to say exactly. I have played GTA 3 through my childhood and i loved it. Therefore i had high expectations from this game. I think i did not find the escence i was looking for. But i realy wanted to like this game.The social club login is failing and you may have freezes in loading screen and you can not play this game online.The game is obviously have a potential and rockstar seems realy have put lots of effort into this game. I have played for almost 40 hours and actually had fun. Because it was not always shoot people missions. There is an average story and weird characters too. I had some fun and it all vanished after finishing the game.So i do no recommend this game because there are technical problems and does not live up to hype. I do not have GTA 5 but i think GTA 5 is a better choice when compared to this.Oh i forgot. Unfourtanately, bad optimization is killing the gameplay.
