GTA IV was my favorite GTA game in the entire series. But Rockstar has recently ruined their reputation by first downgrading san andreas behind our backs and now abandoning GTA IV entirely. The online mode is abandoned. Rockstar SOcial Club no longer connects. Single player resets everytime I play. Settings are unchangeable. THis game is a broken mess.
