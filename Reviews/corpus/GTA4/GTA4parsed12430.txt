Not to be a stickler..... but are you ing kidding me. i boutght this game with high hopes that, yknow. Id actually be able to load the ing game. but instead im asked to jump through hoops? sign into this, and that to play? gotta make this account and that account. i had to join a ing rockstar social media website and i STILL CANT OPEN MY GOD DAMNED GAME. is this a user error, or is rockstar gangbanging PC users as usual.
