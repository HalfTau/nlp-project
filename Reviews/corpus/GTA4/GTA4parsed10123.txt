Got 5 stars for visiting website of children beauty paegants.10/10 would love to get chased by army again.Sidenote I was afraid to buy it because many people complained that GTA 4 had crash issues with Windows 8.1 but, I decided to wouldnt mind spending 3 since its on sale right now . Well, thank God I had no issues, really enjoyed this game.
