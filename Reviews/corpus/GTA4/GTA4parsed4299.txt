This games performance is just awefull... Whether I play the game on max settings or lowest, I still get lag spikes. None of my components are bottlenecking 4690k and gtx 970 monitored using msi afterburner and to me the lag spikes just make the game unplayable. If you guys could just clean up the textures and somehow make the game actually utilize hardware when it needs it, then I could probably comfortably play this game.
