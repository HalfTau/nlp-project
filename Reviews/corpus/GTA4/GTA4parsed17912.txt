Literally the worst console port Ive played in my entire life. Almost all of the hours were spent trying to get a decent, minimal framerate but nothing will do, there are huge perf issues even in the lowest quality. Fun fact is that there is little difference in framerate between when I use max or min quality.I deeply regret having bought this.EDIT  Oh also be aware that this has three DRMs on top of Steam  SecuROM, Games for Windows Live and Rockstar Social Club. Seriously, dont buy this
