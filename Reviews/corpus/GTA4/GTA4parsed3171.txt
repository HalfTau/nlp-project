what a game, somehow you like it but on other hand youre not.Love the story, realistic i felt characters, and i like the city environmentsbut its good just to be playedgood cars and motorbikes!but driving and riding? its sucks! too much drifting and bad camera angle.like i said, its good just to be played.
