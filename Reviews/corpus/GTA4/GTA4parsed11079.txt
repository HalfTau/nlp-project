GTA IV is a good game. GTA IV on Steam, with support from Rockstar is horrible. It is the ultimate waste of money, because the game is unplayable in the state that they sell it in here on Steam.I purchased the GTA Bundle on Humble Bundle, and almost every GTA game fails to start or run on PC / Mac. Rockstars support for the games it sells is just ridiculous. For example, the GTA San Andres update removed content from the game, and added bugs AND screwed up controller support.GTA IV will not work when you press play on Steam. It will ask you for a Windows Live Sign in ON STEAM, and then ask for a Rockstar Social Club login. The Game has 3 levels of DRM on it, and one of them is no longer supported.To get this game to run you will need to1 Download Games for Windows Live Client2 Make a Windows Live account3 Make a Rockstar Social Club account4 Press Play on Steam, and then realize you need to go into the local files and run the game as an Admin EVERY SINGLE TIME.5 Once you get the game running, you will almost always run into the legendary GTA IV VRAM bug. You can fix this on Windows 8.1 by making a shortcut of a shortcut, adding command lines, and then running the game WITHOUT STEAM. Yes, a game sold on Steam that will not run off Steam.6 Once you fix the VRAM bug, you will realize that GTA IV has horrible PC optimization. It runs like a man on crutches.In addition, this game doesnt support modern graphics cards, so you WILL have to trouble shoot and waste time setting up commands to fix VRAM and Sign in issues.In conclusion, Rockstar should not sell a broken game it does not support. Having this game for sale in its current state is a complete joke. I had problems with GTA San Andreas, GTA 4, and Liberty City. I pretty much gave up before trying to run Vice City.
