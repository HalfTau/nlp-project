Awful port, GFWL, unplayable on systems that should be able to kick this games FPS will dip to unplayable levels unless you have a great computer which you absolutely should not need to play this game. If you have a nice computer and are willing to deal with GFWL among other things, go ahead and get it. If not, steer clear. Nice mods, though.
