Grand Theft Auto IV should have been named Drive and Shoot Simulator IV, because thats about all that you do. This could have been fine, if it werent for the fact that the driving controls are maddening and the gun gameplay is dull, dull, dull. At least the later parts of the Saints Row games let you have wacky fun, GTA IV just seems obsessed with taking itself far too seriously even when trying to make a joke. Save your money, get SR, same exact type of game with more fun, dollar for dollar. Unless youre one of those bizarre German Simulator fans, in which case this is right up your alley.
