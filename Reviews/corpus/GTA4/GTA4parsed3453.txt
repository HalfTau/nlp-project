Great game, but its ruined by Games for Windows Live. Having to follow multiple guides to get into my save game has prompted me to uninstall this game, probably permanently. If you use Windows Live for other stuff and know how to fix it without going through multistep guides every time you want to play, its probably fine for you.That said, the game itself is quite good. I generally found few bugs or glitches, unlike previous games in the series I used to fall through the ground at least once every 20 minutes, minimum, playing Vice City, and the story line is interesting. Guns, cars, motorcycles, Helicopters, planes, not much more to it than that.
