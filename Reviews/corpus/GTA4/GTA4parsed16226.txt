COMPLETELY REGRET BUYING THIS GAME. Having spent the last hour setting up a windows social account, a windows live account, trying to get the game to run, none of them work. I now try to save and the only option is to save online through these 2 accounts, neither of which is accessible without an internet pop up which minimises the game and then the game will no longer remaximise without crashing.I bought this game on steam, for the love of god let it run through steam. This is also the 21st century. Why on earth can I not have access to my own damn save file? Why must it be on some Microsoft server which is hidden away by a number of over complicated questions and mechanisms. I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE CAMPAIGN.You really have to wonder who programmed and designed the way this game was to be played on PC, checked their work at the end and thought to themselves Yeah, thats simple and good. No wonder Steam is beginning to dominate the gaming market.
