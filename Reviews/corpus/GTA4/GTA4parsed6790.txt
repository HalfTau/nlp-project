Has always been a terrible port, but a lack of decent support or even a decent build of the game has left it unusable. The game treats modern hardware as if it cannot handle the most minimal settings.I am unable to play this game without downloading and opening a broken copy of Games For Windows Live Marketplace, and after that the game will open. Then, it runs in 800x600 and it will NOT let me modify it on the grounds that, and I am not making this up 200/3000MB is the maximum my system can apparently handle despite the figure of using 200 out of 3000MB of ram...I doubt Rockstar will ever care enough to fix this port or give owners what they paid for. Dont buy this, avoid it like the plague.
