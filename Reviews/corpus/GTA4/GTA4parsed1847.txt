Game doesnot run... just the first copyright page loads and then the system crashes not just the game but the system by itself... which will force me to restart ... I have a upgraded gaming pc which should easily handle any games released atleast till 2017... for sure the issue is with the game itself  ... trying to fix it from past 2 weeks.. got fed up ... unistalling... its insane to believe that game that was released before 2010 doesnt run in the upgraded gaming pc... I am not going to buy any rockstar products in future...its my first and last mistake... l will prefer ubisoft, valve, activision over rockstar products...after buying this game the only thought that stays in my mind is that rockstar are born cheaters... very much like trevor from gta5... The entire gta community is angry with mod ban while in my case I play only original contents never played mod on any games and it looks like rockstar has fooled me in buying a saddest ecopy of all time... I have a completely different story to hate Rockstar Products... RIP rockstar
