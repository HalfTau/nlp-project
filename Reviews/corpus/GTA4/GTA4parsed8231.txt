Playing GTA 4 for the time I did was very fun on PC, it brought back a lot of memories and reminded me of what I really loved about the game. I played about 40 hrs on my ASUS GTX 660 Ti, once I upgraded to my GTX 970 the game simply could not run. After doing multiple fixes Yes, this includes adding a commandline.txt file the game could no longer run at 60 FPS and will never again. I hate to see such an amazing game with such a horrible port, it will most likely be unplayable.This was such an amazing game when I first started playing it, I had an amazing time on PC getting to replay a whole story on a complete different gaming setup. I did die a little inside when I realized that my beautiful 970 would forever butcher this game, leading up to the ultimate demise of uninstall action.Please for your own good, avoid this game at all costs.
