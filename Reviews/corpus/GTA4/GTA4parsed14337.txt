I love the GTA series, but this one is not really one of my favorites. The city of Liberty City has a lot to offer, with its corrupt police force, newspapers, and drunken irish mobster, but the controls themselves makes the experience less attractive, and more painful. Driving around in a car feels like driving a bathtub, as does just walking around.The story itself is kinda good, although youre gonna do a lot of Walk here, kill this guy, escape cops kind of missions... Oh, and Bowling too. Lots and lots of bowling.All in all, i approve of this game. If you like the GTA genre, Saints Row, or just any other kind of Shooter Sandbox, then youre gonna love this!
