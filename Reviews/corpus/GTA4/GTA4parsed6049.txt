After playing GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas it was hard to imagine being swept away again by another GTA game but man does this game deliver. The story, the characters, the setting and the game world are so well crafted and put together its nice to see some developers still take time to prepare their works and not just milk a franchise with yearly releases.
