DO NOT BUY THIS.I dont understand how this is still sold. It does NOT work on windows 10 and apparently on other versions too. Many asked online for help, and no solution has been found yet. I contacted Rockstar Games support and they ignored me.What happens You install the game and spend 3040 minutes to fix graphic problems, reinstalling missing or old files, giving launch commands on Steam and making a Social Club account etc.No matter what you do, this game will crash as soon as you start the game or for some others, apparently a couple of minutes into the game GTA IV FATAL ERROR WTV190 GTA IV FATALERROR windowsTimerFunctionsValidatorCheck ReadFromProtectedBuffer QPCFAILED!  Either reboot or reinstall Gme for Windows LIVEObviously, rebooting or reinstalling Game for Windows Live doesnt work.This is a scam, the product is impossible to use, many had this problem and we are being ignored. DO NOT WASTE MONEY.
