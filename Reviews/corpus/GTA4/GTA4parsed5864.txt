Well,well,well...GTA 4.Isnt it that this title is telling you that this game is really good? Well...NOT! I had some problems at activating this game starting the game.The launcher is totally outdated.Anyway,after 23 hrs i have solved this problem, but after entering the game there is another problem bug, i couldnt sync my Social Club or Windows Live account with this game, so i could save my progress. I thought ok.Theres a skip button...Lets press it.Finally, i entered the game.After doing some optimising settings, there is no change in the game,the same fps rate..blahblahblah...which means that this game is not optimised correctly for pc by the developers.At least Rockstar Games learned from GTA 4 and made GTA 5 a better game for pc and not only a good one for consoles.Thats all folks!Windows Livean awful  gaming  platform which exists just to frustrate people if id be Bill Gates,i would DELETE it
