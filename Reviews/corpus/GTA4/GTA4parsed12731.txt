DO NOT BUY THIS! I should have read the reviews before buying this... Had this 2 years ago and it worked fine but lost one of the installation disks and wanted it for my new laptop. Low and behold it keeps saying the activation key connections has failed and would you like to retry in 30 seconds which does nothing but want  you to retry and if you hit esc the game starts up the main title loading page but that is as far as it gets. HORSE S!T is what this is!
