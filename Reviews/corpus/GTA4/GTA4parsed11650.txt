Grand theft auto has never failed  to impress me. This was the next gta right after gta san andreas. Graphics have improved, you can use your cellphone, hit internet cafes and use the computers, and etc. Game is well done made and extremly fun. If your into coop gaming than you should get the modits a police mod in which you play a police officer. This can be played single player or online.
