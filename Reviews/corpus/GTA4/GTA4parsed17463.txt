A GREAT GAME LET DOWN BY STEAMUndeniably the best GTA  game purely for the mods and addons. BUT.....relies on DRM THAT NO LONGER EXISTS  you will find yourself twatting about for ages getting downloads from third part sites just to get the offline savegame to work  As for multiplayer  just forget it.Hardly the download on steam and click play experience that it ought to be.Bitterly disappointed in Steam on this one.
