Controls are VERY poor. There are countess FPS games that have done a better job with controls, suprising they havent done anything about it. I found myself stuggling even after many hours of play to control my character, screaming at the screen while trying to perform a simple task. When you have to reload several times because of crappy controls, its frustrating as hell.And now this game has problems galore with Windows Live, Newer OSes, etc.Dont bother unless you have an older PC with older OS and dont mind getting carpal tunnel syndrome.Too bad...
