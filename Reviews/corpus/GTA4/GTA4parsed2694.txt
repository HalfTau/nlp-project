As much as it pains me to do this, I can not support what Take Two is doing against the modding community. Instead of banning mods out right because some new mod using OpenIV can mess with the online. How about you talk with the developers of OpenIV to actually patch this mistake so you dont kill all new sales and start a PR nightmare.From the statement Rockstar released it sounds like this is just Take Two and not Rockstar. In the past Rockstar have shared different awesome mods. This just sounds like Take Two having problems and not Rockstar. However, I may have missed something where they delibertly talked against the harmless single player mods.I absolutely love the GTA series, and sadly I will no longer be playing or purchasing any games with Take Twos hands in it. Once Take Two figures out this is a terrible idea for their company, I will remove this review. I just can not recommend any Take Two games right now.The worst part is, Take Two owns Kerbal Space Program now....
