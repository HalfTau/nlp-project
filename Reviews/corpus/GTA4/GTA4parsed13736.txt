Im not a person for reviews but GTA is just a fun game to screw around and mod. I havent beat the game yet because I keep getting distracted from trying to locate the rarest cars and modding the game. Too fun! Also if youre having issues with starting the game, do please read the discussions for help beforee you write a negative review!
