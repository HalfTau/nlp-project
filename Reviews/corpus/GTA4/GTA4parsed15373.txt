The bad first.  Windows live to play...that sux.  The online is little more than chaos.  Just mayhem, no rhyme or reason that I can see.  You cant really spend your money on anything.  Yeah, ammo and stuff like that, but you cant buy real estate, upgrade your car, buy attachements for the very limited number of weapons you have available or any cool stuff like that.   That being said, I had a lot of fun with the single player.  The storyline is really lame, but the missions can be fun and challenging.  Lots of races, car theft, highspeed chases and pigeon slaughtering.  Oh, you can shoot hookers too, so theres that.  I recommend it only because it is so cheap now, but still worth the money they are asking.  I will purchase GTA V based on my experience with this title and probably pay full price, that is how much I recommend this game.
