Grand Theft Auto IV This game is the first in the series to introduce more realistic driving, shooting, impact physics and quality graphics, which contributes significantly to its success. A huge leap up from San Andreas in that regard. As usual theres the regular weapons youd expect in a GTA title, the AK 47, handguns, grenades, RPGs, microsmgs and more. Online multiplayer which can be quite fun, with deathmatch and race modes. Average story, the setting wasnt the best. I didnt feel much connection to any of the characters, even the central one, Niko Bellic  unlike GTA V, San Andreas and prior titles. It just wasnt that interesting. Typical revenge theme which has been recycled by Rockstar for several entries. Some attempt to integrate moral decisions into the plotline, where a few choices in missions can have effects on the future. Nothing really exciting here. No planes to fly, no parachuting, no bicycles, no side activities like GTA San Andreas triathlons, car races, girlfriends, businesses etc are all gone, none of the mayhem of GTA San Andreas. A lot of stripped features...not much clothing selection so limited customisation. Dull city with no breakup of scenery, theres no lush forests or desert regions. The entire game is set in urban areas, industrial districts and streets, making it a bit of a boring experience.Overall Score 7/10Grand Theft Auto IV is one of the worst GTA titles released. In most gameplay aspects it was a massive step down from GTA San Andreas. With that said, it still scores decently for being entertaining, improving the graphical standards and shooting for the series and having a reasonably worthwhile story.
