Grand Theft Auto IV is in my opinion the second best GTA game because we all know GTA San Andreas will be the best. GTA IV offers about 2540 hours playthrough without the side quests. The World and the Graphics are alive and in comparison to GTA V the streets feel more alive. The are hundreds of interiors to explore and the giant subway system, I will not comment about how dramatic and awesome the story is because you just need to see it for yourself to be able to fully understand it. Overall Grand Theft Auto IV is a must buy for those who have a buffy PC. Personally I had lagging problems but I downloaded a Mod which makes it still playable with the game running at Everything Maxed out with 5080 fps.My Rate 9.5/10
