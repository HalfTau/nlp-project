TLDR Plan to skip most cutscenes, get a time cycle mod or crank up the saturation setting, taxi everywhere, only drive racecars when cruising for fun, and youll likely enjoy this game.While not as good as the earlier GTAs, IMO, its still a pretty decent GTA title. More or less, the shooting is much improved, especially using K/M. The driving, however, is worse than ever until you get the high end cars every other one seems to fishtail like mad and isnt realistic at all. Another of the many setbacks is driving around the game world just feels like crap and often takes a lot longer to navigate with less fun. Bonus sometimes you will get to a location, only to have an unskippable mission interrupt via your phone. Then you can drive usually all the way back to where you came, and then drive all the way back to essentially where you likely were! Seriously, playing this game while abusing taxis to get just about anywhere is a MUST. Save your driving time to mission specific efforts. One other thing is the extremely washed out, default color scheme. It can be fixed by using a time cycle mod, which usually comes with an ENB shader, or maxing out the saturation setting under graphics/display while ingame. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy looking at faded green and grey colors for 20 hours of gameplay.I know this sounds like I dont like the game, and I didnt for a long time. But I keep coming back to it because it is fun to play. The story is pretty bad, as the characters are overly dramatic and really annoying ,tbqh. But theres a reason this game has a strong following in the mod community and its because the game and its engine are really fun to play around with.Edit Holy crap, does it have GTA final mission curse! Helicopter controls are awful with K/M and that is one of the final missions, apparently. What a disappointment
