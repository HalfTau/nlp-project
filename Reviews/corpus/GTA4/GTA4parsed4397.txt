Downloaded some graphic mods, so now the game looks amazing when I have to go bowling with my cousin, Roman! 10/10Honestly this is one of the best Grand Theft Auto games in the franchise. It surpassed a lot of peoples expectations, at the time. I personally enjoyed this game on the Xbox 360, but the PC version is the better one of course. You can mod just about anything in this game, and it is fairly easy to do so. I know most people hate on this game because of the annoying Windows Live. But it is easy to bypass, by simply downloading a mod that turns off the service altogether. So with that in mind this version is still the best one available, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun open world game with a great story, gameplay, and modding community.
