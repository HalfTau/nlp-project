Its not that this is a BAD game.. Its just so buggy. When I downloaded it I got so excited when it finished downloading ON STEAM. But then it downloaded all this other stupid stuff, and I cant even open up the game. I paid 6 dollars. I deserve a game thats worth six dollars. Not something that just says Hey do this social club stuff or dont and dosent ever open.If you ever DO get this game, then try getting it on console. Ill change this review if I end up figuring out how to open the damn game.
