No need for Social club you can just play offline, Getting GFWL fixed was easy.So took about 10 minutes. Game works fine dont know what all the negativity is about, sure it could have been easier in the sence you buy you play kind of thing without the setup but come on complaining over 10 minutes of setup.Works greatSerbian pronounciations in the game are awful but i like itI am serbianMore slav feels8/10 only cause of the setupEditAfter 32 Hours i finished the main story its an amazing story.Will play more doing random missions and total destruction.Too bad i cant run GTA V on my computer.
