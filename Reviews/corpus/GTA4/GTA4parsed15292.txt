The game wouldnt even launch. I could only get it to work after downloading a random file off the internet.It didnt warn me, but this game requires Game For Windows Live. When I tried to use my current Windows Live account, it rejected it and said the service wasnt working.... So I used an old, depreciated account tied to an email I dont have access to anymore and the game finally worked. Its tied to that older account forever.Games for Windows Live is another DRM scheme that sits on top of steam, which is already DRM. It took about 3 hours of troubleshooting just to be able to get the game to work. Because if you dont register the game, it wont let you save anything.I bought this game to play Episodes from Liberty City. I ended up wasting that time with just trying to get the thing to work. Just borrow the console version from a friend. I probably wont buy GTA V on PC at this rate.
