I dont recommend getting this if you have Windows 10. Apparently you have to download some sort of third party software to run it offline, or install some Microsoft thing to run it online which is buggy as hell. If you dont have either one of these the game simply wont start. For a game made in 2008, thats pretty pitiful, Rockstar.
