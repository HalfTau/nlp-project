At the present time, this game is actually unplayable. Not from a metaphorical point of view, but objectively. You cant save your game without being logged into a Games For Windows Live account, which is now impossible because Microsoft took down the GFWL servers and discountinued the service, as it was considered by most to be intrusive DRM and a waste of time.Anyway, you cant save the game, and you even need to put in special launch codes into the executable to be able to modify the graphical settings, for what is overall a mediocre game anyway.Not worth the time/10
