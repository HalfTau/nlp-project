Prevention of modding after all these years?Rockstar after the update you turned a fun gaming environment into a linear piece of finite gaming garbagewhere you have to play the devs way or the highway.Logically under current conditions Saints Row IV offers the same things but a whole lot more.This update changed nothing except making me your enemy.I will never purchase a Rockstar game.I will never support any Rockstar game or affiliate.Never bought GTA 5 but I heard of all the shady crap pulled with the shark cards.Pay to win is it?Thats okay.Uninstall simulator.I will wait for you to economically back yourself into a corner as you fade into nothingness.Then laugh as your stocks fall to the ground and everyone forgets you like everything else inour tiny existence.Mwhahahahahaha!
