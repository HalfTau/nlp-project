I remember buying this a few years ago, at nearly full price. My computer couldnt run it at the time, unfortunately, so I shelved it, called it a day, and told myself Id return to it when I could run it.Years later, I reinstalled it, wiser and older, and able to do all the fun stuff I should have been doing with money and a great setup.Needless to say, I found the game in a sorry state, and unable to be played, due to the abandoned DRM and the faulty Club system.If you ever need a game to point to where DRM went terribly wrong, GTAIV is the perfect example.
