Horrible port for PC, crashes after passing the log in window for social club wether or not you log in. Even after going through the pain of fixing the first bug, the settings are completely screwed up for the game and you have to create your own commandline.txt file to fix the graphics settings not working, and then finally once you try to start a new game the opening cutscene begins when you get a fatal error. This is on Windows 10, even after running in compatability mode. Nice one Rockstar.
