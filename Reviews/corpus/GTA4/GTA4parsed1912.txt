Story  10/10Protagonist  10/10Gameplay  10/10World  10/10Atmosphere  10/ 10Very well done Serbian protagonist     bonusMy favourite GTA ever. It beats even Vice City in my eyes. The driving mechanics are a bit shaky but once got used to, it is a lot of fun. I personaly can drive better in this game then in V XD Story is linear which I think is a plus, things graduate evenly, you get the beginning, the middle and and end. Liberty City is living breathing city and with around 250 missions, Episodes included, you get to know almost every corner of it.
