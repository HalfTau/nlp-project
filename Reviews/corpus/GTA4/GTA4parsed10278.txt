DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT INSTALL ON WINDOWS 8.1This game is fantastic though. All GTAS are.When you install, the first thing it will ask you is if you download GFWL Games for Windows Live. Suprisingly it is still up. You HAVE to get this for it to run on Windows 8.1. Otherwise, it will crash your game and not play at all.When you finally get it to work, you have to get a good video and graphics card, otherwise they lower your graphics settings.When I got to downtown, the game just crashed.Buy it on Windows 7 or XP. Dont get on Vista. 2/10 for PC version, 9/10 for game itself. Buy it on sale.or just get GTA San Andreas.
