If you have windows 8 32 bit DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I dont know what three year old coded this but i got it in a bundle with san andreas and san andreas was better. There is first of all the glitch with opening it and it crashing and restarting your computer. I eventually got that fixed so i could actually get into the game but wait, the title screen is on an endless loop because in the config files its set to use some ludicrous 32 Gbs of ram or something stupid like that that i had to change. I finally get into the game and after the first mission i do some walking aroun and guess what? There is no floor. I can see cars an people. Thats it. Chunks are missing everywhere. The game is near unplayable. Maybe its better for windows 7 but for me this game was a waste of money.
