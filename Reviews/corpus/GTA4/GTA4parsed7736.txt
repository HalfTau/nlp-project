Story Great, really good story. I liked thatCars Great psychics. Also good.Bugs Ahhhh little bit worseSocial club Terrible, I was forced to create new account IDK why and then it logged me of and I am not able to log in. By the way i couldnt choose nickname, it has been chosen for me.If you are patient, than it is a great game. Story, psychics, side quest, activities, bowling and stuff like that is waaaaaay better than in the new GTA...
