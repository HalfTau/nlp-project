The story is insane, some people say its boring, dark, etc...but you know what? The game is great, the gameplay is fun and I really love the physics, they are something that GTA V needs! I mean, for example, when you crash into a lamp or a car and you start flying like crazy or the ragdoll... its so cool! I strongly recommend getting the game!Ill rate it a 10 out of 10
