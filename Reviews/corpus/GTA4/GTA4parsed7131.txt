Took me like 2 minutes to download what i needed to get the game running. Even without all the mods you could download this is definitely worth it. Sure the performance isnt the best, but its definitely playable on moderate machines, i was running it on max setting with a gtx 745 years ago with 30 fps. Definitely grab it on sale.
