Great GTA game and definitely one of the best made. Far better than GTA V. Way better gameplay and story and online isnt a grind fest full of micro transactions. Mods are great too but most dont work on the newest update so you have to downgrade to make most of them work. Still a great game and doesnt actually require mods to make it fun unlike GTA V. Overall 10/10. Would go bowling again.
