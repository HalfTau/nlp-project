Ran Gta 5 with Highish Graphics on my mega machine, 60 bloody beauty ful frames pre second,Rarely any Dips or drops.Ran Gta 4 with Highish Graphics on my mega machine, Baffingfully less then that, a ton of dips and drops.So its rumors are true, this is a very butchered port that no Mega Machine can run 60 fps on this.even atfer installing all the crap since i planned to play this game offline, GTA 4 performence wise and Gameplay wise feels sluggish and not as smooth in GTA 5.Dont plan on getting it for your mega machine if you want a smooth performence.. you will be disapointed.Update the new patch 8 update didnt do a dang thing if they didnt fix the major performence issues which still makes my points above valid. nothing to get excited here, move along.
