I loved the graphis and modding capability of Grand Theft Auto IV and V. I only bought their games BECAUSE of modding. Both games are alive because of community involvment and modding. LSPDFR, Real Life Mod, real car skins, etc. Hackers put scripts into GTA Online and now rockstar/T2 is punishing everyone for it. They try to look like they care, and they probably do, but they messed up. They need to develop better ways to filter the online mods rather than take down an innocent program for people like me who want to do Police RP with LS and LCPDFR. LCPDFR is probably one of the only reasons people buy GTA IV anymore. This is just like in real life when 1 bully in school can ruin the day for everyone when whatever everyone was having fun with is shut down.
