This is where LCPDFR started, its a must have if you love to mod theout of a game. This did fix a lot of the unoptomized crap but that patch 8 doesnt work with mods at the moment, so you have to revert back to patch 7 to play with most. If you get it for LCPDFR it is worth it, other than that, not really.
