Wonderful story and truly elaborated characters. Physics are great as well as realism in general.Such a good game for its age and year. No regrets about the money i paid.Optimization could be better, especially if i have a good hardware i actually do, GTA V 45fps on high settings. But FPS sometimes are incredibly low about 30. Happily not lower.In some sense the game is better than newer GTA V. Yeah, the newer one have its own feautures and additional ways for fun. But somehow lost some good things from this one, like physics.I wont make it long, just watch the video GTA IV better than GTA V on youtube. I found there a lot of things i agree with.
