I love GTA and everything about the series. The game was fun played on xbox 360 but I can not get it to work on PC. I bought the game with a GTA bundle package. I would love to be able to play on PC for the mods. I give the game a solid thumbs up but for now until the issue is resolved it will be a thumbs down.
