Okay, I replayed this game countless times on the xbox 360 version of this game I just recently decided to replay this game on pc And i never modded on this game but i just want to say that its a REALLY  move to remove mods from people. And i get its legal stuff and all that t, i really want toon take twos decison but i just cant ive replayed this game as much as i can remember and when i was younger and suffering from depression this game would always help me with its funny and memorable characters and memorable gameplay. So i just have to recommend this game to peple who dont mod games and are fine with playing the normal game but for people who modded game before hand and want to do so with this one then i wouldnt recommend this but even then i think you should at least give this game a try.
