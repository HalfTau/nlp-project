I really liked the game at first but THE T THIRD PARTY CRAP IS SO ANOYING. I bought this game a few years ago and it was working properly after an hour of work to make windows live and rockstar social hub work properly. but now i think they changed something and they ed it up completely. i tried to install it yesterday and got to play it a little but Windows live has aserver. i cant change the password of my old account because of theservice and now my game cant be saved. my brother tried to install it today and literally nothing works for him. he cant start the game, cant connect to windows live or rockstar social hub.all in all the gameplay is fine but if you really wanna put a giantin your consumers , adding third party software to your game is the best way to do it!!
