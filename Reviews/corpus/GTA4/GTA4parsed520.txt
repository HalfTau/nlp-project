i can see why people  dislike it, especially with the driving. i also really dont like the way you have to sign into external things for it to save. i am not a user of xbox live or microsoft live or whatever it is, and its just inconvinent as i have gta san andreas from.. a third party.. and i dont have to save to any external things.overall i give it a its ok, i guess.edit ok yea i realy do not like the way it saves. i cannot save my game at all.
