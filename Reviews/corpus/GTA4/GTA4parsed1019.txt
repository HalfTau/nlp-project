Gta 4 is simply another fantastic game in the series. Gta 4 has a more realistic and serious tone. Not only in the story, but in the games colors, looks and physics. Never have I ever seen another open world game as realistic as gta 4. The story is easily my favorite out of the whole series. Its a lot more serious, but it still has some of the traditional gta humor here and there. This one is quite linear in terms of activities and map size compared to san andreas, but there is still quite a few activities that are still worth while. Hanging out with friends is such a really cool feature if youre really into the characters and story. The world may be small, but it feels so alive and contains so much personality. Its so much fun to cause mayhem in. This is a great game for story and gameplay. To invest yourself in the dramatic and depressing story of Niko Bellic, play some pool or go bowling with yourself or with friends, or cause mayhem.Also, for those that are having trouble, you should be able to just make a rockstar account and then sign in to play.
