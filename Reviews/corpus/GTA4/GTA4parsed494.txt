People have come up with many different solutions to the issues players have with the game on windows 10. I dont know if anyone before me said it but the one that worked for me is validating the game files everytime before I launch the game and set its priority to high from the task manager regardless of being signed in to windows live or rockstar social club etc.Hope it works for you too!
