great game but not pc port because the first time i booted the game up it said grand theft auto has a fatal error and i just prayed to god that nothing happended to my pc because that would be a lot of money down the drain I think im fine for now also it doesnt even have my monitors resolution i have a 1600 x 1200 monitor every other game i have played for pc has that resolution so that sucks also if it did have the resolution it wouldnt even let me change it because i cant change anything in the options menue for some reason and everything is tuck on low graphics and like i said the resolution looks all screwy because im stuck on like 600p and even if i wanted to play at 600p the max refresh rate in herts is 24 and in my opinion that is unplayable i want 60fps minimum because thats what my monitor can handle since its a 60 hertz monitor bottom line is my pc is amazing and does everything i want it to do i built it for my purposes and it does them perfectly great editing pc more than fast enough for me and absolutely great for gaming but this game wont let me use my pcs potential since i cant turn anything up like the resolution settings and visuals and without turning those up i think its pointless to play i refuse top play it on 600p at 24fps on low settings, however, im not complaining to much since i bought the game for 4 on sale before gta 5 came out for pc. I Still dont like to get burned on my money so i would advise against buying it also im not even gonna mention the windows live player or whatever problems but that did get resolved buy a weird update.
