For me, its undoubtedly the best GTA game in the series, and now,after 10 years of playing it on different platforms, I finally took the time to buy it on Steam.The story is not what I wouldve previously expected from a Grand Theft Auto game. Its dark, witty and left me hooked for weeks, and after Im done playing, I still come back from time to time.Liberty City might not be the largest map in the series, but its attention to detail at the time of release is outstanding. For those who expect a more laidback and easygoing GTA game, Id rather point them towards GTA V, but for those who like a bit more serious approach with the occasional wellknown sarcasm from Rockstar, youll like this.
