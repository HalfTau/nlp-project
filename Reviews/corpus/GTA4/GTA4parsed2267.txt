The best Grand Theft Auto in the series.The combat,vehicles,characters,music and of course the cops,fat cops are the best to have fun with,whenever you knock them down or engage in a shootout.The story is fantastic,and the environment of the city fits its daily life.Combat is a bit more expanded than seen in Grand Theft Auto 5,due to Niko being in the army,he sure does know how to handle fights.Characters in the story are really good too,some a funny,which you may not even understand Little Jacob.If your bored and need a game from Rockstar Games get this,dont want to play story? Have fun with cheats, like killing cops etc.Overall I would recommend this game.
