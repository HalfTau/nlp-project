Absolutely loved the game.This game is a full on package like previous games of the series.Great story,missions and characters.gta 4 might not be as open as San Andreas but still the missions beautifully manage to steal our minds away from this fact keeping the game fun to play and enjoy.Recommended to all gta and openworld lovers.
