GTA IV is basically Rockstars beta test for building a game in a whole entire engine. Im not saying this game is bad, but it definitely gave me mixed feelings overall. Theres a very limited amount of things you can do in this game compared to all other GTA games, also the new physics engine they implemented in thsi game is not refined, therefore very frustrating and quirky and 95 of the missions are pretty much the same. The story is decent, though and the graphics arent bad, but GTA IV is also a console port to PC, so do not expect great performance out of it. Ill recommend this game because its decent and fun, but please, dont pay more than 10 for this game!
