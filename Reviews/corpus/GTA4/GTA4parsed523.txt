Like all of the titles in the GTA franchise, the game itself is execellent. However The video performance within the game is very poor on my hardware. This is despite newer, more graphicsintensive titles with equivilent settings e.g. GTA V running very well on this machine. The game would silently refuse to launch after being installed. This had something to do with the Microsoft Games for Windows redistributable which I had to install manually from the game directory for some reason. There are a whole lot of dialogs related to the Rockstar Social club that I have to dismiss upon launching the game. Also, the title screen displays what appears to be an error message from IE presumably the game relys on a website that doesnt exist anymore? Lack of loading feedback when starting the game difficult to know if the game has crashed or if its simply loading. The title pops up with a Product Key every time I launch it. I thought that managing the DRM side of things was what Steam was for?Given the technical issues outlined above, its difficult to recommend it, sorry.
