This would have been an awesome game if not for the integration with windows games you have to register with Microsoft, and the bugs. First there are the visual glitches that take you out of the moment. Then, there are the game breaking ones... for instance, the last mission is buggy and I like many others couldnt finish the game despite trying many, many times.
