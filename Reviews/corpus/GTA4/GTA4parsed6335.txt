A little tricky to get running. A few patches and and file replacements before you can play, but once you can youll realise this game has aged like a fine wine and is still as butkickingly awesome as it was at release. Packed full of interesting and just outright psychopathic characters, cars galore and radio that never ceases to shock you to your core.8/10  Would vandalise again
