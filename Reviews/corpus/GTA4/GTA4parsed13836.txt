Good luck trying to start this game, after four layers of DRM, one of them being GFWLURGH I could not change any graphical settings.. I love this game, but I hate everything you have to do just to get to play it. I do not recommend getting this game on the basis that were getting a new GTA on pc soon and this one is such a damn hassle to get started.
