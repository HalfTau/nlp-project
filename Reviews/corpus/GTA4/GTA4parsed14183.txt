I dont know why steam even sells this game. Rockstar was clearly not aiming to realsease this on pc. All of the bugs and errors to me hours to fix, such as seculauncher failing to start apllication to having to download a new version of GFWL to the infinite loading screen. Save your money to buy on Xbox or PplayStaion cause it is a great game just not on PC.
