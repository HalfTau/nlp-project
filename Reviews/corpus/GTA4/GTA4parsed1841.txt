Do not get this game on PC. This game is absolute proof that rockstar has no respect for its PC audience. Its already a problem that the game wont run without mods, I needed to mod plenty of my favorite games to work like Oblivion. The problem here is that unlike Bethesda, Rockstar does not want you to mod your games. Now that OpenIV is gone I cant find any GFWL mods from non sketchy places. All I can say is, F uck you Take2.
