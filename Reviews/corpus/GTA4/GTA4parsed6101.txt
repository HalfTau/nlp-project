I would recommend GTA 4 for those who enjoy spending hours troubleshooting software and/or hardware incompatabilities.I on the other hand thought I was purchasing a GAME as opposed to a homework assignment.  Not happy I spent money to try and resolve Steam / Microsoft Live issues, I thought that was what the people who work for Steam are supposed to do.  7.5 hrs into it and have still not yet been able to play the game.
