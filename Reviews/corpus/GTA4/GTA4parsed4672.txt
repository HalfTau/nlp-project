Absolutely unbelievable that Rockstar Games has the audacity to leave that game in the stores.Do NOT buy this game if you have any newer than Windows 7. Even then I think you are out of luck if you have sth newer than Microsoft framework 3.5 .The problem lies in this game using 3 antiquities you do have no support whatsoever anymore Securom and old, dead DRM System Games for Windows Live Microsoft Framework 3.5 An old social club login that wont connect to the server anymoreGranted, one might find a MFW 3.5, but after looking for 5 minutes I couldnt find a page with the full standalonethe 3MB webinstaller will only install the current 4.0 MFW 3.5 that didnt come from a shady looking site.But even if I could get the game to run, being in the presence of GFWL once more is reason is enough to climb the walls, but this game simply wont work anymore  atleast not via Steam, it might work with an actual hardcopy.Ive been facing many scenarios like this before, but after 4 hours of frustration and trying to apply every possible fix I could find on the internet Im throwing the towel  that is a first for me.Worst of all things is the lack of support by rockstar games. This is not a 2003 console port, which will blow up with by the potency of current GPUs, this is a friggen game of 2010 which still cost friggen 20 whopping bucks and rockstar seems to incompetent to throw this piece of garbage drm out of their .exe for a game that probably already has received all the damage piracy could have done to it.From Software removed gfwl weeks after its dismissal.
