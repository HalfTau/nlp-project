This game is absolute garbage. I honestly have no idea why its so widely popular. The controls are trash, the soundtrack makes my ears bleed, theres not a single likeable character, and after 2 wasted hours of playing there still doesnt seem to be any real storyline. After five minutes I was as irritated as Ive ever been with a game, but I continued for a couple hours to give it a fair shot. I normally wouldve played a bit more before reviewing it, but I just couldnt take it any more. I paid about four bucks for this thing during the Steam Winter Sale, and it still wasnt anywhere near worth it. You couldnt pay me to play any more of this absolute waste of my time.
