Warning This game several hoops in order to get the full experience of the game or even play this game.Just like the other reviewers you needRockstar Social Cant log in to it, cant even make an account to log in to it. So unable to play online!Game for Window Live  In order to SAVE, you can auto save or regular save in order in SINGLE PLAYER! This is outrageous. Also another step in order to play, you have to log in again!Unable to change the display settings unless you go in the files it self and add no restrictions because of some ram complication issue. Even if you do go no restriction, it locks to 30fps on the highest setting even though my computer can go well and above that. Even on lower settings, cutscenes have immense screen tearing while the game itself ran somewhat smoothly.A review for game itself, it age pretty poorly and the controls are mediocre using a controller for this. The best thing about the game that stand the test of time is definitely the voice acting and music. I feel like these characters are real, some are loveable, or believable, just a nice cast of characters. But I cant recommend this game to anyone.
