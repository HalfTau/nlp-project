I whish i could choose something between YES and NO.In my opinion, a game which is fun to play with a big BUT, because now im using the cracked version. Why? I got a pretty good Computer the last weeks  Win10. GTA IV isnt compatible with Win10. Games for Windows Live The most annoying programm on earth wasnt even continued after Win7. So People also got Problems with thaton Win10 and even Win8. IF you finally get GTA IV to start on Win10 by trying everything, using many and different Fixes Which are often made for Win8, then the mouse is pretty buggy, you cant edit Graphics settings. Okay theres also an fix for the Graphics settings, but when you want to start the Story, youll get an infinite loading screen. After many hours i spent on getting the loading screen problem to work, i gave up.The funny thing is, the cracked version just runs completely fine. Installed  Works.Of course Rockstar/Microsoft could bring up a fix, but they wouldnt get Money with it any more.Sadly, because im using a cracked version, im not be able to play this Game online. The Multiplayer isnt the greatest Played it a earlier on Win7, but sometimes its pretty funny. If youre someone who wants to purchase GTA IV and have Win10. DONT DO IT. You wont be able to play this game! Better purchase GTA 5 then, but its Multiplayer is pretty ed up More than GTA IVs in my opinion.PS Just for your information, downloading/creating cracks isnt illegal. Copying this game is illegal, and because i had it installed, i didnt needed to pirate it somewhere, just installing the crack.Have a good day!
