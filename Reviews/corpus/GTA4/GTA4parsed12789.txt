great plot and storymany memorable charactersextremely immersive and beautiful atmosphereperfect sized worldnear unlimited freedomperfect balance of realism and insanityone of the best multiplayer modes ever madegreat soundtrack and radio stationscrappy pc portcertain parts of the game didnt age wellI really cant recommend this game enough. IV is by far my favorite game in the GTA Series, though I realize that Im definitely a minority when saying that. Youll probably either love it or hate it. It comes as close to perfection as any game Ive ever played.
