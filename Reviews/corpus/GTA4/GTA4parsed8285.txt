Please do not buy this game.  It is broken in so many ways.  At first it wouldnt lauch  no problem, found a fix online and kept going.  Then the game was inexplicably stuck on 800x600 resolution.  Weird.  Found a fix, then onward.  Then I had to set up 4 different accounts, two of which required pain in theemail verification.  Im annoyed, and this is clearly ridiculous but I press on.  Then my c.d. key is invalid.  MY C.D. KEY IS INVALID?  HOW?  This is beyond busch league, but I keep going.  Look for a fix.  Find a fix.  Appently fix stopped working over a year ago when Microsoft stopped supporting one of the 4 things I just had to sign up for.  There is no fix.   this game,  the developers,  microsoft.  No virtual  is worth this.  Dont buy it.
