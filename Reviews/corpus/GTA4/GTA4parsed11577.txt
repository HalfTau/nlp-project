Good graphics, fun side missions.Much of the same as the previous games, but worse than some because theres no real customization options or decision making. Its very linear and gets old quick, not much replayability.Best part is the ability to mod the game and mess around, but really there are better games out there for that.Was a fan of GTA years ago with VC, SA and even III but if you like these kinds of games Id suggest playing Saints Row instead, theres much more freedom and their humor is more enjoyable.
