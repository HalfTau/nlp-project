This game taught me everything I currently know about bowling today. I am a 12 time champion in my bowling league and it was all due to a game that was less about crime and going bowling with your Serbian cousin, Roman.Grand Theft Auto IV is very educational. It is a must have if you bowl on a regular basis, as it has helped me learn several new tricks, such as throwing myself in front of the balls of the rival teams.This is without a doubt the game of the generation, and the generations to follow.10 out of fcking 10.
