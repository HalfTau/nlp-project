Absolutely it is a good game. Ive played this game on playstation 3 for thousands of hours. Had literally a lot of fun. After not playing it for a few years, I decided to respect the oldie classic and purchased it together with one of my friends. I thought it would be better on master race. You know, 1080p60fps and such...However, there is the Games for Windows Live integrated the game. You cannot play multiplayer without it. You cannot play with it either. I hoped they fixed it after 7 years, but obviously they didnt. It gave so many errors during my 4 hours gaming period. Ive spent total about 7 hours to fix those errors but I am still unable to play. My friend gave up, so do I. Im holding this game in my library just because of good memories.If youre planning to play multiplayer, dont even try. If youre planning to play single player, its ok.
