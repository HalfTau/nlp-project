Between this and GTAV I would say that this is my favorite one. This game has so much attention to detail it really is a creation of love. The story is great and the characters are unforgettable. Its a great game that I think anyone that is a fna of the franchise should play through. Though be warned to save you need to use GFWL and it does not run well on modern systems at all. High end 2017 build Other than that it is a great game, play it, you wont regret it.
