This game is way too long and repetitive too.First, its a poor PC port that requires 3rd party DRM to run.Second, its aesthetic primarily consists of shades of brown and grey.Third, Niko controls like a tank.Fourth and final The game has a stupid dating game shoehorned into it that will make you tear your hair out because its incredibly boring.These sacrifices of fun for the sake of novelty realism might have blown minds in 2008 when the game originally came out, but these days developers dont include such features in games because theyre BORING.
