Man this game is so instense. First thing i had to do is battle the first boss GTAIV.exe has stopped working. As soon as i destroyed that problem yet another boss battle appeared but this time it was the Windows live boss running some gang called microsoft in the east of liberty city. The fight was so intense as I searched for hours on how to bypass these bosses. Sadly, I failed the game as now every time i press play I go back to boss one...
