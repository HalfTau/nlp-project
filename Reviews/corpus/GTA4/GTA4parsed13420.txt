Wwhat the hell are you reading reviews here for? Anything that needs to be said for Grand Theft Auto IV has already been said. Just buy it already!In fact, why the hell am I writing a review?While Im here, though, I will say I personally recommend it. There may not be a more realistic openworld game out there, especially if Rockstar listens to its hardcore fans in the future. Nothing is more fun to mess with than reality.And on a sidenote, taking a walk has never been more appealing.
