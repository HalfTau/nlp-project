This is by far the worst port I have ever seen. Couldnt even get it to go past the first splash screen without crashing, and that was after hours of trying every solution on here and around the web. It required a crack to simply run, and thats withouth taking into account that it wont even make it to a menu. This port is so badly broken it should be a crime to even sell it.Edit I have no idea what I did differently, but after reinstalling for the third time and swapping out my old  i7 heat sink with aging thermal paste with a water block, it just worked. Had to make a local profile in game for GFWL with the newest client to make it save, and the game can be still slightly bog down  even on great hardware in occasional places, but otherwise it runs as good as it possibly gets with this port. I recommend the game, but only if you are willing to play the lottery with your install.
