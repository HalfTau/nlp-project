Almost refunded due to Windows Live Signup and Controls. Bought Saints Row 3 cause of Customization, but realize there isnt a lot of mods for it. Bought GTA4 on sale cause of Mods.I would suggest you get X.Live.less Drop the dll file in GTA4 Folder if you want to stay offline.Oh Snap I saw X.Live.Less Without the Periods Blocked, Okay I guess whom ever thought it was Bad doesnt realize people have refunded GTA4 cause they didnt know there was a fix for that also I think it solved my Keyboard problem as well.
