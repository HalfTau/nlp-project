not bad. it has its shortcomings, as everyone knows. particularly regaurding the windows optimization i have a beastly pc and get less than 30 frames on max settings oftentimes. you will sacrifice immersibility one way or the other either with ugly textures and effects/ less view distance lower settings or you will have stuttery low fps gameplay, both of which are bad choices.the game itself is also a bit tedious in my opinion. i have started it many times over the years first on ps3 i think but have yet to complete it beyond about half way. it has an interesting storyline and good actors, but something about the way the game plays out always loses my interest after a shorter time than i would expect from a game i have yet to finish. not exactly slow paced, just tedious. replaying missions over and over, and having to drive all the way accross a section of town each time you replay it just gets old. losing weapons by getting arrested sucks many things about saints row 3 are much better than this game, though the story in gta4 does seem to be much better.i will give this a recommend, but only because you should at least check it out sometime. it has some charm, and i revisit the game every so often. but dont expect it to be alot of actual fun.
