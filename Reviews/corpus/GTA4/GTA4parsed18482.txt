GTA IV will not work for me no matter what I do. I have 2 hours of ingame time, but have not actually played a single minute of it. The whole 2 hours have been wasted on infinite loading screens. Also, there is a glitch telling me that my graphic card cannot handle the game even though it is very capable. Not happy...
