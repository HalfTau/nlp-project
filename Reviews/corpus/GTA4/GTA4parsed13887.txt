Rockstar Games has been a monument to the gaming world for a long time now. However, following the release of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto IV falls short of my expectations. The story line is rather intricate, but more so realistic, and slightly uneventful, as opposed to some of the other Rockstar games. GTA IV provides a sizeable, New York CityLike map to roam around, set in 3 different islands. However I found that all 3 of the islands have nearly the same structure. My biggest complaint with this game would be the colors. The colors are ultimately, extremely bland, at best. Your car might be orange with a tinge of grey, or grey with a tinge of grey. Everything looks depressing, sad, and uncolorful. That being said, the games driving mechanics leave this to be comparable to that of The Crew. Oddly enough, the best thing about this game despite its clunkly player controls, is the semirealistic driving. If you want a New York Driving Simulator with the occassional shoot out, then feel free to purchase this game. But what do I know. Im merely a steam user.
