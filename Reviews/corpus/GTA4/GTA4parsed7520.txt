Well, what do do I have to say.GTA IV, the old classic game... the best GTA game according to some, and the worst according to others.I do like it,  but it has some cons.CONS Windows Compability. In Windows 10, this is almost unplayable. I have setup start arguments to even boot the game. To make it detect my 4 GB VRAM card, I also need a command argument. Really old. Yea, I have nothing more to say about it Windows Games For Live. WTF is this t? I couldnt even use it at first! Story is... OK. It could have been better, but it is good.PROS Classical MANY FUN MODSI can only give this a negative review, Im sorry. But I still DO recommend this game!
