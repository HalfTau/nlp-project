Once I was driving to Time Square to pick up a burger but I drove through the toll both which gives you the same wanted level as killing someone so I was evading the cops, and stuff happened. When I actually got near Time Square, my car was damaged and smoking, so I ditched it, and took a taco truck or something, and drove off. The guy who was initially driving the truck and a police officer both grabbed the handle of my newly aquired transport, and I dragged them until they died. I then got chased into an alley by cops after flipping the truck upside down in the middle of the street, killing 2 or so cops then dying myself. I completely forgot I left just to get a burger.11/10 Unoptimized games, would recommend.
