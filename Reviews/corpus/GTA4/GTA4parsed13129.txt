Great game until action starts. Cars run great, until you start a chase scenario, then all the sudden your car cant turn better than a garbage truck and it accelerates like a fat person on a bicycle. Somehow you can steady target shoot all day, but once someone starts shooting back your weapon tracks right to left like there is an earthquake going on unless you use the autoaim feature. Also it seems like applying the brakes even lightly disengage the steering wheel, so hitting the brakes to avoid an accident is a completely worthless maneuver, you have a better chance of pushing through. If you can get past the game giving your character crippling shakes and dementia whenever an actual encounter starts it is pretty fun. I rage quit this game more than any other open world or shooter game I have ever played. 7/10  Great fun open world game, but player control seems very clunky.
