I really liked the game back on the XBOX 360, yet for some reason I cannot seem to make this game work on Windows 10. I updated everything and still end up with a black loading screen where the game also gets stuck. such a shame that Rockstar Games doesnt seem to come up with a solution after this time for the players, I bought it at a Steam sale, cannot even get a refund back. Thanks Gaben
