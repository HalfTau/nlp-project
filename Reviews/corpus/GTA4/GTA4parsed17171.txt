I would highly suggest not getting this game on Steam. I had the hardcopy of this game but quit playing it due to constant freezing in the same part of the game. The steam version will not even run. I get to the rockstar sign in and it does nothing. there is several complaints with others having the same issue...with NO fix or support. Luckily I bought this game on sale for 5 otherwise I would be asking for a refund. The only reason I havent asked for a refund is because it was cheap and maybe one day Steam or Rockstar will fix it. The game does apparently work for some people but I guess that is a gamble you will have to take.
