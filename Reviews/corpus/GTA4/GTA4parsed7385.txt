The game is good, but its chained down by M. You need games for windows live installed for it to even run, even though you dont even need to sign in. That also prevents shadowplay or nvidia share these days from working.THAT is what makes thisbtw I know steam says Ive played 0.1h. I played on xbox360 back in the day, so I can say the game is good.
