Twenty minutes of my life were wasted with attempting to even set up this brokeexcuse of a game. Between jumping through Rockstars hoops to just set up offline gaming and then experiencing the problems I had despite the great specs I have, I dont want to touch this game with a ten foot pole.To whoever created the unskippable, incredibly long intro, I hope you getcancer.During said intro, cant use escape button, go into steam overlay, cant use windows button, altctrldelete is near impossible.Get task manager open finally, attempt to end process as a last resort. Big mistake.Game hemorrhages entirely, causes my pc to freeze, have to force shut down.Restart PC. All must be fine now, right? ing wrong, GTA IV is still running in the background on startup.Ive never had a problem with any game Ive played until GTA IV. Not worth the headache!
