Its a game everyone is gonna play and should play and yet its not a great game and im willing to say  it.The game had a nice story line and it was fun shooting people.Was dissapointed to see the game didnt have silenced weapons and allot more dissapointed me.Vehicles have rekt my whole experience of the game in many ways. Car breaks are really bad on many cars. Random car crashes creating traffic jams. Cars randomly go to the left or right when you go threw the middle causing you to crash your bike and fly. Sometimes the most soft bike crash makes you fly. Helicopter is horrible to fly. Way to many cop cars sometimes 6 in a radius of 2 seconds. Way to many traffic.The traffic was the biggest problem keep having to drive threw the middle, with few places to speed and with these bad breaks on cars allot of crashes. And if I went for a bike its like the traffic trys to take you out with illogical movements.When I played GTA SA it had allot less traffic and same gos for GTA V on the ps3.However Rockstargames annouched that they will increase traffic density so mostly likekly on the pc version im going to see the same problem of way to many cars.Game had some good songs btw.Preferd the Latin and Russian music stations.
