Honestly, its a fun game and probably one of the most realistic GTAs.However the story is just slow. It takes a good amount of time for anything really cool to happen that doesnt involve shooting like 1 or 2 guys with your Glock.Would I recommend this game? Yes, but expect the beginning of the story and game to a bit boring and slow.
