This is unlike anything you can believePerfection, or the closest thing possible is achieved with GTA IV. This may sound weird but its hard to not think that this is a real breathing city. If one word could sum up the game I think it would be detail. Every aspect of the game is as detailed as possible and it is easily the best game ever made respective of the technological possibility. For instance, the AI of the people walking down the street is almost creepy, it seems like these are living people. The dialogue is truly impressive, I believe that this game could compete with some of the best films around. Some people say that the cutscenes have errors and other minuscule details are slightly askew, but truthfully if they are looking that close for errors they are missing the grand picture. Fantastic acting, worthy of film awards, breathtaking graphics, beyond realistic physics, and just enthralling gameplay make this the first truly nextgen game that goes beyond just better graphics, pushing the limits of what I thought was possible. Its one hell of a deal for only 60, its easily worth hundreds. Rockstar is genius for a making a game so immersive, so realistic, but yet manages to keep that funny, satiric GTA feel. Congrats Rockstar, you deserve your success.
