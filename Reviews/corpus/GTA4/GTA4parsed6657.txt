DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I bought this a little while before the release of GTAV on PC, as the last one I played was GTA III, and I wanted a taste of a more modern GTA.It never worked and will never work due to the service Games For Windows Live. none of the games that i have that use gfwl work anymore due to the program being discontinued.
