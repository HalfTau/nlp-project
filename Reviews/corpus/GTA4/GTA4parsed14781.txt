Im assuming GTA IV on PC is a great game, but there are serious compatibility issues with graphics cards larger than 2GB. There is also a major issue with getting the game to run in Windows 8 without having to download, patch, or fix something. Its overall a huge inconvenience for a game thats a few months away from being usurped on PC by its successor. Ill just have to eat the money I spent on this and wait for GTA V.
