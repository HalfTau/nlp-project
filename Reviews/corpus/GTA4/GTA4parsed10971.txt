i love the missions in this game but some people might argue that its basicly shoot this guy then get payed but when you proceed through the story the missions gets more and more addicting becasuse you want to know what may happen next, also the desisons in this game are game changing, there is no going back after choosing one, i chose the wrong desisons and ended up with the bad ending not going to spoil it for anyone so i desided to redo the whole game because of the missions, the multiplayer had kinda died out due to GTA V coming out but i have seen a few people playing GTA IV and have joined them but then i get disconnected because of my internet running to slow, there are a few glitches that i have encounted but they can be resolved by restarting the game or starting at the begining, the worst glitch i had found is that when in one of the missions you get a truck filled with explosives, and the camrea zoomed in because it was the start of a cutseen but niko did nothing, nothing happend so i had to start from the begining then it was fine,  but apart from that its a great game, yes this game is quite old now compared to graphics but graphics dont always make a good gamethis is why i recomend GTA 4
