The game is better than its previous in many ways graphic, sound, physical interaction.. But the most improved is the storyline which is so twisted and deep. Ending of the game is depend on your decision to kill or not to kill important NPC. The game deserved 10/10. I did not even getting any trouble with Window Live though...
