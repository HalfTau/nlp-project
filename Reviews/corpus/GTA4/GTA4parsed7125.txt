I love open world games and this game is no different! This game is a must play for all New Yorkers! The setting really makes you feel at home. Setup is a little annoying, but its worth it! DThe game has a great story if you follow the missions, but there is also a lot to do on your own, from mowing down people on the sidewalk to just driving around and seeing the different parts of Algonquin.
