GTA IV was a great game, the story, the characters, etc, this game takes pleasure into nteoducing you into the dark, gritty, reallike liberty city. I just beat the game this afternoon, and I loved it. There are a lot of descisons in this game, more than five. This is also way better than five. The mechanics, like running, shooting, fighting, etc the engine is way better than fives. However a couple problems with the game are the driving, it feels like your driving on ice, and when your on the motorbikes it feels like your skidding in butter. The game is optimized for gwfl, which is a pain in theto install. It needs it so you can save your game, and even to open it. There are a lot of bugs, especially towards the end of the story, when your trying to climb atop a helicopter, the game bugs out and the only way to fix it is make the game run on one core using task manager.  This game is poorly optomized for pc, but overall this is a great game, but the poor optimization for pc makes the game run with a lot of bugs.
