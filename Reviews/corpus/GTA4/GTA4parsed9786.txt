Because my GTX 970 got 4GB  GTA IV only supports 2 GB I can only play on 800x600, but you can fix this with the commandline fix. But because Rockstar sucks they decided to implement GFWL and of course I forgot my login datas, so I am unable to save the game. How stupid is that? They dont allow me to save the game without a GFWL account. I never saw a more awful game than this.EDIT I get 87 fps in game, looks like DayZ is better optimized than this, I mean, I can run GTA V at 90 fps  a 7 years old game with the same frames? They ruined the whole game.
