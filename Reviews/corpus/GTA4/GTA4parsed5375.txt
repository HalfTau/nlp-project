Totally unplayable, do not waste your money, framerate, draw distance and resolution all were unplayably bad. Im running on a year old system that can run most new games on ultra with no issue. Additionally the game requires windows live and rockstars social club or whatever it is to play a total pain in theto even get the game started. After this game I would second guess buying anygame from Rockstar ever again on pc, which sucks because I grew up really enjoying there games on consoles
