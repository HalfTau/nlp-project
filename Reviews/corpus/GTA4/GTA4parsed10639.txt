Probably give a final judgment about the work of Rockstar Games would require pages and pages of indepth analysis the variety and the peculiar characterization of every aspect of the game that goes from the manufacturing care of vehicles up outstanding photorealism in the reproduction of social life in this fascinating city leaves us stunned by the size and overall structure surprisingly detailed. And I am happy to reassure by saying that some flaw graphics seen in the surrounding environment will not undermine the fun that Grand Theft Auto 4 will offer.The single player campaign and a mammoth MP to represent in itself a standalone game will fall into a world of absolute fun and durable, which will please not only the fans of the historical series. GTA IV is a title that will be surely appreciated by all players Ps3 simply for the fact that whatever you are looking at a video game in Liberty City will find it.
