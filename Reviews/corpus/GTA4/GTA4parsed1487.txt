I wanna recommend this classic, but the game has a lot of issues. 1. Still using Microsoft Online to have to save the game, I thought this was the Steam version, not the Microsoft download.2. Constant dips in FPS! The game cant even be ran on the lowest settings without it running in the 40s. This game was poorly ported over to the PC.3. Bugs and glitches, I cant even remember how many bugs/glitches I have encountered during the time I played this on PC.Please stop ignoring these issues and fix these issues!
