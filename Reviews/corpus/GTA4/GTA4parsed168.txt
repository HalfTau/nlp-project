I dont know what you people are saying about this game but Its exactly how I remembered it from PS3. Nostalgic, Intresting storymain character and the Liberty City climage just fits with the rest perfectly. I bought it again on steam just to replay the story and to remember the old times back when I used to play it on PS3. As far as graphics I can say the game has really good graphics Its rockstar, what do u expect for a 2008 game. I play it on 1920x1080 on Ultra on my PC i56500, GTX 1060 3GB, 8GB DDR4, Win10 Pro64bit and the game runs smooth AF. The 1.0.8.0 patch really did fix the game and I had no issues with nothing. I downloaded the game, Installed it, Logged into my Game For Windows which kinda sucks account and played. I didnt need to download any extra program and I was already logged into my xbox account.All in all if you havent played the game or completed the story you should defenitly buy it and play it. If you played the  outta of it like I did back in the day then you should rebuy it. You will find a good price of 35  on G24. 4 is A but steam censored itP.S. Its value for money if you buy the Complete Edition on sale. The EFLC are really good DLCs and they worth it. Trust me
