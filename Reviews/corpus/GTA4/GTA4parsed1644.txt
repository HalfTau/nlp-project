Honestly no idea why so many people are moaning about the pc version and saying it wont run yes you have to make a windows live account but it takes 5seconds of your time to do and the game runs flawlessly for me! dont listen to people saying it doesnt work or bad optimization they obviously have pcs that cant run this game graphically.
