Finished game on PS3. The best about this game is the story, its not your typical GTA, although it has its funny moments, its darker and moodier than any other GTA. That being said, the gameplay and mechanics are sharp and accurate, but not fun. Its well worth the money for the story, and the mods you can use on PC.
