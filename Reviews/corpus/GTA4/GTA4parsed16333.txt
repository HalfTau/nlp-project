Grand theft auto for pc. it can be fun especially when you add modifications but it can also make you VERY frustrated because it never can just properly function correctly it is always somthing a few of these problems are the following it freezes, the graphics are off, invisible characternot modded, crashes and much more vrry frustrating problems my current problems include graphics that are again VERY off, game freezes/game crashes invisible characters AND the steam support does not help AT ALL if it were easier to trubleshoot and solve these problems or better yet not have the problems this review may have been different but as of now i am sticking with my claim. as for recommending the game to others if you technical expert sure knock yourself out but if not i would not recommend buying this game on pc unless you have a friend or someone that knows what they are doing and can help you otherwise i wish you the best of luck with your Grand theft auto IV
