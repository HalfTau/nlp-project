Put simply, do not spend money on this game. Microsoft/Rockstar make you jump through ridiculous hoops to play it and they dont deserve your money.After installing, I was told to download an additional client to Steam. Then insert a passcode into the Microsoft client, which didnt work. Then followed instructions on Steam, and on Rockstar, still didnt work. Phoned Microsoft at two separate locations to ask for help, and despite talking to people there and online, I was bounced between the two on the phone and on email.After a week of trying, I gave up. I purchased a game, yet cant save and so not play it.Very disappointed following the reviews for the game. If you have to play it, get it on a console  but I certainly wont be.
