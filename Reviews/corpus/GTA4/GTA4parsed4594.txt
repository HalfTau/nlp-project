ProsGameplayStoryControlsMap sizeThe game is pretty fun to playPretty much everything else apart from the consConsGFWL  took me ages to set this up just so I could save the damn gamePerformance  game lags like hell, especially when driving. I have a pretty decent PC that should be able to run this with no issues, but it lags like hell.Graphics  due to a glitch, the graphics are always low quality.Terrible optimisation from console to PC.A terrible port of an awesome game. Optimisation is awful.If the cons were fixed, I would reccomend this game, but the cons are quite severe. I play this game on Windows 10 yes you can.UPDATE a recent patch was released by Rockstar the first in nearly 6 years I believe that has fixed the performance/graphics issues. This means I can play the game at a decent FPS, but ONLY without Steam running in the background hence only 6 hours when Ive been playing this game a lot recently. GFWL has not been removed however, although with the x liveless mod you can get online, it is possible to play the game without GFWL. Becaue of these changes, I can therefore change my reccomndation and reccomend this game, but be warned that it takes a fair bit of hassle to get this game to work, but when it does work it is worth it.
