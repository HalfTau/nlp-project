Great game, if were just talking about the gameplay, buy it, its great. But this is on Steam, so this is on PC, and the PC port is terrible, even with the 1.0.8.0 update that fixed a bit of it its still a really bad port, I have a 1060 and should be able to run this game at about 100 fps on max settings 1080p, yet I get 40, this low FPS and crashes and glitch issues have been happening for a lot of people, Id reccomend this game, but be aware of that.
