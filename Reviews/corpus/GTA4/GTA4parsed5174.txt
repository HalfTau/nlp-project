Great game. Of course theyre many ingame bugs but thats alright for 2008.I dont understand why people write negative reviews just because theyre to stupid to watch some tutorials on youtube how to play the game.It is right that the Social Club is absolutely sht but if you click on Play Game Offline and log into your account ingame, everything works.
