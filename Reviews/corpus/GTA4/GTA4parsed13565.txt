A great game with great modding capabilities. Its extremly fun to add something, like say, a gokart and race each other through the city while you have a modded in black hawk hanging over your heads with remodeled police looking like specop.The downside to this game is that it is really baldy optimised. It tends to crash alot, if you tab out or just go back to singleplayer after youve been in multiplayer.8/10
