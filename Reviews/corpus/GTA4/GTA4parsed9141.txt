Cant even play the stupid game. Says I need a Social Account and I made one, but as soon as I click play it just shuts down and nothing happens. When I click play offline it just shuts off and nothing happens. Im on Windows 10 also.Edit Ive gotten the game to work on my PC but that does not change my opinion on the game whatsoever. GTA IV on console was fantastic but this PC port is absolute garbage. It runs like crap and is buggy as hell.
