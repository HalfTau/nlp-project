well... its a very good game. Story is okay.But the funny thing about this game was modding, that allowed to make the game even more beautiful, but also permited tons of new things.Saddly Take 2 interractive prohibited modding even in solo mode and threatened modders. So I dont recommand this game. It doesnt worth your money anymore, even with less than half price
