I HAVE A FIX FOR THE 8016 SECUROM ERRORUPDATE YOUR BIOS!!!Now for the real reviewThis is a good game.  If you can get past all bugs with securom and gfwl Games for Windows Live, this game is fun is fun as hell. Id say its tied with GTA 5. The game has a great atmosphere, and unlike GTA 5, doesnt feel like an 80s action movie. This is when GTA took a turn and became a dark and gritty genre. Of course they reverted this with GTA 5, which, in my opinion, was disappointing. If you have Windows 7 or under or are otherwise able to get past securom and gfwl, I recommend it.
