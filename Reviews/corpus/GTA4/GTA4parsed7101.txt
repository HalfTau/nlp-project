if you have an i3 or pentium it wont run well. this game only works if you have an extremely beefy computer, and then, its boring. the city is dark, everyone swears like a shtbox, and the cars wallow too much. its a vampire town in a nutshell. good concept, wrong map, wrong lighting, wrong gameplay.
