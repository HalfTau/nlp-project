Still a fun game even after 8 years since its release.  The only things that havent aged well are1 the friend minigames where you have to take NPCs out around town or risk losing some abilities like a mobile gun runner who gives a discount.2 GWFL integration and the Rockstar equivalent.  The former you need to just simply save the game and the latter would be for multiplayer but Im pretty sure its defunct/empty since GTA V came out.The game runs on Windows 10 but you actually have to go download the latest version of GWFL from the Microsoft website because the one packed with the installer is old and busted.For anyone interested Im using a 4670k and a GTX 770 and get a solid 60fps for the most part and the loading times are fine when installed on an HDD.
