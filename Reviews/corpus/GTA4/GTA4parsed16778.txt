Buyer beware, perhaps one of the worst ports in PC gaming history and on top of that come July Mulitplayer WILL NOT work. The multiplayer part of GTA 4 relies on Games For Windows Live which is being shut down in July and Rockstar have not given any indication as to what they intend to do about it..If you are buying this game then consider it a single player game
