This game is easily my favorite entry in the Grand Theft Auto Series, but its performance on PC unfortunately holds me back from reccomending the game. Im running on an i74790, GTX 970, 16GB RAM and the framerate finds its way below 60 regardless of the ingame settings. Ive heard it runs normally on some PCs, but extremely faulty on others strange inconsistency. Also, this game requires Games For Windows Live, which is extremely faulty, it took me forever to get the game to even launch, had to troubleshoot a LOT. Overall, the game just isnt worth the effort on PC. It was a masterpiece on consoles, though.
