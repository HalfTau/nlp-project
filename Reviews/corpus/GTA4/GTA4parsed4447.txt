after the most resent up daye that just came out to get it working you have to go in folder and any mods you had like xlive list to get game to load with out game for windows live or any other mods that you used to fix game or modify it any way you have to delete but stuff like resinks on charecters and cars and other things fin to keep then you need to download this up witch fixes social club login and xbox live is still needed to log in but you dont have to download games for windows anymore here the link btw for the fix you need and if you dont get the fix game crashes and also this is a rockstar fix so its safe and is needed anyway to play
