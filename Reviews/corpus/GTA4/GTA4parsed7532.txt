The game is good, actually great! good story and interesting charactors.BUT!!And this is a huge but.Microsofts LIVE appartment has helped it onto PCOmg, how terrefied they were somebody cracked this, because they have drenched the game in terrible DRM and online features that ruin everything.I cant sign onto LIVE because resaons... so i cant SAVE MY SINGLEPLAYER GAME, the simplest thing since 1995 for crists sake.So, save the money for the steam version and buy it on PS3 or Xbox, because it works fine there, or crack it somehow. Considering all the terrible log on crap, its properbly easier than acctually buying the game.
