WARNING If youre planning to play this on PC, right after you bought it, get ready for some major waitage. Fiddling around with Games for Windows Live and Social Club and settings is a hassle and I think so far I played less than an hour, had to restart and then I could not play it again.I dont know if there ever will be a patch for this issue, but a game that doesnt let you play single player and save your game, without having to be logged in to Live and Social Club is a silly game.Shame on Rockstar! Shame!
