Rockstar, why do you make it so hard for people who legimitely bought your game to play it?Thanks, I didnt have enough accounts before but now its the perfect amount.Its so frustrating trying to play a game and thinking naively that there will be no problem, plan a date and time for everyone and wait for us all to be ready, try to launch the game but OF COURSE the Social Club is down. Again. Seems like I wont be able to play your game any time soon.Thanks again, Rockstar. I like throwing money away. I really do.
