Stupid Rockstar ate my money.Game was working fine when I bought, but then I decided to install LCPDFR.Downloaded LCPDFR properly or so i thoughtGo to launch GTA 4, rockstar pops up, i click it, and I cant launch.Tried multiple videos to fix this, followed all instructions.Would only reccomend this game if your into vanilla.On top of it, I spent money on the complete edition.
