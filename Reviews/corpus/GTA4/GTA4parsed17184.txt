This is a really fun game. The only annoying things about it area the driving  it is like driving on ice, and you really have to slow down to go around corners, but once you get the hang of it, youll be fineb the amount of time you have to spend before even playing  you have to sign up for a Rockstar Social Club account, and then an Xbox Live account before you can start playing however, once you do that the first time, you are set for the rest of the game, so it is only a hassle at the beginning.So far, the campaign is pretty fun, I like the variety of cars, and ragdoll never gets old this game also has one of the best ragdoll engines Ive ever played.All in all, worth it. Once you are done with this campaign, you can also do the two DLCs!
