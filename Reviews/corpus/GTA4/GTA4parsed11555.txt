The steam version of gta iv is just unplayable and I cant even get past the social club startup screen. Multiplayer has been dead for a long time. If you are planning to buy this game, be warned as the game may be broken for you too.With that said, GTA IV is one of the best games I have every played but its a shame its now a pile of garbage that will never be touched again.
