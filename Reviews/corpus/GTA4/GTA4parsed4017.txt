Well it still definitely doesnt perform as well as it should considering it can run on an Xbox 360 but not my 1000 gaming PC, it runs well enough and is worth it just for the great story. Would reccomend if you have some extra money to throw around and a powerful enough rig to run it above 30 frames per second.
