The only problem this game has is performance issues, theyve been there since the game launched on PC, its just not well optimized, and on top of that it just doesnt run well on newer hardaware.Aside from that... this is handsdown the best GTA game made so far. For me it easily ranks above GTA 5, and I keep going back to it. Its extremely fun, the story is decent, and the gameplay is spoton. Not only has this game aged extremely well, but the modding community has made tons of extra content for it, and its still a blast to play.Online doesnt work well, but at least you can play singleplayer without Games for Windows Live by using a simple patch called . And when you do... enjoy the masterpiece.
