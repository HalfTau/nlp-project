One of the best games I ever played. History has a score of 10, definitely the most positive point of the whole game. The graphics are very good and the map is quite large and nicely detailed. Shows throughout New York at the highest level, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Manhattan and Jersey City are beautifully designed. It is quite realistic and diverse both in missions and in activities. Bowling is the most realistic activity, its amazing man. The gameplay could be better yeah, but however, its fun and one of the best ever made by Rockstar. I definitely recommend.
