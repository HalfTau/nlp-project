After several months of having purchased the game. I have yet been able to play it because of all the hoops you have to jump threw to play it. Ive reset the pw several times, set up a new account. Tried everything i know to do. After 35 years of gaming its become to be to much trouble to do online gaming. What a shame, its the one thing i love to do.
