Honestly this sucks,Probably one of the best GTAs out there considering the incredible story arch and character plotlines. But this has been completely destroyed by the lack of optimization on a bad port.There are ways of getting round this all info on forums or youtube so I wouldnt say its completely a bad game, but youll need to do some work.Oh, and if you want to play multiplayer... Its dead, Rockstar social club will say it has trouble logging in... but mp was bad anyways so...
