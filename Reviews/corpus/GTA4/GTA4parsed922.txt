Literally unplayable thanks to Windows Live.Great game otherwise, youll want to get it from unofficial sources.But steer clear of the Steam version or any other that forces this Windows Live bullon you.Been trying to fix it several ways, creating an account, signing in, messing with , etc. for about an hour now, no success.Literally unplayable.EDIT After being convinced to give troubleshooting a second try, I downloaded it again. It wont even ing start up now. It gives me a fatal error right after I close the Social Club popup. All the solutions Ive found online are differing from each other and none worked.This ing thing should not be on Steam in its current state.
