This game is probably great, but its so terribly optimized, its not worth the hassle.I finally managed to get the game to start up, then the game dosent let me change any settings.Its stuck at 800x600 res, low settings and then wouldnt let me exit the settings.I had to task manager to exit, WTF!GTX 970Intel i5 4590Win 8.1Do yourself a favour, dont pay rockstar for these terrible ports and buy the game for console instead. please dont buy pc version.
