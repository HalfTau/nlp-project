Great job taking away mods by killing OpenIV you ing s! Now instead of minimal mod support we have ING NONE! GREAT JOB!Original Review on Janurary 3rd 2016Okay,the update for this game fixed alot ofand credit goes to Rockstar for doing that even tho it was 9 years after release. Better late than never I guess. Anyways I give 8/10 because sadly you cannot use mods that require Scripthook or ASILoader anymore,you can still use vehicle mods,map mods etc on it tho so thats good. I recommend this if you are okay with minimal mod support and just want to play vanilla and online
