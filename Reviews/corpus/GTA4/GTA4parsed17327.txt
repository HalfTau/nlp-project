This game was a revolution and its still one of the best games of this generation. The graphics were excelent and the driving was a great improvement. The only issue was the fighting and shooting system, because it made you slow and you couldnt move freely like it was in previous games.The storyline was deep. It showed characters with real life emotions and made you think before doing something. This GTA showed the beginning of a new way to tell a story and have a connection with the protagonist and the NPCs around you.
