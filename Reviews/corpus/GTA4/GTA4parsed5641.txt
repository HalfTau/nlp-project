Yes, the port is downright crapcakes, but the experience definitely makes the 20 minutes worth of trial and error justifiable. Sure, the next game in the series is marginally superior in graphics, controls, mechanics, and a plethora of extra features although all of those are superior, theres still one feature in the checklist that, despite innovation, the former title pulls off betterPurpose.The pursuit of the ACTUAL American Dream, the harsh struggles of immigrants hoping for more change than there really was to begin with, the limited amounts of opportunities, the grey that encompasses the world, and the trial  error of a broken man, searching for a path forward. Although Michael displayed a similar amount of relatability, Niko remains as the arguably superior character due to his inner search for redemption of past sins, a trait that Michael doesnt display on behalf of not truly regretting his crimes, only wishing to run away and forget about them. Niko is evidenced to of possessed a sincere amount of innocence before the war took effect, whereas Michael has always robbed people since he was first able to, although Nikos childhood situation was proved to be more dire than his due to living in the third world. As such, there is more purpose with Niko as the main character rather than the three GTA V characters of the next game.Also, this is probably more of a personal positive, but fighting wanted levels in GTA 4 seems to be a little more fun in a unique way since I can repair my vehicle extremely fast through the cheat codes on the phone, making fire strikes with the Annihilator gunship more forgiving and interesting. And bowling with the keyboard and mouse is extremely accurate, causing me to easily score multiple turkeys. All in all, the game is not to be underestimated, and proves to be a superior experience on PC after the troubleshooting, provided that the computer hardware is up to snuff.
