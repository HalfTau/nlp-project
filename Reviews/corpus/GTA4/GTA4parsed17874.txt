Grand theft auto 4 is a lovely game.Some might argue its not as good as the others and deffently doesnt hold the candle up to grand theft auto 5 but its good game.The graphics are just amazing for its time!The story is a tyipical gta story but it has its twists and moments.the online is getting removed mid next year cause it uses games for windows live which is a downer.I deffently think you should play this game even for some laughs on multiplayer and modding and what not.
