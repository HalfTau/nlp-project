Having played all the GTAs since GTA2 through this one, I barely recognize this as GTA.  Dour, joyless, humorless, dull, unpleasant, and generally everything that the series two peaks of Vice City and San Andreas were not.  The city itself is impressive, and theres clearly a lot of work done here, but I spent hours trying to get into this game, and found nothing that was even remotely fun or likable, even with the cell phone turned off to avoid Romans nattering.I dont know what went wrong, but play one of the old ones instead, or a Saints Row game.
