Painfully unoptimized since on my laptop, on all low settings, it runs at 2530 with me just standing still in the street. This is the same laptop that runs Bioshock Infinite on medium settings at a pretty consistent 60fps.Its also a huge pain in theto even get the game to launch since it requires that Games for Windows Live t. If you do have a decent enough computer, I do recommend this game as it is one of the best in the series in terms of singleplayer.I also highly recommend that you get  X  LIVE  LESS  to get the game to run without GFWL  I needed to put spaces in between the liveless thing because for some reason steam censors it. It was the only way I could get the game to launch2/10 one of the worst PC ports of all time8/10 for console and if you can get it running on PCnote you may notice I have 30 hours on it. Even though it doesnt run on my laptop, it did run on my old pc which somehow was able to run it no problem this pc couldnt run bioshock at all so Im not sure how that works since this laptop can run bioshock but not gta ??? but I just couldnt save the game all I did was mess around
