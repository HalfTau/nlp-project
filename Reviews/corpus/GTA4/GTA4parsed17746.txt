If you have completed the original GTA IV, Episodes from Liberty City is just like twice the fun, since there is so much more and so much difference in the DLC, I would really recommend that!Overall it has some really nice gameplay that works out and is fun to play around with. Ofcourse, there are a few bugs or hidden treasures around the gameplay area that can be worth testing as well.
