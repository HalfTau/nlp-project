Yes, the game is good on console, sure. But on PC, the farthest I could get the game working is the game loading screen, which loops on forever and ever. It keeps saying my graphics are unable to handle it but they can handle it and it wont let me fix it. So do not purchase this for PC until rockstar decides to fix it Which I doubt due to GTA V being targetted a ton by hackers.
