Ive played multiple hours of this game on PS3, figured I would pick it up on here about one year...maybe two years ago?  It has never worked properly.  Even with a supposed recent update, the game is basically unplayable in the form you receive it in, unless you begin searching on Google what config commands you need.  Even then, the game does not render properly, and turns all buildings and roads invisible.So, GTA IV the game is fantastic.  GTA IV the PC port shouldnt be on the Steam store.  Rockstar needs to fix this thing before taking peoples money for it.  Just seems messed up.
