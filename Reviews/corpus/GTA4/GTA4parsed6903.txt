GTA IV WORKS ON WINDOWS 10!If youre getting ERROR 8016, check your BIOS version. If its out of date, go to your computers support website and download the newest BIOS version. Follow the instructions given to install, and that will be fixed.Then, download GFWL 3.5, and the game wil get past the Social Club login screen.Finally, if you want to log in to a social club account, delete paul.dl and verify the integrity of the game chache. Load the game, if you can log in, load the game, and then, AFTER loading the game, rename paul.dll to paul.dll.disabled. If it doesnt work, keep deleting it and verifying it until it works, then rename it.AS GOR THE ACTUAL GAME Its my second favorite game ever, so you should play it too and see what you think of it.Thanks, and have a good day.
