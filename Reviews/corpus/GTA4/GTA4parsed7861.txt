The amount of problems with this game is just not normal, I have never been struggling so much just to play a game.Social club crashed after start, after fixing that the product key didnt work, that could not even be fixed because windows marketplace does not work and I cant change the graphical settings because I dont have enough vram... I only have 8Gb video ram how much do you want?I didnt even get it up and running because after 5 hours of trying I had to give up, this happened on two different pcs too and internet is full of people with the same problem, this game is a scam.
