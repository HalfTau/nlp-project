Good game that will last you for a while, the characters are full of story and emotion and the multiplayer is good as well. I bought this game after playing all the other GTAs and it was pretty hard to get used to the driving at first but then you will start to learn, driving felt sluggish and slow. I liked how theres different dialogue if I failed and mission and get to hear characters say the same thing a little differently, the atmosphere felt kind of dull though and alot of times I felt like everything looked grayish. Overall good game with likeable characters and a bunch of things to do in an open world.
