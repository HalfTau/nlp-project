Grand Theft Auto IV is hands down one of the best games of the last generation and can even be compared to the todays triple A titles and its probably something we can all agree on but with that being said i do think the game is amazing but the review is gonna be based on the currently given port on the pc version.As much as i love this game i simply cannot recommend it on pc due to its lack of optimization for pretty much any hardware or software really although some people argue it runs slightly better on linux rather than windows.The main issue that people adress when talking about why this port is simply bad is the inclusion of games for windows live. For those who dont know gfwl is a drm system implented by microsoft in order for them to try to copy the success of the xbox live, but as we all know it is a complete and utter failure since the only thing you will be getting from it is lower performance and constant multiplayer issues to being limited off achievements due to its buggy systemand yes there are achievements but you dont get them on steam you get them in gfwl. And since we are on the subject lets not forget to mention that any accessible feature other than singleplayer is locked behind games for windows live account that can also be dubbed microsoft account, if you didnt know, you dont get the game you get a cd key for windows live account and without it you have no access to either achievements or multiplayer.Now lets talk about the optimization issues that i mentioned earlier, the games optimization is just horrid, the game only uses around 2040 of your hardwares capabilities therefore you mostly result with a very bad experience as you will be getting around 2040 fps if not lower with your gaming rig that cost you hundreds of dollars. But if you somehow manage to get more than 60 fps your experience with this game will be even worse as you will start to crash a lot and i do mean a LOT. The same issue has been around with san andreas back in the day as it was not omtpimized to run better than 25 fps so the game would bug out if you didnt use the frame limiter but in gta 4 and especially on pc you mostly wont even run it above 20 fps let alone 60 fps so it is a rare ocassion but yes, it can happen to you if you run it too fast.But i have to mention that there is an amazing modding community that made mods to smooth out the games performance issue that you can download for free and i do recommend you do that if you really wanna play this game but be warned that the game will look horrid, your drawdistance will be extremely small, cars wont have good textures unless you are in them, trees are taken out of the game and all that kind of stuff. But in case you really are interested in playing this game on your pc and dont have a medium end pc atleast or have it but cant run it well i highly recommend checking lowspecgamers video out that gives you a brief guide on how to improve your performance on pc with mods which i will link right hereIn conclussion stay out of this game, the issues are pretty bad with it and your experience will rather vary on your luck as rockstar has not oficially stated on which hardware this game is best optimized on and even if they stated it, its still gonna be that dogport laying on the sidewalk of the streets begging for money. You either sacrifice your capabilities of playing for somewhat ok graphics without mods btw the games graphics are pretty bad on pc even on high settings but please for your own sake never use high settings on this port its just unpleasant or sacrifice every last bit of textures for atleast 50 fps and the gftwl isnt helping all these issues as well.The hardware i used for this game was in case you are wonderingintel core i56600k 3.5ghz quadcore processor6gb ram ddr3GeForce GTX 1060 Windforce OC 3GB GDDR5 Graphics CardWin764 bit
