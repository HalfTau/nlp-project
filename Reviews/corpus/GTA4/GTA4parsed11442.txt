right when i purchased the game and installed it didnt work and Rockstar is a bunch of morons. When i emailed them to help me i did everything they asked and they said it was my configurations with sli that is the problem which i responded i dont have a sli system then they said oh then crossfire and i said i had one graphics card and it was Nvidia. Then they told me i needed to reinstall windows I did didnt help. At this point the process with them started over again until i just uninstalled the game and wont recommend to anyone.
