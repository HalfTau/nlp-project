HelloI like this game from a young age and its still one of my favorite games. After I bought it I had plaied it for 36 hours and everything was be great. But later upgrades to Windows came to me. I clicked later every time because I didnt have option of click never and later this button also disappeared. I updated my computer and after that this game didnt turn on.Like GTA IV and hate Windows.
