I strongly recomened not buying this game. I read other reviews about this and decided to buy it anyway due to the low price. This was a mistake.Let me reiterate, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, YOU WILL PULL YOUR HAIR OUT!Upon Installing it, I couldnt even load it. I had to download games for windows live from the microsoft website to get it to even start, then I had to jump through hoops creating an xbox life acount to be able to save the game. Online mode, does not work as rock star social club never logs in.The gameplay experience is horrible. Not smooth, framerate never gets above 50,  even trying to apply new graphics crashes the app. You mught think 50fps is acceptable. It feels more like 20fps in game. It is BADLY broken.I attempted a refund and recieved this error from steamWe were unable to submit your refund requestSorry! We couldnt find the product you specified in our records. You wont be able to create a refund request.I currently have a support ticket open with steam to try and get my money back. Frankly I feel a bit robbed. This should NOT be on the steam store.For Reference my system is a skylake build with a 6700k i7 and GTX 980 TI. I played the game at 1360x768 resolution.
