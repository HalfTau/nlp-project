Thankfully there was a refund. I bought this game boxed, it was pretty bad for my PC, so certainly after 3 years and a sale on steam it would be fixed. SO I bought it again, and what do you know, same old problems. Just skip this and do whatever you have to do to get GTA5. Certainly is not worth 3 hours of updates and log ins before you get to play either. It just flat didnt work on this machine, 4790 i7 devils canyon, 16 gigs crucial, gtx9980. Still not worth loading this game.
