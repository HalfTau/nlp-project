I will never know why I love this game so much despite how awful it can be. One moment Im loving how well the gameplay is, then a second later I am screaming at this Slavic  for suddenly going goofy and getting himself killed. Overall Im obsessed with the details and relative variety with this game series. And the stories! Ugh, dont get me started on these wonderful stories!
