Sadly even though i love this game i cant recommand it. It is not that the game is bugged, it is not that the game is horrible. It is that Games for Windows Life has been canceled and Rockstar has not yet patched this game. Meaning you cant save. You cant auto save and you cant normally save. Maybe they will patch it in the future though they been awefully quiet around it and seeing GTA5 is due to be released in fall 2014 i dont think they care much about fixing this.As i write this there is a steam deal on GTA4 and i find this rather discusting to be honest. They dont warn you that GFWL has been removed and with that removes the save game. DO NOT BUY TILL THEY PATCHED IT!
