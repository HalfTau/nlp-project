Boring and overwrought GTA4 embodies a good deal of what went wrong with modern sandbox games. Play Saints Row 2,3, or 4 instead.The game suffers from one of the largest cases of ludonarrative dissonance in gaming. The motivation of the main character is removed quickly when the cash starts rolling in, and yet, he is pushed to keep killing for money, for no good reason.Theres also the bizzare desire of the game creators to have a lot of life simulation moments, where you can choose to go play minigames with somebody, like bowling or darts. You can ignore this of course, but I find myself asking why was this added in the first place? What does it add to the game? Were they trying to create a contrast between the main character in his quiet moments, and the psychotic ukranian killing machine he is in the normal course of the game? Trying to humanize him? It fell flat on its face.In the year of our lord 2013, better sandbox games exist, sandbox games with more internally consistant tones exist. GTA4 strived for greatness, it just did it in the wrong way, and became a jumbled tonal mess of a game, in a genre that has moved on. Dont buy GTA4, it might hold your interest for a while, but it is far outshined by its modern contemporaries.
