On paper it looks like the best version , but sadly its the worst .Pros  higher quality , modding , and thats it pretty muchCons  game crashes , doesnt work on window 10 , the last mission glitch , mission takes minutes just to appearThe worst port for a game that got a 98 out of 100 on metacriticget the xbox 360 or ps3 version better .
