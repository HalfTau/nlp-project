I log into social club with my correct credentials, yet it will say that something was wrong. I try 2 or 3 times, then i do it again and it says the game is already running. It launches a few seconds later, I sign in to Games For Windows Live with my Microsoft account, and I start loading the game. Im finally in the game, but I want to play multiplayer. So I pull up Nikos ingame phone and select the Multiplayer option, then it says I need to be signed in to my Social Club account to access multiplayer. VOLVO PLEASE FIX
