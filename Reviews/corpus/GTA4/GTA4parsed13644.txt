This isnt really a review, more of my thoughts on the game. If this game worked I would have a ton more hours on this game. As of writing this the game will not even open. And when it used to open the graphics and everything was set to the lowest and it ran at an unplayable fps. I have maybe double the amount of hours on this game on the xbox and I loved it. So when I saw it on sale on steam it was pretty obvious I was going to buy it. I am not one of those gta players that play through the campaign and do everything in the game. I am one of those players who freeroam and do random stuff and barely do any of the campaign. I am like this in gta V too. I started playing gta with this game and have not played any before this. When I was playing this I would do jumps, drive around shooting people, and have fun running from the cops. If I get this game working I will be playing it a lot more until I get gta V for pc. I do recommend this but as many others have said, this pc port is a dissapointment.
