Bought in steam summer saleThe physics , graphics and overall feel are fantastic, but the frustration and monotony of no save points during missions just ruins the game and adds to the tedium. For so much careful attention to details they totally missed the point on what makes a game fun.. having to drive over half the city to get back to a mission does not equal fun.If you enjoy failing a mission and then having to spend 5 minutes driving all the way back to the start and then watching the NPC do something stupid that causes him to die and means you go all the way back to drive over again, then go ahead and purchase this game.I dont mind having to shoot my way through all the bad guys again, but do I really have to sit through the whole phone conversation, hijack a car and drive all the way over to the mission again? Fortunately you can skip the cut scenes.Get any of the Saints Row games instead and have fun.
