This would probably be a lot of fun if I could save my game and progress. Unfortunantly, I cant due to GfWL. I have tried modding around it to no avail. So, I have to give this a 0/10. I have spent 3 hours trying to get it to work. I cant. I love GTA. But I spent 20 on something thats unusable and uses a discontinued service for extra arbitrary verification. Thats unacceptable. Anyone reading this save your money. Buy GTAV. Its a better game, and it doesnt give you the giant middle finger.Dont buy this.Spend it on Hello Kitty Island Adventure. At least thats playable as opposed to this PoS.
