Great overall experience. Each smallest mission has its own story. Some are very good with nice twist like Michelle and some pretty seen it all before feeling, yet all of them building strong storytelling. I just drown in this game and cant wait what will happen next and where will this story lead my friend Nico in the end. Whoever likes good games with action and story should really try this one.
