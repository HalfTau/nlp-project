Great game, reinstalled it and the DLC and for some unknown reason, Steam linked it to the worst game service on the planet, GFWL. Now I cant even save or play the damn game.Valve is its usual helpful self for support, so I would not recommend a game that you only have  a slight chance of actually playing and requires you log into 3 service to run.
