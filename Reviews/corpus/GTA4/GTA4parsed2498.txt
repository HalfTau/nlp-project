Taketwo/Rockstar games just destroyed a 10 year old modding community with their cease and desist order. Yes they both have a say into this. You cant play mods anymore on GTA V and IV.I would get a refund for gta iv if it was possible but unfortunetly it is not. Heck i even cancelled my purchase of GTA V on the pc and ps4 regarding this issue. Good work guys.If you want to buy this game for modding dont! This is not possible anymore ever!
