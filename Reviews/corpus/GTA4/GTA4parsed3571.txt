Great game on literally every other system but PC, but not worth a buy in modern times. Especially for somebody with acomputer, aka me. The game itself Ive never managed to actually PLAY on steam. Think about that. All the time it says on my account isnt gameplay its me trying and failing to get the ing game to work. Luckily, I didnt actually BUY this game. I got it as  GIFT. The person who sent me it got ripped off. I cant say exactly how bad this game would run on my PC, but, I assume itd be like trying to solve the meaning of 42 with a couple of sticks.TLDR Cant launch the damn game without it crashing like a Japanese Fighter in WW2. Dont buy.Edit Im not saying the game is bad, its the extra BS thats thrown into it. I personally love the game.
