This is a great game with excellent modding potiential. Problem is, its a console port. I have a high end rig, but am experienceing stuttering/frame skipping issues. Ive spend about 5 hours trying to resolve it, but to no avail. Some people arent experiencing these issues, that being said, i cannot recommend this. Waste of money imo.
