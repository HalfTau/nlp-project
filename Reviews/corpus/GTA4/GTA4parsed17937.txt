I couldnt play this game on my PC due to random crashes, glitches and slow FPS. My PC i5 2500k4400, GTX 560 is not that slow and can handle Battlefield 3, Mafia 2 and a lot of such demanding games.But somehow I cant play well GTA 4 even on middle quality settings. Hard to believe that its even possible, but its certainly.And, of course, a lot of pain with Games for Windows.Actually, the game might be very good but you simply cant enjoy it due to aforementioned problems.
