GTA IV in a nutshellNiko I wont do that some random missionSomeone ill pay heavilyNiko looks at that person  OKAY ILL DO IT /Reason? Some extra burgers, hotdogs..Dont talk about weapons lmao, who even buys them if you can get all weps from 1 phone callAbout cars why bother to buy a car online if you can get best cars from random NPCs ? Not even talking about phone calls.. DSo ye, money in this game is a joke..Or how Roman dreams about private jet lol.. he apparently doesnt even know that you cant use planesjets in their universe lmao..To be honest, besides missions this game is boring AF, unless you install mods for something. For example cars, then get taxi bug and be happy cuz no cars will be seen around except taxi, police.. Talking about servers  join a server  get killed straight away  respawn  repeat til you ragequit.But story mode is good at least something is good, right?
