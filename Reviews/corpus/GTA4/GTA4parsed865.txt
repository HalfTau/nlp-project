Honest review, it has its pros and cons.Pros Freeroam has many more activities to participate in compared to GTAV Story was well done Theme song is the best out of all in the GTA Series I personally find the car physics amusing and funCons Gameplay mechanics are ing wonky Most missions have the same structure, kill this guy, steal this Story only gets good around the end Missions keep piling up, which can be annoying for people who like to clear their todo list as quick as possible like meOverall, a well done game, but not very perfectly executed. 8.5/10
