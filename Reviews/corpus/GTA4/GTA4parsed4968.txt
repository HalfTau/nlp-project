I lov ethe grand theft auto series and this game is queit amazing for its age. its driving is very credible to the world along with the hard body physics that it has for vehicles.i think the graphics are good and with them maxed out the game looks quiet amazing.Great radio stations along with the stroy line i hope to see more to come in the future. 9/10 for casual gamer.
