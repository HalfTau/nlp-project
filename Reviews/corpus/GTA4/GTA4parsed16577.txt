Before we get into the reasons why I chose to not reccomend this game, let me please just say first Grand Theft Auto IV is fun. Ive had a lot of fun with this game, both in the single player and multiplayer modes. The problem is, theres just so much to this game that totally ruins the expirience for me.It took me about an hour before the game initially installed before I could even play it. GTA4 requires a number of things before you get started. Firstly, theres Rockstars Social Club account in order to play. Next you need a Game Windows Live account. To top it all off youre also going to need a Microsoft account in order to get a GWL account. Getting all the accounts, verifying a bunch of emails, and setting up the game was way too strenuous, and I was very dissapointed by it.So what? is what I thought to myself soon after starting up the game for the first time. Now that thats out of the way, the games gotta be worth it, right? Well, yes and no. Like I said before, the game is fun, but theres a tremendous amount of things that made me feel like I was having a bad time. At max, the game takes about a minute to start up on good PC. The game is incredibly buggy, and crashes constantly. In about 10 hours of play Ive crashed maybe 4 times. Sometimes the servers for the dont let me log in because theyre down, forcing me to play offline. Alttabbing for too long makes you disconnect from multiplayer, and bla, and bla, and bla bla bla.I would love this game to death if it wasnt such a hassle. I reccomend buying this game if its 7 bucks or cheaper. Otherwise, I wouldnt bother unless youre really willing to put up with a lot.
