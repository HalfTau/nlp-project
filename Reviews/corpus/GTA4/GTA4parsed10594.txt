This was a great game, if you havent played it you definitely should, its everything a GTA game should be and more....Except for 2 things, one of which would make the game infinitely less frustrating, a checkpoint system for missions instead of making us redo every single step of a mission when you fail on just one part, this can make the game a real ragefest, but meh.In my opinion Rockstar ought to cut Youtube in on their profits for this game. Why? because there is a major bug in this game that remains unfixed and will keep you from completing the game without 3rd party help/tinkering. After trying to complete the games ending in different ways over 6 times I gave up and just watched the ending scenes on Youtube. This is a big fail, for an otherwise beautiful game.
