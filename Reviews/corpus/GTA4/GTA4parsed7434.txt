300 hours on total game from the ps3 and pc  i decide to make this review ...Lets start with the engine ... this is my favorite partCars physics very good deformatiomi dont like the handling its like i run on butter highway and is annoying to drop into windows.Pedestrials hmm pedestrials when i punch into head ped dies ... when i shot into arm people goes back i love the engine on pedexplosions here is not so expensive just like the SA explodes but the car loses componentsThe Graphics this game have the basement of GTA V graphics .. amazing graphics. Shadows textures etc. all are amazing, just amazing for a game from 200810 and combined with the engine ... no commentthe world design is very good. Signs, trashes, lights, etc all are in this game its like i run on NYC streets but the ambient is so dark like the urban NYC streets, this make the game more realistic and deepStory the story is very good and deep but dark .. like the ambient but i hate when ROMAN CALL ME TO GO BOWLING ... this sucksThe problem on this game are the optimization and the pc versionok on my old pc with and intel duo 2.2 ghx and an nvidia gtx 330m i run this with 40 fps on medium settings on high 1520 yes this is a big problem now i run with 4060 on maxed and the patches from pc are just bug fixes ... yeah i play a game from pc like im on ps3 just the dlc save this
