runs like total crap, game for windows live is horrible, I had a disc version of this game that just would not activate, having errors every time, not even manually, so I threw it out and got the steam version hoping it would be easier, it didnt need activation but games for windows live is still horrible corrupt software that was difficult to get working, and then the 1.0.8.0 patch that couldnt find GFWL after I istalled the latest version, horrible, horrible experience, never buying this game again, not even worth 5
