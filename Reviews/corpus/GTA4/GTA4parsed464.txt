I bought GTA IV as part of bundle deal years ago, and did so believing I could get past the issues so many people reported it having. I was wrong. Very wrong.Do not buy this. It does not work. I have been able to play it once, and it lagged severely on a gaming laptop that can run TW3 on ultra settings.This is my favourite GTA, too bad the only place to experience it is a whole console generation ago.
