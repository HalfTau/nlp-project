for some reason i cannot play this game on my pc, it automatically installs as 32 bit but keeps freezing at startup and troubleshooter says incompatible b/c my pc is running 64bit. any tips on what i need to do to be able to play it on my pc? its a new windows 10 that is even good enough to run WoW on ultra, and i dont understand y i cant play this game on it lol. any help would be appreciated. i do recommend this game though, had it for playstation and it is a very fun game, screw the haters, you dont need mods and all that
