Everything has been said about this game.If you get GFWL working, its all good.However, its very CPU intensive and its performance tends to change randomly with no correlation with specs.Using a highend i5 and a R9 290 and I run the game fine.The video editor is a cool feature and is a good exclusive feature for the PC version.The game is great, not really much to it as its already been said.
