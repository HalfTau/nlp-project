i would not recomend this game because when i first got it, it did not run on my computer so i had to install a special software to run it then when i got on it wouldnt let me sign into my rockstar acount so i couldnt save the game and on top of that it is so laggy and slow that it takes about 3 seconds to punch right after you click
