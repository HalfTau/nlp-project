There are so many negative ratings at this game that i must warn everyone who willing to buy GTA 4.The game actually works, if you spend like half an hour to solve the base problems. In my opinion its worth the effort you have to put into this to make it going. There are many good guides in the games threads so you can easily solve the problems around the game.I dont really would like to get into details about the game itself, because i think most of you know this masterpiece.So dont get scared by the lots of negative reviews. You can also play multiplayer ONLINE.
