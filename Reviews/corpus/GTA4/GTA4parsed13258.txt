The game itself is great  follow the plotlines, enjoy the sights of the city its Grand Theft Auto at its core.  The last mission in the game, on the other hand, is BROKEN  a glitch exclusive to the PC version of the game renders the last mission impossible to complete.  If you want to play the game, cheat it to smithereens and allaround have a good time, go ahead and pick this game up  but if you try to platinum every game you play, keep your distance from this one!
