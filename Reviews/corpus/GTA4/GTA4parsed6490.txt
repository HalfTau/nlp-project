Really funny characters, fun gameplay, great modding scene, open world, tons of stuff to do. Whats not to love? The game is often critiqued for being too serious but I have absolutely no idea why anyone would say that. I have yet to meet a serious character in the game. Even when youre beating theout of a guy hes cracking jokes. With Icenhancer the game really becomes something special. The visuals are improved to the point where playing it is actually enjoyable. Especially when you have a vehicle handling mod installed. Liberty Citys setting like in every GTA game exists solely to make a parody of the American way of life along with a satire of the average citizens life. And its really funny.After installing one of the many GFWL removers the game runs poorly. To note I have an i5 4590 and a GTX 970. The games performance in vanilla without modifications never went above 54 FPS for whatever reason, possibly some in game vysnc problem because I used an external application to force Vsync and triple buffering and then I could reach 60fps sometimes. With Icenhancer performance usually hovers around 45FPS which is alright considering this is the worst port Ive played since Dark Souls. With everything configured correctly assuming you have a decent setup you shouldnt have a hard time enjoying GTA IV despite the framerate issues on every system setup.All together its one hell of game that Im glad to finally be able to play. It takes the best elements of San Andreas and implements them in a more refined and beatiful world. If I had to compare the gameplay to another game Id say its a mix of Watch Dogs GTA ripoff, Saints Row 2, and a little bit of Sleeping Dogs.Nikos a fantstic protagonist and listening to his conversations is great. Buy this game!
