I first played this for Xbox 360, and i got bored really fast because of the dull, depressing graphics.Not until 2014 i picked it up on steam for PC, And whoa, thats a huge difference of graphics.It runs fluid and perfect on PC and looks amazing, I love it!So for the gameplay, its amazing and funny, the multiplayer is sweet. Its kinda dead thou but some people are still on.Of course theres the games windows live and some error when starting but run as admin and its fixed.Dont listen to theese  below who dont know how to fix some minor system things for games. Great game.
