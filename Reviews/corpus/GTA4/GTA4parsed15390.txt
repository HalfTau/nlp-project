Apperantly Microsoft and Rockstar areuddies and Microsoft sucks marger A. That being said, I love Rockstar games, but apperantly you have to sing into a xbox live account to save any game progress.  I litterally hate Microsoft, everyone that works ther should litterally Kil themselves.  You mess up everything that is great and I cant weait to see all of you in hell. Im so over there bull and i dont even want to play this game game anymore even though I will.  I relate Microsoft to Walmart which is the devi, so you have been warned.
