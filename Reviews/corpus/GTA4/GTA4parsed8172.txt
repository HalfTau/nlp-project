Probably a great game, the one thing missing is beeing able to play it. I bought this game on a package in sale, and if it wasnt for GTA San Andreas, Vice City or III I would have considered it a complete waste of money. Installed a bunch of times on slow internet, a total of nearly a week of downloading time for all the various times I have downloaded it, another week trying to make it work and nothing. I have given up. If you want this game just create a folder named Grand Theft Auto IV in your desktop, its the exact same game but takes less time to download and less hard drive space. I feel so robbed with this game that some day Ill probably download an illegal copy just to be able to play, as even a hacker makes the game work better than the people who created it, who are just plain money leeches and dont give a crap about probably one of their best games, so you have to buy the newer one or get stuck with a game you cant even return becouse you spent so much time trying to fix it unseccessfully that even steam wont take it back.
