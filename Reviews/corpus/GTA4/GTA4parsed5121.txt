I love Grand Theft Auto so much, but it sucks how you have to have a Windows Live Account to just play it and other stuff, You can play it in offline mode which is good because it still saves all the stuff youve done in campaign but it would be nice if you didnt have to play it in offline mode and would be good if the Social Club thing worked for it as well but it doesnt which sucks and a lot of people are annoyed about it.
