This requires a microsoft live account for savegames. I dont remember it being so stupid when first bought, it might have been a later update. It is idiotic to say the least to require this for a save game. Besides, I wanted to play with no savegames  it is impossible. At first attempt to save, despite using No, dont retrly the program stupidly attempted to get me to use ms live again and again  it was impossible to get to the menu, impossible to do anything but use the Task Manager and End Process to close the program I cant call it a game anymore.
