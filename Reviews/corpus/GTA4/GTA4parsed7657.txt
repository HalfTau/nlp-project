Its a real shame what happened to this port, it really is, and it saddens me that people dont recommend the game because of this. The story is a million times better than Five and a lot of the key sandbox elements Car damage, picking stuff up, more satisfying kills, etc. are done worse or are just not there in GTA 5.PLEASE even though the game is a bad port and you need to have a fix to get it to work with GFWL, buy it. You will have a lot more fun with it.
