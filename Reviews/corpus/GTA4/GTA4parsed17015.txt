Amazing game, loved playing it so much on Xbox 360 I got it for steam too. So why am I not recommending it? Well Im not sure if everyone is getting this but whenever I start it up it asks me to login to my rockstar games account. So I type in my information and either A it says that I used the wrong login information or B it logs in but it doesnt start the game. I tried to look up solutions on forums numerous times but nothing seems to help. My understanding is that they hyped up security on their games because of people trying to pirate the latest installment in the series GTA VI. Dont get me wrong, this is still an amazing game but I recommend waiting a while before you get it, atleast until they have lowered security or they fixed the problem.
