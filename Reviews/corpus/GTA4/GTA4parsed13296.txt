12/10 Best Games for Windows Live Installation  Update Simulator 2014! I literally couldnt do anything other than install Games for Windows Live! D It was great!Anyway, the game is pretty fun! I havent played it much, thanks to the whole 1 hour GFWL installation battle I had to go through, but it is worth it in the end. Im loving it!
