A very fun game indeed. One of my favorite Grand Theft Autos. You can bowl, eat, play darts and pool. Its just like a life simulator. Not much to do other than drive around at night trying to find a hooker, to ride you for 100 for about 35 seconds. You could also step foot onto the runway of the airport and get a 4 star wanted level right away.SetupPretty easy, just that you have to download Games for Windows to get it to work on window 8.xAfter that you can customize your settings easily before and ingame.GraphicsThe graphics are not bad in this game, I like to play in Medium texture and High for the rest except for shaders which I find them annoying. Even on the highest without a HD Pack on its looks pretty good.GiG Game in GeneralWhen you start out you can explore the one island of the city, or just go right onto missions. Its pretty hard to make money without getting a wanted level. You can browse a site calledOr .org to find every secret on the map. Rob banks, mug drunk females, drive up a swingset and go shooting across the map.My ExpressionsPunched a cop in the face ran for 2 miles on foot until I found a helicopter. Finally found a online match. We robbed the bank and had RP RolePlay Server Police have about 24 units on us. Flew right into a bridge body flew and hit a bill board of a woman with stars on her Went back home and fell asleep happy, and GTA IV has stopped workingThank you Rockstar for the game with extreme physics.
