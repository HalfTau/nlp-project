I used to love all the GTA 3 games and finally bought GTA IV. As the other games its simply amazing. A big open world and so much to do. The only thing that was bothering me a bit was the reduction safe houses. After you progress to the second island you loose the safehouse on the first island and will never get another there. But that is only a minor flaw. After more than 120 hours Im done with all quests and reached 100. Now on to Liberty City stories...
