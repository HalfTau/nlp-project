GTA IV takes place in Liberty City, in the year 2008.We play as Niko Bellic, an immigrant with a complicated past that just arrived in America, looking for a new life in the Land of opportunity Great graphics for the time still very good Fantastic physics, the RAGE engine was/is groundbreaking The best car handling in the series and cars got damaged more easily The best car chases of the series because of these factors My favourite story of the series, the darkest one as well  Niko is a badass and the best protagonist of GTA IMO Big, very detailed open world, Liberty is still one of the most realistic looking cities in an open world game that Ive ever seen not as much variation as San Andreas or V, though Nice variety of weapons less than SA, though Cars, motorcycles, helicopters, boats Great soundtrack, as expected from a GTA game Especially Liberty Rock Radio Huge mod community Combat was the Best in the series Until V improved it Friend activities add a lot of detail to the story, but can get tiresome this is very minor, as they are not required to progress the story Flying rats as the hidden collectibles, A LOT of them Also minor, and only matters if you want 100 completion GFWL. One of the worst DRMs ever. Fortunately removable by the x.liveless mod Terrible PC port. I still cant play it as smoothly as GTA V, many years after release Less vehicle style variation than previous games Bicycles and Planes are missing Less character customization than SA, on IV we can only change the clothes Vehicles are not customizable Mods kind of fix thisI still remember waiting anxiously for this game back in 2008, and even if it has a few less content than SA in some ways, it was totally worth it!One of my favourite games ever, completely recommended!
