Unsupported, terrible experience. Whatever game there was is no longer available since it has never been freed from Games for Windows Live dependency. Despite having a Microsoft account in good standing, Im unable to save the game. This is, as you might expect, a hindrance to enjoying it.The game itself might be good! The worldbuilding seems to all be there, the environments look good, and the systems Ive been able to interact with so far all appear to work. On the other hand, Ive played for over an hour and this is what Ive done1. Drive around2. Answer a cellphone3. Buy blue jeans4. Go bowling fully simulated5. Hand to hand combat6. Kill some people because they were angry at my useless cousin who owed them moneyThere is probably a game there! I have not played it yet. And now I have to start over. Unless youre more patient than I am with trying to figure out how to fix GFWL and Rockstars club and the rest of the stuff that surrounds but is not integral to the game, I would not recommend buying this. Go get it on a console from a bargain bin.
