8/10  Im in the unpopular opinion about this but I think Grand Theft Auto IV when talking about the entire trilogy is a much much better game than Grand Theft Auto V, the latter which is massively overated. A departure from the previous entries in the series, Grand Theft Auto IV goes the more serious route, which both works in its favour but also hinders the game in many places as there is less focus on exploration, which helps the storyline but this in itself contridicts the fact that the game is an open world game. Now lets talk about the hoaky as  physics, the physics to say the least are very uneven, in places its relistic as  and in other places its untter , if you can ignore this eventhing else in the game is basically pitch perfect. If you like games with serious cinematic stories this is the game for you
