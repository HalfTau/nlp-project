I think this game is absolutely amazing and you should buy it. Everything you expect from a GTA game set in a stunning city that looks great, even after 9 years, and really, really, really fun gameplay.This game got reviewbombed pretty damn hard because of problems with Rockstar Social Club, Games for Windows Live, and crashes, but I havent had any trouble with that.Theres really only two things I didnt like about the game. First, the friendship business where the game constantly nags you to take your friends bowling to keep them happy, but if you dont, the game doesnt punish you for it so I just ignored all of their calls.Secondly, the way the story is paced. The first few hours are slow as hell before gradually building up. Between the time you unlock the second safe house and the time you unlock Alderney I really had the feeling I was making progress. But the moment you unlock Alderney the game comes to a screeching halt, and the next 10 hours are spent doing jobs for secondary characters that dont affect the plot in the slightest. Then in the last hour every single story thread gets tied up right after each other before the game ends.That said, the gameplay and freedom are amazing, the story and characters are interesting and theres a radio station that plays Bad Brains, which makes it more than worth the 19,99,9/10
