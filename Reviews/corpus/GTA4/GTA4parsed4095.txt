Grand theft auto 4 is the best GTA in my opinion as far as story goes. It is very different from many GTA titles due to its more serious tone however it does have alot of personality similar to is predicesors. The balance between these two apsects is perfect and i feel like thats what distinguishes this Gta from the rest. You play as a immigrant named Niko Bellic Starting a new life in liberty city only to find out that things are not so different from the place he came from. The gameplay is a bit clunky by todays standards but once you get used to it, it wont really be too much of  a issue. The physics in this game are superior to gta v in every aspect and amplify the experience through their fun nature. The multiplayer is simplistic and fun unlike gta v where microtransactions seem to be the focus. This game is a 10/10. The only thing holding this title back is the lack of optimization on pc. Odds are you will have to fix it when you buy it like i have done multiple times. This is basically a console port to pc so be casious of that. However if your confident your pc can run it or you can fix it pick this title up.
