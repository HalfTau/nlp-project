This game gets a thumbs down because it doesnt work without doing extra work. And Rockstar is aware of these issues but wont produce a patch. Otherwise GTA IV is awesome.To get the game to run if you are on Windows 8.1 and maybe lower you need to download and install the latest Games For Windows Live. Yes GFWL is cancer but it is required. Just Google it and hope the download link is still up. It is  you need this considering GFWL is DEAD and no longer supported.Then if you have a video card above 2 gigs you need to do two things to ensure it runs properly. GTA IV assumes you do not meet the requirements and limits your graphics settings. To get around this make a file in the GTA IV install folder called commandline.txt without the qoutes. Then put nomemrestrict norestrictions without the qoutes inside of the file and save. Then goto your Steam launch settings for the game and put those two settngs in there like the you did the file.You are welcome. Where are my support royalties Rockstar?
