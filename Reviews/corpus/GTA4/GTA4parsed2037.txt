Grand Theft Auto IV is the fourth game of the GTA series, unlike the past games this one has a much darker story and its well written. This is the first game in the series to introduce phones and friends. While the game itself is a masterpiece the PC version is looked down upon due to the game being locked at 2040 fps even in modern hardware, GFWL being obligatory and the latest update removing mods support it can be downgraded easily though. This is one of the best GTA games if not the best.
