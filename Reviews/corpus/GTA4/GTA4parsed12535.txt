The core gameplay is continuously interrupted by a wierd babysitting mechanic that forces you go and fetch a character only to sit through the same comedy show 15 times or play dumb mini games.  This gets very annoying and you are forced to do it in order to maintain your reputation. In the end, I never actually managed to finish the story.Also, the PC port of this game is so horribly butchered that youll need to turn the settings right down to get it to run properly.
