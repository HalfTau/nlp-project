Well I cant say this game is too great anymore becuase it runs on Windows Live wich is no longer supported. But You can get the game running on a windows 7 PC but you will not be able to go online or and here is the big one SAVE YOUR GAME! I mean this game is great if you go through all the crap it takes to get it to run... Overall I love GTA and the franchise But this one due to windows live falls short on my list.
