One of the best GTA games IMHO. Great vibrant city, great gameplay, and some pretty decent graphics. If only Roman didnt want to go bowling so damn often...P.S. I have a hard copy of the game and it doesnt run nearly as smoothly as the Steam version does, especially on my pretty old rig. I dont know why is that, but Id definitely recommend buying it from here, even if you already have it on a DVD.
