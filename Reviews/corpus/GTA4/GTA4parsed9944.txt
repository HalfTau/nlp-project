Rockstar finally decided to update the game and they did it very well. All the bugs and errors stopping people playing the game have vanished in the latest patch. Would reccomend now as the game has been patched to make it playable!Previous review down below. Edited the review from negative to positive.Good luck trying to launch the game... but when you do at least for me it is litterally unplayable.e.g.Only buy if you have money to throw away on a useless piece of I am ashamed to have this in my libary!
