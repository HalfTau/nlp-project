The game is great but you cant play the game. you need a rockstar account that wont even work on launch becauce my account details are wrong according to rockstar, a windows live account which is impossible to make and if you dont make one you wont get to save i acutally dont know if it is that hard . the game wont open, i have tried to play this on two computers and have not had any luck with this t. rockstar dose not give a  you are just going to have to get gta 5 or you can waste 3 hours trying to solve all the errors realising that you cant get a damm refund cuz you left the game on or you have had for 2 weeks.
