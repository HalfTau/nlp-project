i know i dont have really any time played on this game, but thats due to the fact that this game does not even load up. The game by itself is fantastic, i loved spending hours upon hours playing it on my ps3, and i thought it would be fun to play gta 4 on the pc to use some fun mods, which completely changes the game to being a blast. but after over a year of hopping back on to see if it was fix, it never was. i was happy when they realeased patch notes saying they fixed the start up, and thought that i could actually play the game now. sadly, it would seem the games loadup is still broken, now not even saying anything nor loading when pressing play at the start menu. as it is right now, dont buy it. your wasting 20 for a game that does not even start up. but, if they truely down the road fix the game, totally buy it. youll have loads of fun using the mods and the over all game itself. but until then, keep an eye out of the game.
