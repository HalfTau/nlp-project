Now I have about 50 hours ingame GTA IV so I thought id do a simple little reviewHonestly this game wouldnt even be known today if it wasnt for the mods. This game, its a  and cant handle as much as our beastly gaming towers! But this game, is amazing.I personally only play for LCPDFR a mod where your a cop. But ummm yeah so if you are thinking about modding and want to play online join a clan so then you are not with randoms who have the whole game as a mod. Me, I prefer offline. Hate online games to be honest but anywayHere are the mods I personally recomend1. LCPDFR2. Simple Native Trainer3. ELS4. ANY CAR MODS5. FIRST PERSON6. ANY ENB TO IMRPOVE GRAPHICS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WITH 60FPS ON MAX SETTING OR MEDIUM7. PED MODELS8. GUN MODELS9. ANY WORKING SCRIPTS THAT BENIFIT YOUR GAMEPLAY10. MAP ADDONS OR MAP REPLACEMENTS REALLY DOESNT MATTERNow for all these things you need or may like to use OpenIV The simple more modern version of SparkIV.You need GFWL to play if Windows 8 or Higher.All in all if you are great at waiting for the game to start up because of how many times your almost definite to crash then youll love it!This game was my first ever Xbox 360 game and now my first pc game Thav ive learned to mod in succesfullyPEACE
