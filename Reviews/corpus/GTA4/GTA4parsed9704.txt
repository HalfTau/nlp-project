I do NOT want to go bowling in a GTA titleYour idiot cousin Roman, who is quite possibly one of the most obnoxious video game characters ever. Sure Navi is bad, but at least she dosnt call you up at random times and asks if you want to go ing bowlingGFWL, but you can circuvent it with Gigantic reduction in gamespace variety and character customization compared to GTASAAtrocious optimiztion. This flatout crushed my Dualcore Opterion and 8800GTS back in the day, and my current rig with a 3570K and 7870 spits out lest then spectacular framerates at max settings.Takes itself too serisouslyAfter coming from the supurb GTASA this is just a massive slap in the face. GTA4 lacks all of the charm, chracter, and delightfully toungeincheek wit from past GTA titles. Oh yeah sure the gameplay is fine like I mentioned above, but the boring gamespace and overly serious story just sucks all of the fun out of the game. This is not the series I fell in love with anymore.
