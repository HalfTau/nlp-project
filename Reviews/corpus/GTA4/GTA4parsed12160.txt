TERRIBLE PORT!!!had to go through so much stuff just to get the game running....first was the infinite load screen glitch that would leave the game in the load screen without ever actually loading google how to solve it...justme off...wasted like 30 minutes waiting....second was the cant change video resolution glitch also solved in a similar way...google it....and third was the fact that this game is riddled with FPS drops multiple areas of Liberty City where your FPS will suddenly drop to 110 frames a second....i mean sure it isnt optimizied for windows 8.1, but it shouldnt be a problem running the game at 60 fps on mediumhigh settings...I mean my computer can run Battlefield 4 on max settings with constant 60 fps...yet this game cant....SMH...dont believe me...just go on the forums and watch the amount of people who have 3 times better comp specs tell you the same exact thingTLDR Although GTA4 is a good game, this is a pretty bad pc port that wouldnt be worth buying just due to all the bugs and random stupid FPS drops that annoy the heck out of me, even while on sale....Im just hoping GTA5 would be a way better port to PC...
