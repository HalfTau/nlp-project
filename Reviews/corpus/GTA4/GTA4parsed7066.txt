1.6 hours on record and guess how many of that is actually playing the game! ZERO! ING ZERO! I cant beleive steam is selling this game. 1.6 hours on loading screens and crashing. Who knows how long I spent reading forums and downloading patches THAT DID NOTHING!!!!! I cant even load this game to see how it runs. WHY IS THIS FOR SALE HERE????? I wish i could get a refund, but I purchased it so long ago and forgot about it because it wouldnt run, but I built a nice PC and decided to give it another shot on better hardware. NOPE.
