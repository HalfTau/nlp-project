This is an unplayable game.  One can manage to patch out GFWL, and select Play Offline to access the single player campaign mode.  The game is riddled with bugs such as unintelligible stuttering audio, or spontaneous drunk camera mode.Its not going to be worth a 2.99 sale price for most people.  You might just spend hours trying to get this game to launch.  Ask yourself, what is your time actually worth?
