Cant play this since Games for Windows Live got taken down. If a game is still for sale on steam it should be possible to start and play it, no exceptions.It serves me right for saving games to play them when I have time. I need to get used the reality being that many games with DRM are effectively rented to us and will work for as long as the devs feel it is worth their while to support them.
