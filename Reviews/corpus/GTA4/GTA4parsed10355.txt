The PC version of GTAIV  is quite possibbly the single worst/laziest port from Gaming Console to PC in the history of the GTA Franchise. The controlls are either keyboard and mouse, or an XBox360 controller whose button mapping matches that of the XBox360 version. There is no way to remap the controls.That being said, this is a solid game in of itself when you have the right hardware. The most recent patches to the Steam version make it playable on Windows 10. You will still need an XBox360 controller or a program named XBox360ce to use both Gamepad and Keyboard and Mouse at the same time.
