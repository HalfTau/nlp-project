Played for an hour and boy how i hate this game... i never played GTA before and after all the people telling how good this game was, i bought it on sale from amazon. combat is horrible, car driving not that fun.. worst is this game still have GFWL? most game already switching away from GFWL and this game still with GFWL...maybe im being harsh since i just finished playing Sleeping Dogs but really after all that hype about this game i just feel it doesnt deserve it... im sorry for all GTA fans out there.
