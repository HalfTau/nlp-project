Little more than an hour trying to get this game to even OPEN!!!!! Says I can play offline, but wont let me!Tried to sign into the account thats needed to play and nothing happens keep doing the same thing over and over and have yet to even be able to open the game!I dont even care about playing online but it still wont let me do anything offline either, it just keeps saying i need to LOG INBut I cant even do that it just brings up the same message.And yes the info i put in is right cause I even went to the webpage and i can sign in just fine but on here it wont go past that point!!!!!!!!
