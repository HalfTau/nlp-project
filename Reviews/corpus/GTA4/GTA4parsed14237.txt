Great and fun game, AMAZING multiplayer, mundane, boring single player story, with several interesting but dull moments. Multiplayer is the highlight, and fun to do with friends. But, the game fails with the addition of Windows Live. It just complicates things and prevents many from being able to play. Be cautious when buying...for pc.
