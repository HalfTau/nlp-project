So ive had a brief history with this game. First playthrough had to stop because of a mission which kept on freezing no matter what I did.After some time I return to the game to play multiplayer only to discover that multiplayer isnt supported for windows 10.Once again after a while, I decided to give the game one last chance.Annnd the game wont even launch now.I understand I bought this game a while ago but never the less I paid for it. If i pay for a product Rockstar, I expect it to WORK. To anyone reading this save your money from lots of pointless frustration and dont waste your time with this pathetic excuse of a port.
