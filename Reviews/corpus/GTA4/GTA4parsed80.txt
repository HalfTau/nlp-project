Maybe Im just used to the super easy installations on Steam one of the key features that made me a thourough fan 1 click to install, another to play. Among hundreds of games, worst case was to confirm another EULA...I bought this game at launch almost a decade ago, and I remember the trouble vividly. Effectively unplayable for months, for a decent percentage of players, uhm, buyer. Also, I still remember how terrifying the rest proved lots of troublesome sideinstallations  Games for Windows, Rockstar Social Club, bah.Okay, so now I get this in a bundle, and wanted to give it a go for nostalgic reasons. And I cant believe it. Social Club is still mandatory, in case you want to save your game, that is. Didnt have my old login, tried to recover through email. Sent me to website, link broken meanwhile?. Tried to register an account  same story. Link broken and / or leading to Rockstar mainpage... Tried for half an hour. Stopped and decided to cater to my nice memories of this beautiful game.This game is great, very beautiful in any respect. But I feel very disappointed, that it cant be made running more smoothly. I adore Rockstars works, and I understand the economic background to these decisions, but for a 10yo game on Steam, the way to make it actually happen should be less rocky...Edit To be fair, right after writing this, I actually found the hint about the broken links  on the shop page! Didnt look there, never needed to check the shop page after purchase. I did browse the community pages for a while, but in vain aka felt stupid doing so, and played a round PUBG...
