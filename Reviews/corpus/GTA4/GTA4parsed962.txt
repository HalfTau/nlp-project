Ok so ignoring the optimization issiues this is one of my favorite open world games ever made. It has a good story with fun charactors, fun free roam and, a fun multplayer. When it comes to the pc port just play the console version the pc port has a ton of optimization issues.so i give the game on its own a 8.5/10
