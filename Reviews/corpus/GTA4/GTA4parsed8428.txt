Impossible to play nowadays.In order to save game progress, you have to be logged on to Games for Windows Live  which would be ok hadnt it been for the fact that it wont accept the CDkey Steam provides you with.wont accept the key either for whatever reason.The game itself is good, but  as mentioned before its unplayable.Dont purchase this unless Rockstar/Steam/Microsoft have actually fixed it.
