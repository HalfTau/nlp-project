After half hour of dealing with an evil thing called Windows Live, I got a message that made my blood boil Cant connect to LIVE. You may be using a Windows Live ID from a region that is not supported by LIVE....So that means i cannot play online and it was the ONLY reason i bought this game.. I think it is not fair for me and also other people from unsupported countries who bought this game. Steam should AT LEAST put an warning notification for people attempting to buy it.This is the same for GTA IV EFLC
