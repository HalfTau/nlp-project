I like GTA4 but I think its taking itself a bit too seriously in contrast to its predecessors. To be fair, if I wanted a wacky GTA, Id go play Saints Row, but then again GTA5 had such a hit release that its clear I need to stop making reviews on Grand Theft Auto and go do something else, like play more XCOM.
