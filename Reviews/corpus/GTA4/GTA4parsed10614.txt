A game with good story, working multiplayer, and.. a bad pc port. Other than that, people put Not Recommended reviews when they cant launch the game because they dont know how to FIX IT. Alrighty, this is my review.Pros Good story.Moddable. I mean, TONS AND TONS of mods.Tons of cars to steal, find, etc.Good day/night cycle  realistic weather.Good unarmed fighting.Smart AI.Cons Random lag spikes. I EVEN HAVE WAY OVER MINIMUM PERFORMANCE.Bad pc port..Crashes. well, if you spawn a bunch of peds or cars with mods..Uses GFWL.. GFWL  Games For Windows Live  basically a ghost town.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaannnnnnd thats bout it. Id give this game a 7 out of 10. 1 for being so empty. yet singleplayer is fun. 2 for the horrible pc port. ROCKSTAR PLEASE MAKE THE PORT BETTER. .
