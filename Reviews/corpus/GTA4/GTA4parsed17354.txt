DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! YOU WILL REGRET IT! The game itself is great and ive played it for many hours on consoles, The thing is, the game does not work at all. The CD key does not work and you will get many headaches, it is not your PC that cant run it, The game is not supported anymore and id me suprised if GTA V comes to PC.... People think its a good idea to keep it on consoles so they can finaly have a game that we dont have......... but if your lucky and get the game to work, It will be a great experienceEDIT The game works fine if you download the program GFWM, I figured this out a hour after I wrote the orginal, I would def play this game
