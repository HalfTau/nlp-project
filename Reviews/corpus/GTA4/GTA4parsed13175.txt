A great game hampered by only a few issues.First off! if you have a low end PC, dont fret, there is a mod that will halp make the game run on your system. Ive got a really crappy 7 year old laptop and it runs pretty solidly.Now, the prosThe game is just straight up fun. Whether youre driving around running people over in single player or teaming up with some buddies to take out the cops in Multiplayer, its a lot of fun. Its got a sweet open world city full of civilizans, and hidden secrets...The consThe story is... well pretty bad. I might be in the minority here, but the story did not keep me interested in the slightest, youre an immigrant, in America, than after 4 boring missions you go from working a taxi company to doing hits for some guys working with playboy? Its really dumb and takes way to long to unlock new islands...Games For Windows Live is here, and its angry. You want to save? Than you better be logged in to GFWL, otherwise... no saving for you. Or get the mod to remove it...The city, while big and varrying, is completely empty. Theres the food places to get food to eat, some clothing stores, and 1 bank you can go into for no purpose at all. Other than that, this is just a sandbox really... theres nothing to do other than drive around.So with all that said, do I recommend this game? Yes. Sure the story sucks, and the world is empty, but get together with some buddies and see how long you can last out against the cops, or download a mod that allows you to Roleplay as a cop, or really anything.Its a fun game thats hampered by a poor story and boring world. the GFWL can be fixed, the bad optimization can be fixed and if you dont like the story... downlaod a 100 save file...
