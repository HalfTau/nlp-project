I got this game Years ago for Christmas on my Xbox 360.. Ive played GTA 4 on multiple consoles including the PC version and i absolutely love this game. The story is amazing the Gameplay physics are hilarious but realistic at the same time. The humor was perfect but not too much.. I think too much humor in a GTA game ruins it and thats including GTA 5 if you want the reasons why i think GTA 5 is crap reply haha. But back on topic the atmosphere of GTA 4 was perfect. The Characters are amazing including Niko Bellic, Roman and Brucie plus the multiple endings.. The Online was and still is my favourite mode on GTA 4. I still play the Online to this day.. The cool features i love in GTA 4 is where you can pick things up from the ground and throw it at people hehe, The other part is where you can steal a Police Car and use the computer to kill criminals another Part is where you can be an assassin and kill off your targets and one more of my favourites is where you can Kill Playboy X and get his apartment plus a secret GTA 3 outfit. Overall i played GTA 4 30 times not even sick of it.. So everyone GTA 4 is 100 recommended. An awesome game is when you finish it and you keep going back to play it over and over again
