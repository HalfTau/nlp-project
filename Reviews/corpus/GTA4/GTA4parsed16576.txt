So i got GTAIV and i finished downloading the game and i click on the game to play so i could run round online with a few of my friends, but hold up im running windows 8.1 with directx11b it says it has an issue  mmm what issue, after thinking i had to sign up to get it to work and sign in at social club it says ok logged in and then the game doesnt start after freaking round for 40 mins i find out i have to install some third party software from a bodgy looking site GTA vision if there was a fix rockstar would have fixed it not some hacking kids on a webpage. so im out of pocket 10 bucks for a game thats ing useless.
