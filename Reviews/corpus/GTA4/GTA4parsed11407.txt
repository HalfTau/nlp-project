Really tried to like this one, as everyone else seems to love the series. I was just bored through the entire thing. Only played for so long, because I was sure I was missing something. But... The gameplay just felt bland. Thirdperson shooting or beating people, and then drive a car like an idiot, without getting caught by the police or any moral dilemma. And it doesnt help I think gangster/mafia stories are boring. Hey, Tony, mah man! Come ere! Hey hey... Listen here, aight? Yknow this nigguh down at Palm Street? Yeah, ma boys tell me he be selling hison mah curb, ya hear? Yeah, I want you to get real nice and close and then shiv that muthafukka!  knows he aint messing with ma corner! BLAH BLAH, you feel, bro? Rinse, repeat, idiot on the street...
