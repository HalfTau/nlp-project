AS OF 12/27/2016I love GTA 4. The game is amazing in many ways both multiplayer and singleplayer. But with the recent update the game is actually unplayable so I cannot recommend this game, if you have a PS3 or Xbox 360 I strongly recommend playing this game. Thank you for the wonderful memories GTA 4, and  you GFWL.
