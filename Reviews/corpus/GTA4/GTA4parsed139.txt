After about 2 hours trying to get this game to run on a Windows 10 machine I have given up. The game starts up alright, but even with a High end PC lags to below 20fps.Seeing input from others who also purchased the Humble Bundle, this seems to be an ongoing and understandable issue given the games age issue.So as such, great game. Cannot possibly recommend to purchase on PC because unless you run anything below Windows 8 you are gonna have a bad time
