However hard it may be for some people to run this title, including myself, this is still a great game. I find that if you turn your page file off and have enough ram, it helps with the studdering. And yes this game does work on windows 10, although on all versions of windows you need games for windows marketplace before the install to play multiplayer. The game is 10/10 , the morons that ported this game, 0/10
