The goal that take two has is not to grant its costumers the enjoy of hours and hours but rather earn as much money as possible by limiting the rights that we have to change our singleplayer experience. They have over and over ed us, the consumers, on what we can do and we have to extend our time in the game. The threats they made now to open4 is the last straw and has changed my view on rockstar and take2 forever
