bugs everywhere.low fps.Its not compatible with Mac yet.This game is good once you can run it smooth but the requirments on this page are false. You need to have more than 256mb of GPU memory to actually play the game. This game would be useless if it wasnt for the mods which GTA 4 mods are better than GTA 5 mods.yesmI cant even play it! I want my 19.99 backI dont recommend this game!This game is not worth the time it takes to set everything up.so first i made a social club account then i downloaded games for windows live Which i hate so much!then i made an account for games for windows live but for some ing reason i had to make an account like 3 timesbecause it said something about a wrong id everytime and then took me to a web page that dosent work! Really!then when i enter the game finally the setting were on the lower saying my pc is too weak to handle itI have a ing amd r9 290x!so i had to look it up then i fixed it i enter the game on the highest setting because its a ing game from 2008and i get 3040 fps like wtf? i run GTA V on 60 on high and very high settings!so to sum up this is not worth your money iv played this game 30 hours! with 3040 the multiplayer sucksbecause everyone is using mods and you cant kill them. Most of the time there are no people online at all!Please dont buy this game for pc atleast not for 20 dollars.Obviously a great game. If youre looking at this store page you probably already know that.The PC version doesnt work without Games For Windows Live GFWL, and it wouldnt even let me save the game if I didnt register with Rockstars Social Club service.Keyboard/Mouse controls are just as bad in GTA IV as they are in GTA San Andreas, so youll need some sort of controller.HA.I love gta 4, they just need to make it so you can use a larger graphics card with it. I cant change any of my settings they are locked at low x.Rockstar Plz Fix!!!! !It didnteven let me sign in itme off
