The game is not made for pc,it runs like a cow,saves dosent work,windows live games fetures    a BIG waste of money ...Edit After years of it being hidden in my libary I tried to reinstall it, just wasted my time trying to play a game that wont even start now! I also sadly linked my Xbox live account to rockstar social club thought it would fix the problem, but it did not. As I said before STAY AWAY from this game....
