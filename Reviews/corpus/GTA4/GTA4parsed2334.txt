Give me money. Money me. Money now. Me a money needing a lot now.TakeTwo, probably.TakeTwo is as greedy as much as this game is genuinely amazing sans mods. Oh well. Maybe they can start charging for x liveless love that they censor that reference too... oh yeahh. Maybe even...if you want to run at max specs that could be an additional fee as well! Premium Rate Patches on future games because its not a bug, its a feature. However for a small fee TakeTwo can mod that unwated feature right out! Is this what everyone wants?
