So much DRM1. SecuROM2. Social Club3. GFWL soon to be retired and break multiplayerSo having tried to get multiplayer working, I discovered that modders and nonmodders cant play in the same game, even if one invites the other to a private match. After reverifying files, Social Club wont sign in. I have spent 1hr trying to get MP working.Single player is boring. The same mission repeated constantly, except for the bank robbery, which makes the rest of the game exceptionally dull in comparion.
