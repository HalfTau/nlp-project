Ive done a review on this game before, however, with Grand Theft Auto V a couple of weeks away I wanted to do a more uptodate, accurate review on Grand Theft Auto IV.I have played a very fair amount of this game  as you can tell above  and I have also completed the storyline to 100 so Ive done everything GTA IV has to offer. If youre buying this game for the story, you wont be let down, it is honestly some of the best scripting and gameplay Ive ever witnessed on a videogame. Some of the missions can be extremely dull however... Such as Drive there, shoot him but its worth playing through them to play missions such as Four Leaf Clover it has honestly stuck with me ever since I played it, true gaming moment.  The bank robbery mission .The majority of people who buy GTA IV on PC / Mac, Whatever seem to buy it for one purpose... Modding, and theres a reason, its an amazing game to mod. Be warned however, dont let the pre2010 release date fool you, youll need decent hardware to mod this into a new game, such as Iron Man IV Search JulioNIB Or LCPD First Response Search LCPDFR...While talking about Modding this game, if you have a good graphics card, Id recommend Searching CryENB V3, Its a complete graphics overhaul and it makes this game look better than the console GTA Vs  Like thats hard... HAHA Overall, Before people get bored of reading, if youve even got this far. You can probably tell, I love this game... Id imagine Id still recommend it in 10 years time, as I do GTASA.Decent PC, Get this!HighEnd rig, This is my personal favourite game to mod, youll love it...Struggle running GTASA, Avoid this game, buy a new GPU then consider buying.
