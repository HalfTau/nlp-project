The game is 10 years old and the only thing that kept it alive so long was modifications. This game however was the first of the Grand Theft Auto series that created a more realistic world environment. I spent so much of my life playing this game and writing this review is to let players know that this game is no longer updated due to the development involved with Grand Theft Auto V. If you are trying to screw around with LCPDFR or other mods, you might find some fun left in this game.Only one CON of GTA IV PC is the horrible port to PC so you will often crash if you mod.
