I really like the stories told in this generation GTA. GTA V is childish by comparison. Unreasonable, annoying, dumb decisions and all, again, compared to GTA IV. I wish they would rerelease or update IV to get rid of GFWL and the settings not saving for just about anything in the options menu. Recommending, only because if you workaround the glitches and GFWL, these BOGT, TLAD as well are superior stories than GTA Vs.Edit 5/10/2017 Holy crap they got rid of GFWL and my settings save!
