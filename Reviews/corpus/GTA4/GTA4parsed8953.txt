Holy Hell is this game bad. I was incredibly excited to play this game since the last GTA game I got to play was San Andreas before taking a personal sabatical from gaming. The GTA franchise was by far one of my most favorite that Ive ever gotten to. Which is why I ALMOST tolerated creating 2! seperate offline accounts just to begin. I didnt and still dont understand the point but I tried. And then I got to the second account that has 0 to do with playing this game. Attempting to register and then login to Xbox live on a PC is worse than pulling teeth. Error after error, forced upgrades that didnt work one after the other, until finally, 2 hours later, i was persistant enough to get it to work.So finally, Im in! Time to play and catch up on what Ive missed since San Andreas! Nope! Impossibly wonky controls, streets that wouldnt load so it almost always looks like youre drving on water which is an insult to water as its more of just dark blue tiles in the middle of the city and finally, an error when I tried to save after putting up with this mess for 2 hours saying that Xbox Live wasnt properly connected. Never again. And Ive been a fan since topdown, GTA 2 through San Andreas. A 2 man dev operation like The Binding of Isaac guys can constantly release impecable content and fix bugs almost immediately but a team of hundreds that make up GTA employees cant even get one of their triple A titles to work on Steam? Disgusting. Thank God for Steam refunds. Not worth the 10 I paid for 5 games. Hell, Id have been happy to pay  10 at least to be able to play GTA IV alone.
