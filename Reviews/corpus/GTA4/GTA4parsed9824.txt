This peace of crap doesnt work. as soon as you launch it the thing will pop up saying sighn in or play offline if you dont sign in and play offline the window closes to start up the game and doesnt work. What happens you say when you do sign in you say the same thing and also it still says your account doesnt exist even if you know its right information. Ones or twice it actually launched but then then when i clicked play the loading screen just kept going on and on and then crashed.
