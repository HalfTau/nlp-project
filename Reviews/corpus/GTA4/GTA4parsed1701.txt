Great game, bad pc port. There are just so many things wrong with the pc version one of them is games for windows live and everybody knows that problem anyway. second of all when you do get past the social club sign in and the games for windows live thing you are greeted with horrible textures and sometimes no textures. look the point is that this is a great great gta game, the story is amazing and the gameplay is amazing but if you wanna play this game get it on xbox or ps3 then atleast you can enjoy the game without problems.
