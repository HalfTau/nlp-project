I would like to recommend this game, but truth be told it doesnt work with my computer. Ive tried multiple times to start it but all it does is boot up for a few minutes then shut itself off. I made an account with RockStar and that works just fine, its the game itself thats the problem. I dont know if its just my computer or my version or what, but its not working. So, for now, all I can say is I am excited for when I can play...until then...no likes or dislikes. Unless you count it not working, then I dont like it much.
