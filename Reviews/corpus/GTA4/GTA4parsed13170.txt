One of the great PC game tragedys Amazing game, terrible port. This game comes from an era when console to PC ports were put together with little to no optimizaztion or care. This game is exhibit A of that old trend. While the game itself is incredible, the poor optimization makes for a frustrating experience.If you can get it working, it will never be an optimal experience. Terrible frame rate hikes, broken textures, and it seems to be a hardware hog for no apparent reason. Six years later, on a current machine, it still runs terribly.
