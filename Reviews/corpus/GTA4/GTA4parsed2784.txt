Take Two basically banned singleplayer modding by sending a cease  desist letter to OpenIV. Rockstar seems like they forgot what made their GTA games better than they already were modding. Let alone the most recent update of GTA 4 killed ScriptHook, which allowed a large portion of old mods to work, now they basically just scrapped every kind of modding on GTA 4 and GTA 5.
