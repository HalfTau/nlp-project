Game is good, but not on computer. If you buy a game that requires a code to play, get a refund. The most buggiest crap ever, also I love games that dont even start up anymore!and yes, Ive downloaded Windows Games  Live, whatever its called.Rockstar if you cant make your games work on PC, stay on console!
