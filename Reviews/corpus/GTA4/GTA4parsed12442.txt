The few dollars I spent on this game were a complete waste.I only wish I saved the money and bought a chocolate bar instead, cause the amount and time of satisfaction I would have gotten while eating it would still be longer than my gameplay will ever be on this game.It doesnt even start.After I bought it and tried launching it, this rockstar games social club login popped up.Then I entered the correct email and pass several times and even tried offline play and still, it didnt launch.So I dug deeper into the reviews and some said it doesnt work sometimes with newer more up to date pcs and also it requires research and signing in to multiple services before even being able to launch it.That seems about right... not user friendly at all.Would update review if I ever at least get ingame.
