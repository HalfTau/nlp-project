Ok, im not saying the game looks bad, it looks really fun, but i need to be logged in to play a single player game, and if thats not bad enough, i cant save either. And when i went through a 30 min. install for it, it said i needed to make another account for xbox so i can get in for microsoft so i can log in for GTA 4 so i can play the single player so i can save!!! what the hell, if i wanted to play multiplayer then i can see loggging in, but for all that trouble in single player. If you have all the accounts it wants, then you are set to play, if not, go make them now or youll regret buying this. its a good thing i got this 80 off, but still, it said nothing of all this account BS, i bought the game, let me play it.
