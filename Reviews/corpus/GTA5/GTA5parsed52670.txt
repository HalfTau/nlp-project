Usually I would say it is a good game. BUT the developers are doing bad in the last updates... No more MODS, everything is getting SUPER expensive and you have to do things in public rooms so  pot heads dont let you do nothing...You either grind for weeks nonstop, use hacks never done myself or just accepts that you wont be able to buy anything in the game...
