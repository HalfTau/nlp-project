So you mean to tell me that you have a million people playing online and maybe more playing for the SP experience since the games release in 2015. Your company is making a  of money and all is well.Then you get and idea that taking a beloved feature away from the game in this case, modding, is supposed to dofor the game and company.2 years and all of a sudden nodding is an issue, I find that extremely hard to believe.Of course like many other companies, looks like RockStar and Take Two are going to try and maximize profit at the expense of our joy.
