Stop ing about online. Most of the arguments against this game right now are stupid and hypocritical. New GTA update drops, people complain about it being too expensive, then R introduces some new bug that people can abuse to make millions, then people complain about everything being overpowered, the bug gets patched, and the cycle continues. Its still a fun game. You can fight it out with futuristic tanks, normal tanks, APCs, stealth helicopters, attack helicopters, fighter jets, bomber planes, flying bikes, flying cars, and halftracks, all while running multiple multimillion dollar industries that you use to fight other industries to the death. At this point all I want is the ability to buy a firetruck.BTW you can hide from orbital cannons and basically everything in the sewersUpdate I got banned but its still a good game
