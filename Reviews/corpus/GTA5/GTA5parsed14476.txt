I can no longer, in confidence, say I support GTA V Online. While it is very, very fun, I believe that the actions taken against the COMMUNITY by Rockstar and TakeTwo, both in the forms of massbanning of players, and now a legal threat against the modding community, is unnacceptable. I truly wish that these issues will be fixed, but at this point in time I cant say they will.
