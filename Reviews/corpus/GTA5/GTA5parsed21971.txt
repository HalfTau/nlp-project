damn you Rockstar, purchased this game for the third time for my PC just to play around, i previous owned it on xbox 360 and xbox one, Ive put well over a hundred hours into my character. I thought what the hell, Ill migrate the account to PC. After purchasing i find you have disabled charcter transfer. So of course Im not starting over I want my money back since i only purchased this for a time killer, I go to refund on Steam and get 20 dollars taken off my refund for NOT EVEN one hour of game play? This was a complete waste of time and  money, thanks for the wonderful expierence.
