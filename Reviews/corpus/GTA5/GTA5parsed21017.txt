this game is kind of pay to win because you need a lot of money in it but you can work hard for it to get a lot of money from jobs and yes it take forever to get money but still a good game and the over all experience is amazing in single and multiplayer.note  there is a lot of hackers in the game and rockstar and take two is out of control and they cant fix it and im not blaming the company but also you can go passive mode so its kind of okay.
