Cash grab, cash grab, and more cash grabs. Gta 5 also didnt even bother with single player dlc, why? Because of Everyones favourite online game, that was sacasm, would suffer and wouldnt generate more money... The game sold more copies than it could ever hope for, yet its funny they ask for more money in their online component, which is cough crap cough, yet they couldnt even fix their far too over powered police, which I took issue to it from day one on the last generation consoles and the lack of replayability that the rest of the franchise had, or that Red Dead Redemption had. Also, though this is late, the fact that Take Two had the audacity to take down open IV back in June was absouletly a red flag for the community... Though it was brought back Take Two deserves to have the backlash from that on them for a long time, but it is unfortunate that Rockstar is under a greedy publisher because they dont deserve that.
