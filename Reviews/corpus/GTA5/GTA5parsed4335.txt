One of my most favorite games and most time spent on this game because it is so fun if you are looking to buy this game most reviews will say THEY GOT RID OF MODDING! and will dislike the game but i still ing love theout of this game and have had it for over 3 years now and i still enjoy playing but one fault of the game is the constant need of friends to do most of the funin this game like heists and gaining more money. However overall this is a very great game and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys stealing sports cars and robbing banks
