TLDR at the endIve spent quite a bit time on this game though not even close to as much as a lot of others and I feel ready to give my review about this game. GTA V first of all is a great game, I have not yet had the time to fullly play through the entire story mode, as of some saves being deleted and loosing the will to start over, but most of my hourts spent in this game have been in online mode. I have to say that online mode can be a lot of fun, but after some time I felt it becomming very repetetive and boring, yet a game I can  come back to from time to time. I would suggest this game for people who have patience, can live with some/much repetition depending on how you play the game but also those who want to have a few hundred hours of fun, before it becomes repetetive and boring.TLDR Overall good game, some repetition. Much fun, gets boring.
