GTA V is a really fun game....That said...One of the biggest problems is that its STILL being sold for 60 USD. If possible, only buy it on the rare chance it goes on sale. Another issue is that hackers are constantly finding new ways to grief other players. If you even suspect that theres a hacker, and you are with a group of friends that make up the majority of the lobby, just vote to kick them out. Otherwise, just find a new lobby. Do not stick around. The only exception is if there are hackers / modders that are giving out free money. Theyre doing Gods work, because the other major problem is how expensive everything is. This game is literally built on microtransactions. The only reason it hasnt been lynched by the gaming community is because the payouts for ingame activities and jobs are more or less reasonable, and you can actually advance without stopping to drop extra money on the game if you really dont want to.3.7 out of 5, 4 out of 5 if you play with friends. Get it when its on sale though. Dont pay 60 for it.
