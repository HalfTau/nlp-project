Take Two, the publishers of this game and owner of Rockstar North, have pretty much banned modding ruining thousands of hours put in from mod developers, but also completely shattering one biggest subsections of their community. The entire Grand Theft Auto Online experience is a complete ing joke and is riddled with microtransactions and hackers which can empty your bank account on an instant and blow up your vehicles which has you having to pay up up to 50,000 from your own bank account to bring it back.GTA has been out since 2013, so its coming up to 4 years old and instead of TakeTwo actively trying to ban the hackers and scripters that can be found in pretty much every Online game, they spend their time destroying the work of modders and harassing the community with acts such as removing all opinions, constructive critisism, feedback and genuine concers towards the games direction from their comment sections on their social media over 70,000 comments deleted in just 2 years on their newswire alone. news article belowThe average time taken to gain around a million ingame is around 10 hours, although it can take a lot longer. I genuinely wouldnt mind if it was 10 hours of good quality content, but its not at all. Most of the gameplay is purely repetitive bullsht that is designed so you are rewarded the bare minimum in an effort to tempt you to buy a shark card instead. All of the content they add is for the most part absolute garbage including the businesses, designed to be extremely expensive and give off the illusion you can somehow make that money back, and as for vehicles it seems almost every couple of months they add an even quicker car right after you bought what you thought was the best car after many wasted hours of grinding.If you do buy this game, my plea for you is to stay away from shark cards, as it only further condones their awful business acts, treatment to the community and modders alike and ultimately their fcking awful microtransaction business model.Source / TakeTwo silencing GTA community
