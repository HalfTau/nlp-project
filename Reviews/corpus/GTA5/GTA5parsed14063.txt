i feel stupid for buying this game right as now, gta will be and always be a fun game in pc if its open to modding and as of right now, i feel very stupid to even purchase this game on sale because of how ignorant rockstar is right now for banning mods to this game. Games are about having fun and will always be unless its a mlg game or whatsoever. but right now im not spending money to make money. I invest my money to play fun games and thanks to rockstar, u ruin it well my fellow friend.
