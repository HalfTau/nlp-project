Still at full retail price...lol. Only buy if on a good sale, for the single player. The story is terrible but the perspective shift is interesting and it has a good 30 of contentat most by todays standards. Online used to be fun 32 years ago, but it has gone to compete The community is the manifestation of the mostVile and sickening things you can think of, and Rockstar has ruined the economy by making it pay to win. Like I said, only buy for first time single player, and for 30 at most.
