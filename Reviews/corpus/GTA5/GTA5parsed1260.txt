One of the best games ever made as far as Im concerned. Too bad theyve ruined the online experience by injecting microtransaction junk and a new DLC that is complettely outofplace. Cars and aircraft still have no real purpose for the most part and Rockstar/T2 have failed to deal with the issue of hackers/modders. In fact, they seem to support hacking/modding in the sense that they know both are out of control yet they require that DLC content is played in public lobbies full of these people. The single player game is still worth playing and GTA Online is worth a bit of play but I caution players to avoid getting caught in the grind trap and falling out of love with what once was an excellent online game.
