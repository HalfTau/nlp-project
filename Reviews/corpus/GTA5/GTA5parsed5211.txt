TLDR Single player is fun but Online is a horrible mess with outrageous microtransactions surprised there was an uproar about Battlefront II and nothing regarding this game and its escalating pricings on online items... maybe if people had spoken up about GTA Online before, Battlefront II wouldve been more tameGTA V Single player is fun. The story is enjoyable and fun with lots to do.The REAL problem comes from GTA Online... and Shark Cards...The online component of this game is full of idiots and trolls... give them their daddys credit cards and that makes trolls armed to the teeth with all sorts of antifun weapons... while those who dont buy Shark cards OOOOOR spend over an ungodly ammount of hours grinding to buy a simple tank or  something like that and you have a ridiculous gap between those that want to have fun and those that found their daddys credit card and want to ruin everyone elses fun.The loadings are horrible, even after all these years... the DLC they keep adding to online has been getting more and more expensive and downright broken and unfair to anyone starting off or just doesnt have enough cash both in game and in real life to get the super expensive FLYING CAR WITH ROCKETS...Honestly? Youre better off hoping for a new Saints Row with an online component.
