All they want is money rather than entertaining their playerbase. GTA online is a terrible cashgrab which punishes players and cheaters alike. The story is great but the longevity of this game is ruined by greedy developers. They dont support modding and crush any attempt, this just screams they want to punish people for playing their game. Wouldnt suggest buying unless its on sale, strictly for the story.
