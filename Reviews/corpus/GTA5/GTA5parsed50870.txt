GTA V was a really good game but it is disgusting how they treat there community, thats why I would not reccomend this Game. It is bassically P2W with completely overpriceed shark Cards and a lot of hackers. I think we can all agree that hacking in online destroyes the Game but shutting down Open IV wich has absolutely nothing to do with online is just a huge step against the community.
