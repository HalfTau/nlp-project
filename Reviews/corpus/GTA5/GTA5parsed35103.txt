Singleplayer is slow, and unless you play a certain way, you never make enough dosh to afford everything.Multiplayer is essentially a trollfest, and its just not fun 99 of the time.Overwhelming grind in online, and virtual certainty of losing progress, as well as possibly your real  money if you buy shark cards.Mass banning any modding is the last straw.
