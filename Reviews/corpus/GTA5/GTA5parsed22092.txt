So where to start with the monster that is GTAV  GTA Online.GTAV is a good game, but probably not as memerable as some of the older titles. It has plenty of features, good graphics, and a good amount of content paired a story that isnt going to bore you to death, but you wont be talking about it with your friends over coffee.GTA Online is another entity entirely.GTA Online is fun, and theres obviously plenty of stuff to do. Its nice to be able to do the usual GTA shenanigans with groups of friends online. That being said, this games layout is a blatant cash grab from them.Every time they release new free content, its priced with the in game currency to more or less equal 25 for all the cool high end stuff. 2 IRL for a fancy new supercar or business. While it IS possible to attain mostly everything without spending real money on the game, they make it pretty difficult and grindy and its a genius marketing strategy when you think about it.I just personally wish the online wasnt such a cash cow so they could release some Single player DLC and expand on what is already a very nice base of a game. However, as long as GTA Online is raking in the  its not very likely.Overall, I do have to recomend it, just beware that the Online is a very grindy cashgrab filled with trolls and cheaters.
