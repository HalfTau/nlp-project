Ive been having fun with this game up until the last content update. Now all it takes is two people on the flying, rocket shooting motorcycles, or one person with the orbital strike to completely ruin the game. I cant believe they added garbage like this to a game that was already a mess with trolls and griefers. It looks like they have given up on GTA Online and are putting their resources into future games anyway. Save your money and wait for those games if you want a good Rockstar experience.
