This game is pureand its a pitty because it could have been great fun, it is well designed and balanced but cheaters ruin that balance.Theres cheaters everywhere in freeroam, in missions, in races... .I m not exagerating 30 of the people in a session are cheaters. its impossible to play like this. Unless you have cheats yourself. Rockstar got bullied by the cheaters and their bad reviews so they wont do anything about it. Forget buying it unless you get it on extreme sale and only play the offline campaign which is good btw.If you like cheating online this is the ultimate game for you! You will never get punished and if you do who cares? You re cheating anyway you dont need ingame cash you can spawn it!
