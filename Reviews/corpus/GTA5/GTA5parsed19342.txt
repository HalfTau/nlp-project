Rockstar has some major hatred for modding, for one, getting temp banned while playing singleplayer a while back was extremely annoying as it doesnt impact anyone else or the game itself. I also dont see a big problem in people modding in multiplayer, it is understandable to be against the modding of money and using mods to kill people, but, if I want to look like an alien and run through the streets or fly through the skies in a car that changes colors without doing anything to anyone else, why cant I?
