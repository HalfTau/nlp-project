I finished the story mode and started my journey to become the strongest and the richest ceo in multiplayer. However, whenever I am trying to do my cargo missions, there is always someone in the lobby who is able to blow me, spawn stuff, block my movement or even teleport me far away from the map.Two of my friends got banned because of modders blocking their movements and increasing their rank by literally 8000 levels or by spawning millions of GTA  on them. Instead of banning the ones responsible for modding, Rockstar is banning the victims.Rockstar needs to facking improve the security and needs to eradicate modders from gta online community. Rockstar, please take some action or give me my money back.
