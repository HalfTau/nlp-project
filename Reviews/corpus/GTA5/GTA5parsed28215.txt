I know about all the stuff going on about the mods, but Im absolutely annoyed by the modders in GTA Online, i believe this isnt going to be permanent and R  Take2 will eventually switch their minds but at least they finally did something against mods... sadly it took down the fun part of it for non online players. Anyway the game itself is still hella fun, and worth being played even today.
