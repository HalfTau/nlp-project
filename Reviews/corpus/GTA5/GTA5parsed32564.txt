The gameplay and optimization is solid.The multiplayer is a complete mess though. Everything is a ing grind to entice you to buy their microtransactions. I used to be ok with it because it meant new free content but now theyre making everything online  so you either grind for hours or buy it outright with cash cards. All the insurance stuff is t and the gamemodes are a hot mess jumbled together where it takes you 20 minutes to get a lobby going because of the poor matchmaking despite there being 50k players online.
