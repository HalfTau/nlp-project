I really like the game, but I hate Rockstar and Take Twos anticonsumer and antiPC policies. Not only did they make the PC community wait and entire year to play the game now they have banned modding the single player experience on top of that. The publisher should offer a full refund and apology to anyone who bought this game on PC.
