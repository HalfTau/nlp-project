Take two forbid us from using mods...The  way mods can expand the lifespan of a game is incredible, the clear example is The Elder Scrolls games which at the time of writing this mods are still free. There is no point in forbiding people from modifying their game saying that It effects negativelly other multiplayer users, that is just insane. There wouldnt have been any problem if they had given us custom servers for the online mode, moded servers, private servers, etc. And if they wouldve been able to communicate with their customers just like CD Project Red has done with their games and updates we wouldnt have arribed at this situation.But they dont care about the user experience, they only care about their wallet just see for yourself the price tag this game has... and it was released in 2013.
