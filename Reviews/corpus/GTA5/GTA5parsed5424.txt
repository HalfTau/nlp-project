Free car costs 535.000 dollars! First time I got scammed by a game. Thanks for the Christmas gift, Rockstar/TakeTwoWallets.I bought this game for the single player mainly, which is nice and worth buying for a 50 or larger discount. And while I knew that the multiplayer had its problems, I never expected to be such a Pay2Win money grab.Flying cars and bikes with miniguns and heat seeking rockets. SMGs that basically shoot grenades. Also featuring 15 minute loading screens when the game is installed on a SSD.And thats without talking about the cheaters. A friend of mine got turned into a boat once. True story.I was reimbursed 5 days later by the Rockstar support team. Thanks you for that, but my review remains negative because of the other aspects that I mentioned.
