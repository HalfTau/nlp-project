Sorry but GTAV is no good. Take Two made sure of that beyond the games alreadyflaws. Everything about this game is rinse and repeat copy and paste. Only a handful of missions are fun and the rest are all the same. The online is nothing but a grind that feels very much like an app. As you level up you gain more ammo capacity and more weapons, costing more and more. This means you have to keep working to get that nice car you want but in the process the ceiling keeps getting higher and higher taking longer and longer to get it. This goes on until youve got to a high level where unlocks are slower. Theres no goto mission or thing to make money. Every content release is just another failed attempt to get people to buy shark cards to make more money which if you do your research, people who calculate this crap show you lose money and take forever to make back what you spent. The rest of the online is a total wreck. They ban everyone they possibly can for no reason yet theres still people teleporting around spawning crap and killing who they please with hacks. They just stop people who try to work around their shark card system not the actual hackers. Im honestly surprised the multiplayer isnt completely dead these days. It looks like more people are on FiveM but thats just me.
