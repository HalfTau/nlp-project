I really love this game, at first I hesitated to buy it for all the bad comments from people who said that online there were many hackers / modders, etc, etc, etc. But since I am a fan of GTA V and I have been playing it since I have the Xbox 360, I decided to buy it in an offer, and I must say that I do not regret buying it, since people are right, from time to time I find myself with a hacker, but I just change my session and problem solved. So if you want to buy it, buy it, people are right to say that there are many hackers, but that has never affected me much. I must say that it is one of the best games I have played.
