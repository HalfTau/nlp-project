Note, this review is primarily of GTA online due to it being the selling point of the game in my eyes.If you have a decent pc i would 100 suggest buying this as I popped on console GTA and the fps felt almost unplayable after getting used to a solid 60 fps on pc.ProsGame is open worldVisually stunningPlenty of contentPlenty of customisationLots of vehiclesFun gunplayReal sense of progressionConsToxic and pvp obsessed lobbiesModders/hackers who kill youEverything is money focused and extremely expensive. Saving up for things takes a very long grind which pushes players towards buying shark cash cards.All in all i would give this game 10/10. It is in a League of its own and nothing comes close to what GTA offers.  The afore mentioned cons have no real impact on the gameplay and there are many thousands of hours of fun to be enjoyed with GTA
