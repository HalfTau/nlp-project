The singleplayer of this game is absolutely brilliant and tons of work must have gone into it! However, instead of Rockstar releasing much requested singleplayer DLCs, they churn out more multiplayer crap that no one wants because they know it will get them more money quicker. Greed has prevented this game reaching its full potential.
