I know, I know, They removed mods... BUT.  Mods are not what make the game fun, If no one liked the game in the first place    mods would not even be added so suck it up.  Now here is my review.  The game is very well optimized and I like the game WITHOUT MODS more than I do with them still, I believe that the modders are out of control give us money and s so I think security measures should be tooken upon thatI know it is difficult, but they are out of control and giving us 50k to 10M so that is making shark cards completely useless which is making your money go downI still buy shark cards btwso that is why I am saying up your security.  Now I think the game is very fun and I play it a lot with my friends, I also think you should make the explosive ammo less op because it is getting on my f nerves how people just kill you instantly.Jacobsclub121my ign
