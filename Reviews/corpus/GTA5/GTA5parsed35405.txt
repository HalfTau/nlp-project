They totally ruined the modding community, which was one of the only reasons I played the game. It is an awesome game, and I really enjoyed it but cutting off the modding community and its history wit hthe GTA series is just disrespectful. Would have rated up, but they just dont deserve it there has to be another way of stopping hackers than demolishing the modding community.
