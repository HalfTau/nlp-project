After banning OPENIV I really dont see why you would buy this game anymore.We, as gamers, have to take a stance and stop spending money on Rockstar / Take Two until the issue with singleplayer mods is resolved. After so many years of allowing modding of GTA games it really is a dck move to ban mods in this game.As a community I hope we can achieve something by giving low scores and bad reviews for this game.
