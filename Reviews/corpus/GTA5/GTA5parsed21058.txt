The modding communitys reaction to this notorious OpenIV case was really, REALLY exaggerated.Over the years I have enjoyed Rockstar games, both on Ps3 and PC. Ive played GTA 3, SA, LBS, GTA IV, Red Dead Redemption, Max Payne trilogy, and GTA V for over 1000 hours total, and Ive never used any mods.Why, you may ask. Why didnt you expand your gaming experience for all these wonderful games to enjoy so much more?The answer is simple they are all already wonderful games. They dont NEED to be modded in order for you to enjoy them.Sure, GTA V has had rough times. The game has gone through phases, that have made it so frustrating youd just want to throw it to the wall and never play it again.After all the rough times, I still enjoy GTA V. And Ive been really happy with the official content, so happy that Ive never EVER felt a need to fool around with mods even though some games, like Skyrim I enjoy modding.The reaction by the modding community is on the other hand very understandable some people do it as a side job to pay rent etc., but on the other hand immature and extremely ridiculous. Your life didnt end just because you werent allowed to roleplay as Hulk or Iron Man around the city in a god damn video game.
