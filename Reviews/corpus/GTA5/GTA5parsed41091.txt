I used to like GTA, I used to like Rockstar, but time and time again they treat us, the gamers, like garbage.Today Rockstar Games and their publisher TakeTwo Interactive sent a cease and desist to the developers of OpenIV, a tool made for modding GTA and allowing the games to thrive years after release. So much time and effort put into the tool so that people could make the game their own and its all gone due to the greed of Rockstar and TakeTwo. I will never buy another Rockstar game after this and it was bad enough as it was with them turning onlline play from something basic and fun in GTA IV into a greed propelled grindfest.Once upon a time I would have recommended this game. Frankly, I would have recommended any Rockstar game, but not anymore.Please sign the petition here
