If you wanna have fun playing a game, find something else. If you wanna play online and get obliterated by a tank/jet every time you leave your apartment however...Take two shouldve taken time trying to make the GTA Online community better, but, theyd rather go after modders because theyre taking away some of their revenue Like they dont make a crap ton of money already. Corporate greed destroyed the reputation of this game, and its highly unlikely theyll ever get it back.Thank you Take Two Interactive for obliterating the reputation of one of the biggest names in gaming history.
