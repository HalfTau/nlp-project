Personally i love this game, before i played games on PC i played alot of GTA V on Console and have played this game since release. Once i went over to PC gaming this was one of the first games i bought because it is a great game, but there are some down sides... The PC side of GTA V is full of hackers and makes a majority of the player base mad, even though there hackers on Console also there are alot more on PC because of how easy people make them. All in all i love this game.
