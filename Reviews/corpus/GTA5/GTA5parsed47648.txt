Pretty darn good game. Rockstar is pretty scummy though, and large public online sessions are pretty awful, but generally, a good experience. Of course Online is grindy, but it can be enjoyable sometimes, and story mode is great, but sometimes it can get a little boring. Great game, you should buy it.
