Good single player but short, there were tons of locations unexplored IMO.The online is pretty awesome, lots to do all the time, you should to play with a couple of friends to get the most out of it. Have in mind that its full of 12 year old trolls and from time to time there are hackers killing everyone and you have to change the session just to not waste your time dealing with them, its not worth.
