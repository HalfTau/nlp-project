This game is so ing bad. I thought it would be great and all, yea get cool cars do some cool s, mess around with a bunch of people but no. You get ed over by ks with homing missiles, orbital strike cannons and lots more money than you. When you try to get more money by vehicle import export, you get assaulted by a bunch of players trying to get your loot. Solo public sessions should help but no, you have enemies that spawn right in front of you with  cars and smgs with the accuracy of about 100000. I was around 3/4 mile away, it was a long straightaway and the stupid 2 enemies in blue cars still were able to shoot my car. I lost so much profit from that . You can play stupid heists with horrible setups and pre setups yup setups for the setups where enemies spawn in front of you, you have to control horrible vehicles that barely work properly doomsday and the heist itself is more boring than the setups. Thats another way to get money. Keep in mind that you have to do ALL of the setups every single time you want to do a heist for like 300500k per. Could be worth if you did them fast enough but highly unlikely. You could do cargo runs where you get a piece of cargo and you deliver it but its ingcuz police everywhere and you need a semi andand its just ing horrible. Not to mention other players can interfere too. If you plan on playing with friends, then you would probably wanna do ty heists because thats the only way money is shared besides vip work which is extremely boring and doesnt get that much money for you or your associate/bodyguard anyways. If you wanna do import export, your friends dont get paid anything from the 3080k per car imported or 1050kfrom cargo so its almost useless unless you play heists which is once again very boring. Find a better multiplayer game. This game is a huge grind and R doesnt seem to wanna fix this.
