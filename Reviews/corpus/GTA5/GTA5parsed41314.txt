I once respected Rockstar. Though I always had fears of TakeTwo.Now Im sad to see that those fears have been fully realised. As a programmer and modder myself.  you. You killed OpenIV but scripthook still runs rampant. OpenIV was mostly SP. Nothing to do with multiplatyer. Some jackass didnt do their research before firing off that cease and desist. You shot yourself in the foot serveral times over trying to destroy modding. A community which has existed within the GTA scene for decades. Yet what, You just suddenly decide to try to bully modders into nonexistence? Rockstar claims this isnt their fault. In technicality it isnt Unfortunately they have to act under TakeTwo as T2 Owns RockStar. Im absolutely disgusted in the decisions and actions of TakeTwo as a whole. All Im saying is they better leave KSP alone.
