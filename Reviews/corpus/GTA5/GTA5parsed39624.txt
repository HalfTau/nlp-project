Well this is the end of it I guess. No more nodding in the game after the Cease and desist to Open iv. I used to play online frequently, both modded and unmodded as in FiveRp and fivem This game is officalyshit to me, even after the banning of mods, theres still hackers online. Dont get this game. Its terrible now.
