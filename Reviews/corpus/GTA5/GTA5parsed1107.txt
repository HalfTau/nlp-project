CONCERNING SINGLE PLAYER Get it  Its the best GTA yet, handsdown. Hilarious thrill ride of action, feels, drugs, and impotent rage.CONCERNING ONLINE PLAYProsI have fun when I have friends to play with.Looks pretty good.Gameplay is enjoyable  but fixedwing aircraft controlls need to not suck.Great sense of humor throughout the single and multiplayer experiences.Heists and jobs are fun to do with friends  in general the game is always best with friends no matter what you are doing.ConsGeneral players are clinically disabled, and cannot be relied on for anything aside from for to suck  which is great if its any sort of competative play  the people who play this are as dense as a daikon radish. Pwn freely.Rockstar is a batch of hilariously ironic criminals with their business practices surrounding this game namely in how getting cash is a grind if you dont have 3 other DEDICATED friends to run entire series of heists fun, but tedious after the first 23 times every day to get whichever amazeballs cool toys what get released with each update  and all of it is exhuberantly expensive.Navigating the UI feels like a personal skill its convoluted trash. Anyone can figure it out  sure, but it shouldnt be as broken up and... obtuse as it is.Still 60 many years after release.Im giving this a thumbs up because its not terrible, and I wouldnt say you shouldnt play the game but note that in my opinion, its really a 50/50 split. For single player, YES, thunbs up all the way.... but for the whole other half of the game, multiplayer, its a definite NO if you dont have at least 3 other friends to play with
