Single player/story is 9.9/10.Gameplay and story are superb. So much to do, so many options. LOVE the satire of modern day LA/USA, its FING GENIUS. FING BRILLIANT. Check out the radio talk shows, some missions.. and youll see. Would absolutely recommend for single player/story.MultiplayerNever went on. Too scared. Heard and read too many scary stories of people getting banned for the randomest thing and no chance of appeal. It also looks like a blatant cash grab and not very fun. Would not recommend.
