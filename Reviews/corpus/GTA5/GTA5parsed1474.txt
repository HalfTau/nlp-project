I wish I could give a Mixed reccomendation or whatever. Compared to just reccomdend and dont reccomended, but I digress. 60GBs is pretty outrageous for a game thats I think is only worth it for the singleplayer. Talk about bad texture compression. Regardless the singleplayer is very fun and you can sink a lot of hours just by doing the side activities. I was never a fan of Rockstars storytelling and it hasnt change much in my opinion here, but I would buy GTA V for the story. Id buy it for the classic reason Player freedom. On the other hand the multiplayer is so lack luster, it almost feels like a discount Payday 2, in some aspects. I would try avoid it becasue a lot of the time it isnt worth the hassle. The endgame goal is just to grind out as much money as you can by doing mediocre heists and missions. Not to mention how annoying it is to try to play it with friends, It was very hard for us to even do the same mission together. Maybe were just . Either way the multiplayer left a bad taste in my mouth, but if you are interested in the singleplayer buy it if you can stomach 60GBs. Also if the main story and sidequests get boring you can also download mods to prolong the game experience.
