I am uninstalling this game right now.I will keep it short. Hackers!!!You spend hours to make some money.One hacker shows up and destroys everything in seconds.Everyday and every session, there is always hackers.The worst part is that GTA makers dont punish the hackers.It is a hacker paradise.I will never buy a rockstar game again.
