Oh look a bunch of cry babies complaining about crappy mods. The game as it is base is a great game, it does not deserve these pathetic tantrum reviews from a bunch of toddlers. Grow up.Great Varied GameplayInteresting charactersGreat VisualsStill missing that special charm that III, Vice City and San Andreas had. Still amazing. Not deserving of the toddlers trying to lower the score because someone took their intrusive cancerous toys away.If you havent bought it, do so.
