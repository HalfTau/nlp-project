gta v is so over rated, hell gta in general is over rated plus the game was an absolute mess on release! The only reason i brought this game was because of the option to mod it. I understand the need to stop cheaters online, but preventing people from modding the single player is ridiculous. If I knew they were gonna do this I would have never brought this game. If they have the same no modding policy in the next instalment of gta you can count me out. Rockstar/take two interactive just got to greedy. em!!
