I cant believe they banned mods.  What a terrible move and an insult to the community.  Dont buy this game.  EDIT Apparently they reversed course, but only because of the negative reviews hurting their bottom line.  This is a fake change of heart and I have no doubt they will attempt to do something similar at a time that suits them.  Dont buy this game.
