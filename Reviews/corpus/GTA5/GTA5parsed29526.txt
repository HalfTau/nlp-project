Im just going to say it. Grand Theft Auto V could turn into the next All Points Bulletin Reloaded if not fixed. use to play on ps3 until i changed to pc so the hours are off. i solod online a lot as in played with no one. online isnt really worth playing if you intend on doing that i mean you could get to 70 by doing racing for a month may be off on that, but other than that not really worth the grind.
