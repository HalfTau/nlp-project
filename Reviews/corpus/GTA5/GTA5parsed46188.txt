I only bought this game, specifically so I could mod it in single. I dont really like the online mode. If I cant mod the game, the game is useless to me. If I cant mod GTA VI, again, Im not going to buy it, simple as that. I dont like Online games filled with microtransactions, and this pretty much ruins the game for me. If Red Dead Redemption 2 comes out, I sure will NOT be buying it. Its sad because Ive been a big GTA fan, and modding GTA games, since 2000 back when GTA 2 was out and I had it on PC.
