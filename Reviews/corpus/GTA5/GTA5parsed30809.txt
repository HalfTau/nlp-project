i bought this game for my fourteen year old son thinking itd be a wholesome gaming experience he could enjoy while i worked on adult things taxes, paperwork, etc. however, when i peered over to the monitor from my desk, i saw a cavalcade of dirty words. these Rockstar smut peddlers had the NERVE to insert words i wouldnt dare repeat here HINT one starts with c and is synonymous with the word quot. essentially, my pure son has been dirtied by this virtual trash.all im trying to say here is that as a virtual dad i expect certain illustrious franchises to live up to their family friendly label. GTA V is NO LONGER ON MY CHRISTIAN GAMES LIST.as a cyber dad i just want a little peace and quiet so i can deal with myjob and my  wife. this game used to allow me some quiet virtual dad time. now its just turning my son into a bigso, Rockstar, if youre reading thisi know you arejust know youve let this racer dad down.! how do you like hearing these words? not much, huh? well keep them out of your games! Mad Dad comin to you from virtual reality
