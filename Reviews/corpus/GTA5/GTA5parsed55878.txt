I dont even play this very much, but basically single player mods have been removed to prevent people from having fun and push them towards the online play laden with microtransactions.Game companies are about making fun games that people enjoy, not a race to the bottom, to squeeze out every last bit of cash from their hosts. Take 2, that behavior is disgusting. Get good or get out of the way.
