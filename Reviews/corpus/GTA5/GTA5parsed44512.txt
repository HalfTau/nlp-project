I bought this game some time ago so I cannot ask for my money back now. Fine, fair enough.As a modder of other games, I find it highly worrying that Take Two interactive has decided that it wants to target OpenIV. Let me make this clear if Take Two had done even the slightest bit of research, they would have found that OpenIV is a modding tool coded to only work with the single player part of Grand Theft Auto V. It cannot function with the online component of Grand Theft Auto V in any way. Their cackmouthed statement shows just how illaware they are of pretty much anything to do with modding at all.Let me put this scenario to you. Youre a cop, theres a gunman and he has a hostage with a gun pointing to their head. Do you shoot the gunman? Thats the sensible thing to do. But instead of shooting the gunman, you shot the hostage and watch as the gunman prances away unbothered. In case the metaphor is unclear, Take Two is the inept police officer in this scenario, online cheaters are the gunman and OpenIV is the hostage Take Two just shot dead.We like to rag on corporations like EA, but even EA wont shut down single player modding on Star Wars titles. When I have to jump to use EA, the perceived worst video game company, as an example of something GOOD, you know you ed up. Its almost like these guys are trying to take the crown.The sooner Rockstar finds themselves a different publisher, the better. To anybody considering buying this game dont. Take Two dont give aabout you. Until they learn to do some basic research before handing out cease and desists and shooting the hostages, Id suggest steering clear of any title this company puts out. Take Two.
