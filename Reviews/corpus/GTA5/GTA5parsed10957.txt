The best game that i ever played!Singleplayer 11/10 awesome!Multiplayer 7/10. This is the first working multiplayer in GTA. It is really good, but there are some disadvantages. The actual missions, though, get repetitive once you break rank 20 or so, and there needs to be more here to keep people playing. Another disadvantages are cheaters and long very long loadings. But i still play it! This is really good game!
