Very Nice! Runs smooth with my computer, a solid 60 fps to be exact! Online is very smooth as well, except the modders either trapping you in cages or spawning money on your head. Though, the online functionality is to the extent of great! Story Mode is Outstanding and is like watching a movie if it was just the cutscenes. To Conclude teh game is worth the money and price, but, online is dominated by cheaters.
