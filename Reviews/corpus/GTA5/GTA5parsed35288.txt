This game as already made tons of money , and they keep making us pay more , how do they do that, let me explain to you , so first of all , yeah its cool they put out new stuff all the time , gunrunning is a good example so whats wrong with that you might ask , its wrong cause everything in the game costs money , and going through the online game without buying shark cards, is a pain in the, cause youll never make enough money to afford the new stuff unless you have a company in the game but wait , that too costs money, so either you buy tons of shark cards or you get ed by people with the new stuff , however there is a last option called modding wich i was doing , i was modding to get money in the game , thats it, thats all , i never used it to  other peoples games or make me invicible , all i wanted was to enjoy the game to its fullest , by adding money and by giving some to other players who was in the same situation as me , guess what ? i got banned, for life so now either i buy the game again , or i never play again. And all i did was modding money for me and people without bothering anyone because buying shark cards is too expensive for some of ous and playing the game without the new stuff is kind off bluh, especially when you play in a server with a rich kid who as everything he wants and keeps killing you with his stupid brokevehicles , so yeah , i used to love the game , but now its just a moneycompany who wants more and more even tho they did well enough money and they keep making alot from people buying the game.My regards,Ace
