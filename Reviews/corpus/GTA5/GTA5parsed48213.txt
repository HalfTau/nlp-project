With this being the sequel to the ephemeral GTA IV, I had high hopes. These hopes were quickly dashed. Rockstar quickly demonstrated their skill for single player stories, and delivered an excellent experience. But I had purchased the game for the joy of playing multiplayer with my friends. This is where Rockstar screwed the pooch. At first they released good, fun content. It was creative and fun. They quickly realized they could milk the online for every dollar it was worth, and I stopped playing after realizing I would need to either pay lots of dosh or play for endless hours to ever catch up to the rich or hackers, who strangely were never banned by the awful automoderator, while I had friends who had never hacked, or played with a hacker, get banned for no reason. If this game is good for anything, it is to show you how far even the greatest of developers has fallen, in the era of microtransactions in games. This game is good for singleplayer, but I cant even recommend that without the fair warning that you are paying a lot for very little if you only play singleplayer.
