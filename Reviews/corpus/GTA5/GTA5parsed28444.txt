I will not stand for mods just suddenly not being allowed. Its part of what made this game so fun to play around with in a huge open world where the possibilities were almost endless. If they take that freedom away i will no longer support any of take twos games. my time will be much better spent playing Bethesda games which have allowed mods for years.
