I pray to god that you are looking at this review and understand why i dont want you to buy this game. This game has become a MONEY PIT story mode has been completly abandoned and most of the content is reserved for GTA onine. The content like cars and weapons is now behind GIANT paywalls wich would require the purchace of shark cards wich require real money ex getting a yaght requires the purchace of 2 99 shark cards. TAKE TWO has become complety autocratic with how they treat their coustomers STRAIGHT OUT WARNING YOU when you log on to online to not cheat as if you were a hacker. Most of the players who are playing htis game are leaving wich will put you in a disadvantage if you want to play HEISTS or any other job in game that requires. THe poeple who do stay will most likley be hackers and greifers that will attack you on site online.LONG STORY SHORT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR THE SAKE IF THE GAMING INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE.
