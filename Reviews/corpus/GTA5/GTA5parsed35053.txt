118 hours of gameplay dedicated to nothing but the single player mods I had available to me all taken away. And my game expierence ruined. I feel bad to all the people out there who streamed this game and its many mods and there fans. Thank you for ruining the game for me and a lot others. And to whoever at take two made the final decision to do this. Ill see you in hell.
