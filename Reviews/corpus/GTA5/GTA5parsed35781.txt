Bought GTA 5 only to play LSPDFR Mod, as i played alot of similar mods on GTA 4.In the past Rockstar openly supported moding gta but suddenly have now banned open iV and modding.In what can only be seen as a tactic to try and increase sales of pay2win shark cards in multiplayer.Total sell outs, from a company that sold alot of copies off the back of modders.Wont be recommending or buying anymore games from rockstar.
