their actions towards modding are disrespectful and the tools blamed were responsible for a very small percentage of the online part of their game. The single player game and story is fun, the multiplayer side of things is okay but extremely grinding oriented for a game in which you are a criminal.Because of the modding cease and desist letter and the way you have to grind online if you dont want to pay additionnal money for a shark cards Id recommend that you look for another game.
