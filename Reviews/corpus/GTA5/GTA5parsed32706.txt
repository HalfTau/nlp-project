On behalf of the resonable player who love to mod a game you ed up Rockstar Games, but on the other side of the coin thank you for doing this because a good majority of force hacks relied heavily on the tools to break GTA Online indefinitly so thank you for doing it. The majority crybabies who are ing and moing about the recent decision to end OpenIV are the ones who are more to blame for cheating in a non cheating zone. I just hope you great devs at Rockstar games would have implemented a better security protocol to keep the hackers offline that is all, either by having designated moderators, or Volunteer members who could be given certain access to help maintain the online expereince. I like the decision to chop off the source but also am disappointed to see a great modding tool destroyed by a larger company.
