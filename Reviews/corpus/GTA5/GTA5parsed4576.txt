Singleplayer is just great. And GTA Online... Well, well... After 60 hours of gameplay, I got to review the game. Overall the game is fun. But the part which I most hate is when you want to chill and drive around the world and that stupid  kills you with a plane, heli, EVEN ON FOOT. Ive seen many modders in many lobbies. A lot of people asking them to drop money. Lol. Its pathetic. You should do races, setups, heists and many. Thats why Rockstar added these, for fun and to make some money. It is kinda boring to play solo, so get your buddy or buddies and start exploding
