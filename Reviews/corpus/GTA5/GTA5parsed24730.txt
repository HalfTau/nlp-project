This game talking soley about the core mechanics, is a great game. Online, not so much. After microtransactions took over the gaming community by storm in 2012, rockstar and take two thought it was a great idea to add Shark Cards to the game. Virtually no one earned money legitly, because it was too hard, and everyone either modded money, or money gliched their way to the top. Recently, I got banned for getting cash from another modder. I was mad, but their bans are final, so I couldnt do anything. When I logged back in I expected to still have my character and its level, but I was wrong. My character was deleted. Gone, all my progression 100 percent gone. I had to make a new character. I left after that. I have bought the game multiple times, on 360, xbox one, computer twice I got banned lol, and Im not spending another cent on it again. GTA 5 feels like a free to play game where you need to spend money on the game to progress, but Its worth 60 dollars for the base game. I do like the Free DLC, but its not enough to fix the game. I hope GTA 6 will be better.
