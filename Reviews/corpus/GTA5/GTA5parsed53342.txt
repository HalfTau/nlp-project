With TakeTwos recent modding community massacre affecting about all mods on GTA5, I cant recomend this game. The sole reason GTA5 was so popular in the first place was becuase of the modding community, if they want to be greedy moneygrabbers and say, Hey, were not making enough money even though we got plenty already, we should kill off the best part of the game so we can make more, then there is just no point. Thumbs down Take Two!
