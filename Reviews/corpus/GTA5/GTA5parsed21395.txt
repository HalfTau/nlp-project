I loved this game. Frankly the game is still fun and Ive owned it since release for PS3. I didnt need a second version except I was captivated by what the modding community had accomplished which led me to buy the PC version. Now I regret this second purchase and its all Take Twos fault. They are turning this wondrously fun game into a freemium game you have to pay for. The online community is already ruined with ridiculously expensive DLC and have significantly limited ones ability to make in game currency via playing the game. Now they are trying to limit offline gaming by going after OpenIV to try to move more people online. Its not going to work and is just turning off longterm fans of the series such as myself. GTA V might be the last version I buy in this series as Take Two will likely hold Rockstar back going forward. The next version might not even have a campaign mode if these know nothing executives like Strauss Zelnick have their say. GTA is going down a road many large game companies are moving their titles. It soon might be a microtransaction nightmare and I fear they wont notice the damage theyve done until the franchise is a bust like Atari with Driv3r and RollerCoaster Tycoon and EA... well, basically most of their stuff.
