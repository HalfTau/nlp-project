 you Take two interactive! You have made an amazing game that I loved so much that I even based my PC build off of it and this game was worth every penny I paid and that is saying something coming from me seeing as I NEVER pay more than 20 for games I would rather wait a long time for it to go on sale. I loved it so much until you guys took away our ability to play with mods in single player. When are you gonna get it through your heads that people like to mod their games. Its what they do. Why does it matter to you if someone mods the singleplayer portion of a game that is completely offline based? I dont even play gta online. I hate it. I was originally gonna give this game a good review but not after what you guys did! Go  yourself Take Two interactive!
