Its bad enough that this game has been out for so long with no single player DLC, the only thing that made this bearable were mods bringing content. the only way you can get anything new is by being price gouged IRL and then again ingame with your newly purchased ingame money. I mean FFS you could at least give people the new vehicles in single player. without mods, i just wont play this anymore. not that Rockstar cares though that doesnt make them any more money, it could save you some though dont buy it.
