The publisher has taken an anitmodding stance and issued a cease and desist letter the OpenIV the software that allows for modding GTA5. There has also been no DLCs free or paid for the single player game. They wont produce new content and now they wont allow any one else to either. Take Two F UEdit Rockstar and Take Two seem to have made the right decision and I can recomend this game again. Im going to leave the statement above as a reminder though.
