Modding was what made the GTA series, and now they are taking it out.Also cant have private servers and they are usuallywith getting constant disconnects and loading screens.And shark cards are over priced. Like 160  for 8 million? thats like just a standard yacht, or 4 good cars.And any job gets you dogpay. Like wow i just got 20k from a 10min mission. I only need to do it 100 times to get a bunker.
