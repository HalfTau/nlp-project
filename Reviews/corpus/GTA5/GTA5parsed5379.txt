Well for the singleplayer experience alone the game is worth getting. That is solid fun.However on PC, especially since the launch was delayed compared to consoles, people mostly get it for the multiplayer component.It feels like a cheesy MMO in many ways. You just grind the money. You do a lot, and I mean a lot of work, for very little pay compared to the prices of everything.Many things are clunky and rough on the edges. Higher level players love to bully everyone out of boredom. A lot of the missions are designed in such a way, that they can be easily interruped by other player for no real benefit to them.. So people just destroy each others fun. Plus a lot of missions are a terrible chore. Like you may not believe.There are hackers in the game, not so common nowadays, but it used to be a huge problem. So again  no fun.And now imagine my day today Im tired, last months were tough. So inbetween all the Xmas stuff I log in to play with my friends. Nick says, that I should clean up my garage and get the discounted Kuruma armored vehicle, extremely useful, and a free Hermes. OK, I help him out with the missions, Ill buy the cars later. And so in the evening I get into the garage, to sell one of the cars, I get inside and.. a helicopter spawns inside, I cant get out... OK, finally I buy the Hermes, it says FREE. That substracted 535,000 from my account. So Im 12,000 short of a Kuruma. For the last delivery mission thats my biggest source of income I was paid 168,000. And I need a crew for that, and hopefully an empty session. Yeeeees. I feel very done.Its some weird kind of rat race more money, better cars, bigger houses, and the way you get there is through boredom and pain. Get a job instead. It will help you pay the bills, interact with people facetoface, good stuff. It will keep you sane. This is like a bad job  slowly drives you insane.
