Single player really coolMultiplayer pain in the Why? People are cheating. Not just casual cheating. Hardcore cheating.  People are spawning tanks, busses, airplanes, anything during heists. If you find anyone who wants to play a heist. Other events are not bad, but for newcommers, this game gonnayou, you end up in endless grinding. Dont buy it if u like challenge in online playing. Buy it if you like single player campaing, and goofing around online, or you dont play online.
