Id rather  Miss Piggy than play thisnow. Game used to be alright but since this ing Gunrunning DLC it went further down hill than it ever has. There was good hype for it but major disapointment. Mostly cause peoples hard earned money was taken away cause people like to  with the game. Rockstar has gotten to the point where they havent gotten any money from Shark cards because hackers do that service for free, that they punish everyone so the can get their payment. Rockstar I swear yall are more greedy than a a bunch of  on Popeyes Tuesday.
