Pay to fing win system is BS.Dont get me wrong, i love this game, but dont expecy being able to grind anything but a knif within your first two too three weeks without paying twenty dollars for an in game million or so. After playing off and on for a year or two i can say the late game is an expencive wast of time.Please, rockstar is rich enough, dont wast your money.
