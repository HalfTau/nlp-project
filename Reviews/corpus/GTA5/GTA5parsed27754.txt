Really wish I could refund this game. Online is a massive grind and obviously trying to push the shark cards. Single player got left in the dust. Recently Rockstar and their publisher tried to kill all single player modding and showed their true colors. They do not care and are only backpedaling now because of how many people they upset.Do not reward them for this. Do not buy.
