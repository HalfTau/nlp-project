ARE YOU FREAKING INSANE ROCKSTAR?ONE THOUSAND PESOS FOR FREAKING GTAV? No way.You ALWAYS do this to south american customers. I am NEVER buying any of your crappy games. Im better off getting them on theUPDATEFunny Rockstar. Another missed opportunity of doing something for your latin american customers. Still shady pricing, and because of that not even this 60 discount can save you.Im literally better off going to a retail store and getting the physical copy of your game, which like stated before, I wont do, and ill make sure none of my friends do either.
