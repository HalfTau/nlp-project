This type of modding is often toxic and usually has a negative impact other players online experience.Modding the offline/singleplayer portion of games makes gaming what it is today. It allows players to express their creativity by taking a game and putting their own unique spin on it, generally enhancing the experience. There should absolutely never be a situation where a game developer should punish those seeking to mod this portion of the game. It restricts creativity and is a slap in the face to anyone who wants to get the most out of their gaming experience.The recent news regarding Take Two Interactives cease and desist letter to OpenIV is a blatent overstep of their authority. Unless their decision is reversed, and they take no other actions in the future that punishes ethical modding, players will unite and make a difference.Good luck trying to sell another game.
