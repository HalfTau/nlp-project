Main reason of purchase was, to see how does online work, after a very long time playing story mode So... First of all  Story modeI have had WONDERFUL experience, since the beggining of it. It was my first GTAV experience, because at the beginning , when it came out, i had the illegal version without online.Short story long, Alot of memories, laughter, tears, Flawless story, main characters, with their own personality, that make you feel related, BASICALLY all the damn best o/Also, one of these games, that story is not making me bored, and its always nice to come back 3Second  OnlineI have 50 hours here on steam, that mostly is from online, my first experience.. My first experience... It started with that cloudstucking glitch, right when i was so hyped about the game, AND still have it. On the other hand, Game modes, customizations for clothing, cars, everything is really nice. Lobbys, one of the main problems probably should be mods, from one side its sometimes good, when it makes you laugh, or either bad, when it can make you super mad.Beside Online and Story mode, something that just keeps me hyped, is Radio stations, the choice of music is just WONDERFUL,  for that Overal, if R games, made another part of GTA, my thoughts wouldnt be good, by feeling hyped or something. Maybe only in one case, which is the most most important for me, if it had a good story, then maybe, i would change my mind.I just feel GTAV is a good place to stop. o/
