Strange business practices and nonsensical choices have damaged this game.Targeting the Singleplayer mods as they can be ported to Multiplayer has really shown that all they really care about is the microtransactions as they dont want people hacking in money.  Thier solution to ban the biggest Mod is a horrible idea.
