GTA online is officially ruined by modders that love to grief you with endless explosive sniper rounds or whatever else they decide to toy with. This has been happening every single session now. All I want to do is make a enough money to play around with the new smugglers run and fly all day but these modders make it VERY DISCOURAGING to even try anymore. Only play online in closed sessions with good people.
