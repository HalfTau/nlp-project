Dont waste your money!! Ive spent a very long time playing this game on several different platforms. At least 2,500 hours on playstation and hundreds of hours on PC. All that needs to be said about this is dont expect to have fun on GTA Online. Primary reason is the fact everything way overpriced and other players have fun making your game not fun. I couldnt think of a more annoying thing that someone just driving around in an armored truck throwings bombs out the window at people who spend HOURS grinding for the little money rockstar is willing to let you have. Ive played on the side of working for the money and ive paid for it, working for the money is so much more satisfying than just killing people...maybe thats just me. Youre better off just playing an amazing fallout game or just something else. Save yourself but at this time its probably too late.
