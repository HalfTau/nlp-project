The Grand Theft Auto series has made a remarkable presence on the gaming community as a whole, this title is no exception. GTA is one of the if not most, controversially recognisable gaming series of all time and one of the most successful as well. Overall this title especially online multiplayer is fantastic, but like anything is not without its faults. Rockstar has sinned in a variety of ways, some which they cannot make up for, no matter how prolific their attempt would or could be.Despite these faults, in the recent months GTA V has become notorious for a variety of compelling reasons online cheaters being the most significant. This issue needs to be addressed and continually combated, in a good, professional manor key word being good. Many people have been banned, significant portions of these being cheaters and hackers, but although minute still a percentage, innocents who are being unfairly maimed in the form of a ban due to other peoples venomous behaviour.However although not going in depth, in an attempt to keep this concise, Ive kept detail to a minimum.I highy reccomend if you have a resonable pc of certain specification, you buy this game. Its fantastic and has a compelling story which can become competitive and boring but take it with a pinch of salt, the GTA storyline is like no other. However, simultaneously the online version of the game continues to flourish, despite this cheaters have become a large portion which is a huge drawback to online.OverallGraphics 8/10Story 8/10Online 7/10
