Shameless cash grab. Used to have some replay value but theyve gotten rid of mods, which ruins the game after the campaign. Online isnt any good either, as the only way to make any substantial amount of money in order to buy the repetitive new content that comes out every month is to buy the ingame money with real money Shark Cards.
