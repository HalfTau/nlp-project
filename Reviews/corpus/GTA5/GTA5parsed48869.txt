As many of you already know, Take Two Interactive has shut down OpenIV. This tool was solely for SP mods. All of the mods for it couldnt be used in Online to affect other players negatively. OpenIV allowed for great mods such as custom textures, characters, graphics, vehicles, weapons, and maps. Modded SP is a million times more fun than GTA Online.Once Take Two corrects their unethical and greedy buisness practices, I will give this game a positive review.
