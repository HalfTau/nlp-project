Everyone thinks this game is fun, that is everyone but me. in my opinion the multiplayer is just grinding and doing boring missions so you can get cash and acctualy play the fun part of the game like buying jets, rocket launchers and yatchs, most pepole are already level 100 or higer so they have everything to demolish you and your friends. And the servers have bad ping and are comeplete filled with hackers that blow you up or spawn hydra jets that last one was actually pretty fun. And last but not least, the game is prised at 60 dollers, WTF, most old AAA games are 30, and sometimes even 20 or lower, this game is NOT worth 60 bucks, not even 30, buy doom 4 or battlegrounds insted.
