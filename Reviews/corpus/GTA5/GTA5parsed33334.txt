Moaning about mods being deleted and also wanting rockstar to crack down on hackers. Well you cant have both and rockstar thought hackers were a bigger problem than the bonus provided by moders.just a reminderYou understand how much money rockstar have made of gta v right? They could loose all income right now from gta v and theyd still survive. Also you ignore the fact that they have gta v on consoles which will continue to be played so there is nothing you can do. All you kids running around moaning because your mods were taken away. But forgetting that you dont own the game, you own the licence to play the game how it was intended and developed. Its breaking the games rules and regulations to modify files and even reverse engineer the game files to create mods
