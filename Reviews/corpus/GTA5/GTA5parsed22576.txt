Also this game is just amazing to me. Single player gives you a hefty, and exciting 4050 hour campaign, and Onlinebe fun. Emphasis on can, because things can be going really well in your server, until some Dbag drives up to you and fires rounds at you. Though, this is why you get three recommended other friends to get this game, to save the stress.Its a blast in my opinion, even if you get it just for singleplayer. But seriously, if you decide to play Online, play with other friends, it obviously wont be fun without them.
