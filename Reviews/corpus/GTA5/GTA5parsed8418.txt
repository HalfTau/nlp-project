One of the greatest games of my era. Especially if you want a game to play with your friends. If you have a crew then you can almost grind everything out of the game. But its really hard to do anything alone at all. And the hill at the start is almost prohibitively steep if you just want to invest in the game and expect yourself to grind everything out of it. And an edless supply of people with more money than they know what to do with in their life will almost try to blow you up in almost in every other lobby. And last but nt the least the cheaters. The people who have no life. They are just the scum of GTA.Anyway, even with all these problems, this is one game to experience with your friends.
