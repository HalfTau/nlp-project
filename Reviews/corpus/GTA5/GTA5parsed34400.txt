Single player is OK, but the overhyped multiplayer is an extreme letdown. Most of the time you are just stuck in loading screens, and often after playing a minigame inside the multiplayer, you end up in a different lobby than your friends in the regular multiplayer even though you joined the minigame together from the same lobby. To join your friend, you must sit through another loading screen, only to fail many of the times.GTA V should have been what San Andreas couldnt because of the technical limitations of its time, yet GTA V is a step back. Surprisingly, the possibilities are limited in GTA V compared to San Andreas, even though it should have been the other way round.With the singler player you get the familiar GTA gameplay and story type, but in reality most of the reason that there are many hours of gameplay in single player, is because you spent a lot of time driving rambling NPCs around.Rockstar really hyped the multiplayer gameplay, but its a massive letdown. Only very limited gameplay options and a very limited selection of vehicles. The biggest problem is that you are painfully aware of the potential possibilities for fun, but Rockstar has chosen to implement so many abitrary limitations.Also, why the hell does Rockstar hate mods so much?
