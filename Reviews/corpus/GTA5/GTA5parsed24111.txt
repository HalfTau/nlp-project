This game wouldnt be so full of modders if it werent for Rockstars greedy business model in the first place. I can never get a peaceful lobby without some degenerate blowing up the whole lobby, spawning strippers that hump you while trapping you in a cage and sometimes dropping moneybags on you even when you didnt ask for it.Maybe Rockstar should stop advertising shark cards and making everything so damn expensive and just be happy with the money theyre making from selling the damn game. Theyre legit worse than EA but no one calls them out because its Rockstar they made GTA hurr durr.
