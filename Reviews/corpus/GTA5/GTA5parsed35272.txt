How could Take Two possibly make modding illegal? Modding is what keeps many games alive well beyond their prime, attracts more people, and brings people to come back to a game with new experiences and allows a creative ground for people. This act is deplorable. Take Two never should have done this and Im glad to see the community actually doing something about it and voicing their strong opinions. I cannot support this game for this very reason and this whole Shark Cards thing is a pain.
