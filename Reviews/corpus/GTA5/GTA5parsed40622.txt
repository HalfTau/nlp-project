GTAO is the biggest cash grab Ive seen in a AAA title like this ever.  A freaking vehicle costs the eqivalent of 49.99 worth of ingame currency.  The biggest hope you had to have any real fun in GTAO would be if a modder gave you billions of dollars for free, but Take Two Interactive now bans people even if they didnt do any modding themselves.  Spend your money elsewhere.
