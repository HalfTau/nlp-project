Im not even going to touch on the cupidity of Rockstar and Take Two many others have done so, and they have opinions worth listening to.Grand Theft Auto 5 is acceptable. Its rife with Rockstars own brand of humor which can be either sublimely satirical or inanely selfgratifying, depending on the point of view, it has lovingly detailed map design, excellent vehicles, and a cast of  hit and mostly miss characters. Its decent, overall, but it lacks the charm of San Andreas or the iconic charachters of 4/EFLC.Grand Theft Auto Online is absolutely atrocious. The gameplay and game modes are generally good, and the expanded vehicle suite are excellent. The community, however, is handsdown the worst in the existence of online gaming. Expect your teammates to speak the same language as you? Or each other? Youre out of luck. Expect them to have any idea how to play the game mode theyve joined? Expect them to actually complete a match without leaving the keyboard? Same story. Expect stupidity, expect griefing, and expect the distilled fundament of the worst of every game community possible.
