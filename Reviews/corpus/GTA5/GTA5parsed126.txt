Id watch mission impossible if I wanted this gay dlc that makes me feel like Im playing payday 2, but even that would be preferred over the state of the online in this game.The singleplayer is good for what it has on offer, though pretty much everyone knows this by now. A good cynical plot which mocks capitalism and big time corporations, as well as popular media moguls that are popular for no logical reason. Its good for how selfaware it is in the story it presents to the player, and a simple story plot youd expect from the synopsis of one of Michael Manns big screen masterpieces is translated well across into this game medium.Michael is easily the best character out of the three on offer with a backstory and overarching character line that feels like welcoming straight homage to old noir films of the 40s and 50s, with the charm and antihero aspect like that of a character from Apocalypse Now  youre not meant to like him and what he does, but you cant help but feel enticed by his quest and view him from a humane point of view.Franklin is the character that changes the most throughout the singleplayer, creating a narrative to show his rise from a twobit gangster to bigtime crook though whats disappointOMG is the seemingly evident tunnel vision with his interaction with other characters  despite the good execution of the cutscenes and what they have on offer overall, it appears that not much thought was given to show Franklins relations with other characters outside of Michael and Trevor and Lester at a stretch, most clear towards the end. Lamar is only present at the start before the jump to Michael is made, also.Trevor is the typical mad case and comic relief to the sometimes dark tone that the narrative heads in, but if you look past the aspect of humour you see a poorly executed and shallow written character. Apart from the one mission on your journey to LS, I remember nothing else of Trevors backstory that was told other than the bank job at the start of the game that he feels the need to remind Michael every interaction and the player, too.Gameplay is solid, driving is responsive and satisfying and the combat is requiring some work most clear in online but good for the most part to keep the player entertained but also on their toes when the formula for mission gunfights and sometimes changed up. Chop is annoying as the little side interaction for Franklin that he is, but thankfully avoidable for most of your larger gameplay.Devin Westons missions are tedious and nothing else, gathering cars for his financial gain feels nothing but than to increase the length of the singleplayer and in a map with little subtle terrain differences, it grows boring to speed the tarmac of LS over and over again for the six or so cars you have to gather for him. Overall, however, the singleplayer is fun and worth a replay once completed.I only give this a downvote because of how shockinglythe online is, and its incredibly slim in chance that itll ever be fixed, so my rating wont change.
