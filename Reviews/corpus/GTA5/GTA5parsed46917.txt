Yeah, Im contributing to this. Modifications basically MADE PC gaming what it is today. Take 2 has ignored the mods that are available ONLY FOR THE SINGLEPLAYER up until now, but are currently legally fighting against OpenIV and the same community that made the game what it is today a 2 BILLION dollar revenue game, but apparently that is not enough. Again, these modifications are carefully only playable on the singleplayer version of the game, and will not affect anyone elses experience, but Take 2s sickening greed knows no bounds. If they had done this at the time I bought this, I would have IMMEDIATELY demanded a refund and played something else.
