As great as the single player game is, I cant recommend it based on how scummy GTA Online is as an entity. R will release a multiplayer expansion with vehicles, weapons etc, refuse to port those items to singleplayer because it doesnt have microtransactions, and then have the audacity to deliberately break mods that allow these items to be used by singleplayer users by modifying the games base code. Rewards earned from missions in GTA Online are pathetic, and getting anywhere requires a huge investment of either time or money. Any new players are pretty much left with only spending money as an option, because grinding to a level where you can hope to be competitive takes hundreds of hours. Planned singleplayer content seems to have been cancelled in favour of developing more contentpack leeches to apply to the starved corpses of the GTA Online community. Oh, those new cars sure look awesome. Better invest another 30 hours.Ultimately, I have no real issue with adopting an MMOlike business model. But when free to play games like War Thunder genuinely have a fairer grind than a 40 tripleA title, I cant overlook it. If you enjoy GTA online like a lot of my friends do, thats awesome, and I genuinely hope youre getting fun out of it, but its one of those games that bores me beyond belief with how long anything takes, and how boring the steps are to get there. Owning a yacht or a jet fighter or whatever is probably really fun. But I dont have another 200 hours to spend being mostly bored, so I guess Ill never know.
