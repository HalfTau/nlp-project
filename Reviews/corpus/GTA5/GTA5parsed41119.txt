The game has an okay story with decent controlls and options. There is lots of customizability to cars and there are many cars in the game itself. The loading screens take a very long time and most of the game is just driving around in a car and, if you so choose, kill innocent pedestrians. The online mode has a lot of content but to purchase anything of said content you need to do dozens of heists and petty thefts as most things are locked by RP and cost hundreds of thousands and in some cases millions of dollars. The sodas and candy of course cost 1 at the gas station so you can stock up before you rob them for all of your money back. It is very hard to acquire any money and if you want something fast, you may as well buy a shark card as the entire money system in the game is designed to make you buy cards however does not make it impossible to play without. As everyone who looks at the reviews of this game is vehemently aware, they also started to crack down on modders. Some may say Oh wow, they are finally doing something about the hackers! but they are not. They are cracking down on single player mods of which you can now get banned for.TLDR It is an okay game held down by scummy buisness practice.
