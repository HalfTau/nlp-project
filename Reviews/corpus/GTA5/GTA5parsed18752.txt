Since is one of the series, people cannot help to ask when is the next one Grand Theft Auto VI is coming out. Hold your pants guys, cause I am still waiting for their DLCs haha. The Online experience is great, but I enjoyed more in the single player mode, and this is the mode the Devs are lacking at when comes with the additional stuff, and the stuff that can be done in Online mode. Still, 100000000000/10 woudl recommand to play the story missions and the online schiniendiediegens haha.
