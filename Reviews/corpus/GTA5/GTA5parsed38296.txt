This is a disappointing sequel to GTA IV in every way. The AI has been dumbed down, vehicle physics and pedestrian simulations are absent, and it somehow feels like a smaller game despite having a larger play area.If GTA Online interests you, be warned that the hacking is so prevalent that longterm progress is effectively impossible. I wish Rockstar would have delivered on the promise of singleplayer DLC instead of focusing on selling us more outfits.Id say go back and replay GTA IV, but Rockstar has elected to stop supporting that game now that they have your money. this game and  this publisher.
