Well the gam is fun i would recommend that you buy the game. But thats if you can get past the modders and trolls in the game but there are easy was to get away from both and just be in a session with you and you friends and do you ceo or mc work but i mean rockstar and take two just pulled a gun to their head with the new 100 no mods meaning online or singleplayer i mean i could understand online of course because thats where they make their money. but single player was where people went when the got fed up with people online and still wanted to play the game and when you do 100 completion on the campaign then  theres really nothing to do so mods were an escape from that limit. Also i see people complaining about the online being grindy, well i only got a few things to say about that and its that it is supposed to be grindy and time consuming its ment to be hard to do thats why they make it so others can destroy your shipments and product. now dont get me wrong i getwhen i worked half a day with my friends to fill all my large warehouses and we go to sell and that one prick is waiting there just to destroy my shipment having wasted mine and my friends day but you know sometimes your not supposed to care about the money and your just supposed to have fun with your friends go do some races me and my friends go do deadline, adversary,all the races, and all the other missions available and we have fun doing it and you know whats funny. its that by the time we get off weve earned a few million by the time we get off the thing is to not pay attention to the money and pay more attention to your friends and as i said if you want there are ways around being in an open session and doing your shipments with no one else in your session i mean its temporarry but you simply disconect the gtav.exe from any of the hardware or just disconect your internet for about 10 sec and reconnect or resume the process.Even with all the bad things within this game I still play it because me and my friends can still find enjoyment out of it and thats what every game is ment for is to have fun not sit there and obsess about money and getting the best cars i could care less about having those cars but do i have them yes because ive had the money for them and just decided to buy them and was i able to buy every thing for this new update as soon as it came out yes because i didnt focus on money because the trolls knew who to hurt the best and that is those who are only trying to make money and occasionally a random person so...i recomend this game to alland i hope you have fun with the gamejust remember dont take it to seriouslywell thats more than my two centsjust have fun and thats all i have to saywell other than if youve read this farthankyou for reading and have a wonderful dayEveryone is complaining that there are no single player mods I didnt like this either. The reason they said no mods at all is because people would have their mods on in single player and then leave the mods on when going into multiplayer. This is the Rockstar comunity of users fault for modding online and forgetting to turn their mods off.
