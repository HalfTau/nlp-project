Yeah this game is still 60 dollars. It was released 45 years ago as well. Also modding is banned, yes you read that clearly, modding is banned, even in single player. Keep in mind this isnt Rockstars fault, its Take Twos Publishers. fault of sending a CD letter to the staff of a mod making kit, OpenIV. Take Two pretty much pushed the self destruct button. May I add that they are banning innocent players and resetting their accounts for a. Having mods, b.  you, this situation is a big terribleshow now. Story mode is still good if you can complete it in under two hours so you can still refund the game. Online is a grindy mess unless you buy microtransactions, all new items are in the millions New bike is 3.5 million, about 50 US dollars in microtransactions. also in general online really isnt the best place to use your time to play video games, go play something else and avoid this game like you would the bubonic plague.
