First of all, fuck you TakeTwo. You greedy fucking cunts.Second, congrats! Youve just killed your sales and your reputation. We are the gamers, we are the players. Were the the one who buy your games, were the one who play it. Without us, youre nothing.Third, if you wanted to remove hackers and cheaters from the game, make a more powerful AntiCheat. Dont kill the modding community. Theyre the one who gives modifications and feedback so you can make the next game even better. You can take ideas from them and maybe give opportunities for them to work as your creative/development team you retarded fucks.Most of the people who bought your game on PC is to customize it using mods. Check my profile, I have played more than 600 hours on Grand Theft Auto 4, and what the fuck do you think I did on those hours? LCPDFR. A mod that lets you become the police and protect the city. Thats all, becoming a police. And even with the lack of optimization for the PC bad FPS, texture loss, I still play the game until now. You know why? The mods.Im sorry, but its more fun than your online bullshit. You just wanted us to go online and spend our money on some Shark Cards.Dont support these greedy cunts, the more you support them, the worse they get. Sorry Rockstar, you should have stayed independent. Download the game instead from S.k.i.d.r.o.w if you want to mod your game if youre still able to.
