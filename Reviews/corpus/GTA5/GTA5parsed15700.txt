I used to have GTA V on Xbox and it was awesome. The online was fantastic and i never had a problem from it. After having not played the game for a year because i sold my console i decided to buy it on here. The single player was once again awesome but as soon as i got online it said i was banned forever. I didnt even have mods on my single player game and when i contacted rockstar all they said was sorry all bans are final. So pretty much saying well take your 60 twice plus your shark cards then ban you because all we care about is your money. After looking into it i noticed that the ban apparnetly took place about a year ago on red dead redemption on a nintendo switch which makes no sense. I contacted rockstar with suspicion that someone had my account and all i was greeted with again was a big F YOU we dont care from rockstar. So moral of the story if you want to spend alot of money to have your account stolen and a company tell you oh well then this game i perfect for you! If youd rather not get screwed then id reccommend getting something different
