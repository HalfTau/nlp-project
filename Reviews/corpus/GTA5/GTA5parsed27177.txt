Great game. Very good story line, extreme attention to detail and endless posibilities.Oh and then theres online. If you wanna have a lot of fun on a friday night with friends, gta 5 is the way to go.And the idea that the game is bad because they took away the mod support is ing laughable.Enjoy, FreaK
