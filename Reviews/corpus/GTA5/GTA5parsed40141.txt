I remember watching the final prerelease trailer for GTAV and preordering immediately. I showed all my gamer friends the trailer for Online  it felt like the true next generation of GTA was here. Online began as a letdown missing key features and hampered by inexcusable technical problems that still persist today. Ultimately, it became the force that ruined any positive future for a game that I was thrilled about on release. I wish I could return to these characters in storyline DLC. I wish I could rob that casino as Trevor, Franklin, and Michael. If the DLCs that were supposedly planned and leaked online are true, what we got sucks even more in comparison. Oh, and all that excitement was for the 360 version. I bought this ing game twice, still hopeful there may be more singleplayer content someday.Theres still a cool world and a great story mode in the base game, but there are companies that deserve your money much more than TakeTwo does. I cant even fathom how much money theyve made off this pig at this point. And now theyve had the audacity to ban singleplayer modding tools  yet this game uses peer to peer networking and is fundamentally broken from an online security standpoint. The dlc they sell for thousands of points consists of textures that take minutes for an artist to complete and recycled content from scrapped story dlc that would have turned less profit than it did nickelanddimed through shark points.
