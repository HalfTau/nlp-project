When I try to play it it goes to a black screen, loads and says an error has occurred therefore I have not been able to play it for the 9 MONTHS that i have had the game. All i wanted was to be able to use fun mods on story mode and play gta online I have an xbox one but i cant get mods on it.Rockstar, can you please give me tips to fix it, if that happens i will be really thankful.
