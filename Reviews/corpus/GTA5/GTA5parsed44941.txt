No longer allow single player mods well online for PC is filled with modders who come along and mess with your account. If you get banned because of a random money drop the account is reset back to day 1 after a 3 day ban. No appeals. The whole thing makes GTA online, on PC, a joke of an experience.Their customer service is terrible and I wouldnt suggest this game for PC. If you own a console get it on there, if not then dont go near it.
