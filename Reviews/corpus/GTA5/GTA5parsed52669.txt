Unfortunately Rockstar Games and TakeTwo have now decided to attack their huge modding community by throwing OpenIV, which is a big tool used to mod GTA with, a CeaseandDesist letter.This appears to be an attempt to crack down on people cheating in GTA Online, but shutting down a tool that has done so much good for their game is not the way to go and OpenIV cant even be used in GTA Online. Its a really bad excuse from TakeTwo and Rockstar Games. I think it is a stupid attempt to make people pay more for GTA Online to buy special vehicles and such that you normally cannot get in the singleplayer mode in Grand Theft Auto V, but the people attacked will never go onto Online, so it is all just a big loss.So they are not attacking the players who are cheating, they are attacking their biggest fans that love their games so much that theyve decided to actually ADD ON more fun stuff to their favourite games.Thanks to this I can no longer recommend this game. Keep away until they realise what a big mistake theyve made.Its a big shame, because the game itself is actually really fun.
