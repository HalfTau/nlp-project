Anyone who wants to buy this game for GTA Online should DEFINITELY reconsider. Folllowing the Gunrunning update, I was caught in a massive ban wave and my account was suspended for seemingly no reason at all. All of my progress and characters will be reset meaning that everything I have done in the game will be erased. If that isnt bad enough, I reached out to Rockstar Support to seek help and find out why exactly I was banned. All I got was an incredibly vague and generic response that sounded like a default copy and paste answer. In conclusion, do not play GTA Online on PC as there is a higher risk of being banned even if you are innocent and Rockstar support will only give you the cold shoulder if you try to reach out. If you want to buy this game for GTA Online, I would definitely advise against it. Just stick with the current gen consoles if you have them and if you dont, well its not worth it since GTA Online is kind of a boring grind for money now.
