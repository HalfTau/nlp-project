Banning one of the essential singleplayer modding tools is the equivalent of stabbing your community in the back. Sending a cease and desist to the OpenIV team is honestly disgusting, they have worked for years to extend the longevity of your games for years now, and this is how you repay one of the most loyal communities you have?This will not stop modders in online, but a better anticheat could. I still see modders in 4/10 of the sessions I join.This was to force people who want to expierence the DLC content to play Online instead of spawning the new vehicles into singleplayer. Too bad the new vehicles are all outrageously expensive to purchase if you dont want to spend several days farming. This encourages people to buy shark cards of course, but I dont understand how Take Two is disappointed that consumers arent paying for these microtransactions. Are the hundreds of millions you have already made not enough?If this countinues I will have no issues not buying games from Rockstar and Take Two in the future.
