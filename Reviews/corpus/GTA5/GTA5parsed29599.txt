I think a lot of playability and community of this game was through that of modding. I understand where TakeTwo Interactive were coming from, however they have targeted the wrong people to reduce online hacking etc.Personally, I play GTA for the moddability brought to us by OpenIV, and the huge array of mods available for single player of which unfortunately will no longer be able to be placed into the game to make many more hours of playability.Out of the 287.3 hours I have played, I think around 50 of that was playing Online. Yes, I had it on console prior to PC but that mostly was driving around in a police car imagining myself stopping vehicles etc. Modding gave the capability to actually do that and unfortunately that will no longer exist.
