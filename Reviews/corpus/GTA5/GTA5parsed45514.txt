Trying to prevent people from creating mods to make the game fun again, just so they can force you to buy ingame cash to progress online and enjoy the game.This game is incredibly boring unless you spend hours and hours grinding out cash online so you can afford better things, and with mods there was the possibility to make other ways of enjoying the game  Police role plays and etc.Trying to stop them just so you can reap in the cash is disgusting.The most expensive P2W game Ive ever bought.
