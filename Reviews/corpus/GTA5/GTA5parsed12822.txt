I have only bought this game for the single player because i heard about the hacking and cheating online, and i wanted GTA for the storyline and single player free roaming.It would be great to enjoy this single player experience without Rockstars irritating DRM system, where the Rockstar servers decide if i get to play that day. Even starting in offline mode is not possible without this connection, because the game has to be activated everytime before it starts.I would stay away from this 4 year old game that somehow still costs 60, for the base game.
