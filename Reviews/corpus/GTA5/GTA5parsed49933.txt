At its core, Grand Theft Auto is a good game. If I were to review the game itself, itd score a 8.5/10. However, Im giving this a thumbs down because of TakeTwo Interactives and to some extent Rockstars royal ery with the modding community.On June 14, 2017, a takedown notice was issued to the creators of OpenIV, an absolutely essential tool for modding the core files of GTA V, IV and to some extent, Max Payne 3. What they pulled makes modding illegal, and is a massivemove on the part of the publisher.I hope the modding community recovers from the blow and that TakeTwo and Rockstar get theirtogether and issue a sincere apology, because until then they wont get any business from me.
