Personally, Ive never really modded. In the end Rockstar owns the rights to the game, purchasing the game does not give you the right to modify it. Given the situation and percentage on the community that hacks in online, constantly breaking the rules of gta v online with not too much repercussions... I wouldnt be venturing very far to say that this is Rockstar saying enough is enough. Even if openIV was only for singleplayer, its disrespectful to dislike a company that has given so much content and entertainment to those that play it.My actual review of this game is that it is one of the best modern multiplayer and singleplayer games. It looks amazing and playing through the story is fulfilling. 10/10 would recommend this to anyone, you cant go wrong with a rockstar game.
