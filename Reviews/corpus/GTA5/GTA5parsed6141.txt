This game has some serious issues with the online. Youre forced to be in an open session with a bunch of idiots if you want to earn some money, and a fair amount of those idiots are PayToWin. So in order to make money you have to try to avoid people who spent actual money to get items to  with people trying to grind up money in a long and not so fun way. Rockstar keeps adding more and more crazyto the only online. Thats good, but the fact that akmost every new item always costs somewhere above one million is insane and just plain stupid. Not to mention the horrible ceo work. Go fetch this package far at sea while getting shot at by a helicopter while youre trying to fetch just one package so you can go put that in your storage. Then sit through two loading screens as you need to go both in and out of the storage. Then go do the same with the other packages, but beware, there might be a flying delorean out to get you, because some PayToWin  doesnt have anything better to do. Wont be starting up this game again, or use any more money on it.
