At the beginning it was pretty good, online was funny and even if it was hard, you could get lots of money. Now they went full retard, banning people and stealing money legitimately obtained, also it has become harder to get rich unless you pay those shark cards incredible the biggest one costs more than the game itself.Oh and to do all the new stuff of bunkers, biker clubs and such, you have to be incredible rich, thing is many people that had a lot of money now they dont, and they cant afford it unless you pay said cards or spend a lot of hours, and then getting your money stolen by Rockstar again.
