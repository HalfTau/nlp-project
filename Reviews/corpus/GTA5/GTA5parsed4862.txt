Bought the game during the sale to play with a friend. Was riding around with said friend getting chased by the cops when he says to stop because he called in a batmobile. He hops in the driver seat and starts to drive with the in the passenger seat. After a few minutes I get a suspended for a month with a character reset. Now this doesnt really do anything to me as ive only had the game for 2 hours and have nothing. The whole reason I got the game however was to play with a buddy and now I cant for a month.
