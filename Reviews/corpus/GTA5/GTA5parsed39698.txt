Take2, the parent company of the development studio for GTA V threatened legal action against the developers of OpenIV, a tool used to mod the single player experience of GTA V. Their defense was that OpenIV was being used to modify the online portion of the game despite the fact that the tool could not be used to do that. It is no longer tenable to defend the actions of Take2/Rockstar, they have forgone the quality of their product in pursuit of greater profits by forcing players to move to the walled garden of the online mode where they are more likely to make microtransactions for new content for this game. I hope that the tanking reputation of this product on Steam is a message to the developer and parent company to do better with future IPs.
