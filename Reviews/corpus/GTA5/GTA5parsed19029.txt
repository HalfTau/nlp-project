After a combined 2k hours between xbox and pc this game is no longer worth the disk space it takes up. Rockstar has become so money hungry its stupid. Sure dlc is free but to buy anything in game is inpossible legit. Then they go and ban all the modders giving money. Why? well pay to win of course. Cause while you can earn the cash in game wtf good is it when a majority of things pay 30 grand for 30 mins of work. Gta 4 was open to modders and had no moderation by rockstar and as far as i am concerned if i had to rebuy this game even for 5 bucks i wouldnt do it. For free id refuse the copy. So i hope somone from rockstar sees this and relise you have destroyed the gta franchise.
