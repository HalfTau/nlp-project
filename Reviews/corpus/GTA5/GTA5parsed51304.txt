EDITNot a proper reviewTakeTwo wholly owns publishers Rockstar Games and 2K Games. In the last fortnight TakeTwo has revealed how it views us, the consumers. Quote TakeTwo CEO Strauss ZelnickYou cant give stuff away for free in perpetuity theres no business model in that, but were not trying to optimise the monetisation of everything we do to the nth degree. My concern is, if you do that, the consumer knows. They might not even know that they know, but they feel it... We are convinced that we are probably from an industry view undermonetising on a peruser basis. There is wood to chop because I think we can do more, and we can do more without interfering with our strategy of being the most creative and our ethical approach, which is delighting consumers. Were not going to grab the last nickel.Im no expert on the subject, but i think Jim Sterling may be so Ill leave the links to his videos hereIn this video Jim talks about the quote above, it is titled TakeTwo Isnt Making Enough Money From You The JimquisitionIn this video Jim talks about TakeTwo banning mods from gta5, it is titled Mod Theft Auto The Jimquisition I feel the game industry has been going in the wrong direction since i started gaming. Ive bought many games from the likes of 2k and Rockstar and I feel like Ive supported their downfall and money obsession. I will do my best to withdraw all  future finacial support from TakeTwo because unfortunatley, money is the only thing that will influence the decisions of CEOs like Strauss Zelnick.
