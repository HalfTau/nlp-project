I loved modding. But getting salty over something that small. Okay that made 0 sense but heres 3 solutionsA. Stop Playing GTAVB. Keep ing like a 3 year oldC. Buy Saints RowIts got a good modding community andsooooo yeePS. Dont give me rep cause i agree with Rockstar/Take2 i dont really mod makers put time and effort into their mods but does it really matter most mods either broke the games script if you ed up or just got bland sooo yeeeeeeeee
