Rockstar might be one of my favorite gaming franchises. It never ceases to impress me with their content and their singleplayer campaigns are always fun with a little bit of dark humor mixed in. The online for me is a totally different story however. The community can be pretty toxic occasionally, thats not the worst of it, the money system in the online is horrible. Assuming you arent hacking or cheating, the only way to get money in game is to either spend the equivalent time youd spend in a parttime job or spend a parttime jobs worth of cash just to afford the shark cards in order to even scratch the surface of what GTA online has to offer. If you are just buying this game for the singleplayer, then you will not be dissapointed although you may be incredibly annoyed by the wealth gap in its online mode.
