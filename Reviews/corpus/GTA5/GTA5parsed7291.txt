So after hours of this game on Xbox and PC, I think Im ready to put in my 2 cents.If youre buying this for the singleplayer, go ahead. The missions are fun, the characters memorable, and the city feels alive.If youre buying this for the multiplayer, just.... dont. Once upon a time, GTA Online was a fun place. Sure, there were s, but what game doesnt have s? Back when it first came out, you could drive up to somebody and there was a 50/50 chance they would either pop you or hop in and go for a ride with you. Now you should consider yourself lucky you dont get blown up by some  in a fighter jet as soon as you leave your garage.It used to be satisfying to grind for stuff in Online. Now everything costs much more than it should, giving players incentive to buy shark cards Which gives you ingame money for real life money. And dont even get me started on the hackers. They can freeze everybody in the lobby, spawn in things to trap people in their apartments, and Rockstar wont bat an eye. But if they give themselves or other players free money? Rockstar aint having none of that, and they wont hesitate to ban the person hacking the money in and/or the player recieving the hacked money. Its a fckfest now. Lets just hope Red Dead 2 Online isnt like this.
