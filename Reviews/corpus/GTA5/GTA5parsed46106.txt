Long time GTA player, played on PC since GTA 3.Considering modders got this game to where it is today Rockstar and Take 2 should be ashamed.Remember when a Karuma used to be the biggest threat from an Online griefer? Nope lets give them cars with guns, snipers with exploding bulllets and all the other crap that comes with it.You betrayed us Rockstar....Rated M for Microtransactions.
