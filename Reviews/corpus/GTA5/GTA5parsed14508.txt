The game was great. Emphasis on great. Before all of the flying motorcycles, biplanes, supercars, and yachts that will take you either over 100 in actual money, or 100 hours farming to aquire. The game has become a grind, just to get something that youll later sell for around 70 of what you paid for it for something minutely better than the first. Rockstar has made mistakes in the past, but this games direction is the biggest one yet. The constant addition of overly expensive vehicles and not really any new ways to get them, or other ways other than shelling out at least a million for a biker club, bunker, or CEO business to earn large sums of cash leaves them inaccessable to most players that feel that theyve already paid enough just buying the base game.TLDR Dont buy this game unless youre either playing story or are willing to spend copious amounts of time or money to get SOME vehicles that are considered to be alright.
