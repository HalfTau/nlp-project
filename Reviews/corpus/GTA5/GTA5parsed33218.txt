I was just about to get back onto GTA V and do some more modding to find that TakeTwo is trying to make a claim its somehow goddamn illegal to mod in SINGLEPLAYER! They are just a bunch of corporatetrying to push us onto the  online, to make us buy shark cards. Damn pigs just tryin to make as much money as possible. RIP GTA mods.
