I supported this game since launch, only for them to remove my in game legitimately earned money.Their methods to remove hacked money affected many people who played this game legitimately.Their support replies with generic CopyPaste answers, with no actual help.The game direction is going more and more into microtransactions with tactics such as encouraging people to destroy someone stock so they cannot make money and maybe forced into buying ingame money to buy the items they want.Save your time and money and do not play this game.I know I am not supporting Rockstar again.
