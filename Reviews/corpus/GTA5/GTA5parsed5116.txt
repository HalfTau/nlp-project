GTA Online is pay to win pay to win with a good 6 hours of griding starting off i have only made 100k then everything else is 100mil . Also all million dollar items and buildings are advertised all over your screen and forces you to buy shark cars even when you go bankrupt it forces you to buy shark cards to pay your bills even for a 12 shark card 1.2 mil is hardly nothign as msot cars and buildigns is 4mil  and makes you feel scammed every secodn of the experiance and dosent make me want to gridn anymore as it just isnt worth it anymore!
