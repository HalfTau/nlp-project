Beautiful graphics, great sound  just so much small details like listening in on other peoples conversations, splitting of the story from the viewpoint of 3 characters I did not like initially but after a while you get used to it and you love all of them, including Trevor who is a real nasty piece of work! You seriously get your monies worth with this game.
