There was a time when GTA 5 was fun. Then Rockstars greed killed it. You cant do anything in this game without paying and everything is extremely overpriced. It is impossible to get ingame money without buying Shark Cards. This game is paytowin and paytoenjoy.The hackers in online mode are out of control. Rockstar cant even set up a proper anticheat system. I will admit that I had a mod menu, but only to give myself money because I wasnt going to let Rockstar scam me. I didnt abuse my mods, but everyone else abuses theirs. They seriously need to be dealt with.Singleplayer is probably the only decent part about this game, but it gets old after a while. You could mod it to get more fun out of it, unless they ban singleplayer mods again. In the end, this game is garbage. Not worth the money and trouble. If you must buy it, get it on sale like I did.
