I absolutely cannot recommend this game anymore. Removing modding is the last straw. The intolerable amounts of banning on the online portion of the game kept me off of online play, but modded singleplayer was still fun. This game has ZERO replayability without mods, and as they have been banned by  Take Two, I will no longer be playing this game. Over 500 hours have been spent on GTAV personally on multiple accounts. Modding kept the fun in this game.
