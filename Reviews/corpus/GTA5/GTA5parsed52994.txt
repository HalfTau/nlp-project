I really thought I would never have to do this but this was the last straw Take Two and Rockstar did. Ive played GTA V for most of the time on my PS4 but then switched to the PC version just for the very reason of available mods like the LSPDFR mod. Now that they have decided to completely destroy modding by filing a lawsuit against Open IV which is basically needed to create mods that game is dead for me. The Multiplayer part of it is just filled with hackers all the way and the prices for cars,planes and so on are just ridiculious. Anyone who is still thinking about buying this game should stay away from it. It will keep you busy for probably 30 hours but then without mods and new things to try out you will loose interest in it pretty fast.
