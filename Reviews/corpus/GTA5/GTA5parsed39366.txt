First of all, story mode is great.But since the multiplayer is the only thing Rockstar is updating, ill leave my review to it.Started nice, cool multiplayer and fair, no hackers or anything.Then came the Heists, the best update the game had, incredibly fun to play.But then started the be rich, a hacker, play the game ALL DAY LONG EVERY DAY, get money from other hackers OR give up.Because, this WILL happen to youSpawn killed by level 1000 with armored weaponized vehiclesChange to passive mode and because of that, not being able to play the game the way it was meant to be.So then theres the new updates, innovative ways to earn money.Steal cars/Steal supplies or something like that.Okay, ill create a private session to play with my friend or alone, so I can do these missions in pieceY O U  C A N  TAnd there you have two options1  Try and to the missions on a public session and fail everytime, because lets be honest, how in the hell are you supposed to escape from jets/tanks/armored vehicles/whatever the  they add next with normal cars/slow trucks?2  Force your internet to run slow so you can join an empty public session until someone logs in and  up your fun with the things above.And also, theres this mod thing you all know about.I think it was time to post this review. The online is ing ridiculous.
