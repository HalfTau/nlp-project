I find it disgusting that rock stars parent company all but banned modding in its entirety. I dont understand the need for the threat of a lawsuit I also do not understand the threat that modders pose to a company. If anything, having a strong modding community will boost sales and client enjoyment of the product. If they were illegally distributing the game, that would be a different story. I hope they will reconsider this action of aggression for the sake of all of us that enjoy a customized gaming experience.Yours truly,Fellow Human
