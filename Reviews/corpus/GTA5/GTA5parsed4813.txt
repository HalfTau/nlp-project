I paid 23 for this game. Single player is very well done and I can easily enjoy it for hundreds of hours as I did in 2013 on ps3. Buy it if you like single player games. Because gta online is borderline unplayable.GTA online is a different story. I started playing the day it was released. A lot has changed. Back then everyone was doing the dupe glitch, everyone had money, everyone had everything they wanted, everyone had fun. With every update this game gets worse. Not because of the content, because of the price. And the constant unfair banning and stat wiping done by rockstar. They do this on purpose. The want people to buy shark cards. Its the most scummy bussiness model Ive ever seen, but it works for them because of the vast amount of kids playing this game.  those guys who are responsible for this.Then theres the modders that we have here on PC. After youve finally loaded to gta online the loading times are unbelievable at times, you get ed over by the modders who will ruin your experience if tar cant do it first.If you plan to buy this game for gta online, dont. Stay away from this pile of Single player is good tho.
