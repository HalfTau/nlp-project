GTA 5 SP is great and even better with mods. Online not so much IMO. seeming how ive played online more and thats the main problem I have with this game Im going to be talking about that. GTA 5 has become to much of a grind. I have to grind for hours just to get maybe 1 million. Vehicles are also way over priced. I know this review was quick and not very detailed but Ive about had it with GTA 5 online time to go play sp with mods
