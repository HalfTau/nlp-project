Been active Gta player played since it came out on pc, got banned for taking hacker money and called support to ask why and was not given an answer.af, dlc came out, bought another copy on Rockstar games. Now online servers 90 are filled with hackers with infinite health and also blowing everyone up for no reason spawning things in the reserves. Im ing dissapointed. Therefore I do not recommend this.
