Its an okay single player game. Great open world full of fun stuff to do, average story, fun heists.The multiplayer and the publishers stance in general is where they dropped the ball. Full of hackers, filled with microtransactions, loading screens and toxic community in general.So yeah, couldve been fun, ended up being disappointing. Not to mention T2on their community and modders, shame on them.
