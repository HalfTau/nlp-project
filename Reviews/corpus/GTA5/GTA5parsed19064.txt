I think this game gets too much hate. For me gta 5 is a good game, not great but not bad either. The singleplayer is fun and the story is good too but the story is definitely not as good as the previous games. The gameplay is great. Just about perfect for a game like GTA. However, people dont get this game for the singleplayer, they get it for the online mode. While in the reviews, in the most helpful reviews, they see GTA Online as moneyhungry and micro transaction filled grindfest with 8 year old kids killing every player they see in there sight, I would say it really isnt like that. I dont know if its my server or something I dont run into squeakers most of the time. On the money hungry part, I would say that the game isnt paytowin simply because you cant exactly win it. People say that everything is overexpensive and requires grind, but I think that once you unlock heists, gaining money isnt hard, especially if u have 3 friends. After that u can buy a biker clubhouse and start a business. Making money in GTA isnt really grindy, I dont feel the need to buy shark cards. The only thing I see overexpensive are definitely the vehicles. They are expensive as 1T. for a beginner the best advice from me would be to stay away from cars and buy urself a cheap high end apartment. Start a biker bussines, then import export and then the gunrunning one. Dont buy expensive vehicles until u r atleast level 60. Overall, I give this game an 8.5/10.
