Had nothing but bugs for the longest time that crashed my game thanks to my card R9 390, was refused a refund due to spending 2 hours to fix the bug Crashed game after 20 minutes of play, the bug finally got fixed and i was able to experience a mediocre game with a ok story and an online so full of hackers it just wasnt fun. No simple lobby for friends to join servers unless you make it private, generic maps filled with nothing but guns and no creativity, garbage balancing in the online and NOW they have removed mods making it very unlikely i will return to the game. Good job T2 and RS, you have killed your game.
