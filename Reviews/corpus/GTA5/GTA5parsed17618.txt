Grand Theft Auto V is very awesome plenty things to do in story mode/online. Lots of updates that makes the game even more interesting. You can play it with your friends, have your own crew fight against other crews go for a gang bang! The game is really worth 60euro I will never regret that I bought it. I rate it 9/10 Try the game for your self you will see how its awesome!! !
