A bike recently came out which, while pretty cool, costs 3.5 million dollars. To buy this amount of money with their microtransaction Shark Cards, youd need a minnimum of 50 dollars. Rockstar released a vehicle in game that would either take hours upon hours of work to get, or a real life amount of 50 dollars.Thats just one motorcycle.Dont buy this game
