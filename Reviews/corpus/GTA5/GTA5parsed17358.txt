Cant recommend a game that robs honest players of legitimately earned cash. 8/26/17 I had a certain amount of money around 600,000 removed from my account that I legitimately earned doing an ingame sale event, made a ticket to rockstar support, and havent gotten my money back. Only a pathetic automated answer claiming I had gotten the ingame money illegitimately.Im not a modder, I havent recieved money from modders, and I rarely play in a public room unless its with my friends doing a sale. If I play in a public room, its a solo public room with my friends who are also not modders. If I were going to mod money in the game, I wouldnt mod in such an insignificant amount like 600,000. To top it off, the money removed from my account was an extremely specific number such as 637,210. I had recently gotten this exact number from doing a sale online. Essentially, they made that sale useless. I rarely make 600,000 in this game much less 1 million.5 minutes of research proves Im not the only one who had legitimate money removed, and the amount I had removed pales in comparison to the amount that was removed from others such as millions. Yes, Im aware that some of these money adjustments were done because players had recieved illegitimate money from modders, but many like myself were done to people who earned cash legitimately. The fact that they wont correct this nonsense is unnaceptable and proves just how greedy they are, as if we needed any more proof.Even though the amount of money removed from my account wasnt massive, I shouldnt have had any money removed at all, and the way Rockstar has handled this whole situation will forever leave a bad taste in my mouth.
