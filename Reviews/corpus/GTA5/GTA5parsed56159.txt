Rockstar finally fixed the major hacking issue online and did a hardcore shakedown which unfortunlately came with the cost of OpenIV. Regardless I can finally enjoy mutiplayer without hackers and dont have to hide behind closed severs which can become boring very quickly. Usally I rarely play, because if I go online and do a drug run or any other freemode mission, Im afraid a hacker would ruin the all the fun and make freemode missions impossible, but just yesterday some guy in a attack heli came after me trying to destory my boat thinking there were drugs in it but there wasnt and he tried so many times to kill me off but he had bad aim and I distracted him long enough that my friends finished their supply runs and witnessing this was extremely fun, the most fun I had online unfortunlately. Now imagine if there was a hacker online? Imagine if Rockstar and take two didnt do anything? What then?
