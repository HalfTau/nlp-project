Mods are back, but guess what? I wont be buying the next Rockstar game. Skyrim SE, a 64 bit version of an almost 6 year old game is in the top sellers list for a reason, pay attention. You have shown that all you care about is money when trying to stop modding, and you pood on the fanbase. My  goes elsewere from now on.
