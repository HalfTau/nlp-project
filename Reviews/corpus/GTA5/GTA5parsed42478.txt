I dont play this game anymore but Mods were the reason I put more than 100 hours in single player alone. So Take Twos decision to ban OpenIV makes this game loses its unique and fun experience on PC. And more importantly Take Two took every consumers right to do whatever they want with a product they paid 60 for. So for these reasons I dont recommend this game unless Take Two backs off their actions
