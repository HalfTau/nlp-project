Okay, so this game has a tendency to seem not too fun. Because, well, at parts, it isnt. The game is incredibly grindy. Like, Rockstar realized that people were going to stop buying the game at a point, so they just had to force people to buy Shark Cards. However, if you dont mind doing some grinding every once and a while, AKA if you really like Runescape then this game is a solid addition to your library. Also, the singleplayer campaign is really good.
