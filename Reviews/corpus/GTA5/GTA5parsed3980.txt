The single player is great, just what youd expect from a GTA title.Now for the online.ProsThe game is great fun, especially when playing with friends. Ive spent countless hours just screwing around, laughing myoff and having a good time. If you want to have a good time, youll find no problem here.ConsLong loading times Not always, but occasionally youll get an irritatingly long loading screenModdersThe longer you play, the more youll realize how overpriced some things are to push people into buying their shark cardsMaking money is often a slow grindI like this game a lot, but sometimes I get dissapointed in how they chose to design certain things, like the hangars. Nontheless I will give it a thumbs up, because I had tons of fun with it and will probably continue to have for some time.
