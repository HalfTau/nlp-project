After having GTAV on the PS4 for 2 years and acquiring roughly 170 hours on the story and almost 600 hours on online, I was wary of buying it on the PC and having to start from scratch, but when it was on sale at 16 I just couldnt resist.34 hours in so far and I absolutely have no regrets whatsoever, even though going back to square one with my online character has been difficult and frustrating at the best of times.This game is my favourite game of all time for many reasons The 3 main characters are hilarious and crazy but all very different at the same time The NPCs are also completely bonkers and its so much fun messing with them The radio stations are amazing albeit I only listen to 3 and I have discovered some brilliant music on there The online part of the game is so vast and theres so much to do its unreal  helps to have a friend or two to play with but even so there is plenty to do by yourself R treat us to new DLC every 2/3 months which is FREE unfortunately I think people tend to forget the free part when complaining about online Online events which change every 2 weeks or so, including adding new adversary modesYes, the stuff in the online DLCs can be expensive and yes you have to grind to earn money but when theres so many ways to do so, its fun and gives you hours and hours of entertainment! Theres no need to buy a shark card  Ive earned 60 mil on my PS4 account and have never once bought a shark card nor felt the need to buy one.Ive had this game 2 years, and I am still to this day discovering new songs on the radio stations and still hearing new dialogue from the NPCs and boy do they say some crazy stuff and I cant think of another game that can do that.10/10, would highly recommend P
