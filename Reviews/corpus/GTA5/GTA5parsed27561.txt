Ive never been banned from this game. Ive played on the exact same character ever since GTA V came out for 7th generation consoles specifically PS3. Ive never played with mods, but there so many reasons why I would still play this game. I love mountain biking, parachuting, having 80 cars/motorcyles, etc. This game gives me a reality where I can wave my richdick in front of poor players.Regardless, Im just writing a bad review to pitch in with the community against this new modding policy and there is no reason for me to explain.
