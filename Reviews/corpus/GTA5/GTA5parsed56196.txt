Mods are the one reason I still play this  grindfest of a game, and to see the actions taken by TT Interactive to try to suppress and destroy the creative minds in their community has caused me to lose faith in this company. Modding is a vital thing for games, and it generally helps keep them alive even years after the initial hype of the game has died down. Without modding, a lot of games wouldnt even exist today, I mean, look at CS, Dota 2 and TF2! Shame on you TT, Shame on you for being the greedy s you are.
