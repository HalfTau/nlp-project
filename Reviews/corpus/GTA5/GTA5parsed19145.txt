playing the game, as the game alone, not paying a cent over the games price, its fantastic, the story if you didnt know might have the best most realistic aspects while still having a fun cartoony violence style, along with the characters that, when you hate them, youre meant to hate them, story aside because weve all played it at this point, the online is fantastic, on the contrary to ps4 and xbox, its very mature and chill mostly, you can jump on a server, and even the modders are nice to you. this creates such a great experience that without being pay to win can be enjoyed to the fullest extent, that being an open world action game where you can literally do everything youve ever wanted, and can i just say how well this game has aged? this 2014 game still looks absolutely stunning and feels so alive, the physics and cars feel just the way you want them to, realistic or not. the atmosphere of this game just feels so amazing from the car radio and the DJs for each, and the talk shows, and the people on the sidewalks, this game does almost everything right, and thats the best you can ask for, rockstar always hits a home run with their games and this one is the best ive played, all the settings to push your god pc down to its knees, and all the visuals to make you feel great about your midranger. in conclusion, the beauty of this game never ends, neither does the fun, social aspects, new friends, etc. buy... this... game...PS For comparison on people unsure on how this thing might run because minimum/recommended specs are rarely realistic, a 680 usd prebuild with an rx 580 4gb and a ryzen 5 1400 8gb ddr4 runs this at a solid 60fps consistently with 8x msaa at maxed settings at 1600x900, 90fps with no msaa.
