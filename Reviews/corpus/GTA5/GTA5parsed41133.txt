I really enjoyed the game, but the online gets extremely stale quickly  especially considering the fact that getting cash in GTAO is extremely grindy and the game finds every way possible to keep you needing more and more. Its not a coincidence that they also allowed microtransactions to exchange real cash for ingame cash. Its hella lame. After my first ban for installing a first person FOV mod because the included first person camera has a FOV of about 50. Yeah, 50, I got a trainer and used it to have fun in the game, spawning BMX bikes en mass, carrying people on the back of a big rig going 200 MPH down the interstate until we hit something and went flying, and crashing the games of any vitrolic cheaters who were ruining the fun for everyone else. It was fun  but I was permanently banned for it. Sure, its fair. I was cheating in an online game. But the stance Take Two Interactive has on modding is archaic and is directly against the interest of the community, and the game. Modding keeps the game alive, it keeps it fresh and lets there be a reason to keep playing and buying the game long after its release. It feeds the community, and taking a hard stance against it is totally against their own interest. I wish I can go back to GTAO, its a very fun experience. But without the freedom that a trainer gives me to enjoy the game with other people, I dont feel like its worth it. I wanna dance on top of a train while crushing another player under the weight of a thousand BMX bikes behind me again.
