Ill give it a 10Good graphics, music etc. The story is in fact dull, all characters are idiots but cool on its own way. First person camera makes the game immersive. Online is cool, competitive join a crew before complain about toxic community, and the online jobs keeps you busy, so, I totally recommend it.
