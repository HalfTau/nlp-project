At the time of writing this reveiw I have play 17 hrs in game. And I can say that I love this game. It has a massive and alive open world with tons of things to do from tenis to taking a car and driving around. GTA ONLINE is amazing I really love it From the races to the PVP. I rate GTA V 10/10 for me. I also know that people have been having probloms with Online and bans and or servers. I just personaly just love the game.
