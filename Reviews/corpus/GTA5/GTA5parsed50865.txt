I once would have given this game 4 stars, but only because I bought it for the modding. Now it seems Take Two Interactive is worried that singleplayer mods pose a threat to their revenue in GTA Online. Without the modding community, this game will fade into the background and die. To me without the modding, this game would only receive 2 stars from me. I will be boycotting TTI games in the future. If TTI doesnt support 100 of the GTA community, then we shouldnt support their business.
