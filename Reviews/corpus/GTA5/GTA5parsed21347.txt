Rockstar as a company has gone extremely downhill recently, but it doesnt change the fact that GTA V is one of the best games out there. It has the best living city in any other open world games, with an intriguing story and a 40 hours of awesome campaign and characters. Online is riddled with hackers and modders though, and the recent controversy with mods have only made matters worse. All in all a must have, if only for the singleplayer campaign.
