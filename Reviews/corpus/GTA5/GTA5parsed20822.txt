So much potential that hasnt been utilized in this game. There is no mod support or cooperation with the community. DLC updates only update material content  cars, game modes, clothes  and does not at all develop and improve gameplay. Instead of  for example  making lobbys with servers that can give good input and variety in gameplay from the players.
