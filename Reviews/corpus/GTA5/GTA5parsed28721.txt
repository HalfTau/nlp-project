WTF??!? I leave for a month or two and come back to nothing butWARNING MODDING IS ILLEGAL NOW??? I mean come on Rockstar and Take Two. I get it, modding in Online isnt fair for the rest of us, but modding in single layer is totally OK!!! I just wanted some highend graphical gameplay! Thats all! Modding was the reason i picked up this game again in a whole year! The community clearly doesnt like this either! Plz let the single player modders enjoy the game! You dont have to punish us cuz some idiots cheat in online! Blame them, not us!
