I love the single player for this game, but that was almost 4 years ago now on Playstation 3.  Ive played a couple hours of GTA Online and its a real hassle to get anything going.  Maybe one day Ill revisit the single player missions with a proper build.Wouldnt recommend buying it for GTA Online, wouldnt recommend buying it because modding support has been nuked.  Wouldnt recommend buying because micro transactions.
