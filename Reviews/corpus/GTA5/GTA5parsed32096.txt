Bad matchmaking, pay to win, so many loadings when trying to connect to a lobby, even exiting a lobby ends up on a 5 minute long loading screen. I played this with patience. Now theyre trying to shut the modding part of this game even before i tried it? Thats it. I wont be returning to GTA Online ever again. Heres hoping someone can make a tool to replace OpenIV so i can enjoy myself in Singleplayer with mods.
