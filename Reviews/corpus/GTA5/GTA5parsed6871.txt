Loading screen simulator 3021.A really fun game but it kinda forces you to grind or buy shark cards to counter other people. Theres atleast 1 tryhard in every lobby who happens to geek this game 24/7 and keeps on killing you for no reason. But once you get good at the game it gets better. Theres alot of heists, modes, races... It was definetly worth buying it, and i would recommend it to anyone who has enough money Id wait for a sale tho it can drop down to 24.
