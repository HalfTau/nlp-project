So Ive played this game for a while now, in the past often playing with friends and such, but I always wanted ot experience the modding scene, to play singleplayer with a animorph mod, or have massive tsunamis devastate Los Santos as santa and his mighty army of reindeer carpet bomb the highway... heck I wanted to try the Matrix mod, but alas the damn game no longer allows modding of any kind. Im done with Gta 5, as for anyone planning on buying the game now be forwarned, the consumer is not in the mind of Take2, only their wallet, and mods off the table.
