Ive purchased this game 3 times now. First on the Xbox 360, then the Xbox One and finally on the PC with the latter two being digital purchases.I purchased the game on PC to experience all the mods and other cool things the talented community had added to the game with the help of modding tools such as OpenIV.TakeTwo and Rockstar have since banned this tool probably in an attempt to further monetize the game because my 3 purchases were not already enough for them.Do not support these actions if you really want to play this game buy it second hand on a platform that supports physical media to ensure the publishers and developers do not see a penny of your money.
