Obligatory Upvote. The company was critizised for blocking mods, reacted adult by making OpenIV accessible again, so we gamers should react accordingly and feedback Take Two that they have made the right decision.So, stop spilling salty tears now, reinstall all the nude mods, go for a winning fap and change your review.EDITRemember OpenIV is a 3rd party software. Neither Take2, nor Rockstar will make any money from it  Its more likely that this will consume ressources at Rockstar.As a gaming company, you need to make profit, to make further games. Its not an altruistic community that is just there to make life more convenient for you, they need to pay bills, wages, etc. Also espacially for GTA5, you really cant complain about abandoned by developer or servers dont work anymore. They provide top notch service for their own products.If you really think, that you have contributed to the modding community enough to critizize a company for blocking 3rd party software on their own servers, well, noones gonna stop you.But then dont complain, that RDR2 or GTA6 will never happen because Rockstar games is out ofmoney.
