I would not recommend this game whatsoever. 2K games have made it extremely clear that all they want is money. They dont want to make a good game, they dont want to make people happy. They couldnt care less what your experience is playing their games and they dont give a rats a about how you feel about it. All they want is your money and then you could go die in a hole for all they care. Its like going to your absolutely most favorite place to eat. The food is always great, the staff are always friendly and you always have a good time. But then your favorite place is bought out by 2K games now they didnt change much. Food is still great, staff is still friendly. But now eveytime you walk through the doors 2K spits in your face and tells you that youre worthless scum. Its pretty much how I feel. One of the best selling games on the planet and its still not making enough money for those greedy s. 2K games, youre bad. And you should feel bad. I do not recommend this game or any other game currently released by 2K Games.
