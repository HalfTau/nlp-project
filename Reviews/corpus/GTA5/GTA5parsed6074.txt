Great game with beautiful graphics. Runs like a charm on most rigs. Only downsides are loading times, server instability, and a plague of modders.Started playing this game in January 2017 with a friend, they introduced me to the world of GTA and the MC community. I found a great group of people to play with and it has increased my enjoyment of the game tenfold. These people have become the best group of friends ive ever had, some as close as family. If anyone is looking for a light RP, PVP oriented 1 MC, check out.
