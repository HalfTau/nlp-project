The worst 30.00 Ive spent on a game.GTA Online in one sentence Waiting 30 minutes before selling the next 9,000 dollar stolen vehicle while using passive mode to evade modders openly hacking the game.Expect to be stealing vehicles and selling them to spray shops for cash. Expect to register as VIP and run hundreds of Executive Search missions that pay 25k to hide somewhere for ten minutes while nobody tries to find you. Expect to encounter player modding cheaters that have the ability to teleport to any player have god mode and will simply attempt to get you banned by GIVING you money... The money bags will pour onto your character so be ready to find a new session. Reporting is a bad idea since GTA policy basically sates If you report someone then you can be banned simply for reporting... The VOICE chat is bugged and apparently hacked by modders listening to every channel... Dont be suprised when a modder starts talking to you like theyve heard everything you were saying in private channels. Story may have been interesting to play through but its my opinion. They need to run a decent online game where cheaters dont ruin the place with confusion and chaos. Trust me. Modders dont deserves to play GTA V. Modders openly harrass others like they own the servers. Players dont deserve to be treated like this. Remove mod functions from online or shut this game down.Put me into a cage afterwards..
