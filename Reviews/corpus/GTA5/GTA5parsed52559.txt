EDITRockstar have managed to convince Take Two to allow single player mods and Open IV is now available. Good too see that they listen to their fans. I will still leave my old review belowAfter seeing Take Twos stance on mods, I can no longer recommend this game. I wish Rockstar would stand up to Take Two but no. Take Two have ruined Grand Theft Auto, first with the shark cards and now with the removal of mods.Go  yourself Take Two.
