This game used to be a lot of fun. I put more than 200 hours in to GTA online on the Playstation, and have put more than a hundred hours in to single player on Playstation and Steam combined.That said I have a couple complaints The online has been completely ruined by Shark Cards and the outrageous pricing on the new ingame stuff like boats, cars, and houses. Honestly, the game was a lot, lot, lot more fun when everyone cheated, but it was still feasible to make progress in game without cheating or paying for money.Now, you cant get any of the new cars or stuff without A being one of the people who cheated a bunch to begin with, and still has a ton of money left over from that, or B spending more than the retail price of the game on Shark Cards. It makes it even worse that Im afraid to cause too much trouble in game because I dont want to lose money on insurance and ammo, but people who have cheated or are willing to buy Rockstars t points run around causing wanton distruction because they have enough money to not care.The amount of money that you get from completing missions and races absolutely does not make it possible to obtain any of the new stuff in game without spending an outrageous amount of hours doing it. This is one of the biggest reasons my friend and I, who used to play daily, dont anymore. I bought this game on PC because modding GTA SA and GTA IV was a load of fun, and I expected this to be similar. Then Rockstar went and ruined that. Rockstar and  TakeTwo.
