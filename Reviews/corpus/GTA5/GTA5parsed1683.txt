Playing online with a group of friends is still pretty fun BUT . . . the game is completely run by money now as in IRL money. If you dont play this game a LOT to grind up the money then youll either need to buy ingame currency or be prepared to beall over by people in ridiculously OP and Overpriced gear.The hacking in the game has become CONSTANT. If you spend a large amount of money to setup a heist and a hacker just spawns hundreds of planes on you, killing you and your friends. . . then tough luck youre screwed. Not to mention the fact that the Net Code is so so buggy that simply restarting a heist after a hacker ruins it often causes you to get stuck in a loading loop or get dropped from online losing all money you invested in the heist.TLDR This game is great 30 of the time and totally broken and70 of the time. Rockstar, considering how much money they are getting from this, NEED to sort thisout!
