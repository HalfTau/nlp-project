I was never big on the mulitiplayer for this game back when I played on my xbone 360p, but nonetheless this games single player is excelent and will keep you entertained with its living breathing world full of things to keep you busy from watching TV to hunting mythical creatures, Rockstar knows how to pull off a truly amazing game.
