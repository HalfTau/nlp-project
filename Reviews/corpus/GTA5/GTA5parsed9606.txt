I got this game on PS3 back in 2013. I would recommend this game if Rockstar didnt turn it into an insulting money grab. Sure, free DLCs are always appreciated but when the ingame prices of cars are so high youd have to spend like 20 hours farming money on legitimate jobs just to afford ONE car, its quite infuriating. The story mode is maybe one of the greatest Ive played but there is not a lot to do when its over. Dont buy this game if youre not willing to put money online.
