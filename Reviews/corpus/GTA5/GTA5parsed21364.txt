You know, I bought this game in hopes to play with mods. I got a refund because my computer wasnt good enough. Fair. I never had a good gaming computer so there was alwasys too much lag. My fault. When you take away the reason I wanted to play the most, I think Youve gotten to the point where youre so rich off a game you think you can do anything with it and receive no backlash. Yeah, the mods are back. Now tell me this Did they bring back mods because they thought they were wrong or because they got so much hate from fans? Is this any different than when a celebrity says something stupid,  and then goes on a massive apology tour trying to keep their popularity so they stay cool and everyone will still give them money, to keep their lifestyles so wonderful? I dont think it is.
