No longer recommend GTA5 due to the developers and publishers of this game NO longer supporting single player mods, sorry but mods have been a thing in the industry for YEARS and you dont have the right to cease and desist on mods, neither does Nintendo which they did and they will suffer just as much, neither does ANY other dev/publisher, you dont  with the gaming industry AND think/assume you can get away with your t, no Rockstar...not this time...not any time...we are done with your if that means waiting like 3 years to grab RDR2 used thats fine with me, if that means getting Bully 2 like 3 years later used thats fine with me, its not like us gamers dont have other things we can play, you ed up, now your gonna pay for that mistake
