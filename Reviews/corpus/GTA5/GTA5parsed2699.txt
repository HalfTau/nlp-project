Grand Theft Auto VWith all the Dislikes on this game, it was hard to choose between this and a Other game.BUT as usuall, people tend to get butthurt due to certain stuff that does not effect the Main purpose of the game, I really enjoyed the Campaign, I also enjoy Online, Certain thing tip me off, like Bad ping in my Country but im use to it.People are not so toxic and people are mostly chilledIf you like being fisted with a Sticky Bomb up your , then this would surely be your gameThanks Rockstar, keep it up
