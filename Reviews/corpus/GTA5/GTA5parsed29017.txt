Take Two, throwing away years of work by so many modders is incomprehensible and unacceptable.Take Two, go  yourselves.UPDATEHonestly, I really like GTA V for its story mode. The plot is one of my favorite for a GTA game second to Chinatown Wars, Los Stantos really shines, and the driving is my favorite for an open world game. If you want GTA V for its story, I say go get it.However, GTA Online is a cancer on the gaming industry. First of all, its boring, and the activities arent fun. But more importantly, it has fostered a community of prestige, where only the few who are willing to pay get to have much fun not to mention all of the hackers on PC. Paying 50 on a single in game item, on top of the 60 game among other expensive in game purchases is nothing short of unfettered greed on the part of TakeTwo. TakeTwo has also made it clear that all of its future games will plan to have microtransactions, and I can only fear for Red Dead Redemption 2. Rockstar used to come out with a new game every year, but buy the time Red Dead 2 comes out it will have been 5 since its last.  Rockstar also used to make some of the best single player expansions but now only focus on exploiting thier online cash cow, which makes hundreds of millions every year. GTA Online has forever altered Rockstars fate from making good games into extracting as much money from a game as possible, amd that is why GTA Online deserves to die in a fire.
