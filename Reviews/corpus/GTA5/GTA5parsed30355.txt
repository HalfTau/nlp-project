I always have problems playing the game it crashes. I have issues playing single player because rockstar account or social club whatever it is. and recently the publisher has done a huge blow to the single player modding community that makes me want my money back. also this game is a couple years old and still full price for what? less content than it had a year ago now that mods wont work.Edit although after massive neagtive publicity they have reversed thier stance on single player mods, I however could not still recommend this game for more than 20. It was and still is a pretty big dissopointment for me, mods are the only thing that give me any reason to play it rarely but ultimately I stop because of the frustrations I have had.
