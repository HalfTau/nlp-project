Dont buy this game if youre looking forward to the multiplayer. The single player story and missions were great. Online is a different story. In order to get anything like a house or a decent car you have to grind rediculously. Its all made to make you want to spend actual money to get in game money. Its virtualy impossible to get the new doomsday items, or anything nice for that matter, through grinding alone. Meanwhile modders with god mode on are constantly blowing you up with their flying cars with unlimited rockets or just blowing you up on comand. The modders are a HUGE problem. Theres at least one in every session I join. Its a broken paytowin game.
