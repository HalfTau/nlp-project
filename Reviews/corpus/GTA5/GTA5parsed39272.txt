Grand Theft Auto as a game offers quite a bit of fun, but in light of the despotic actions taken by the developers, I cannot reccomend it. While a lot of multiplayer banning was tolerated in the past, the destruction of harmless single player modding is the final straw, I urge everyone to downvote as well.
