If you want the game for the story its mediocre at best I get rockstar were trying to parody old heist movies and Overkills PAYDAY series to an extent but it just comes across as optional sidequests.If you want the game for the online more well, youd better be a big fan of the coined term fee to pay. sure you can make some money by doing the online missions and heists but you wont get access to even half of the available content unless you bend over and present your wallet. it, Im sick of seeing take 2 banned my mods, I banned their income on games that have NOTHING TO DO with GTA 5, Open4, or Rockstar. If you want your ing mods then learn how to make them without breaking EULA, and STOP posting fake reviews for games that have NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM.So despite my hating of this game to its core BEFORE there was a pointless bandwagon for it...  you Im recommending it!
