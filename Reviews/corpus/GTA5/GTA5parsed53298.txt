I was almost about to keep this game. Not even half a minute after I started playing, I heard about the anal intrusion towards the modding community. I cant stress enough how ed this is, because I bought Gta V for xbox 360, and for the xbone and I loved the passion they put into this game, but I wanted it on PC after having a long while and getting bored with it after 4 years. I play WaW on pc for mods, I played Fallout 4 on xbone with mods after the mod support came out, but I was almost about to fall into this deathtrap expecting to be able to use Open IV and experience the game like I was never able to before, because im not a big fan of GTA online, thats why. dons tinfoil hat I feel like this is part of a greater push by AAA developers to drive away singleplayers who they I theorize belive stagnate their cashflow with the payonceandplay set of expectations. Despite what TakeTwo says, no matter what their intentions, this was very beneficial towards their efforts to get more money out of players who have already paid upwards of 180 to catch GTAV on all consoles for different reasons to have them on those platforms. I dont know how theyre gonna do it, but if they dont fix thier problem with the modding community, a very large representation of thier PC playerbase, TakeTwo is gonna make one hell of a skid mark on one of the best sellng games in history.
