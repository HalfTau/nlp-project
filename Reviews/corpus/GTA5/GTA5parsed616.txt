The offline/story portion of the game seems ok but the online element is ruined by certain elements that are a relative minority  but not an insignificant one of the GTA Online community.It could be an excellent online game but until R deal more effectively with the disruptive elements griefers/modders I will be unable to recommend this game to anyone.
