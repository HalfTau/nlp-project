Completed the offline campaign in one sitting, got really boring and repetitive, i preordered the game on pc and later got it on ps4, never got past the second heist because as i said, it is boring and repetitive, making money is riddiculously slow and everything is so expensive, you would need to complete all the heists just to get a single high end car, which leads me into the biggest point, this game is 100 P2W, i dont care what anyone says.Also, if i got a cent for every 10 year old brat with team masked outfit and a black and green zentorno or kuruma, i would have the money to buy the game again, which still stands at the overpriced release price ater 3 years, it was literally cheaper to preorder it and get 500k free online cash. smh wish i never bought this game, neither on pc or ps4.
