GTA V is  a great single player game, but if you live in israel, do not buy it from steam!Right now its priced at 350 NIS which, converted to USD, accumulates to 102 !!!!! for the base game which came out more than 2 years ago! which is insane!this is all due to the pricing localisation the store has andergone undergone in the past week.
