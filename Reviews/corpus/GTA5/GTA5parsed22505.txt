Take Two and Rockstar have ruined this game for me and many other people. With modding gone, the game has no future replayablility. They arent worried about hackers, they are worried about thecash cow of GTA Online that they keep milking. With single player mods gone, this wont be a game like GTA 4 where 3 or 4 years from now the mods will make this game replayable, it will just be a game that sits in your steam library until the end of time. Rockstar better get theirtogether. We as a community need to rise against such a tyrant. I have lost all trust and faith in Rockstar and Take Two and will no longer be supporting their games, I hope you do the same.EDIT Open IV is back, I love this game again
