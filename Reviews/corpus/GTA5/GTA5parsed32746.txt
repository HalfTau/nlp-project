I never do  this but I am giving this a bad review. The only reason I and anyone else on here bought this game on PC was for the mods. There is absolutely no reason to remove them. It is COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE to cheat online. If you have one small file out of place or modded even the most unimportant one they will automatically detect it and prevent you from playing online. Maybe if rockstar didnt have to rely on shark cards being bought from their  new online conent people wouldnt have to mod the game to make it fun. And the mods are all for single player. But I guess they want people to spend money on their shark cards instead
