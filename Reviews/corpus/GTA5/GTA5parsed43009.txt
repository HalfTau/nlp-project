These people keep getting more and more greedy. The ingame microtransactions are honestly absurd in terms of price, and now with this whole fiasco involving OpenIV, Cmon how greedy can you get. They obviously have done things not only legally but with the well being of the game in mind, in order to expand the experience this game has already 100 provided. So Take Two Interactive, please get your heads out of your asses and start improving the game/servers yourself instead of adding another P.O.S update, just to get more money out of people that bought this already expensive game. And stop harassing a company that only had good intentions.
