This game was great on PC thanks to mods. For multiplatform gamers that already had this game, mods were the main reason for getting the PC version. Thanks to Take Twos policy on cracking down on mods I would NOT RECOMMEND. Also, nobody can ensure that they will not push any more anticonsumer practices and microtransactions.
