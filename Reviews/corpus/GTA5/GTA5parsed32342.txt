I used to like GTA 5. I used to like it a lot.Even though I haddnt played its multiplayer I was still thinking of having a go. now I wont though. now I wont play it anymore at all or buy any future rockstar games even though I was really looking forwards to Red dead redemtion 2.Why? because take 2, the companny in charge of rockstar games has banned modding in the game. in SINGLE PLAYER.they apparently done this because the modding software was sometimes used by hackers in GTA online to cheat. Thats the key word though SOMETIMES.Not all the time and not by everyone.why ban every single player from using mods in single player just because of a few bad people? its a tottaly stupid move and its why im going on a boycot against Take 2.the reason why Take 2 did this was because of shark cards. little micro transactions that allow you to buy more in game money in GTA online for real life cash.The problem Take 2 has though, is that people cheating in GTA online have no reason to buy shark cards since they can spawn in more money.So to wrap it all up this why Im quitting gta 5. Im not ok with playing a game that sqaushes my creative freedom for such a stupid reason.
