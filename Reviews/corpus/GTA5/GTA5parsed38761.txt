TakeTwo moments of silence for the modding community, the machinima creators and ultimately the harmless player who wanted to have one of the greatest funs on Steam and now, no longer can.Edit Now take SEVERAL ing moments for the modding community to never get over the fact that WE WERE WRONGED BY THE BIG GUY!! even though virtually everythings back to normal.Thank you, Rockstar for correcting the mistake.And seriously, the bitter, unapologetic, GTA V is boring once you 100 the game section of the modding community, get over it you are ALL going to forget this T2 thing happened once RDR2 hits the market.A pity, that the one time you felt validation in your lives was when your play time was interrupted by daddy.TLDR GTA Vs modding is back and theres no reason for not buying the game now if you love ACTUALLY PLAYING THE GAME.
