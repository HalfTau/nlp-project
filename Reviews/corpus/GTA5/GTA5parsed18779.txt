The online gameplay has become too tedious to play, with the new online only DLC it makes it hard to buy any of the products in game without buying a shark card especially if Rockstar takes your money away and you have to start from scratch. the missions you play online to earn cash can be fun at first then they get repetitive and have such low payouts. the game also makes it hard for new players to have a chance of being successful in the online community because of the gap that is made when older players have a tank and a player just starting has a 9mm and cant get anything done due to them being killed about every 5 seconds.Recently my progress in my online business has been repeatedly reset product missing making it even harder to earn money.EditI have altogether stopped playing GTA online, but I have found new life in single player.  I have started to play with SINGLE PLAYER mods such as LSPDFR. It is a great way to still have fun in single player as well as bring some new and online content to single player such as the new vehicles.Funnily enough I went on online today fully expecting my money to be gone because while I had mods in my game directory, I accidentally tried to log into online because of some inconvenient key binding only to notice all my online money was still there furthering my beliefs in Rockstars corruption.I want to make this absolutely clear I HAVE NEVER CHEATED IN AN ONLINE LOBBY.
