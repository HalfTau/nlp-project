Singleplayer is the objectively greatest experience ever. Tight driving, well made characters, nice gunplay, extremely well developed world. The PC version has extremely iffy flight controls, but its doable once you figure it out.Multiplayer is a complete cluster with servers worse than Ubisofts. Ive played multi for 4 hours. Ive been forced out of, randomly dropped from and sometimes forcibly had to leave at least 12 times already. Fix your servers.
