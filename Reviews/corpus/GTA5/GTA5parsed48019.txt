People are angry about mods but the only part of this game worth playing is Online, which isnt effected by the mods decision anyway.I think its a great game and the internet hive mind needs to cool its roll.The DLC cars and missions are great, theres tons to do, and a million ways to do everything. Pretty much everything you own is within easy reach.Downsides are the price gouging that Rockstar seems obsessed with online, New cars costing many millions of dollars just to lure you into buying Shark Cardsdont.Overall 8/10.
