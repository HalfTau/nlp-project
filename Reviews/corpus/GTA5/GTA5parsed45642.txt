The singleplayer experience in this game is probably the first or second best of all GTA games so far. The problem is, there have been no expansions for the storyline. For this game all additional content has been focused on the online, which I personally find awful. A lot of people like GTA online, but I dont understand why. They made griefing other players in the overworld super easy so its pratically mandatory that you walk around in passive mode so other plays dont kill you repeatedly with the tank or fighter jets that they paid 50 in real world money to get. The missions are very repetetive and boring. Its disappointing. They also banned mods in singleplayer recently, so not only are they determined to avoid expanding the singleplayer experience, they want to make sure no one else does it either.
