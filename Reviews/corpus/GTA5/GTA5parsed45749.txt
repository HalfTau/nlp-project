Take Two, the publishers of GTA 5, have recently decided to shut down a big part of the modding community, which for me was a huge reason for playing this game. I havent touched the game since. Take Two would rather destroy the experience to make money in the short term, rather than providing a what once was an awesome game.Dont support this sy way of treating a community. Dont buy this game.
