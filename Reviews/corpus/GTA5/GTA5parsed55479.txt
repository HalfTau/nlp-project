I originally bought this game for the Xbox 360 on September 17, 2013. I started my online character on October 1, 2013. I bought the game again on April 14, 2015 for the PC. I have sunk a lot of time into this game, across multiple platforms. Ive had a lot of fun, and very frustrating times with this game. I do not regret the time I have put into this game. It was far from perfect, but it was still a good game. I was ok with how Rockstar introduced microtransactions. They gave everyone access to the dlc for free, but you had to either pay real money or grind a lot of missions to be able to own the content. Unfortunately, microtransactions are here to stay and this was a more palatable way to introduce them. I feel that this method was implemented improperly though. They priced the new content extremely high and kept the mission payouts low, so modders felt the need to help everyone. Modders runined the online community by giving out large sums of money to players. So to keep up with this, you either had to pay more real money, grind more missions, or become a cheater by accepting this money.I decided to say  online and went back to single player. I wanted to spice things up with LSPDFR. I had a lot of fun, and there were a ton of different car skins. I have had a lot of fun with it. Im not leaving a salty review because to kid blew up my drugs with a Hydra. Im leaving a salty review because of what TakeTwo did.  you TakeTwo.EDITSign this petition
