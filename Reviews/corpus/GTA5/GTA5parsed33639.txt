Hacker dropped money bags on me while I was away from monitor, was punished after a few hours. Acumulated a substantial amount of money just standing there..  Rockstar went ahead and categorized me as a hacker so my actual hard earned money and RP was completely reset. Im talking my entire account reset! Back to square one and Ive been playing that profile since GTAV came out on ps3. I was up to level 140 with a few million, a high end apartment, and a clubhouse venturing into the lucrative businesses in the dark web. Since this wipe happened I have completely gave up on GTAV Online because its a little traumatizing to go through a character wipe like that especially when you have done nothing besides grind and take advantage of double rp and  missions.I do not recommend this game.
