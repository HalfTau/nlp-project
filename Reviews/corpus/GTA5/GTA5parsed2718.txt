Honestly, single player is worth it if you can pick up the game on a sale. Online is trash. Utter trash. If you are a casual gamer plan on spending hundreds in real world  just so you can enjoy the latest content which is never THAT good. Online used to be amazing and well balanced, but Rockstar fed it up so bad.
