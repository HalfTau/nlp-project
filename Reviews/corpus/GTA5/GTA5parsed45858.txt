The Game has a great Strory, insane Graphics and really good controls.But the Online Mode keeps getting badder since everything good is really expensivepeople began to mod the game and give money for free.Since the last update tho rockstar banned those modders and now the Online Mode is an endless Grind.Just because Rockstar wants to sell ingame currency.To Rockstar Sell games, not currencyThank you
