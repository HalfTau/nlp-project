THIS REVIEW IS ONLY APPLICABLE FOR GTA ONLINEIt was quite astounding at first, with heists, missions, many vehicle races, great and interactive open world with full of things to do.Characters has lots of great customizationsE.G. clothes/costumes. There are many options to customize your vehicles as well. Rockstar brings out free updates regularly and very often, which is good.But as you progress, you will realize that its totally a Pay 2 Win game that rockstar made to suck up lots of money into their pockets. You will always need to pay a lot to buy any property or vehiclesweaponized, sports, super cars, every upcoming updates releases very expensive content. The recent Doomsday Heist vehicles costs at least a million GTA and some even goes up to 6 million GTA, without even any customization at all. The IAA Facility from Doomsday Heist also has a ridiculously expensive cost if you want to customize some parts.This game has enormous potential to become the biggest and most played open world game but Rockstar is putting out too much expensive content and it became a pay 2 win game. This game is unfair to many players that does not have extra real money to cash in and have fun. I hope that Rockstar would change a bit, maybe give out real free content for all players to enjoy or give out a higher amount of free money regularly so that new players or poor players can enjoy paid content like weaponized vehicles and properties without the need to cash in a lot of real money into it.
