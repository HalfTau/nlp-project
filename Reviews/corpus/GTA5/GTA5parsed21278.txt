If you have someone to play this with and think shark cards are good value compared to other forms of entertainment in life, go for it. If you play solo and do not want to buy shark cards, avoid this like the plague. If you have never played the single player, thats worth 60, honestly. Anywhere in between, flip a coin.Notes if you jump in online as a noob with a preloaded shark cardFirst car Karin Karuma armoured if you are a returning player and can get Duke O Death for free do that instead. Maybe wait until you can get the Insurgent. Thats it. Dont consider any other cars. Period.First Apartment 200k Del Pierro Heights. Thats it. Dont look at anything else. DO NOT BUY A STILT APARTMENT FOR THE LOVE OF ANYTHING WORSHIPPABLE!Buy all the clothes and guns you want. No Issues. Note homing rockets are very expensive so dont use it not even in missions, maybe heists unless someone pisses you off. Ive been there, was worth it.If you start with the 3.5M card get 1m CEO office absolutely do not consider a more expensive one  Buzzard Attack Chopper.Dont be tempted to buy anything else until you watch some YouYube videos on the content. Just because it is expensive does not mean it is better, good, or worth it.No need to thank me. Enjoy.
