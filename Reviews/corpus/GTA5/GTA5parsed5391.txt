Prepare to spend around 100 to actually get into the game if you buy for half off atdot com at this point as youve missed three expansions that all required massive time investments or buyin. All fun content is locked behind needing to buy warehouses or hangers to store the cool vehicles. The game is terribly balanced due to these cash grabs, and absolutely nothing is being done about the hackers in every game.The ui bloat is a terrible mess and they did a crappy job of pushing open world content. Its hard to figure out what to do any any given point in time and the player base is split between newer open world stuff and launch day instanced missions.Finally the net code is an absoluteshow. Connecting to a single online game can take 510 minutes. There are also random disconnects going from instanced content back to open world. Its ten times worse with friends. The amount of bugs that require joining new instances make all of this even worse.Once everything does come together in an open world mission where players actually have a back and forth instead of one obliterating the other, its a fun game. Happens about 5 of the time though. Multiplayer was clearly an afterthougth cash grab, which sucks.
