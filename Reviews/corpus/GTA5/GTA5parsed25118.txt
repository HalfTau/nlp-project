I dont know exactly why they banned modding, however, its such a mundane thing to lead to such bad reviews.Now, you guys are expressing your feelings, and I guess it seems to work a little bit, however, I Take Two also has every right to do what they want.These ratings are a little damaging to the game as a, well, game. I have played San Andreas unmodded as well as many other games, and GTA V on its own is a fine experience. When I usually buy a game, I look at the ratings, and if theyre low I usually assume a bad port or a very buggy game. This game just has no mods or whatever.
