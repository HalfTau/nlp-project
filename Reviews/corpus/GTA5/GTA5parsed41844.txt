GTA Online and Take Two interactive are the reasons this game is dead to me.The obvious moneyhungry moves made by TakeTwo are specifically designed to  as much money as possible from GTA Online, whilst leaving the obiously less lucrative SP with half of Onlines content despite nearly all of it being able to be accessed through the use of trainers. Obvious greeddriven decisions from both dev and publisher have lead to player creativity and freedom with the game to be slowly and slowly obliterated, and now with the absolutely silly CD of OpenIV I will be happy to say that I will not buy another game published by TakeTwo again.Cheers for anticonsumerism.EDIT And also, taking a F2P model in a game most people paid twice for is downright shameful.
