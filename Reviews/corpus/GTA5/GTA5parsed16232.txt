Almost all of the free DLC is only online and costs millions of ingame money, and pretty much the only way to make that money is through shark cards, which cost real money. I wish that they would make all of the DLC available for story mode too, so that I dont have to pay real money to play them and risk getting my money purged from my account afterwards.
