I have been modding GTA since probably the year 1999. I used to design my own 2D cars in top down view and import them into the game.I modded GTA 3. I modded Vice City. I modded San Andreas. And you better bet I modded GTA IV. I put a Delorean in GTA IV, and I made it super fast, and super heavy, and super strong, and I would barrell down traffic like an unstoppable object.I used to spend hours on the forums of, which had some kind of official support. All the GTA 3 era games had simple handling files that anyone could tinker with, adding hours of fun and enjoyment to the game.I have bought multiple copies of the same GTA game for multiple platforms. I bought Vice City for PS2 and PC. I modded Vice City so that it had the map of Liberty City from GTA 3, but you had motorcycles and helicopters.I have always loved the GTA series because it is the ultimate sandbox game. This is your core fanbase, your hardcore fans. The DLC and online was okay, but it was mostly annoying. Do I enjoy playing online with people? Yes, sometimes.Would I rather have a whole new game? Yes, most definitely. Am I going to put up with an online system that is, overall, just kind of really annoying? Not for long.Rockstar Games used to be the best. Solid quality, period. Now you are taking the cheap, easy, screwthecustomer route. Lots of game companies do that nowadays. I dont play those games either.
