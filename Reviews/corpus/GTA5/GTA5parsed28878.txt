GTA Online is an awful cashgrab, everything you do costs immense amounts of money. Ingame activities dont pay enough. Everything you do is made to sell more Shark Cards. Really, 3,5 mil. car equals to 38 Shark card, what the  R? And dont get me started at this games 12 year old community...I wasted my money on this game, dont do the same.
