Ive put a few hours into this game, and after the first wipe of money with the gunrunning dlc rollout i understood. The message was loud and clear, Dont cheat, Dont get money in game from modders. I listened, in about 68 hours i played to grind up over a million to try and get some of the new vehicles, but no. Rockstar decides its going to rollout another money wipe and take away hours of work in game grinding. Will not continue to play this game as of now. Maybe when rockstar stops moderating GTAV servers i will start having fun in game again. But until then rockstar has let me down.
