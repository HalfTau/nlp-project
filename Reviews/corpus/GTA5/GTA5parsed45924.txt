Have always played the GTA series for its single player content. Couldnt care less about its online component yet Take Twos draconian laws prohibiting user made content has made me unable to enjoy this game as id like to anymore. Its nothing but a transparent attempt to monetize every aspect of this now 2013 release. I cant recommend this game.
