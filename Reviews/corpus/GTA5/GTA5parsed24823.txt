I dont have this game for PC, but I do play over my PS4 and Xbox one. Sadly, I was going to get this game for my PC during the steam sales, but the biggest selling point was the modding capability of the single player. Sadly, This is no longer a thing because of the recent issues regarding take two. Im not recommending this game to anyone. Online is just crap because of  hole players so dont bother wasting your money.
