The game itself is a good port. Runs well on modern machines. Once you complete it however, it becomes rather..well all the same stuff. Online, is not for me. Its full of trolls and angry gamers just looking out to destroy your car or kill ya when they can. Sure RS has done what they can to stop the negativity but, its just not that fun.Recently, Take Two, the publisher ticked off the entire modding community by threatening legally the OpenIV team. Many of us were ticked and the backlash/outcry put over 50k negative reviews about the game.I was one of those people. It felt like a stab in the back. Modders were not the problem, its the few jerk hackers out there, that just had to mess with the online part. Rockstar worked with the publisher to get them to relax some, so hopefully mods return soon.Final note? The single player campain is great. Challenging, fun and the story is fantastic. The online part, while kinda fun for me, ended up on a sour note due to hackers plus just outright rude nasty toxic players. Its worth the money in the long run but, well ill be very wary of Take Two from this point on.
