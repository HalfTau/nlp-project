Everyone complains about how money hungry Rockstar is. And they arent even close to wrong. But 90 of games you enter you can find a hacker to generally give you free money granted you arent begging or just anhat. The game is overall fun, certainly more fun with a squad of friends. Id recommend but probably only on sale
