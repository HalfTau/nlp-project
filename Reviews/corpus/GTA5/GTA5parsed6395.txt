Its solid and has its moments. Certainly not a lack of missions,BUT the SP story is pitiful worst ending since ME 3 , a lot of stuff that made VC and SA great arent present, and the online mode changed to a monetizing free to play style business model.There are so many paywalls that people rather consider paying for stuff i.e. the heist requirements with real cash. Let me say this Take2 and Rockstar got greedy. Buying this game full price or even 30 bucks makes you support their way of doing things. Wait until its like 10 Dollars or something. All the stuff they put into this game doesnt justify their moves they made. They need to learn a lesson. VC and SA were pirated a lot , GTA 4 a lot less and GTA 5 even lesser. People pirate a game cause you have to convince them with a great story and content. The less thex do that the more trust,  or lets say addiction they are addicted to it. What I am saying is, if GTA VC and SA are the unique giving samaritans, then GTA V is the greedy friend that you stick to for no reason.  It leaves a quick and stress relieving feeling but a bad one none the less.Trust Total BuisquitCynical Brits review and you are going to be fine. I am a hypocrite. I bought it for 30 bucks despktd reading about the qualities it lacked. Just couldnt believe it. Dont be the same fool like me.
