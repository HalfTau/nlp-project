Unfortunately, Rockstar cant tell the difference between reasonable ingame prices and straight up ripping you off.I had high hopes for the game when I heard about heists and races, and I did enjoy it.Until the game started with the offices and biker hangouts. Ever since then, the game has gone downhill by adding supernatural vehicles like Rocketmounted cars and bikes costing about 48 million dollars each.The game has also attempted to make OpenIV a modding tool, used primairly in singleplayer and private lobbies illegal for whatever reason. Of course, its been resolved now, but it caused an outrage bigger than PAYDAY 2s Crimefest 2.Oh, and Rockstar cant tell the difference between someone who is farming a mission way too hard to get money and RP and a cheater, so thats nice.
