I just spend some hours to find out how to play this gmae purely offline in Single Player. Apparently you have to install a crack onto your legit copy to be able to do so. WTF, Rockstar?! ?Forcing legit owners their legit copy just to be able to play?Work / Family doesnt leave me enough time to also deal with this BS!I really regret buying this game
