Been playing GTA for years now and Im glad I can finally put this game behind me. Single player was a lot fun but, all development is focused on multiplay. Which is fine if it wasnt for all the Modders/Hackers. People talk about wanting mods for games, To do what? They give you some innocent perfectly legit reason for a game to have mods. What ever good comes from the modding community is over shadowed by the sheer number of people that make it a point to ruin the game for everyone else. So...1 Im done having to leave a session because a modder is god killing everyone in the lobby.2 Im done losing money because some modder is ruining everything in the session.3 Im done hoping Rockstar will take responsibilty and fix this probelm. Which Ive been told that its not Rockstars problem Its my fault and I should just join another session when there are cheaters.4 Im done with all the excuses.5 Im done with the drip feed, cash grab, and underhanded tactics.The genre has been run into the ground and I dont care if there is another GTA or anything else coming from Rockstar. Im putting this game and everyone invovled to rest. There plenty of other games and developers doing more and striving to be better. Im done .
