Another legend about to become out of touch with the fans, disregarding the right thing to do. Ive had hours upon hours upon hours of fun with each installment of GTA over the years, but the future is less than promising. Luckily I was already mad at them for making RDR2 console exclusive.I will admit though, shooting themselves in the leg is a pretty Rockstar thing to do.
