Singleplayer is great, multiplayer is a pay to win hell. Only play online if you have a few friends to play with you, otherwise you are stuck with spoiled 12 year olds with overpowered t. Since Rockstar loves to focus only on the cash grab multiplayer then ill do the same and drop this negative review until they wisen up.
