One of my favorite games when it came out on Xbox 360. First and only game i preordered for PC and i bought a Xbox One controller to play it. Countless hours of run and gun from the cops and just drive the vast selection of cars I had. Sadly the only thing you see now in the game is hackers and vehicles you cant afford. The community for this game is a fraction of what it once was and thats what makes me sad. 9/10 Big dog, Big nuts Lamar
