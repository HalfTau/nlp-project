So....OpenIV has been saved.I think its a good enough reason to change the reviews.For an actual review,the story is good for the first time then gets boring quicklyThen you should mod the game to make it more fun.Online....well it can be 3 things1.A grindfest.2.Buy some stuff because you bought shark cards.3.Buy everything you want because a modder gave you moneyI am not encourageing anyone to hack,just telling the truth.
