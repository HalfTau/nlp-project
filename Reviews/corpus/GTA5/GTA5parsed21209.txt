Take Two Interactive and theyre scummy business practices have put a knife deep in the back of a loyal community of gamers dedicated to this series. a comminity of which that keeps these games alive and kicking well after theyre AAA sales hit peak bottoms on console ports because there is nothing left to offer players there. i dont know if thats their way of punishing PC community to accomodate other gamers but either way they are successfully alienating a base of players they shouldnt be and well i dont feel the least bit bad for them. they have lost a customer for good and i dont care if their next game is the 2nd coming of christ.GTFOH with that BS.
