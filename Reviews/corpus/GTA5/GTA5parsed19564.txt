So I happily played this game on PS4 with zero problems and considered GTA 5 one of the best games I ever saw.. so now I decided to buy it for PC for better graphics and maybe some mods..Experience begins with social club which I really dont need.. then I see lagging like a hell mouse in options menu, options autochange without my actions or reset to something i dont change and constantly ask to restart application for applying. This is basically first in my long gaming carrer when game treat me like this, though Im ITspecialist and no noob at all..So if you have console version, dont buy PCport, its just a mess..
