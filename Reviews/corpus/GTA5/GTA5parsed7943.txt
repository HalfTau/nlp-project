I played GTA V on ps3 and for a short time on ps4 and I havent been playing since then. I see that the game changed a lot. It has so many new features and better gameplay. There are more things to do when you get bored. Played 70 hours now, mostly online and Im having great time still. It has a long loading screen but the game needs time to render the map because It has a great map so I think Its not a big deal. Even though some other players says that the game is dead or Its full of hackers There are lots of hackers but you can change your session.. I recommend it to everyone, especially people who likes casual gaming. If you have 23 friends you should follow sales and buy together while its in discount. You will have fun 100 with friends. And I personally have fun when I play solo online.The ones who are having trouble joining only late. You guys should open story mode first then join online session. Its faster believe me
