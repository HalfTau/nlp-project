Honestly its the first time that i write a negative review. But enough is enough.After TakeTwo couldnt handle the cheaters, they just banned ALL mods and modders and nearlyeverything that made the game as great as it was. This is the most consumer unfriendly behavior that i have ever seen in the gaming industry. So many people put so much effort hours and years into modding and mods, just to see everything destroyed over night by TakeTwo.I will never buy anything again from TakeTwo. I will never advise anyone these companys in any ways. Iam angry as .Good thing I will now join the GTA cheater community and will have fun destroying this game. Iam done.old school hacks and google is your friend. If anyone wants to ALOT of money in GTA, write me.Funfact you only get banned for a week or so after you get caught the first time... so lets go rampage.EDITNow they have allowed OpenIV again. But still this company is shady and not consumer friendly at all. I stay with this review. They are evil. Dont give evil people your money.
