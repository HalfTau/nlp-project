GTA ONLINEI started playing Grand theft auto on my playstation 3 when the game first game out and it was a fun sandbox to play with friends then i switched to ps4 where a good amount of content was enjoyable but since last year this game has turned from a fun sandbox to EA 2.0. The amount of needs for microtransactions just to play with the new things in a dlc is  and you can barely make a profit grinding in this game if you have school/job. Thus many people have gotten smart and bought mod menus and accounts on PC just to enjoy a dlc. The major problem comes with the players who just want to play the game legit because the game gets stale after around 6 hours of grinding just to have enough money to buy a ok car. But then the new dlc makes the game even worse if you start the heist and pay around 300k just to startup the heist and you pay your crew a fare amount of money YOU LOSE MONEY! This game is horrible and to be honest dont buy it if you want to keep your sanity.THE STORY MODE It is a blast to play and one of the best in the Grand Theft Auto Series but honestly no one anymore plays the games single player because all the new stuff is in GTA Online.So i believe we should stop playing the game to standup to rockstar and prove we are strong like what we did to EA with battlefront 2
