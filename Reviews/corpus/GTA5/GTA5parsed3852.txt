Looks amazing on Ultra in pc as expected and really smooth compared to Console. Though I do recommend using a controller of some sort as flying in this game with the key board and mouse is pretty horrendous. Everything else and pretty doable with keyboard and mouse. With all this being said I would definitely recommend this to all my friends. Oh and btw if your going to buy Gta 5 anytime soon, just letting you know that you can no longer transfer accounts as of March 2017 and from then on.
