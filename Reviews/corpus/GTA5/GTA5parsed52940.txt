I still do not recommend this game. Even after the whole mod fiasco, I dont.ONLINE Its been a grind  from the start. To even get a car and modify it, itll cost you big. Shark Cards are too overpriced too. Almost a hundred dollars for eight mil that barely buys you a yacht. No wonder people hack theout of it. Their anticheat bans innocent people for just playing the game and even if they try to talk to support for it, it wont ever help. Children are all over, and youll probably get kicked from heists if youre low level by the most toxic of players. Two thumbs down and a blown raspberry to that.SINGLEPLAYER  CAMPAIGN If you are considering buying GTA V for SP mods, Id suggest it. Personally, the campaign was a little slow for me looking back, and also quite grind like again. Ive played it fully through on XB 360 and then some Money in the SP is a bit easier to get, but of course half of the stuff that is actually fun is on the online.Unrelated to gameplay, but the graphics are pretty awesome if youre able to afford a good titan of a PC, but even mine Cyberpower Thermaltake with a 1060 GTX slugs with FPS on recommended settings.OVERALL Unless youre buying this for the first time, or buying it for mods, I dont suggest buying it for full price. And even at that, dont buy it for full price at all. Buy when sales come on or maybe a third party. Online is crappy on many points, and Singleplayer depends on the players style and mindset. A solid 7.5/10 from me.
