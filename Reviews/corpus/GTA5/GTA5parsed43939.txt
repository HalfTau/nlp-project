I never played the Online version, only the single player, so YMMV.That being said, it was a good game without modding and a great game with it.  Until recently, I would have also added some suggestions of mods that really make the game more enjoyable to play and improve the replayability.  However, when they decided to kill the modding, I uninstalled the game, and as long as the parent company acts out against their community, I will not purchase any more of their games or play any of their games that I already own sorry KSP.The only way company executives learn how to treat their customers and communites correctly is when the people impact the only thing those insensitive clods care about, money.  While it is true they werent gettng any more money from me through GTAV, but now they wont get any more of my money...
