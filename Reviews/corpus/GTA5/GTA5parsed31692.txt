I have to say the story of GTA 5 is great and fun to play. Now going to online ... its a mess. There is like 4 Heists that is worse then GTA 5 sigle player.The banning of modding in GTA 5 is the most negetive thing i can think of. How does the modding my Single player experiace can brake the other people ONLINE experiance?
