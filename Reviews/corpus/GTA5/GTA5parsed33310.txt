Great game that got screwed over by terrible business practices. Cease and desist letters threatening to sue modders, violently tearing a tremendous amount of value in the game with legal acton? GO FCK yourself Rockstar and TakeTwo, this is unacceptable and greedy especially on a game you guys have made billions of dollars on.
