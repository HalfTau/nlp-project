u will start workin whole day for money in an artificial world. thats whats fun about the game and thats also how itup ur real life....plus shooting contents are not good enough, bullet doesnt drop u can use pistol as sniper, no prone and crouchin position,also not friendly to new solo players. heist jobs, as the most important part has to be done with multiple players most time mixed with guys fresher than u who alwaysthing up and experienced guys who  would kick u out or quit job as u cant work togrther. no hints, only a brief introduction with npc who always has loads of t. hardcore sonetimes. i would love to try it lot times but its hard to organize a heist when u are new.gta is an excellent game, but it needs improvement and advice to be better.
