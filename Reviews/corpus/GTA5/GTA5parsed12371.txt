Finished the campaign for the 8th time, 3 times on PS3, 3 times on PS4, once on XBOX ONE and once on PC. The grapichs on PC are so much better then PS4 and XBOX ONE. unfortantly you cant transfer your GTA ONLINE character from PS4 to PC anymore  because ive worked so hard and long on my GTA ONLINE character and now i cant enjoy it on the PC master race anymore
