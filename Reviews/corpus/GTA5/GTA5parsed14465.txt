I have this game on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC and yet today I received a permanent ban on PC with no way of appealling.I have worked extremely hard to get the money that I had earned ingame, saving each and every dollar I earned to buy a hangar, an office and the garages that go with it.Whenever there has been discussion regarding modding/money drops/cheats/hacks etc I have gone straight to Find New Session regardless of what I was doing at the time even if I was in a mission. I have been banned previously, even on console I was accused by Rockstar of modding yet this was not possible.I do not understand how or why this has happened as Rockstar would be able to look at someones account and see exactly what has been done, if not then their system is flawed because every other developer with a multiplayer aspect to their game can see what someone has done....I have continued to support Rockstar Games for many years and would not want my account associated with any kind of cheating. I dont even use Single Player mods which includes the many vehicles, trainers and other things that change the game entirely.I have now uninstalled the game and if you are reading this and thinking about playing the game legitimately then by all means go ahead and do that but you will be banned so you best look for some of those modding menus that all the cool kids seem to be able to use spoiling everyone elses fun.....it seems to be the only way to remain unbanned.
