Single player is fun, multiplayer is fun with friends but its a money pit for all the DLC. All in all a pretty good experience, and this controversey over OpenIV is stupid. Rockstar is protecting their IP, which they legally can do. All these attacks against Rockstar is a good reason for them to not port Red Dead Redemption 2, which is what I dont want. Also yes I know that OpenIV was mainly used for singleplayer mods, but come on.
