Whats left to be said about this game? Great, mindless fun. Easy to jump in, and lose hours. Its not the 3rd bestselling game of all time for nothing.  That being said, ive hardly even played this game. Because i played it so much on console already. But that aside, id always reccomend GTA VIts a massive storage hog though.
