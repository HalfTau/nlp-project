This game is really good, but people on the online mode need to learn that some people just want to earn money through missions, and that killing them just for existing is super pointless. If you like the controls and graphics, I would stick to story mode. Its a fun challenge. Otherwise, i would wait till a friend gets online so you at least have some protection. Obviously youre always going to have someone online who targets you for literally no reason, but oh my god! s am i right?
