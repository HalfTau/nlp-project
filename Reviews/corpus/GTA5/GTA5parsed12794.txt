Single player main story is very short.. not hard at all.. i expected more.The map issint that big either u cant enter much buildings wich i expected because thats what everyone wanted after the previous GTA games.Okay the looks are better but thats all.. the map is not bigger than san andreas wich is 10 year older or something.Expected more for the single player.
