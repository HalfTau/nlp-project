It was fun for awhile but then got a massive hacker problem as well as other problems with content releases. Removing private player instances for example forced me to play with said hackers, public gameplay became impossible and it was just a mess over all.They fixed the private game instances, but buy then me and my friends had moved on. We considered coming back with the new updates but then they had the audacity to blame the PC modding community for their failure to combat online hacking and to further blame them for causing bad sales.Bad sales. On a game that made them a LOT of money.TLDR The net coding is garbage, it constantly lags out and if you disconnect during a match/game you cannot reconnect to get mission credit. This makes heists impossible to play especially the long ones. Overall, its a good fun game to throw away on the pile after you play through singleplayer though.Id not reccomend it unless its massively discounted.
