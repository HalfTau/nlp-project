After 1.500 hours on PlayStation, around 50 hours here, I  pretty sure can say that you all should stop giving those fagots called Rockstar money. They dont give you anything back. The last profitable DLC was back in 2015, which was the Heist Update, since then everyone waited for them, to finally make new heists, because they were fun, the only reliable method to get some money while actually playing the game and not just waiting for a stupid bar to fill up. Now we got it and its BS, of course you cant start the Heist like youd actually do, you have to buy another building, I guess you wont earn anything above 1.5 Million if that isnt already too much and the best thing is, you have to do almost everything in an open lobby. The prices for the new vehicles etc. are probably far behind humane. They wont even set the ingame money for sharkcards higher, Im glad Ive never bought one.Graphics 8/10money grabbing 11/10fun in multiplayer went slowly after timeno fcks given about the customers oh yeshackers and cheaters? plenty
