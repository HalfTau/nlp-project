Was and still is an incredible game, but when you ban something that has made this game thrive for years knowing that it will cause chaos. Well, thats just a low blow Take2, one of the worst possible things you could have done to your games. Knowing that there are people who only play this game for the mods because not everyone has that speedy connection for online, its just a dog act.RIPOPENIV
