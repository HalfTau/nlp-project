With the Mod menu finally being taken down, let me back up and explain my position. I am all for mods when it doesnt effect someone elses game. If it is only being used in single player, its great, you are only effecting yourself and enjoying the random mods like becoming the hulk, or magneto random stuff like that. When you bring the Mods onto the online, you are having fun, but for those who dont want the mods you are ruining the game for those players.Now with the Mods having a heavy crackdown on the players who use them the game is starting to proceed again in the GTA fashion that we remember, blowing stuff up on even playing grounds, Rank actually being used to the advantage in which it is supposed to rather than this rank 3 with a CEO/MC and MOC and flying around with a Hydra blowing everything up. Clearly not earning their equipment and exploiting their gifts making those who have invested their time into this game seem not as fun or desirable to play.This game is amazing, it carries its same GTA vibe since GTA 3, get in cars, blow stuff up, jump off stuff, range of weapons. If you are a GTA fan, this is still the great game you fell in love with all those years ago, but with a twist, thanks to the people buying shark cards, free DLC/ UPDATES to the game adding new content. Just a shout out, you dont see new content free in a game anymore, you can just look at Destiny as a prime example of that, along with many others. This is not a rant, i enjoy this game as you can see i have played quite a bit and the new MOC add on is amazing with its new range of vehicles and its new weapon modifications, bringing a new twist on the old obsolete weapons.
