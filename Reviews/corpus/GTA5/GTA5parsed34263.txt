GTA V is a great game. It has a lot of gameplay potential even after almost 4 years. Well, at least it had with the community mods that made it even more fun. Now that they essentially banned mods the game will lose most of its charm. This is unacceptable after not receiving ANY single player content after release. This is shameful.UPDATE Its still being updated after 4 years.
