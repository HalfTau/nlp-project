GTA V is a well made game and very fun. That being said, Rockstar has become a prime example of the satirical, superficial America it portrays in its game. The PaytoWin/Paytohavemaximumfun marketing strategies as well as the recent removal of mods support for single player and overall antimodding attitude taken by Rockstar and Take Two Interactive has made this game as well as the companies a shadow of their former self.
