TLDR Rockstar is pulling a Bethesda with GTAV ModsThat may be what spurred me to submit this review, but thats not the only thing wrong with GTAVIn shortShark CardsAbsolutely abhorring modding of the game, in both MP AND SP, while essentially giving hackers a free pass on ing with you online by not implementing a proper antihack tool/system for the game.Ignoring Single player DLC. After GTA IV having brought substantial SP DLC to the GTA line, It would have been amazing to see what SP DLC could have been made for GTA V The most well polished GTA game to date. But no.  what we want, go buy shark cards.Rockstar and Taketwo are ing up what May have been an incredibly amazing experience for the GTA line simply out of greed.And Theyll make money over fist for years to come. Just look at EA Being  in this day and age doesnt stop you from making aton of profit.This game is 4 years old and this iteration is 2 years old. Theyve already got most of the money they were going to get from this game. Nothing about this game is going to change for the better
