I stopped playing this game a long time ago, but recent events with the cease and desist towards the developers of OpenIV compelled me to write this review. Im hoping that no one else will buy into the awful practices that TakeTwo are conducting here. I never got the chance to play GTA Vs campaign when it was released the first time around, so that part was fun at least. However, once I started getting into GTA Online with friends, it became apparent very quickly that Rockstar does very little to combat the blatant hackers which ruin the experience for legitimate players. In addition, there have been multiple occasions that TakeTwo have shown fervent hostility towards the modding community that help keep their game alive. I could go on, but its nothing you wont see in the rest of the negative reviews here. Please dont support this developer, as its clear they dont care about their playerbase and this most likely wont change any time soon.
