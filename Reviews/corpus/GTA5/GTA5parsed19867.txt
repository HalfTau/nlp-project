If you havent played it, go for it.  If you played it on any other platform, dont waste your cash.  Single player is a good game probably the best of the GTAs outside of Vice City, I consider Vice City to be the best GTA game, multiplayer sounds like it would be a great idea, but when you make GTA multiplayer, it just turns out to be a really really bad idea.  And the architecture of the multiplayer system basically completely prevents Rockstar from preventing cheating . . and its not even clear if they care about cheating in the slightest.
