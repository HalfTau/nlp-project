The Singleplayer is marvelous. Enormous in proportion. You can sink hours in that alone.Online has a lot of potential. There is always the fun of being able to play with friends and just messing around, or to go full serious mode and take on heist and delivering goods.All the updates are for free, and they add a lot of stuff, as of this review there are a lot of ways to earn money. So you make your own choice in that.The downsides are that the netcode of this game is unstable, which leads to occasional disconnects, which can be frustrating when you are playing with friends. The last few months the amount of modders has risen aswell. Which is rather annoying.Despite this I do recommend this game. It has a lot of potential, and if Rockstar picks the right cards this could be one of the best GTAs there will be.
