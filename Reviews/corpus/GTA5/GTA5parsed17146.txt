I will start by saying I like this games. GTAV is a good game. If you are looking for a good single player game I would pick this game up on sale. But if you are looking for a good modding or multiplayer experience DO NOT buy this game. Rockstar and there parent company are banning modders. As for the multiplayer all of the fun vehicles are behind huge paywalls that you either need to grind for dozens of hours or spend hundreds of dollars, to get all of the vehicles you want.
