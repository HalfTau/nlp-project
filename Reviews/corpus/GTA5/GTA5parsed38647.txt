Modding is a huge part of the GTA community, and Rockstar/T2 claimed to support modding for the longest time. These guys had the audacity to ban my friend, and many others accounts for modding in GTAV singleplayer, which was allowed during that time period. Now they are going to discontinue one of the best modding tools ever made ,OpenIV, which isnt even used for the reason theyre trying to get rid of it.  Mods are the only reason that I play GTAV anymore, but I dont want to risk losing my GTA Online character because of all the hours Ive put into playing it. TakeTwo needs to stop ruining their game under the false pretense that theyre making it more secure. All that the OpenIV team can do right now is bend over and take this.For the modding community and OpenIV team, I will never give Rockstar/T2 my money ever again.  you Rockstar
