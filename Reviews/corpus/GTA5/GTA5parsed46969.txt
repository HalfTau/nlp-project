Back when I first bought this during the PS3era I had great fun.Then I bought it again for the PS4 release  it was still good also I got to complete the story, finally.Then the most important release  the PC version. Finally we could mod the game!Well so much for that. TakeTwo has ruined whatever hope there was for this game to live past its expiration date.
