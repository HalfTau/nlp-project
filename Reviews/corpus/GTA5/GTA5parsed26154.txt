I have bought this game now for the third time. Never have been into playing it online and only purchased this game for the pc mods. Otherwise I would just keep playing it on the ps4. Its a damn shame that 2k and Rockstar have turned their backs on the community. Great game but I feel like I am an idiot for buying the PC game.
