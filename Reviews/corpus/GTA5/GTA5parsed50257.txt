GTA V is easy prime example of a great game ruined by terrible publishers/developers. The SP campaign, though very enjoyable, almost needs mods to contain any semblance of longevity. With TakeTwos foolish actions punishing single players enjoyment, the lack of single player DLC expansions, and the sorry state of Online, I really cant recommend this to anybody but a masochist.
