Cant believe TakeTwo reached this decision, the greed is just pathetic. Clearly this is the way they have done business for a while, and I have no plans of buying their products in the future. Companies like this never change, they just never do. Theres plenty of other great games out there to play, made by people that arent bigots and published/produced by companies that arent a bunch of bigots.
