Only bought the game to mod singleplayer and Open IV was a great program that made it possible. With their latest decision, I will happily say Rockstar are a bunch a greedy money whoringWould also like to add that I have modded/ hacked online as well purely to give myself ridiculous amounts of money to pay for the extortionate prices of vehicles and properties. I never once did anything with the mods that could have ruined the experience of others.At the end of the day you have 3 options with this game.1 you pure waste your life away grinding the thousands ofand repetitive missions for very little cash.2 you give these greedy ers your hard earned money and buy sharkcards3 you mod the game, give yourself and load of cash, buy everything you ever wanted and go about happy ing days.Rockstar  Take Two Interactive dont need anymore money from this game, theyre just complete greedy In my opinion its mod the game for money or nothing. I wouldnt dare spend real money for a virtual currency which even with the most expensive sharkcard youll hardly be able to buy anything with because of how extortionately things are priced. And I certainly wouldnt waste my time grinding this boring game. For me back to the options I mentioned earlier, in my opinion theres only really two.1 Mod the game, get money and actually have fun2 Dont play the game at all and have fun playing something else other than this grindy waste of electricity made by people who are now considered as greedy as EA.Last of all to bring this back to my first point, I only bought the game to mod singleplayer, which I did for the most part, due to fact of how ing boring it is without mods, eventually modding online as well even though with an account that has good statistics built up over the time of Online originally coming out in October 2013 to transferring my account to PS4 and then transferring it again for a second time to PC. In that space of around 3 years  I have finally come to the conclusion that GTA V is probably one of the worst games Rockstar have made but also made them turn from a great company to a terrible one.All I have to say last of all is with the path GTA V/ Online has taken, we can only hope for the best with Red Dead Redemption 2.Edit  19/11/2017OpenIV and modding of the game was allowed within days of them attempting to change that, however most of my points in this review still stand.Rockstar have turned into greedy ers, please stop buying their shark cardsP.S, cant wait for how much of a ing dissapointment RDR2 is going to beRockstar 2013  Well be creating Singleplayer DLC soon BTW
