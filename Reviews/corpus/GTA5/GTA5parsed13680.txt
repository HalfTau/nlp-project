Singleplayer game is amazing but aimed at consoles clearly. In theory this is a very good game so why give it a negative? Take two interactive is the answer. Rockstar and Take Two are on a mission to constantly ruin the relationship between the consumer and the product that could be great but wont be because of their constant intervention to make matters worse. The game is even now, years later almost full price and the BSt that a gamer has to endure with their launcher, rockstar club membership and gtaonline  which is GTA V mmo style How can I recommend it even if the SP campaign is great? They attack modding community that only change the SP game, yet do nothing about the problems that plague the online version, and the only solution they offer is more microtransactions on a regular basis and tighten the noose around the consumer neck. On several weeks and occasions I have not been able to even play the game because of the rockstar social club BS that every now and then just fails for whatever reason to login you in in order to play the games you have paid for. I do not recommend any financial support to such corporations, regardless how good the core game is, that is if you even get to play it.
