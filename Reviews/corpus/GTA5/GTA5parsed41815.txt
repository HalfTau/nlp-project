I love the single player experience but GTA Online is such a hassle, partying with friends hardly works as expected and the load times are ridiculous even with an SSD. I only recently discovered that there were multiplayer mods for single player content and now theyve been made illegal. With how anticonsumer Rockstar and TakeTwo have been since the release of GTAV, and how disappointing the state of multiplayer is currently, its only right to send a message through protest, so here I am doing my bit.
