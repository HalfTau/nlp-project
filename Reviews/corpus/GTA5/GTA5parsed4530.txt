The game crashes on startup to the point where Ill need to restart it three or four times, the game either doesnt save any graphics settings, or crashes when I change them. I couldnt get as far as the first mission, too bad a game this good is optimized so horribly. I was really looking forward to playing it on my new 1060 too. 0/10 Dont buy this mess unless you want extreme migraines.
