This game used to be fun and great game to play with friends, but now its just a cash cow. Im so tired of how the community for this game is being treated. All that devlopers do is release a bunch of content that is lack luster most of the time, and realse the content for free but in relaity it costs an insane amount of money to get the things you want, this way any player that doesnt want to no life the game has buy the beloved SHARK CARDS. I really wish the community would take a stand and buy the damn SHARK CARDS. Im also tired of people getting banned because into a match and someone is dropping money and they happen to get some, but once again that cuts into the SHARK CARD profits. Then they also go and screw over the single player people by getting rid of mods, once again so that way the people that have been banned, will go and buy the game again to play online since Single player is now completley useless. Thanks Rockstar and TakeTwo youre really an inspiration to the gaming industryEDIT Even though Rockstar/TakeTwo have gone back on single player mods, Still be cautious of this game. The multiplayer is still a grind/pay real money to get the best stuff. I will not change my review to positive because to be fair I hate how they use the online community to make a quick buck and how the community actually pays for the micro transactions.
