Online is just plain trash you cant do anything without A grinding the same mission for hours on end in order to buy anything of value, or B buying one of their FreetoPlaytier shark cards which do not belong in a full priced, 59.99 gameAlso, the online component has completely ruined the rest of the game because of the success of the online mode, Rockstar has neglected the whole other half of the game, AKA no new Single Player DLC, which GTA IV had plenty of. Thats saying a lot too, since the game has sold over 70 million copies 70,000,000, making them over 42 BILLION DOLLARS 4,200,000,000.00, and the fact that they want MORE money from the shark cards is saying something. It looks like they dont care about their fans anymore. They straight up just neglected the other half of the game, so theres basically no replay value in singleplayer.
