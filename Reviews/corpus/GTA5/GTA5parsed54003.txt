I only bought this game with the prospect of installing singleplayer mods made by the amazing GTA modding community. The majority of my enjoyment from this game has been from playing free singleplayer mods. I guess Take Two cant stand it when their customers find additional enjoyment from their game for free. Take away modding and theres not much incentive to purchase their games in the future.
