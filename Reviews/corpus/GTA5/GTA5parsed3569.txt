Grand Theft Auto V is a really good game considering I was expecting it to be dead judging by the recent 60 off sale during the Steam Summer Sale.This game has very exciting missions and a fun storyline which is shorter than San Andreas but still definitely worth playing.The driving and flying physics are amazing for a game that isnt even entirely about that anymore. The driving is even more enjoyable when you use a controller or gamepad and drift in the Futo.GTA Online is very far from dead, with updates coming all the time and a community so strong after the Steam Winter Sale that the servers went into a Limited state for PC for quite a few hours.Building up money in Online is fairly slow but this means you spend longer earning the rewards of being rich. Once you have a high level and money there are still races, missions and heists you can do with a team of friends or dedicated veterans from the GTA subreddits.Recommend this game to people who love exploring in free roam, and need to relieve stress on civilians, or gain stress from being dominated by the online players.8/10 because the storyline is a bit short and some vehicles and updates added to the game have taken the games style a bit too far from stealing cars and lowlevel crimes although its still very, very fun.
