Theyre making it increasingly more difficult to grind for money online and adding more upkeep cost when you own all the facilities AND those facilities only give you what ammounts to pennies unless you have 3 or 4 people with you. Everyone is up in arms about the modding issue which is also a problem but the bigger problem is the economy for players trying to play legitimately has gone to Theyve added so many high priced items, made the daily cost of owning things 30k which is insane for what they net you in worth, all while making it harder to actually grind for cash.. WTF rockstar.Stop trying to put players in such a bad position that they NEED to buy sharkcards. Youre ruining your own game. If these issues are fixed I will update this review but untill then DO NOT GET THIS GAME it used to be great but theyre forcing players into crappy experiences unless you pay them extra money, and even then they take the money away from you so quickly its almost not worth it.
