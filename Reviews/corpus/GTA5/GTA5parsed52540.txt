Hello TakeTwo,I know that rockstar doesnt want modding to be banned because at the start they where supporting it. But because there is money involved thing change radicaly. When banning modding you take away the fun you can have with non vanilla software. By doing this you are forcing your buyers players to play what you have created. If you are paying money for something you should have the right to alter it in a little way. Its the same with cars you buy a car and may change the color of it as many times as you want or even upgrade it without buying a new one. I tink you should revise your choice of banning modding and making it undone.TheDutchGoat
