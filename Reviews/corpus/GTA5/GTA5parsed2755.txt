I dont know why people are saying bad things about online. It isnt bad, its really fun! When you meet a hacker just change sessions. Most of the time hackers are nice! You have to grind, but just watch some money tutorials on youtube. When you get your first house and first upgraded car it feels amazing! Give the online a chance!
