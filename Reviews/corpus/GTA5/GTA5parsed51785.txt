First things firstTake 2 Interactive shutting down Open IV, a mod tool for GTA V is abhorent. Modding is a legal PC institution that shouldnt be harmed with in anyway. First Bethesda wanted us to pay big bucks for mods, now T2 wants them to stop being created, so you can pay big bucks on GTA Online via Shark Card microtransactions.Disgusting.Now onto the real review. GTA V in my opinion didnt live up to the hype. This was my first GTA game. I played this game for 3 hours and all I found is unlikable main characters, boring missions, unsatisfying gunplay, AWFUL driving controls and lots and lots of really mean people roaming the streets. I know the purpose of this game is to create chaos and punch these guys in the face, but that doesnt apeal to me to be honest. I want a good fight to stand for, not to be a If I wanted to release my anger, I would play Doom or Wolfenstein.But thats just me. I found GTA V to be tasteless and boring. But that may be different for you. GTA does have a strong fanbase and a dedicated community. So dont let my opinion sway you away from this game.  Just hold off on this game until T2 or Rockstar pays for what they did to the modding community.
