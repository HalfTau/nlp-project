Singleplayer gameplay and story is a great step up from previous GTAs.Otherwise, GTO is a place where rampant hackers and scripters somehow pass the totally legit meter by Rockstars standards. I mean, I ran into a guy with 1000 yes, ONE THOUSAND KDR! How the hell does that pass the lowest standard for blatantly hacking jerkoff??? That doesnt even require fancy cheat detection algorhithms or player reports to figure out!That took common sense!...Which Rockstar is severely lacking!
