GTA Online is a toxic community where people who have grinded their way up to have weaponized vehicles/ or modded, Ruin the game for the entire rest of the population. There is no such thing as a bad sport lobby Pretty much any lobby you join will end up in you being harrassed by bored players.I wouldnt recommend playing except with friends, Ive blocked Rs ports in my firewall settings, and am still able to play public sessions without any other players.EDIT Modder dropped money on me, went through Rs no appeal ban process and am now forced to start completely over. Like seriously? An automated email for a support ticket that auto closes your ticket? Thanks R for all your amazing support. Constantly upon login I constantly see the message Rockstar service has corrected your balance by  making it even more difficult to gain any fun toys they keep releasing... I actually enjoy this game but Taketwo has ruined it for me. Im done with this game. Doubtful Ill get GTA 6 when and if it comes out, Customer support for GTA V has been awful. Buy it for console if you REALLY want it.
