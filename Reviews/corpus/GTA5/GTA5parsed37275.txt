the game is ok, but its not cool what are you doing with the Modding community and the banning of OpenIV. I mean what do you want Take2?? Because If its really the cheaters online issue, just work WITH the openIV team and find a solution, that will give value to the game and all the players, not this very short sighted policy that only harms your audience.But we now is not that, always the same, I bet this is the typical greedy management call, they never understand anything not even make money.
