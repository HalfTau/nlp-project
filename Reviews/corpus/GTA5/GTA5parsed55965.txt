They destroyed the fun associated with Online mode by turning it into a paytowin fest. If you dont have thousands a month in disposable income, dont bother picking up this game for the Online mode. For Singleplayer, they also ruined the modding community by sending a cease and desist letter to the main backbone of the modding world that everyone makes their mods from. So if you want to buy this game for Singleplayer mods also, dont bother. The Company doesnt give a  about fun anymore, they just have that  in mind. Refund if you can.
