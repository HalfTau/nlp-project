A NOTE This review would have told you to buy it if I had written in two weeks agoThis game, frankly on its own is amazing. The story is over the top, but the characters are relatable. The world is very much alive in its own strange and quirky way.And I wont be playing it anymore. At least not for the forseeable future.The recent move by Take Two with the CD against the creators of OpenIV, a tool that for the past ten years allowed some AMAZING things to be done with their games See ICEnhancer for GTAIV and GTAVREDUX has given me pause with this game.With TT claiming that OpenIV allowed online cheating it didnt, as it disabled online play when you installed a mod with it, it was apparent that they simply dont want the players on PC to be able to enjoy the game they bought the way that they want to. This is ridiculous and anticonsumer. Please, if you do not own this game, do not buy it on PC. If you buy it for console, make sure you buy it used. Dont give Take Two and R any more money if they are going to pull these kinds of moves.
