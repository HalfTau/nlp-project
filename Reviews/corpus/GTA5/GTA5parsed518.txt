If you have never played the game before its great, but if you bought the game like me and many others dont think youre going to be able to transfer characters over from another platform to PC. Their flimsy reason for this was to prevent hacked accounts but thats only partially believable and theres still a ton of hackers, rendering the game that much less fun because of the policy and useless in the first place. The actual game is pretty good, multiplayer is about the same, controls are alright. Just dont buy unless you want to start a brand new game.
