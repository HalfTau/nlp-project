Rockstar and Take Two Interactive have completely ruined this game over the last year or so. WAY too pay to win in GTA Online and now we cant even mod singleplayer as of a few days ago... REALLY wish I could refund this piece ofgame. Was fun for maybe the first couple of updates to GTA Online in late 2015, but after that it became too pay to win to ever make me want to play again. EVERYTHING is ridiculously expensive, except for the people who dont have as much of a life as others and play this game 6 hours a day and actually have the patience to grind money forever just to be able to buy a supercar. On a scale from 110 I give this game a 2. If you were to ask me this time last year I would have been near a 9. This game costs 60 on here and spending 50 USD every single time that a new update comes out isnt exactly my idea of good budgeting. I have pumped nearly 400 into this game and I am deeply regretting even putting 3 into it on shark cards. With this recent update I had to sell SEVEN SUPERCARS and I couldnt even buy 3 things. I recommend this game if you love microtransactions, otherwise stay the  away from it. Youd be better off to spend 400 on League of Legends than this ing game. Rant over.
