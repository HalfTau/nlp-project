I bought this game during the steam sale because several friends wanted to play it online. I purchased the game and 2 shark cards. After gearing up and doing a few missions, I killed a bunch of players. My account was immediately banned for a month...1 I never said a word in public chat.2 I never installed any mods/cheats.3 I cant even imagine what I could have possibly done to get banned.This is a first is any game ever... I am still kind of in shock that I got banned from a video game... I submitted a support request with Rockstar, that was immediately closed with a form response.There are plenty of games that are buggy, incomplete, or just not that fun. All of that can be frustrating but this experience is a new low in the gaming industry.I am leaving a negative review because of this and sharing my experience, so buyer be warned.
