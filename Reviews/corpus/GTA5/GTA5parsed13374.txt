Fun as can be expected but I am very disappointed with the Early steam release for this. I purchased it a long while back with the Great White Shark card Bundle. Thing is steam wasnt able to transfer the Great White Shark card value in game. It said I had it but no way to redeem it. I eventually gave up after rockstar wouldnt get back to me and steam proved to be even less help. I redownloaded the game after a lot of updates and content were released. And as it turns out steam figured out how to make the cards work... but now my card was no longer with my game. Just gone. Never redeemed. 1,250,000 in game currancy just gone. A twenty dollar value erased. So, Im a bit peeved to say the least.But the game is a ton of fun. I just wouldnt trust to much in the card bundles even if they figured it out. Both companies seem to care little if your money it taken without a product to show for it.
