Okay. So I played this game when I had an xbox 360 about two or three years ago. I upgraded my PC and recently decided to return to it, but it is NOT the same game. Microtransactions were always a part of the game, but back then 20 shark card took you a longway. Now the top end vehicles in the game sell from the dealers for like 50100 in REAL LIFE. The value of about 1.4 million is 20, 3.5M is about 50 and theres another for 99. Thing is, the most awesome cars, businesses, flying motorcycles, all of that ranges between 2.4 million  5 million dollars in game. Specifically, the flying motorcycle costs about 50 in shark cards. Do not waste money on this game unless you just wanna rob stores with friends. At best, legitimate money making will take at least 45 hours a day to get anywhere. Forget it if youre a solo player like me as well. CEO and MC jobs REQUIRE that you have a team of other players or you are blocked from doing anything with them.
