Grand Theft Auto Vs Single player campaign was extreamly fun, but its not what this review is about. its about the broken, mess of a multiplayer.But wait, you might be asking. I gave it a positive review, what gives?Everything is expensive, they want you to buy shark cards, the start of your multiplayer career is slow and tedious. But, that doesnt mean there isnt anything good. If you have friends, the Hiests are a ton of fun, the game modes are fun, and once you get going, there is nothing more fun than hunting down a group of people who tried to attack you for your supplies long story and taking them down over and over again with just you and one friend of yours. Yes, Hacking is rampant, and if Rockstar is doing anything about it, its not working. Rockstar Support is also some of the worse support groups I have ever encountered, running you in circles until you give up or they just tell you the game is working as intended, but get past all this crap and the game is actually a lot of fun. There are also ways to get solo lobbys, both private and public, that are just an internet search away if you dont want to deal with hackers.
