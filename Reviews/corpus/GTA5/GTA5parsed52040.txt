The decision to ban mods for the game by Take Two has severley impacted the replayablity of the game long term, as a lot of the games best content was in the modding scene, and without the mods the seemingly endless amount of content has been significantly reduced. Because of this, I would not recommend that new buyers purchase the game, particularly if you have played through it before.
