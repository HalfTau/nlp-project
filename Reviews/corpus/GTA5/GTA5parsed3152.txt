To start with I purchased this game solely to play it online with friends and while private sessions are ok and the general idea behind the game is great, it does not work as intended due to the overwhelming number of hackers and abusers.GTA Online requires the player to grind for money so they can unlock stuff and a neat feature I thought was the CEO missions which you can do once you get a CEO office and warehouse.  Sadly though the missions require you to be in a public game to do and they missions are designed so that other players can attack you during them to earn money for themselves and this is where the entire issue comes into play.So I have to invest money into a mission and if it fails I lose that money but if it succeeds then I can make profits.  Since every game lobby you go into has a hacker running around slaughtering everyone this becomes impossible.  There is no way to get any of these CEO missions completed in a profitable manner and the game forces you to join public games before you can do them.  This means you are forced to do boring  events like the slashers game or races over and over just to earn money and to me its just no fun.It would of been much better to just have actual NPC driven missions the player has to complete for the CEO missions and then allow them to play them solo or with just a group of trusted friends.This game had potential but there doesnt seem to be enough being done to stop the abusers and hackers.
