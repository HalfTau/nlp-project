I saved up money for 3 months just to afford this game and it was worth it. Finished the story mode in a week and currently exploring GTA online. It is everything Ive wanted in a video game. I am a long time fan of the GTA series and I have to say even 5 years after launch the game still got it. Lots of multiplayer lobbies, heists with friends, and so much more that it cant be described in one place. Thank you for giving us this masterpiece Rockstar games. Heres to countless more hours enjoying this game.
