As a whole, I enjoyed GTA V. But recently, after 100 hours or so I found the game to lack replayablity. Removale of Open IV was the biggest reason I am writting this review. Modding allows games to have infinate playability such as skyrim and GTA 4, but the removal of this program lead to GTA finally going down hill.I have played a large amount of online and single player, and the multiplayer lacks depthness because it is blocked by a wall of Micro Transactions and countless hours of grinding on minigames that are shallow. Hackers getting your account banned and numerous bugs make the online mode hard to play. Even if you do acquire a large sum of in game money, the overly priced cars and houses quickly make it seems as if you are living paycheck to paycheck. GTA was never ment to be grind based game, the multiplayer should feel as a sandbox not WOW.My other issue is with single player. For this, it is a F2p version of GTA. You do not get the ability to do all the cool stuff in online despite having the funds in game. And you cant drive all the cool cars and own the property that you can in online. Without mods the single player is heavily limited. I do not recomened buying GTA anymore, and this saddens me.
