I know you want to get rid of Hackers in GTA Online but is this really the right way?!? In my opinion this was not. You should not have taken down OpenIV because you thought there were harmfull items and malicious software for the game in there. We all know there was non of that. This was just a STUPID action from Rockstar and Take2 Interactive they should not have been so easy about this. They should have thought this trough much more. If OpenIV wont be able to come back same goes for FiveM and GTAMultiplayer and every other big modding community you will just have to deal with the negative reviews. Its not fair Rockstar. You put time and effort into your game and so did the modders. They never meant to harm the game  The singleplayer modders  there are some modders in GTA Online that can be considerd Harmfull but there are other ways to take them down. Look at the huge ban wave from a few months ago when the new anticheat was implemented. Do more stuff like that not this.
