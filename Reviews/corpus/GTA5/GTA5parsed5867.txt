Singleplayer was fun, but online... It used to be good, but it became a paytowin hell filled with terrible people who probably kick puppies for fun. I regret buying it and regret putting the hours and money into online that I did. If singleplayer had more put in to it, it could have been so much better. I can say without any doubt that this game has become horrible. This review could be considered empty, but I dont feel the need to say what SO MANY other people have already said about this game, and in such great detail too.
