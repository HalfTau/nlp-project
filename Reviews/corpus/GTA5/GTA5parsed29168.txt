Single player is bull hope your computer is TOP performence becas graphic issues will stop your play at Trevor torturing a dude. Multiplayer is full of 13 year olds that just  and cuss. 0/10 experience, Rockstar sucks balls, dont get this game. Very disappointed. BTW they took away the one presentable part of this game, modding, and made it a perfect can of bullstew with witch to wash your 60 dollars, what a rip
