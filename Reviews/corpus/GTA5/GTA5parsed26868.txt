The singleplayer, while amazing, is severely under developed, and has been left without expansion in place of tacking more and more t onto online to try and pad it out and get more people to buy shark cards, effectively paytowin amounts of ingame currency.The latest update to online has given those who have played the game enough to have wracked up a few million Either through shark cards, or through hacking access to a tank that Can outpace a sports car Has a multibarelled missile launcher on the top, which can fire devastatingly powerful missiles one after another, with a large effective explosive radius that can just about oneshot anyone poor enough to not be able to get away in time Has enough armor to withstand anything but another one of itself AND counts as a personal vehicle, so can be respawned infinitely, negatively impacts those who do destroy it, and the owner can kick out hijackers at will by forceejecting people from their personal vehicle.Theyre just looking for new ways to make people buy shark cards at this point. Every new update adds more overpowered nonsense that costs more than some oil states can muster.
