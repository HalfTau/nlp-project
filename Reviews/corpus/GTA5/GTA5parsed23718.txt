The single player is fine especually with mods, but the online section the game at this point as some issues. For the most part this is one of the better games to have come out in the past few years. Having said that, they still havent fixed a lot of things. Connectivity and loading issues that have been with it from the beginning are still there so enjoy the five minute loading screens if you dont get stuck in one and good luck playing with someone for long durations of time as staying in the same lobby can be difficult if not impossible at times. Money too is an issue as prices have gotten to a point where you are unable to reasonably buy new DLC items without paying actual money. Ive put in 300 hours and have bought most things in the game, this latest DLC is, to me a blatant money sink designed to bleed out any modded money that was to be left over after they began the mod purging as it coincide so neatly. Also after you reach level 100 you no longer unlock anything so leveling past this point is worthless. Vehicles too are locked to a single characters, so you cant even start over without more money, even though the money shared between all of them. As fun as this game is you cant do much without ingame money and you cant make much without buying it. So if you have nothing, but free time and have 3 other friends that have the same its for you, but not me.
