iest online multiplayer usability EVER. If I want to play a session with a friend who sits in another room I CANNOT DO IT since the fing developers dont bother adding server browsers to the game or any easy interface to join games together! And I can get old during the loading screens. Loading screens even when EXITING the session. WTF ROCKSTAR?? ?
