I got this game from a friend and started playing the game. It is fun to play good game but the only problems I have with it is its very difficult to earn money. I think they do it so theyll drive you to buy shark cards but then people just go to modders and get money and then people wonder why they get in the badpool party. The devs really need to fix this game if they want anyone to actually like it. Plus customer support sucks
