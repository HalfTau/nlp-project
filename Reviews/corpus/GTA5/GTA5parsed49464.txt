Take Two screwed up. OpenIV did nothin g legally wrong and Take Two sent them a cease and desist because they said it was illegal. Take Two basicaly repeated the Nintendo v Game genie case from the 80s. Game Genie one that case and if openIV had chosen to take them to court there was a 100 chance that OpenIV would have one aqianst Take Two. Rebel against Rockstar and Take Two DONT BUY ANY OF ROCKSTARS AND TAKE TWOS GAMES UNTIL THEY GET THERE ACT TOGETHER!
