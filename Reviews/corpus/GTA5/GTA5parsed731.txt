This was a great game, now Rockstar has abandoned the community for modders/exploiters while they continue to milk the game for money. Also, all recent DLC has been nothing buy PayToWin greifing tools that take hundred of hours to grind out...Unless you have your moms credit card.Its extremely tempting, but dont buy this game unless you want to play single player, which rockstar has also abandoned, or Rockstar fixes their game.
