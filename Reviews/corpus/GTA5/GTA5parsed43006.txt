About a month or two ago, I probably would have been writing a positive review for this. But now? I honestly cant support Take Two, or Rockstar anymore. Not only did they send the cease and desist to OpenIV, but they also adjusted the accounts of my friends and I, causing us to lose two, to four million each of legitimate cash. All because a modder gave them maybe 600k.
