I used to recommend this game. But now that the modding is gone, theres no point anymore. Unless you have a few hundred to spend on Shark cards, or plan on spending all your free time playing to try to be a pro player, the online is pointless. Its a bunch of kids who have nothing else to do than kill everyone else and spend all their parents money to be better than everyone.
