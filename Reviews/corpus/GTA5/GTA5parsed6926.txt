encourages cheating. there is no way to report anything except bullying. as if the game is mocking you for someone needing to cheat to win. i am referring to leading the pack in a race by over a minute and someone appearing behind me on a long uphill straightaway. there was no corners, let alone anything on the radar. then i had to listen to countless use of the n word and other ridicule until i left the match. mostly the n word, tho. every person who placed ahead of me used it repeatedly. until i left. point is, theres no way to report this. whats worse is that it took four hours of game time for this to happen. now im stuck with a game full of rampant cheaters.
