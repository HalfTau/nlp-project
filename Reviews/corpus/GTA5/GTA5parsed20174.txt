Decided to reinstall GTAV and oh wow guess what? IT GOT WORSE. And NO, Im not talking about the mods that actually make this fun even the players that used singleplayer mods got banned.. and I MEAN A LOT OF PLAYERS GOT BANNED as of the 25th. Im not talking about the RP servers that make this fun. Im talking about the community the has to shoot you the second you exit a shop. The community that goes afk on the best paying heists and jobs. This game is now a HUGE dissapointment. If you start getting spawnor killed by someone, you might aswell leave, cus you arent getting payback on that level 193 with unlimited sticky bombs. I really dont know where to start with this review so ill just end it with this.Shark Cards are 100 for 8MILLION... For the past YEAR.. ALMOST EVERY DLC VEHICLE has been around 3040MILLION. So unless you wanna spend about 400 bucks for one of the low end DLC vehicles YOU CAN GRIND AND PLAY THE MONTHLY MISSIONS. Like this month, its this parachuting car thing. Super fast, and fun mini game... until 9 players land, and 1 player DECIDES TO FLY AROUND IN CIRCLES FOR 5 MINUTES, 20 TIMES 5 waves total AND YOU CAN MAKE 100k!!!Well... it took me one whole hour to play this mission... and I made 70k. I COULD just spend 100 bucks to get a LITTLE closer to getting that new bike. The game is No where near newbie friendly, in fact the original community, IS FAVORED and HAS BEEN from the begining.. better vehicles, fast xp.. yada yada.. different events.If youre trying to get into this game and catch up to your friends who somehow seem to get past all the players who leave sticky bombs outside of barber shops, the kids who scream into mics with their british accents, then LOOK NO FURTHER!! If you get started today, you can spend many MANY hours on DYING, or.. CALLING YOUR MECHANIC FOR A NEW REPLACEMENT CAR. OR... DEALING WITH A BOUNTY BECAUSE YOU FINALLY KILLED THTA TROLL WHO KEPT SPAWN CAMPING YOU.Anyways.. yeah. This game sucks. Look at the overall reviews. Look at how often the DLC updates are coming out now? This game came out years ago, and you can tell by their efforts of updating the game, that its falling in shambles. Too bad it is filled with kids whom had their PCs made by their Papis..
