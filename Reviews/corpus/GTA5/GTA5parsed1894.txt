The online play is just one huge grind full of griefers and hackers. The devs do nothing to stop all the griefing and hacking, despite saying that they do. After over 200 hours of gameplay, Ive uninstalled it for good. Its not fun. Its constantly frustrating. It had its moments but otherwise only served to raise my blood pressure. Never again.
