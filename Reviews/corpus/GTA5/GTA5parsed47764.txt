They are milking theout of this game. Nice game and all but its so obvious what they are doing with the multiplayer. Now also removing modding tools and sending out sieze and desists. No improvements to gameplay, the constant adding of ultra expensive new cars and bikes and that require you to either spend aton of real money or about 4000 hours of doing either the same  heists over and over again, or playing  mini games that get so boring so fast. And they are still charging full price for this game. If you want it for the single player expierence and nothing more buy it. But dont, because Rockstar is just milking the ever lovingout of this game and they should not be encouraged and supported by giving them money. Flush it down the toilet instead, because at least your toilet wont  you up thein the process.
