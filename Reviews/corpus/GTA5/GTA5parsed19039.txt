Welcome to Grand Theft Modo where you will live in this online game either server hopping looking for money drops or buying Shark Cards. Ive done both and lemme tell ya, jhJHaoiksjdlkah amiright?. Just when you think you have enough money to start a business, Surprise you have to buy a flipping 6000000000000 warehouse. You can buy the trash one and be stuck wanting to kys as you drive 6 miles away. I can hear you now But Grit you flipping cracksack! 6 miles is not long! Tell that to my mom then get back to me stupidface. Once you buy your fave car, you will just end up selling it to buy the next best warehouse which you will end up not even supplying because every time you do, surprise heres a modder or a freaking socalled friend in a Hydra. Also dont even try to deliver with friends cause all they wanna do is crash your planes and destroy your product, then laugh and blame your sorry buttcrack. Youll end up broke, yet living in a milliondollar apartment because reasons. If you dont buy a shark card, then you better hope that someone forces you to buy one against your will, because youre gonna want money in this so you can buy more rockets and sticky bombs to blow up the hacker and mean guys, jk stick em on your teammates and watch then writhe in pain! Maybe you want to just hang and have a good time, well go play Paladins you freaking casual cause it aint gonna happen up in dis crib boi. Overall i give 8/10 stars, because i like to see people explodeded till they freaking rage quit and tell you that youre bad. So bad. Chief Beef P
