Take Two Interactive eliminating mods for the SINGLE player is the worst thing they could have done. They are trying to shove GTA Online and DLC down our throats. It would be one thing if they still supported GTA single player, which is where people were playing the modded version. But since they have not released any new content or DLC for single player the only option we the people who love single player have is to mod the game.
