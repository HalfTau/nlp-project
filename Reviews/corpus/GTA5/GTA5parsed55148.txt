 you Take Two.  you and your micro transaction riddled trash.  you for making us buy this game three times, once on PS3 and XBOX, a second time on PS4 and XBONE, and a third time on PC.  you for wasting our time while we waited for heists and a PC release.  you for not even bothering to make sure that the game was well optimized for PC until a few weeks after it was released.  you for banning modders who only play in private lobbies. So many people were hoping that GTAV would have a modding community like GTAIV did. So many people bought GTAV twice or even three times just to have fun with mods. By making it against the rules to use mods ingame, you have shown that you dont give a singleabout people who like playing GTAV single player, and that you want everyone to play online so that you can milk as much money as possible from people who need money in online as fast as possible. One of the things that made GTAIV so popular for so long was its incredible modding scene, even if you had 100 completed it, there was always a plethora of mods that you could download and give the game new life. In GTAV, you rereleased the game 3 times, and never changed anything, but people kept buying it in hopes that they could relive the fun they had in GTAIV. With this action, youve destroyed that hope, and with it, angered so many once devoted, and loyal fans.  you Take Two
