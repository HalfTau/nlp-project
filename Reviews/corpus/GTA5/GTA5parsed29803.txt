They Ruined it....... Back in 2013 when I bought this game for my Xbox it was one of the best, it had everything I wanted. Rockstar created a perfect game and they managed to ruin it. The single player story was amazing, the story of these 3 characters was amazing to play through and it was a fun journey, It compelled me to beat the game more than 3 times. The vanilla story mode is still alot of fun so if thats what you were looking for in this game by all means buy it. Gta Online was one of the most amazing things when it launched, but now it has been inflated with overpriced DLC. Most of this DLC is so expensive grinding to get the money for it is very boring so knowing this, Rockstar wants you to take the easy way and buy shark cards for them. All the DLC in GTA Online were made to push shark card profits, nothing else. Its not 4 years later since GTA Online launched in 2013 and now its inflated with things that are priced so high grinding from level one to get it would be a huge pain in the Lastly, Rockstar And Take2 banned modding. Modding was the olny reason why I rebought this game on steam! This alone made me write this negative review. This is a  you to the wonderful modding community that this game had. Mods alone made this game one of the best in my opinion, but Take2 and Rockstar didnt care.
