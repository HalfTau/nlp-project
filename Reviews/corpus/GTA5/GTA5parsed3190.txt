I bought this game for the third time Xbox 360, Xbox One, and now PC because I was told that I could continue my GTA online character by transferring it to PC through the Rockstar Social Club. I even bought the version which includes a Shark Card, because it was on sale during the Winter sales, but found out that Im just late to the game because I can no longer transfer characters for absolutely no given reason other Its not allowed anymore. Im not going to start another character because that would mean all of the progress that Ive made means nothing anymore, and this Shark Card is now worthless because Im past the point of refund. Its entirely pointless, and I wasted a purchase.
