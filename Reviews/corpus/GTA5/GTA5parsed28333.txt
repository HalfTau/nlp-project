Story line is rich. The 3 story mode characters you play as Trevor, Michael and  Franklin have a slow start but it gets more and more exciting like what Lester would say, mind blowing orgies. This game makes you hate some characters and understand the characters background which teaches you to not judge a book by its cover. The online mode is just cancer. Players killing each other for fun or literally chaos Jets and tanks all over the island and bombing players. You might meet modders. Most of the time you might meet modders who are d1cks and would teleport and kill you but there are chances where you meet kind modders who will bring you to places to party,give you free cash or fly you in a cargo plane. In total, I would recommend this game to others.
