To say thank you to the PC community who kept titles in this series alive with the huge amount of single player mods available Take Two Interactive decided it would send a cease and desist letter to OpenIV, effectively killing modding support the same modding support that also fixes glitches and exploits in the game I might add.They claim its due to online cheating despite this not actually being the case and I cant help but wonder if theres going to be a paid for mods coming in GTAs single player future... Its also rather ironic but Online has had numerous free money exploits in the past which are attributed to not OpenIV, but exploits in the games code that have gone untested by the devs.GTA V is a good game, its just a shame that Take Two are milking it to death.
