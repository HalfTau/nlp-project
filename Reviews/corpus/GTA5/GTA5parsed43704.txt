I until recently enjoyed GTA Online and GTA SIngle Player on another PC. Used to have fun with friends and messing around with some offline mods but T2 just runined this for no real reason and banned Open IV.I mean these mods dont effect online at all and just provide entertainment on a local PC yet T2 have decided this isnt cool so no more.I really hope Rockstar get rid of T2 as soon as possible for their own benifit.
