You know what? GTA V is a good game. The singleplayer game is good, the multiplayer is enjoyable.However, between hawking Shark Cards for the easy microtransaction money versus actually adding more content in more standard expansions and the like, and sending a CE to modders who TakeTwo have previously featured on their own channels.I cant recommend a game with shady ing devs, treating modders likecriminals. Mods are something highly valued by the communities, and keep games like this alive longer than otherwise possible. Going after legitimately harmless mods just makes TakeTwo a bunch of s. God after the online script kiddies, sure, but what the hell, TakeTwo, get a ing clue.TLDR Go  yourself TakeTwo.
