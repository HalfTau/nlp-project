I dont even make mods, and have never installed a mod, but with the recent happenings i think take 2 are actually ing . But not Rockstar though. After having played this game for several hundred hours on pc, i think its a great game. Both online and the offline storymode. Rockstar make great games, and have always given spotlight to good mods. But take 2 can go  themselves.
