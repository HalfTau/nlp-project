Bought it in the sale together with 3.5m shark card,played it for 3 days constantly changing servers cause of hackers,one hacker tps to me in session drops 50k on top of me andI got banned for 30 days meanwhile im sure they are still playing considering how many hackers are out there in the game.TLDRDont waste your money as you will be banned cause of some random hacker being in your sessionEdit Customer support only repplied to this with a generic message saying Bans cant be appealedthey dont even bother checking their logs to see what happened. If their  antihack service picks something which is definetly not the hackers as i mentioned since there is  ton of them
