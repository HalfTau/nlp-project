Bad idea banning mods. The game isnt updated with good enough content and the microtransactions are allready pay to win. Some people dont give a damn about online, so they play around with mods. That alone gives your game longevity. Do you really think banning mods will stop a bunch of little hacker kids? No it will not. TakeTwo and probably Rockstar are bad and their decisions are bad. They should be ashamed. Your fans created you, they made you what you are today. All the mods for San Andreas, for GTA IV and GTA V really made the games special. Heck GTA V even sky rocketed in popularity on Twitch and Youtube with the help of the modding scene.Should I complain about the legal pursuing of mods, the boring and usually late updates, the lack of community interaction, the microtransactions or the price of the game? I do not support Rockstar, I do not support TakeTwo and their actions. I will be boycotting them. This means not buying their future games untill they come out and adress the community and the fans. Now you might say nobody cares about a lonewolf not buying the new RedDead Redemption but I tell you what, I do not give a damn either. Ive got plenty of other games to play.Edit I think everything is fine now. The modding community is safe. Although there are way too many modders in GTA Online. I am having so much fun in GTA Online and new content just keeps coming. Guess what? These new contents are free. My only complaint are modders and how Rockstar hasnt been able to combat them. Changing my review to positive.
