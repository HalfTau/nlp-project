Overall my favorite franchise and game of pretty much all times.Open world game play allows for any kind of nefarious brutality and uncensored mayhem.Whether blowing up cops with RPGs or participating in a BMX bicycle race, relentless PVP, or testing your coop skills in complex heisting scenarious turns your crank, GTA has something to enjoy for every twisted mind out there!
