Chances are, if youre at all interested in GTA V then youve already got it, so Im not going to bother recommending you buy it.But theres also a decent chance that you own it but have only played the multiplayer. GTA Online is great, but if thats all youve experienced then youre seriously missing out.The story mode of GTA V surprises me with how polished it is each time I play it. Its an incredibly well put together game, and one that you really shouldnt miss out on playing.
