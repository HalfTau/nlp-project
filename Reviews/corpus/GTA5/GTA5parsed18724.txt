The game is lots of fun but has many flaws. First, I love Online because you can play with friends and have a blast doing missions. On the other hand, Rockstar makes it their goal for you to buy their sharkcards and other microtransactions. Heists dont get you very much money either. In the end, I think the game is great I just think the cooperation who made it could be less greedy. Wishful thinking.
