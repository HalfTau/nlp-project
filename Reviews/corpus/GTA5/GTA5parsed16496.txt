Loved this game for the first couple of years it was out. Now its all about who buys the most shark cards to upgrade your weapons and have an unholy advantage above anyone who hasnt invested as much as you. The races are still fun but aside from that, the game turned into a money grab of insiting hatred between people to encourage them to spend more money on the game to catch up... sucks because I loved this game
