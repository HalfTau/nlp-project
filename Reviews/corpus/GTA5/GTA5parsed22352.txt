Single player was ok.Online was boring.Mods were awesome.Devs tried to remove mods. After the negative reviews they decided to undo the change. I dont care, they only responded because of the uproar. The corp will do stunts like this in the future and I have absolutely no respect for them, whatsoever. Ive been supporting his franchise since GTA 2 and this is where I pull the plug. Its over.
