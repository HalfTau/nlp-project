The game  had a lot of promise, a good single player narrative with good graphics and an open world with a lot of character.The multiplayer while initially seeming good is held back by its poor design requiring ether outragious amounts of time investment making GTA Online the only game you would ever play or outright HAVING to buy sharkcards to actually earn really good things.An the modding scene was bright with an active community with many great mods such as the Visual overhaul, greatly improving graphics and gameplay mods like the Ironman and Hulk mods or even mods that add the new multiplayer content to singleplayer since the devs do not add any of the cool new updates to single player. However Take2 the most inept and biggest failure of a publisher in memory has banned the usage of mods even in the single player hitting the creators of the most prominant modding tool OpenIV with a ceise and desist.  this Game, if you support it you are potentionally supporting a very grim future for PC gaming and gaming in general.
