Im going to make this as short and to the point as possible.Logged in today after being offline for about two months to an adjustment of close to 1.7M GTARockstars reasoning that I somehow modified the amount of RP or GTA That Id gotten.Now id been laughing about the hackers and the cheats that were complaining about them taking away ill gotten gains... so to speak... In a game full of them. But I grinded for every penny of that with friends running missions, filling my warehouses and selling stock etc...So my case in point This game is a blast and I do recommend it for fun times with friends but Rockstar has become very crooked in their ways. They launch a new DLC and take away not only hacked cash but also cash you may have worked for. Be wary of their shark cards Ive had reports from others that their money has been taken from them since the new DLC launched.I am completely unsatisfied with Rockstars pricing, a game that relies so much on microtransations needs to be free. This is getting rediculous.
