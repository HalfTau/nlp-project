Lack of single player content, high prices online requiring you to grind for a ridiculous amount of hours online or buy shark cards just to buy a car worth half of what it was offline, and now take two trying to ban mods. whats the point of banning mods that dont affect online play. yes online modders are a pain but those modders that cause problems are not usings tools such as open iv. so puting in a cease and desist out to open iv solves nothing.
