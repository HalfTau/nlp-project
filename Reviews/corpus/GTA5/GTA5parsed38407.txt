Yo online is trash now! Wheres everyone at? Even if I get into a session with more than 10 people, no one hangs around in the city anymore. My guess is that everyone is just forced to grind now since the rockstar robbery, so everyone is up north working and no one is in the city. It just isnt fun anymore.
