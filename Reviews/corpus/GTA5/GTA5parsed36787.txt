Great game but wouldnt recommend unless you want to spend out of yourto get anything fun or worthwhile. R either get you to purchase shark cards, which by the way are overpriced in my opinion, or they force a grind of missions, heists and other goodish paying game modes in game, which take way too long to create enough disposable income for the fun content they are adding. Not worth the pucrhase anymore.
