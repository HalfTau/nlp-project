 I am writing this review with 927 hours on record. This review is exclusively about GTA Online and not about the Story of GTA 5.My previous review was positive, but I have to revise that opinion. The game became so buggy and expensive and is full of modding noobs so it it is hardly to enjoy.I barely have fun playing it, except driving around and do nothing.Still to have to do the exactly same things after 900 hours to earn a few dollars with which I am able to pay my bills isnt what I want to do as a high level player. And when I am trying to sell a car, to be able to afford a new one it is not possible because of bugs. The support of rockstar isnt helpful a bit and takes days or weeks to reply.Dont buy this game it isnt worth it especially when you have to start now when everybody else has so much and you cant afford anything.Sincerelyparatus141
