Rockstar is Scum, They dont give a single  about anyone, everything is boosted in price by 1000, the missions pay next to nothing since they nerfed the only good ones. They literally spit in any grinding players face by letting hackers run amok 24/7, and they make you purchase shark cards as the only real way to get through theircontent. And dont even get me started on not putting anything into singleplayer.Thanks for making me waste years on this game only to take all my  and say i was hacking. you RockstarSomeone who actually enjoyed the game once upon a time.
