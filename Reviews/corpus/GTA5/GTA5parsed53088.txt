This is ridiculous. I was waiting for story mode DLC and you banned openIV? What the ???? I dont gave a damn about all those fancy money sucking online DLCs. I hate every single one after the Heist. I have always been a fan of this series. The company seems to be different after GTA Online. Im really worried about the RDR2 tbh. PLEASE focus on the single player mode.
