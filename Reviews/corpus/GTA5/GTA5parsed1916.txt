At first the game was great but after i started online for 24hours i realized modders and cheating runs wild here. half the time you cannot get to atm or even complete tasks because modders are screwing you up some how. rock star needs to help, i already uninstalled it for now... the players who have money have so much they can do whatever and destroy you with ease while you try to make enough to get a garage or car. whatever, fix the game or alot of people will continue to stop buying bs content.
