Fun singleplayer with some great characters, acting, gameplay, and open world. As weve come to expect from Rockstar.Multiplayer, not so much. If youre buying this for the multiplayer then Id advise you not to waste your money just get the Multiplayer mod for Just Cause 2 or 3, it does what this game does much better and with ten times the fun. To elaborate, if you want to rank up in multiplayer, expect to grind endless hours and be killed constantly by other players. Im not against microtransactions if its for cosmetic reasons, but to give other players an advantage just because they spent more money? For shame.Id tear more into the multiplayer, but if that were the case Id be spending all day writing this review, but Ill give this game a thumbs up just for the singleplayer.
