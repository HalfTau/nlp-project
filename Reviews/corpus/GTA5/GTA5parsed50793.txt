As a person who does not and has not used OpenIV in the past, even I can say what an absolutely horrific and abhorrent decision it was on Take Two/Rockstar/etcs part to target OpenIV. What a complete cop out and lazy action. If this is how they handle their user base, then the message is loud and clear  they do not want my business. Ill make sure I dont give them any business ever again.
