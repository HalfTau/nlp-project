This is one of the best games Ive ever played and is still one of my favorites. I bought this game when it released on each generation of Xbox and when it released on PC. The Story is really entertaining and Online mode is fun. You wont run out of things to do, there are heists, missions and loads of other fun activities.Good Things!Great gameplayGreat storyGreat charactersGreat graphicsBad Things! Hackers Loading screens sometimes very long.Overall I would recommend everyone to get this game.Its usually about 50 off on steam sales so you will save a bit of money if you buy it then.
