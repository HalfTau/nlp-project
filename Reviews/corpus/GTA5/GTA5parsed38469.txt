Decided to turn this into an actual review instead of an agry grrr no mods post although it will still be rather negative, dont get me wrong this game is a hot mess but it didnt start out as that it had so much potential when it first came out, single player DLC with new characters? maybe just some more missons with the main cast? Undead Nightmare 2? could have done anything!and then theres Online a wasteland of nothingness when the game came out that also could have evolved into something great, maybe some more missons or new people to work for maybe even working with the FIB or Devin Weston? maybe some better freemode things to do side missons like maybe a cab service or delivery missons maybe a few more ilegal things like gang wars or selling drugs, nothing that pay thousands or will get you rich quick but just a fun thing to do maybe? that would be fun.Instead theres no Single player DLC leaving it a boring wasteland after you beat the game hence the mods being mandatory for single player it adds life to a lifeless game and Online is nothing but a freemium game with over priced crap. Oh sure you can earn the money to buy anything in this game Im not saying you cant but what I am saying is that you REALLY have to work to get the cash without exploits considering that every misson or activity you do pays nothing heists excluded those actually pay over 100,000 depening on your cut, normal missons normally just go over 10,000 never hitting that 6 digit goal making shark cards not just apealing but basically manadtory if you dont want to put DAYS into a game just to play the new free DLC even the latest DLC if you were to buy everything minus the clothes and with the cheapest bunker and mobile command centre with no modifications what so ever your looking at 17,000,000 in game or a little over 200 in real world money in other words Gunrunning alone with shark cards is worth 200 and people give EAabout expensive Season pases but sure you can earn the money in game... just make sure to have friends and that you spend a few hours maybe a week or two playing nothing but GTA online with zero failures and Im sure grinding all that wont make you slowly hate the game by the time you have enough money to START the DLC.so in conclusion GTA V in my eyes is the biggest gaming let down Ive ever had the misfortune of experincing, it was fun at first but slowly became worse and worse as time and updates went on with a few exceptions of course Heists were fun and I enjoyed cunning stunts and thought Bikers was the best DLC they released, expensive clothes but still really good so I would not recomened wasting your money on this game and actually wait for a sale when GTA VI comes outsince its probably more of the same, heres hoping Red Dead isnt a freemium game I dont want to know about buying shark cards in the wild west2/10 maybe R should bury this series before it becomes total trash
