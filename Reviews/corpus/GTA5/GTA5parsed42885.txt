Giving money to a publisher which actively fights against the modding community is something I cant get behind.In addition, I can almost guarentee that Take Two doesnt care about just review scores on its game. The only way to get a message across to a company is through their wallets, if you truly dont want to support a business which treats thousands of community contributors so poorly, then dont buy their stuff, simple as that.
