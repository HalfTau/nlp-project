Reviewing the whole game, not just the cluster that is online  hence the recommendationThe game itself is by far one of the best games ever released, the open world is constantly in motion and everything from the graphics to the dialogue is perfect or near perfectNow to the Online experience, its not THAT bad like most peoples reviews indicate, yet having spent 100 hours grinding cash, Ive had enough. Every time you log in, you will spend the first 20 minutes hopping through servers until at last you find one that has less than 5 players. Why? Because you have a much greater chance of actually being able to finish a mission VIP work, bunker stuff etc.. Eventually though, the server will fill up with people and then comes the inevitable kiddy on his f flying motorbike firing rockets at you, ending your mission immediately, you get nothing. Time to start the mission over again, better luck next time.Theres nothing wrong with allowing this kind of action in a game direct PVP, however the way its been implemented encourages and REWARDS the griefing of other players. The only legitimate way around this problem, making money in game, is to cough up your own hard earned cash to pay Rockstar for Shark Cards, which are pretty pathetic in terms of bang for buck. 50 for 8 mil? Are Rockstar so strapped for cash that we need to get Bob Geldof in for a Live Aid concert to raise funds for this evidently struggling game corporation? Bono can keep his traditional line in the charity single we release.Buy this game for the single player campaign and by all means play online if its your thing, just expect a lot of griefing.
