It is June 2017 and the game still costs 60 USD! ?The online portion is a repetitive grind for the sole purpose of selling in game cash via shark cards. The loading times are atrocious. Cheaters are everywhere.The single player portion is excellent and the best that 2013 had to offer. Pick the game up cheap on console or wait for a sale, the game is too old to be paying launch day prices.
