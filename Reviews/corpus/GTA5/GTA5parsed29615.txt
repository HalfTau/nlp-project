The games fun enough, and while the online isnt amazing mainly because its hard to do a good crimespreefocused openended openworld online game without people going off the rails a ton, the base game is good enough to stand even without mods.Also worth noting that it was Take Two, not Rockstar, that slammed the stop or well smother you in your sleep CD on the modders. Rockstar was pretty much out of the loop there, so dont be blindly throwing them under the bus alongside their craptastic slavemaster. /
