Unfortunatly, I cant recommend this game.Not for the Subtraction of mod support. I never used those anyway.Not for the microtransactions, everything can be unlocked eventually so you dont have to use them, they just make it a lot easier.But the clear lack of any form of support that take two has shown this game in general, whether through customer support, or through rockstars social club.You can wait for days afters submitting a ticket for a response of, Oh we cant do anything.You can get banned for being in the same lobby as a cheater.Single player was abandoned almost instantly.I just cant support this game. Ive stopped playing it so much in recent months. But this has forced me to quit flat out.Sorry GTAV, you had promise. But your dad took you out in the field and shot you before you could reach your full potential.
