Its a good game, but Take Two Interactive has just effectively shut down the modding scene for this game by cease and desisting OpenIV, which has been in development for 10 years and has been endorsed by Rockstar themselves. Until that changes, I can not and will not recomend this game.Edit Take Two Interactive has reconsidered its decision and retracted the Cease and Desist, and Rockstar is talking with OpenIV to help stop the issues the way it should have been done in the first place.
