just when i start getting into the pc version of the game they shut down mods. people wont know what they were missing.having bought and beat this game 3 times now ps3,ps4 and now pc i now have no real reason to replay it.... lameedit Well, it looks like they changed their minds on the single player moding  it makes me happy to know that our voices were heard. I totaly understand why they wont allow mods for gta online, but its the small victorys we should be happy about.
