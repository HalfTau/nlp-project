In my opinion the online portion of the game has just gone toin the past year of more with updates that introduce insanely expensive vehicles that are totally unbalanced and practically force you to either waste your money on  shark cards or spend hours on end completing the most ing boring and bland delivery missions ever which cost millions to buy anyway!Its great If you either have the money to buy shark cards, an unlimited amount of friends that dont bore you after repeating the samefor 5 hours now or if you are a new innocent player who can still buy the cheap,  cars! It would be better if there were more heists where the game actually interacts with you and give you the only fun way of getting money although if you play solo its stillas the online community dont communicate or frankly even know how to play on the level you do and keep bringing you down!Rockstar you need to bring the game back to the basics which used to make it fun and enjoyable and stop being the scummy money s you are! This is all coming from a long lasting player all the way from xbox 360 with around 600 total hours in the game.
