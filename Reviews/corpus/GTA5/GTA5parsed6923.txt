Absolutely beautiful. ThirdPerson, as well as firstperson, shooter, openworld, and now Jetpacks. This game always finds new ways to expand as they add content not very often but still loads to do since of the map size. Drive nice cars based on real ones and blow up your friends like they do to me. Race and customize, its your choice. But one downfall to getting GTA depending on your hard drive is the long a loading screens. Oh. My. God. For me personally this isnt an issue, but what Ive heard and seen, it takes forever, Tip Load story first then online through story. Rockstar loves to mess with you, patching money glitches every single minute, and literally adding more and more expensive veichles every patch.9.5/10 Would Recommend. KhozenOh, and thats just online.I would talk about story mode, but that would take just as much. D
