The singleplayer is decent, the story didnt really impress though as the immersion wasnt great.The problem is in the multiplayer, the only good way to get enough money to buy stuf especially the newer content is microtransactions. Playing missions and heists simply doesnt make enough. The second mayor flaw is that you are constantly killed and hunted by certain players who get their fun from killing other players. At times it becomes so bad that it completely ruins the experience and renders you unable to actually do what you want to do. Because of these flaws i dont recommend this game untill they fix the problems mentioned above.
