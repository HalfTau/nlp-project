One of the main reasons even GTA 4 is still played to this day is mods. I know I even bought GTA 4 for the PC was because of the mods that I would see on youtube. Mods are still being realeased for that game every week on a game that is over a decade old and runs like and because of mods that game is still being ing played. GTA 5 was realeased 3 times, on previous gen, this gen and PC and is the fourth best selling game of all time and only 2 million copies away from being in the top 3 best selling games of all time. A very large amount of people purchased this game on PC due to the ability of being able to mod and then you spit in peoples faces and remove a crucial tool to modding SINGLE PLAYER and then back track and say it was being used to mod online. Not only is this killing your games life span tremendously its also killing a whole dedicated community who worked to improve your game. There are thousands and thousands of mods for GTA 5, car mods, scripts, guns, characters, hell there is even a dedicated community of RPers in FiveM and then you go and give everyone the middle finger so you can milk online some more. You just decided to take away one of the PCs biggest selling points and in the long run killed your game on PC. You have made billions off of this game alone but yet you continually try to nickle and dime your customers and quite frankly its disgusting.
