So, Rockstar or T2 have killed the OpenIV.It was a year 2003 and I was in love with Vice City and GTAIII. Had no internet back then, but we had those pirate warez CDs, and among these were the GTA mod CDs. You want your boat to have naked Candy Suxx sunbathing on top? No problem. Flying DeLorean? Here you go. Oh man, have you heard about this new sht for Vice City, the zombie overhaul? And so on. Weve exchanged with friends, we stalked pirate game stores, we were obsessed with finding more sht to throw onto our GTAs. Then San Andreas came, and with it I first got my hands on the Internet. Free dialup over night, you know what Im up to right after the porn pics. The GTA mods. Download as much as I can, throw everything on CD, share with friends. Then was the GTA IV and ADSL internets for even more modding stuff. Laggy and buginfested, the game got its mods, as always. Now, the devs are trying to kill what I was growing up with.Now Im 25, I dont have that much time to patiently smear mods over my favourite game, but still, GTAO cars and weapons, along with couple of graphical and gameplay tweaks, were a musthave mods after another GTAO patch. I dont even play this shty grindfest, I just want to visit virtual LA and maybe ride some real cars with realistic handling at eternal night time, with a bearable FOV and so on. Unfortunately, marketologists rule the game dev now, so sht like this was expected to happen. Though, Im sure well see a rise of a modding scene again. When GTAO will die, and it will, after the last patch, well see the people enthusiastic enough to pry the game open and mod the hell out of it.For now Ill pirate the latest moddable version and fuk these online flying bikes updates.
