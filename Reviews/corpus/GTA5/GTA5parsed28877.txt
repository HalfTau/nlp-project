Modding wasnt an issue with the other GTA games. Maybe if Rockstar had a better team they could have pervented the cheaters/hackers with GTA Online.With them putting an end to modding for GTA5, I have no reason to play it. Modding kept the game alive for me. GTA 5 was WAS a great game... but now its not worth anyones time. This is all about money and Take 2 wasnt making any off the mods. They have declared that modding is illegal and with that I have uninstalled OpenIV and GTA5. For those who are still playing or new players to GTA5, I hope you can find some entertainment still left in GTA5.
