GTAV is just a damn long grind with a highly toxic playerbase. I mean its a great game if you want to spend lots of time or money on it, but really how many people would do that? A lot I guess. I mean I still do it. Why the hell do I still play this game? I dont know. Its fun to get killed by hackers and modders? I guess I need to rethink this crap. Im just going to finish and post thisreview, Im sure Ill get back to it. Ill get back to it after Rockstar fixes their servers and anticheat. I guess Im keeping this review then. Stop baning random people and ban hackers Rockstar. Theres a hacker/modder in almost EVERY SINGLE LOBBY. How hard is it to figure out a decent anticheat system? Im literally asking because I have no idea. Rockstar could do a lot of stuff better, but Im still playing I guess.
