h1 PLEASE FIX /h 1Rockstar takes my cash that I legit earned myself and they reset it, it was a high amount yes and by what they see its modded. Secondly, MODS!! Modders everywhere and taking away all the hard work by messing the game up and taking your weapons away online and not giving it back. As much as this game means to me, you got to fix it Rockstar, Youve let modders take over the online!! And all you do is ban if there is files incorrect? And shark cards are way too overpriced. We want this fixed. Listen to the community.
