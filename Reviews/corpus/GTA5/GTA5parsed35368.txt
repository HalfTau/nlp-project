Rockstar REALLY needs to do something about the moddersAbout a couple months ago, A friend of mine was suspended for modding when he wasnt doing anything. I was there. Another player was to blame. But Rockstar is ran by people whos only motivation is money. So they didnt care.Just today another friend had the same thing happen. Now Im really angry. TWO of my friends have been wrongfully punished for crap they didnt do. And this appears to happen to A LOT of people. What kind of image are you making for yourself, Rockstar? To me it looks like cold hearted  and only caring about money.Take care of your players better. Its depressing that with all your money you cant do something about GTA online modders who are out there to cause harm. And then innocent, honest players get punished for exploits they didnt do.I am fully aware that this will likely get ignored, but come on Rockstar, this isnt how you run a business. Your fans and customers should come before your paycheck.
