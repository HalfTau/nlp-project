Its really nice to see that Rockstar and Take Two are finally taking action against hackers who, up to the release of this update, made it nearly impossible to find a public lobby to play in where you didnt have to keep an eye of your money counter just in case it starts rapidly increasing and having to force quit the game, or suddenly being teleported to the top of Mount Chiliad and repeatedly killed. Nothing like this has occurred since Gunrunning, making it very enjoyable.Taking down OpenIV was a step too far, however this decision has been reversed, hence the nowpositive review. This game has an excellent singleplayer campaign I havent finished it yet however as well being very enjoyable to play with friends, as long as you dont mind some of the intense grinding required in order to afford even basic luxuries.
