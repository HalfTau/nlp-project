TakeTwo making over 8 billion dollars in just Shark Card DLCs is not enough money for greedy corporate s like them and to put salt in the wound, Rockstar are supporting their decision just because they are the publishers for their games. Even DICE has stood up to EAs poor employee treatement and greedy tactics used in the gaming community. If mods are illegal as Twoclaims, why have the thousands of other developers not taken down MODB, gamefront, jkhub, steam workshop, or any other sources for mod, as well? Grand Theft Auto 5 has been out for almost 5 years now and since Rockstar has put their main focus on the further development just crappy DLCs and hopefully Red Dead Redemption 2, TakeTwo has feels so useless so they take to ing the community which has already resulted in people not buying Rockstars games anymore. BRAVO. I cannot believe the timing of this cease and decist on Open 4. I just recently, despite it being available for aton of years, decided to try it out and to my surprise it was unavailable. That is god awful timing on my part, but also  or corporates side. On behalf of myself and Angry Joe. When the game first game out you done did it good! Now, YOU DONE ED IT UP.
