Story is really good and all, But the online has become so grindy that its  unbeliable. You basically need to grind several hundred ours to get the bunkers and all the gunrunning stuff. I personally like the grind in some degree but it has gotten out of hand. Still love the game and would recommend it even with these flaws.
