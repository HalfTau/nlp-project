I have been playing this game across many platforms and still do to this day but now after hearing the news of mods being done for I am seriously apposed with the decision by take two and it makes no sense for this because people have been using openiv mods for ten years now and to see something this succesful just be washed away by a big company is really sad. I am making this review because I loved playing with mods in the single player and the mods simply made the game better. They would probably argue about modders in online but just step up your countermeasurS to prevent them. Just look at the gta modding community and see how passionate they are about what they create for the game. So with take two removing mods, they just killed the game for many people and got themselfs a hole buttload of negative attention and it will affect them, also without mods in this game it seriously detracts from playing it and for me it just lost about 30 bucks in value.
