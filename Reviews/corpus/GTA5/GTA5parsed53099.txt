Rockstar removed modding due to TakeTwos cease and desist towards the creators of Open IV, which allows you to mod within the game.  This is not okay with me.  TakeTwos stocks fell significantly because of it!If Rockstar is closing down modding, then I am closing my wallet with them. They cannot beat the hackers who will continue to find ways around the secure wall, just so you can make more money, while upsetting the community.Blizzard Entertainment dealt with this kind of issue with Diablo 3s Real Money Auction House that produced a profit for Blizzard Entertainment. They tried to find ways to beat the hackers, and cheaters. But what did they do when they knew they couldnt beat them? They removed the feature of the Real Money Auction House that provided Blizzard Entertainment a soaring profit! They werent being greedy at all!Rockstar in this situation, is just trying to gain more money by cutting a feature that is likely used throughout the entire community. This is not okay with me. And obviously not with the community.I urge them into reversing the cease and desist, and lookout for the communities cries, rather than your own finances in mind.
