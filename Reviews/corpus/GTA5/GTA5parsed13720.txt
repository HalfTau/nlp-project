Pay for only to see urself get harassed by hackers pouring boars on to u, exploding u from no where, trapping u inside a tram, who are inturn immortal and extremely hard to kill, and some who hacks you to turn you into a christmas tree, ufo, and a giant disgusting yellow ball, ultimately stealing all ur cash in hands, Thank god the trick to Solo public session still works to save urself from these annoying hours, and after 1000s of reports being done about those hackers R wont give aabout ur reports, Apart from these issue GTA Online is an extremely unique experience, Setting up heists with random peoples from a session or going on a row with ur Friends, drawing plans to complete em, Racing, arm wrestling, TDM, Plethora of unimaginable but extremely fun modes and missions, the brand new transform races, this is definitely a must buy.GTA V  10/10GTA Online  7/10 Looooonggg Loading times, annoying kids and Hackers/Modders.Rockstar Services  2/100000 yeah its a huge thumbs down for the poor customer relationship and ignorance to exploitersVerdict  Buy it if u want to have tons of Fun i mean it no game wud offer these much stuffs for free never!!! or not buy it if u cant tolerate hackers/modders/kids, My opinion everything in GTA online is tooo dammn expensive, work hard in real to buy this game and even work alot harder to earn gta cash to buy stuffs which are insaley priced, GRINDING GRINDING Stamped alll over again. I would RECOMMEND this game despite all these flaws as long as the solo session trick works, if they patch it out, dont buy it NEVER!!! !
