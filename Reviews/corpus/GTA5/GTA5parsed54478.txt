I love the sinlge player of this game. Ive had it on xbox 360, ps3, xbox one and ps4. I moved to PC a few years ago and again, bought it on this platform. Now, I hate the multiplayer and the fact that they completely ignore the single player is shown by how little Ive played it. About 30hrs of my gameplay is with mods. Well, not anymore, time to make space on my PC and uninstall this game. Well done Take Two, well done.
