Let me start this off by saying my hours are not accurate, I first played this game on ps3 when it was released. Probably around 600 hours total spent on this game.GTA V used to be fun, but it gets old VERY fast. There isnt much to do, online is chaos in the iest way possible, its not worth 60 now, even on sale for 30 its a waste. Pick it up if it every goes on sale for 1520 but otherwise dont waste your money. Its a four year old game. The age shows in everything but the price and the anticheat.Play a fun game, not this.
