this games online is for the most part unplayable littered with hackers with one being in nearly every lobby you play in and it seems that rockstar hasnt put any effort into anticheat systems and only seem to ban the hackers that drop money and the price of the items that are put in the game are so ing high and are clearly that high to force you to buy sharkcards with many of the items being the equivalent of around 50 USD so with that rockstar has only banned hackers that give people money thus making it less likely that people will buy sharkcards all rockstar is trying to do is milk this game for all its worth and they have left all of the fun things to 1. people who have put endless hours grinding out money 2. people who buy lots of sharkcardsrockstar has treated their customers and their fan base likeand turned GTA online into P2W Online
