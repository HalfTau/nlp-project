If youre looking at getting this game you already know what you think of it. Its GTA. Overall the game is decent enough with a fun story and an online mode that, despite the usual problems with hackers and cheats, is a reasonable and fun addition to the main game. Yes its a grind and yes the economy is geared towards either doing that or buying in game currency with real world cash. Unfortunately it seems that this is the way the gaming industries going so I dont know that this game can be pulled up for that on its own. The gameplay itself is reasonably balanced though and is at least an enjoyable grind, especially with friends.However with all that said there is one massive issue that the devs really need to find a workaround for. That is their customer service. Currently their ban policy is to ban people with little to no explanation and no chance of recourse. If you get banned they close up all lines of communication and give you no option to defend your case. After I was recently spuriously banned and reset I found this out firsthand. There was no help from customer service and any attempts to get help from the community were met with derision and accusations. Luckily for me it appears someone is looking into the bans behind the scenes and I have had my account reinstated. While Im happy with the outcome in my case, the lack of an explanation about this whole debacle really doesnt sit well with me. Ultimately, I feel like that experience has tarnished my opinion of the whole thing.
