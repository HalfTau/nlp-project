I gave this game a good review 2 years ago, but as a long time player, that played the game since its launch Ill tell you this about the gamethis game has an amazing SinglePlayer Storyline, with great characters that are relatable and they have great interaction with eachother.but thats exactly what I can cap it off with. a good Single Player.the online on the other hand, used to be fun, on Online before all the CEO, MC crap I had the time of my life. put over 1000 hours on this, like michael said I smuggled drugs I ran wores...in my opinion Rockstar should have stopped at the heists, but T2s greediness got them to produce so much useless content, that the online feature became so tiresome.they really try and shove the shark card down your throat its just depressing, its a good game gone bad. that is gonna lose its fanbase sooner than later due to their greediness....P.S they could have also made more Online Missions, the Lamar missions were fun, they could have made a lot more. goes to show they only give aabout the money and not the fanbase
