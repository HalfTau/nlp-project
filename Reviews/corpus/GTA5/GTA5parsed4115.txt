Yeah...its good. Single player is fun if you have a really good imagination of what you tend to do in the open world. IF YOU DONT, theres always room for dessert, go play online and kill people for no reason. IF THAT GETS BORING. Find some friends and play together its ultimately fun to beable to kill people for no reason as a group... Oh yeah and dont forget to kill players. Have fun!
