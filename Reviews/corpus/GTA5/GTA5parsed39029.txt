well now that mods are finally legal again, I can review this truthfully as possible. Its nothing short of amazing. The world you experience throughout this game is insanely vibrant and usually never gets dull. The story is great but the fact that you can do so much more on top of that is insane. While online is a bit cancerous it still is fun. This is a must buy for all steam users and well worth the 60 dollar price tag.
