I cant believe they actually sued the modding community to attempt to bring out all the cool features R missed in the online, people who make very little if any money off of these mods and bring joy and fun to thousands of players, all because Rockstar more specifically TakeTwo cant stand the fact that these guyss mods are putting their own original creations to shame, yet only barely taking a smallest fraction of the money made from this game, if any at all.
