This game is a broken mess. When I bought it I could play it for a day or so. When I launched the game next day I got stuck on the Rockstar Social Club loading screen. I struggled with this problem for 3 days. I submitted a ticket on the tech support page and did all that I was told to do. They gave me the link with a new launcher but when I started up the game agin I got a redeem code message. I redeemed my code I was given and then it told me that it was already used. The thing is that it was used by me. I tried all the solutions I got and I couldnt fix the game.
