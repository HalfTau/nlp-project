Wow, so I bought GTA5 but apparently Take2 doesnt think that means that I own GTA5, just own a license to use it.It was such a beatiful thing  now destroyed by a greedy company, that is not just immoral but but holds the very community that supports it in contempt.  Take2 doesnt see you as a fan, it sees you as cattle.This crap, on top of the shark card nonsense that sees the cards constantly increasing in price, while reducing how much in game cash you get out of it, is completely unacceptable.Take2 has squeezed this game too tightly, finally time for GTA5 to die.
