This has to be the most greedy game i have ever seen. Hundreds of real dollars will get you, essentially, a few vehicles and houses. EA looks like CDProjekt Red compared to Rockstar. I am basing this review solely on the online mode since Rockstar cares only for the online mode. ALL new content for GTA V is only available in the online mode, and they show absolutely no signs of stopping and making single player DLC. Not to mention Rockstar and Take2 want to ban mods in singleplayer This is one of the worst gaming experiences I have ever played and please...PLEASE...go buy a real game! Save your money on this 4 year old trash.
