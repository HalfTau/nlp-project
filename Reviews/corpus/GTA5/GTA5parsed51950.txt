continuous money grabbing and refusing to improve the online experience unless it affects shark card sales is a huge problem in this game. deciding to use hacking as an excuse to remove 70 of SINGLEPLAYER mods is disgusting, it was only done because people who play singleplayer only are not making them enough money. it really is a sad state of affairs when someone who is hacking money into the game for themself and others are able to taker the moral highground, they have continuously made the game harder to play without buying cash by making everything they add more expensive
