GTA 5 is infinitely fun, infinitely great and massive in both singleplayer and multiplayer modes. If you have a capable PC to run it then it should be the first game you need to buy. Runs smoothly at 60 fps on my 1080ti with all graphics settings set to ultra at 4k resolution, and Im sure it runs well on 1070 and 1080 cards too. The single player story is mindblowing and unforgettable. You can play multiple characters ingame, not just one. This game is Rockstars gift to mankind and should win many more awards on top of the 35 it already won! The only thing its lacking at the moment is native VR virtual reality support. I have a HTC Vive and would love to play it in VR.
