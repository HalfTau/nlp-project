This game is worth, to me, about a dollar per hour to play. Ruling out the terrible online multiplayer experience and the now modless singleplayer, that means that it is worth roughly 30. If Rockstar expects people to still pay 60 for their game, they had better allow mods in singleplayer, and make the multiplayer better.As it stands the multiplayer is a grind to get the coolest cars and guns, it is only meant to push players to spend money on shark cards so that they can get those cool items faster. Fine, whatever Ill just stick to singleplayer, the online community is toxic as you may imagine.But wait, theres more..., and now because there are no singleplayer mods, we cant bring those cars into singleplayer to make that a more fun experience.Rediculous.
