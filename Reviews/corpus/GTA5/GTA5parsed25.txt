Sooooooo... Gta.I LOVE this game. On record, I have about 500 hours, including another account 100 hours to me I started playing on an individual account about 3 weeks after gunrunning. I experienced both Smugglers run Kinda ruined it if you do not have a hangar or a plane and the Doomsday Heist.Gunrunning Good things to save up, but some too OP at sometimes.Smugglers Run UUUUGGGGHHHH... I died so many times from planes, and with the vanilla aircraft Hydra, P996 LAZER and the Buzzard with stuff too fast to kill with bullets, and one shots to you with the damn bombs THOSE DAMN CLUSTER BOMBS! But it isnt too bad. You get to use planes not just to kamikaze or troll, but to use them in missions.The Doomsday Heist I love this one, because I played in the Avenger, a VTOL aircraft. It was amazing. If you have over 10million, go for Avenger and the Deluxo, based on the DeLorean. If you dont like the submarines, go for the Stromberg, an AMAZING submarine car hybrid.So this is worth it!Sy
