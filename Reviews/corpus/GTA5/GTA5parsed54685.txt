Take 2 Interactive are ruining GTA and setting a godawful precedent, Taking LEGAL ACTION against a free Singleplayer ONLY mod.This is being done because Take 2 have a huge hardon for milking people for every penny possible.They hold back/ cancel Singleplayer content in order to push overpriced vehicles.They make massive efforts to ban players that hack money but to nothing to the trolls to run about with infinite health and ammo.Take 2 Exectutive went on record a few days ago saying that We feel that we UNDERmonetise our customers.We all know that the gaming industy is riding the microtransaction bandwagon but this is a step too far, might as well offer T2 our credit card info and they them take what they feel theyre entitled to. Take 2 are greedy, petty scum.I will NEVER spend a single penny on any Take 2 Interactive game EVER again until this move is reversed.
