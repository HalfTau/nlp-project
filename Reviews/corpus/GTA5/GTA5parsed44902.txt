Any game with ingame currency is destined to fail over time. Eventually the consumer becomes a competitor and Rockstar responded with the removal of mods. I honestly enjoy playing this game with my friends. However, Rockstars consistently terrible relationship with the PC community has left me disappointed to say the least.
