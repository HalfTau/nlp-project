Reason for me writing the review is not cause i dislike playing the game including Online. In Story Mode the game doesnt have any major issues from what I have experienced the problem and the reason for thisreview and why Ithis game if you are someone who is like me and likes playing online to the point where this is the first game I have ever bothered with making a review of.The game has so many issues with online and R dont even bother or care for the players to even fix them and these issues have stayed for years.Major connections issues chances that you will even manage to get into a lobby of a heist or any other jobs is low. in which you will just get stuck in a loading screen and will have to restart the game and wait for it to take forever to load up as for me its around 5mins to connect to online servers.Being spammed by your own  phone. For no reason at all you get calls constantly about the same thing. Trying to get you to buy things or do things you will have no interest in. Would be nice to have a setting to turn them off they dont ofcourseHackers... So many in which you have to deal with getting teleporting, getting killed constantly any time you spawn, being camped and cant anything about it since they cant be killed. You can just join another sessions but there is going to be another hacker in which most of the time go through the same thing.So from my judgement if you are planning on getting this game for its online mode in which mine and many other reviews will warn you on is to. R gives zero  and will not change the game to make it playable and one can not expect any support from them.
