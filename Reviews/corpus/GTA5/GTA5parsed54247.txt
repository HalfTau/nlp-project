Aside from the fact that this game was initially launched on PC so long after console, Rockstar and TakeTwo Interactive have made some horrible decisions during this games life cycle.Needs more single player DLC, better optimisation and of course  modder support! Mods extend this games play time incredible and should be welcomed by the developers. This doesnt resonate well with PC players, and is a huge shame considering the base game is alot of fun.Hopefully Rockstar and TakeTwo Interactive change thier decision and support the hard work by the mod creators and community.
