If you do not know why this is negative, read the other reviews. Yeah, I disagree with banning mods. I already owned the game on another platform. I purchased the game on steam at full price when it was released solely for using mods, which now makes this game purchase useless. Thank you, everyone, for standing up to this madness. Actually, if you think about it, it is like buying a new car and not being able to install your own aftermarket air filter or wheels and tires customization. Maybe that is stretching it, but hopefully you get my point.
