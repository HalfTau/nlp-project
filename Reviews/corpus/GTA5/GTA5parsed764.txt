The story mode is pretty good, but I mostly have played the online since it first came out on the ps3. Back then, the community was much more lenient and fun. Perhaps time or the fact that Im playing on the PC has corrupted a majority of these players. Even though it is hard to find good people online, it is fun to jump into from time to time.
