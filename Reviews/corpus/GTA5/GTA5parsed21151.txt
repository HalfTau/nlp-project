I have over 600 hours in the game, and have put a ton of money into online. I downloaded mods over a year ago and used them for like a day. Literally just a trainer in single player to spawn in cars and screw around. I never used it in mulitplayer. Ive had them uninstalled for months then out of the blue got banned, I figured Okay, ill just wait a little bit to get unbanned then just play again. Little did I know, once banned your player gets reset. All those hours down the fing drain. I am now considering boycotting GTA and Rockstar. F you Rockstar, go after the real hackers. And a BIG f you to Take2. Im never purchasing another game from Rockstar again. And I suggest you do the same.
