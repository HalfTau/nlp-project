Single player and the offline mods are solid. 10/10. looks great. That is my only positive thing to say.Now for how I really feel You RockStar. you. Way to be the new EA. Online has become a tradgedy. between  long load times to even get into a peer 2 peer session, once you get there, you likely will be greeted by a modder who trolls everyone and ruins the experience. If you go to find a new session, enjoy that 10 minute load time, and more likely lately connection drop. Time to restart the game and enjoy more load time.OH BUT WINKZY YOUR PUTER MUST SUCK! ahhhh no. SSD, 200D/50U connection and gtx1080i GPU to start. I play with a core group of 4 people when we do manage to get into a decent session, and they all have the same complaints.The modding and connection issues as well as the long load times could be negated by hosting servers. This peer 2 peer t has ruined the experience, and since the game has been out for soo long Rockstar could not give a  anymore since red dead redemption is coming out with loot crates as their new cash cow.Do not be a fool and buy shark cards for this game. Let GTA Online burn in hell.
