fun game until your game freezes and crashes or until you disconnect while doing a race or a mission from online and all the players leave or when you get banned for having money spawned on you. extremely pay to win unless you want to grind while other player constantly want to kill you and ruin your day. poorly optimized so your game crashes because you alttabed out or for no apparent reason at all. one of the only games i have played that crashes without any mods to the game whatsoever. with that being said the content is really compelling and so is the gameplay and it can be fun and rewarding when you get stuff done but these issues are really unbearable at times and i sometimes regret even buying this game 330 hours later. oh and dont forget the 70 price tag.i really hope that gta 6 doesnt make the same mistakes.
