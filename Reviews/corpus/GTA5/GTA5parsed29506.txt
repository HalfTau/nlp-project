So much potential wasted.This game makes me feel sad for few people who seem like poured their sweat and blood into core gameplay just so it would be locked down by mod ban and pay 2 win multiplayer.You might enjoy this game, but the dread of what could have been will haunt you and make this whole ordeal not worth it.PASS
