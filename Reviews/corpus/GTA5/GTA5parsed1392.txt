Spent over a thousand hours playing this on xbox 360Xbox one.I had fun over the years and I eventually got over having to spend hundreds in shark cards since I cant always grind for items in game. Now the only reason I will rate this game badly is that I could not transfer that 1000 hours of progress over to PC.Id expect more from game giants such as Rockstar
