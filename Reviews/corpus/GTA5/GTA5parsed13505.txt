GTA V is the tale of two games. The singleplayer is outstanding and absolutely worth playing. GTA Online, however, is a totally other beast and your longevity depends on one of two things your ability to want to grind ceaselessly, indefinately to pay for each DLCs hyperoverpriced items or how long you can basically troll people before becoming bored of the online service yourself. This is also in the face of Rockstar really struggling to find a medium between stopping modders and not punishing its player base, which it has done so often as of late.The online economy is a huge culprit in this. You really cant ignore the online portion of the game is utterly donimated by 2Ks demand for Shark Card sales which arent going anywhere going forward, it seems. Bear in mind you dont HAVE to buy anything with real cash, its possible to earn the cash through grinding.But youll probably read, if you havent already, the myriad of stories of people giving up on the game thanks to the absolute frustration that is the grind for cash payouts on missions have noticeably been decreased over the years as Shark Cards became more prominent. GTA O suffers from many of the same problems of an MMO without really being one. The only way I could really encourage people to play GTAO right now is if you had friends whod play in a cliq with you. Playing solo gets tedious very, very fast.I love GTA and have played it since the very first, but 2K has done a great job of taking the dream of GTA Online and smothering it in the name of microtransactions. For that reason, I cant recommend the game and even quit it myself. However if your intent is just toaround in the singleplayer, then hell yeah youll have a good time.
