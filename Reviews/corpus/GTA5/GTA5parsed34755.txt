Take Twos buisness model and policies make the consumers out to be idiots who are only useful for their money. Also this whole controversey with OpenIV being CDd is just another ing scummy reason why i can not recommend you to buy this game. A once 10/10 game has turned into a 3/10 game because of their greediness. I hope GTA VI If there ever is one is not plagued by the same t this game is. Anotherr thing, this is not rockstars bidding, this is all on Take Two interactive. RIP GTA 5
