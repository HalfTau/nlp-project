The port for the game is not very good at all. Ive tried many times to get this game working on my PC but I cant fix it for the life of me. Every menu is horribly laggy. The phones textures are broken somehow. The lag in the single player is sporadic. Additionally, almost none of the online features work for me. The game isnt even a game in this state, its just an expensive bundle of frustration.I also have played this game on my brothers Xbox One and I have to say that the new pricing system that Rockstar has been vomiting out is absolutely atrocious. Many of the new vehicles and properties are priced at the sharkcardequivalent of 50 USD. That is seriously ed up.
