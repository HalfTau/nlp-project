Take Two. ITS TIME TO STOP.EDIT This was a review bomb.However due to the new histogram feature, I felt I should update this review.My current thoughts on the game is that Im glad it is getting long term support. I can always respect a game with a long lifespan. I got around 500 hours of gameplay out of this. The thing is, I am the type of player that would rather slowly grind than to pay for content. So due to my dislike for microtrascations, I ended up relizing that my solo CEO warhouse farming strategy was not a fun experience. Therefore I simply stopped playing the game.So when I found out that the modding commnuity was beeing negativly impacted by Take Two, I used the situration to express d my discontent with the payment model of this game. Due to the fact that this payment model of shark cards and paying for content versus achieving it through emergent gameplay, I cannot recommend this game to anyone that shares my taste. In the end, the choice is yours. Thanks for reading!
