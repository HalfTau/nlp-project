This game was worth it back in 2013. Five years later its worse than a F2P P2W game.Online is all that is left of GTAV and its a broken mess.Its impossible to meet the demands of these absurd prices if you have a normal life.Freemode is a Battle Royale Michael Bay movie.The systems of the game chop money out of your bank account even the money you bought for real life money.This is a cash cow and it rips you off. There is no royalty here anymore. Wait for Lezlie Benzies to release the spiritual successor.
