I kindly request the withdrawal of the ceaseanddesist to OpenIV. I have spent a lot of money to play this game across multiple platforms and shark card gifts for myself and friends. I would seriously reconsider buying another game from them if this is how they wish to treat players of the singleplayer experience.Meanwhile, Bethesda is embracing it.Somebody understands good business decisions, and someone else does not.
