Singleplayer Awesome.Miltiplayer Absolute disaster. Hackers and modders are ruining the game for normal players without any repercussion what so ever. Ive expierienced dozens of situations where hackers got people locked in cages at their own houses, droped people from high altittudes, teleported people together and bombed them, stole millions of dollars worth of their money and even got people banned. Changing the session doesnt help since literally every single session has around 24 active cheaters on it that just seek to ruin peoples gameplay, which prooves that the Rockstars anticheating system Assuming that it even exist is failing miserably. I have never seen such scale of online cheating ever in any of the multiplayer games Ive played in my life. If this will not change radically, I guarantee that GTA Vs ratings will continue falling down.Seriously. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
