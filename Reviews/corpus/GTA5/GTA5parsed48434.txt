Take Two be banning Mods. Rockstar is sucking theiron it. RIP Open IV. Weve been modding GTA games for over a decade. And now you think its a problem. Its making people actually buy this pile of crap. Its never been a problem. You over protective aholes. Youre like that helicopter mom that bans his son from going outside. Screw you.
