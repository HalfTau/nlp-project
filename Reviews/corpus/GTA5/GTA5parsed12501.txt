Now Im not giving a bad review from my singleplayer experience Im talking about online.I was banned while playing sumo with a friend I didnt really care since I didnt have too much money on me and no new update was coming out but I do care I was banned for cheating even though I was playing sumo with a friend now I had cheated money from hackers in online games dropping me money for no reason but thats whatever but the fact my friend who wasnt banned but hacked losing millions losing his boat his ceo and his character all together. He was able to get his account back but with everything gone. Now I think rockstar support dont understand how anything works since my friends account was stolen by some russian dude and rockstar didnt give him back hie character no they gave money to the new character that the guy who stole his account made and that wasnt it they only gave him at most 10 mil not nearly enough to restore all what he bought. They continued to be no help and refused to help by bringing his character back. The only way to make any money for him to get even close to what he had is to hope someone will drop money. Because there is no way any of us will do the whole grind again when we get set back to square one. The failure of respecting players time is laughable. If people spawn in money at extreme rates and only can buy one thing with it shows how screwed this system is. False bans and account wipes are crazy out of control. Now do I support hacking in anything in games but this game is unplayable to its full experience since they dont respect your time.TlDr You can get your account wiped by random reasons and rockstar will not help you nearly enough.
