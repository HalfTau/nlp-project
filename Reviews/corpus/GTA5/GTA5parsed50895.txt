Holy  I just watched nerd3s video about gta 5 and take 2 interactive. They ed gta 5 for pc about 2 days ago. Basically, although gta 5 is one of the most selling games in the history of gaming, take 2 decided that they needed more money. So what they did was, they sent a ceaseanddesist letter to those who develop openIV a mod acting as a base for basically 6070 percent of all single player mods in gta 5 to make more people play Gta online and buy shark cards. Gta 5 has dropped to 7/10 on google and rightfully so. They make people play the repetetive grindy multiplayer by handicapping the singleplayer to make more money. ing hell take 2, i really hope that this doesnt happen to other take 2 games like Kerbal Space Program, which also is a very popular game for modding.
