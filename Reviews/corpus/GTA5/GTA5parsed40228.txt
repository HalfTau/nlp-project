GTA 5 has become t... not only has Rockstar added unrealistic and unbalanced vehicles in gunrunning, but now Take Two has banned OpenIV. Modding offline is a massive part of any game that keeps it alive... and in this recent string of events Rockstar and Take Two have completely ruined the game on both single player, and multiplayer. This game and Rockstar are dead to me since they would clearly rather turn a profit on shark cards than appease their fanbase.
