Jumping on the train of hating Take 2s t modding take down. Im glad I got this on a crazy dirt cheap sale months ago. Finished SP which was fun but all felt too familiar, avoided MP cause I hear nothing but bad word of mouth about hackers and microtransactions. Got bored running around SP a day later but decided to keep it installed specifically to start trying out some of the awesome looking mods when I had time.Not now I guess. Pretty shocking they would do this when Rockstar has openly supported mods for ing years. Some of the biggest games of all time started as mods. CounterStrike? TF2? Even new hits like PUBG owe their existence to the support for modding on PC. Ridiculous.
