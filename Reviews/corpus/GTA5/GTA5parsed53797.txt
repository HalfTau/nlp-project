The game isnt bad per se. Its actually pretty damn good, I must say. Its fun, the gameplay is varied and you never get bored.But sending a cease and desist letter to modders? Big mistake my friend.I dont support multiplayer cheating, but singleplayer modding isnt harmful in any way.If you dont support such publisher practice, let your voice be heard.
