RockStar The ol in out in outJumped on for 20 mins one day but, as oftin happens with this games online, i got bored. decided to play a bit the next day, and according to the ban bot, i was hacking. my account was suspended for 30 days and rolled back to 0. I tried calling support, emailing ETC. but apparently all that support was able to do was read a script to me about how cheating is bad and this is happening to me weather i like it or not. needless to say i was frustrated, having put over 3 years of work into my account, and across 2 gaming platforms, only to have it all whiped clean on an assumption. I have never manipulated game code or hacked in anyway, and yet here we are. among other issues thanks for ruining this game. and i have never even used a mod single player or otherwise.
