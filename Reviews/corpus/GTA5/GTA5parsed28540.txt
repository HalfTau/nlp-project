you get banned so easily and even if you are innocent. Hacker can drop money bags on you and you can get ban just like that. And after that all of your progress and things in the game will be reset. Rockstar really needs to get better as a devoloper and needs to get ahead of hackers. Instead of just banning everyone who are got involved. I got banned like that and i didnt do anything. I play a lot of games and none of the games i play, never happenedlike this.
