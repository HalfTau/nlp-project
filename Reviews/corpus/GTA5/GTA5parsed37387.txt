TakeTwos stance on fan created content that contributed to the game as well as their obsession with squeezing every penny out of the customers pockets through microtransactions leads me to say that this game is not recommended. Play it if you have it already but if you dont, dont buy it and sure as HECK dont buy any microtransactions. It isnt worth it.
