I love GTA 5. Cant play as much as id like to but still great game. However, the decision to remove modding tools for the game is ridiculous. I dont even have mods for my game, but its a huge part of the GTA 5 community, and it was the reason i bought the game on PC. Its the same as if games like skyrim would remove modding just to make more money. I call senanagins on all of this and i dont recommend buying this game for the sole reason of punishing this kind of behaviour.
