I wish you could give games a star rating instead of a binary goodorbad.  If I could give it a star rating Id give it 2/3 and please allow me to explain.I bought the game on release day and the single player campaigne is absolutely outstanding.  5/5 without hesitation.  However, online play is now the bigger and more saughtafter part of the game, which is why I rebought it for PC, and I found it to be very grindy and devoid of many worthwhile rewards.  You have to play for hours and hours just to afford even the most basic stuff like a midend sports car or something like that.  The missions are boring and repetitive except for stunt races in my opinion, but they hardly give any payout and a large pecent of the time I was dealing with someone else in my game who was lagging and therefor kinda ruins it for everyone else.I would say if you want this game for the single player campaigne, do it, no doubt about it.  But if youre interested in it for online play, maybe watch some youtube videos and do some research to make sure youre prepared for what youre spending your hard earned money on.
