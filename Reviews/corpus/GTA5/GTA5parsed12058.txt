As all gta games go the story line is pretty good with its humor, I still havent finished it as I never seem to go without getting a corrupt save and couldnt be bothered to redo the same thing over and over again.I only recommend cause it is good.As for the online side, it speaks for itself. depends on how much patience you have with hackers.
