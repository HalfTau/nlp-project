Game was out for over four years. Played for 3 on xbone and thought Hey since its on sale and I havent played it for like a year Ill just transfer my character over! just to find out they removed character transfer for no reason in March, 3 years after the games release.Entirely sure its just a scam to get me to buy Shark cards till I catch up to my old character because from what I remember and experienced the entire game is a frustrating grindfest unless you buy Shark cards.Also Rockstar would rather just punish people who use their exploits instead of fixing the exploits themselves so expect my nontransferred character to get deleted and a Rockstar Death Squad to pay my house a visit soon.Also they ban people who use singleplayer mods now, apparently.
