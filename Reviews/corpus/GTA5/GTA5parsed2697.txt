I Dont Support Rockstars Customer Support and how they handle things. They need to get their heads out of their gloryholes and get to work on doing things right again. This is my only purchase from Rockstar, and I barely even play it anymore, and mostly use it for some Fun Senarios with friends and thats it. Singleplayer Great. Online  Friends only if you have em.
