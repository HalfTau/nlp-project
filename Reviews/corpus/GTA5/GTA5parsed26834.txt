When I first played grand theft atuo 5 on xbox 360 i played it 20 hours straight it was amazing so much about it that i was facinated by but overtime like all games it does get old. Gta v luckliy gets updates so your not stuck doing the same thing all the time and you got more things to look forward to. However now all the updates are for online only and you cant get this content on consoles like xbox one and ps4 so im playing gta on pc so i can mod the dlc content into single player and test it out before i spend my money on it in multiplayer. I also enjoy using addon peds and map editor because I like to explore the work of art that some mod creators have created and released so others can enjoy the game too. However now it seems like Take Two interactive, a former now obsolete game company that created the old 2d universe gta series games is now trying to dictate what we can and can not do on single player. They just threatend opeiv and forced them to cease and desist, which is bullsh. I bought gta v on pc so I could enjoy the bonus of modding and the enhanced graphics but now I have to be under persecution by take two because there now trying to control the awesome single player mods. I cant say how angry I am now with this because now the peacefull gta v modding community is getting violenty attacked by take two.
