Loved the single player in this. But Rockstar and Take two interactive are just milking their customers dry with theirDLC. Now theyre trying to kill modding, which is the only reason why many people bought the PC version. Considering Take Twos CEO stated that they undermonitizing the customers, Im sure as hell not going to buy any of Take Twos games.I cannot recommend any Take Two affiliated games due to their cancerous business practices.
