Single player is great as usual, however GTA online is utterand an absolute grindfest.Their business model is clearly built around getting players to buy as much ingame currency with real money as possible, even going so far as to completely ignore the single player mode when it comes to DLC.Now, with the recent move by Rockstar/TakeTwo which has essentially killed the modding scene for GTA 5 a move which was clearly taken to get more people playing GTA online, this game has been ruined.
