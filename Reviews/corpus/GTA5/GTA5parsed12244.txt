The game is good, the graphics are awesoem but you know what is not awesome about thsi game that has been around for a very long time? There is literally no sign out while your playing to check either your email you use to sign in or to simply sign in with another gta account to steam. Please R fix this so maybe me and many other players who may have lost their emails can get all their stuff back what they lost if lost
