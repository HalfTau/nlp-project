Great Game for goofing around. My only gripe with the game is the lack of contents on the offline part of the game, but the online part is really flocking with features and toys to play with. But even by itself the offline part is really fun to play with.Performance wise, the game ran just fine on my late potato laptop and it run perfectly on my current laptop.9/10  Very Recommended, but need time to enjoy all of the online contents.
