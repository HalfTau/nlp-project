This review is specified on GTA Online.Personality Requirements   Grind tolerance   Passion   Speak russian Too many of them in this gameOptional Have friends to play with or make some via Social Club... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!Pro   A LOT of content. There is so much to do/to buy in GTA Online   Always being updated New Game modes, price deals, etc.   Some nice people to meet if you find them.Con   Veeery expensive prices   Micro transactions, which prices are also absurd.   Hackers, they are everywhere.My conclusionI play this game since the early days in 2013. I saw everything human kind could imagine. My first character has level 686 and is now retired since I joined the masterrace.If you bring up the requirements, you will have a lot of fun in GTA Online. And maybe develop love for this game, like I did
