NO SUPPORT FOR TAKE TWO.Declared modding as illegal.I will not buy any TAKE TWO games in the future and deinstalled GTA 5.Such a delay between pc and concole version and now you want to take us the best part of pc gaming?I installed mods since GTA 3  and it was a motivation to play the game again....I will not support such actions. No money for rockstar and any TAKE TWO game.
