I dont usually leave game reviews here on Steam, mainly because I never really bothered to, but in this case Im opening an exception.In light of the recent events June 15  2017, TakeTwo Interactive is proactively hunting and shutting down numerous GTA V modders and their projects, the most recent one  OpenIV, a tool that allows players to decompress and compile custom content into the game file format. This tool is used for SINGLEPLAYER MODE ONLY, since you are pretty much INSTANTLY BANNED if you modify GTA ONLINE.Not being enough, they decided to FORBID any modding whatsoever to the game  even singleplayer.If my game experience DOES NOT interfere with or degrade other peoples games, why am I not entitled to do whatever I please with the game that I BOUGHT?I can no longer recommend GTA V to anyone, if this foul anticonsumer practices go along nowadays, god knows what they come up with tomorrow to screw your experience and your hard earned money along.PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THESE PRACTICES AND DONT GIVE THESE PEOPLE ANY MORE MONEY.
