The Single Player part is Awsome, and I would recommend it.Multiplayer is awsome, but on the downside is that theres hackers, and grievers. If you want to do the invite only, or friends only you cant do any of the missions on the computer when your character sit down in the chair at the computer. You have to play in Public for the missions that are the computer. Would be nice if GTA V would enable it, so we could play with out going into Public server.I give this a thumbs down on the Multiplayer part.
