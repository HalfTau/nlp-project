RIP over 50 of your playerbase. Good job guys, I honestly hope you learn your lesson with this.The amount of people that use mods that have nothing to do with hacking, such as LSPDFR and put so much time and effort in to ENHANCING OUR GAMEPLAY WITH THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD BE MAKING LIKE DLC FOR POLICE is astonishing. I hope you lose a ton of support with this decision.R E S T    I N    P I S S  ,  S C U M F U X
