Between the terrible cost barriers that make enjoying the GTA 5 online experience nearly impossible,  Shark cards that can run over 100 for 8 million in online purchases Buy a few cars and a building and you are out. This kills the appeal of extended online play and especially the initial online play. Constant game interruptions asking you to buy new property, vehicles etc will kill you in combat if you do not rage quit first. And to take the cake cracking down on the modding community makes the single player mode short lived. This game is not worth the 59.99 that has not lowered after years since release. GTAV has plenty of potential to grow but instead of understanding the consumer they have shot themselves in the foot and reloaded. Dont bother buying this or any other game by rockstar until they fix this
