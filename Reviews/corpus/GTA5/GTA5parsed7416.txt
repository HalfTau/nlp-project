Really fun game for campaign. Make sure that your computer can run the game first, as I had to go in a small tab to run the game on the lowest settings. All I did was add a 1050TI and now I run the game on nearly maxed settings 60 fps. Dont play online, it is filled with hackers. However, the campaign is really fun.
