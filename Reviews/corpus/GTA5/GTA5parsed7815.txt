I have more than thousands of hours on this game including on the ps3 version..This game has awesome single player..realistic open world ..but i gotten bored of it after thousands ofis bad tho but playable..to avoid cheaters and hackers disturbing and trolling you or getting you banned just find a method to play alone in online..either do invite only session or use other methods to play on public lobby without anyone in it..things in online are awesome but super overpriced.They should have included the online contents in single player as well..This shows Rockstar are money minded are expecting microtransactions..most people like Vanossgaming or H20 delirious rarely play GTA anymore because Rockstar just keep on bringing repetitive stuff and expect us to pay for it and then we end up loosing the stuff after getting banned for no reason.Luckily i did not get banned as i always play private sessions..One more thing Rockstar doesnt support modding because they scared that  mod contents might attract players attention towards mod and not towards online..If you still want to mod just turn off your wifi when you are running the game with mods or youre banned..Rockstar also forget about their promise about single player dlc..Overall everythings a disaster..I think Rockstar should abandon GTA online and concentrate on GTA 6 singleplayer content
