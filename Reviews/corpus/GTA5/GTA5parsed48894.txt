So i love this game but Take2Interactive is basically killing the modding community so hence my negative review. GO SHOVE IT T2I!! !T2I gave a cease and desist order to the devs that make OpenIV so you can mod GTA V with that program. Well, i hate to say it T2I, but you just messed with a community and you will regret it. Why cant you guys be like Bethesda? Ever wonder why they are doing much better then you guys? BECAUSE THEY SUPPORT MODS!!!! !
