the only reason i bought this game was so that i could mod it and get constant updates. The online experinece is total crap given that you have to grind hours out of your life to make cash to buy new vehicles is absurd .no one has enough time or encough cash to throw around on sharkcards to do so...and given the recent events of openIv being banned and rockstar constantly screwing us over i feel like i should have stuck with the pirated version
