The game is fun, but keep in mind, this GTA on pc, half of the community has mods and half of the modder are people that like to ruin people days, so if you want to play this game, you better do it in a console, so there will be less modders, or if you really want it on pc, its either, get ready to be fcked by people, or find some friends and do a private lobby...or you can do like me and just laugh at the modders that are trying so hard to kill me, seriously, I have so much fun looking at someone trying to get into my appartement with a jet.
