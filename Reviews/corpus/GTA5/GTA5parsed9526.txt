Extremely Fun Game easy to play. But the game is so old they make everything so exspensive so that high levels who have money cant just buy anything. This means that for low levels and people who have just started playing it takes ages to make money. This causes people to hack and use mods to gain money. I dont have mods but it is easy to just to get someone on your server to drop money for you. Overall fun game that needs some rethinking and redefined controls for aircrafts.
