The graphics look good even in late 2017, the singleplayer story is fun and interesting with a lot of side content and activities. Rockstar payed very good attention to detail which is why this is still one of the best video games on steam nearly 3 years after release. Multiplayer can be fun if you play with friends otherwise its pretty cancerous in random lobbies due to squeakers, hackers, russians screaming at you and downright psychopaths trying to kill everything that moves with overpriced military hardware not available to the average new player. Multiplayer is also a huge grind unless you want to pay more for the shark card microtransactions so keep that in mind. In all honestly I still recommend you try it as there is a lot of fun to be had if you have/find a group of people to play with.
