Talking before the update that made everyone hate it, which is when I quit the game, it seemed pretty good.It ran 40 frames on my craptop, so it was well optimised for an openworld game of the detail level that it had. The controls seemed a tiny bit clunky, but still gave a realistic feel as the pay off. The storylines seemed, for a video game, fairly realistic compared to other competitors in this genre Saints row, for example.The downside is the waiting. Like Saints Row 2, you have to do things before you could start the next mission.But it wouldnt tell you what you needed to do. It just expected you to do them.I never completed this game, because the waiting and dumb chores were terrible. They were increasingly more annoying to complete as the game went on and practically forced me to give up not even mid way through the game. Saints Row 2s infamy system or whatever it was, was bearable to me. I enjoyed it, it made me do all these extra little things that I wouldnt have done other wise. GTA Vs system makes me go to the middle of no where just to complete a task that I dont wish to do, just to drive the story forward in a completely different section of the game.If youre okay with this, or youre here SOLELY for the multiplayer, then I can highly recommend the game to you. If you disliked Saints Row 2 SPECIFICALLY for the system they had in place, then do NOT get this game for the single player experience.I never made it far enough in multiplayer, or online, to truly comment on how well that plays out with heists and such. Ive heard good things, but I recommend staying away from random players from the rumours Ive heard.
