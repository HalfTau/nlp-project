I mean, the this game is pretty good for what it is. GTA Online! Its unique, looks good, plays well. The modding community are upset that they arent able to mod anymore.. Whatever. Why waste your time modding when you might as well build your own game? I dont get it. If you wanna play it for the story, its worth the money. If you wanna play it as an open world MMO? Yeah, its one of its kind. GO FOR IT.
