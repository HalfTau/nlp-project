While this game started out as fun initially, its best to avoid GTAV as well as any other games from Take Two Interactive in the future, due to extremely draconian stances on mods.The multiplayer also has extreme grinding issues, making it incredibly difficult to progress in the game without paying even more money to buy ingame cash.
