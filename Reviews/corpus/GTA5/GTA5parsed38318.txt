Fck rockstar, take two and this game. Firstly these greedy s dont let you play this game that you paid for offline because they think were all pirates so dont want to loose that less than 1 revenue from the pirates meaning if my or your internet goes down we have to pay the price and cant play this  game AT ALL. Then they wont release real DLC for the story focusing on the money with GTA online which is a pay to win not even gonna go into it i would be here all day. And now they decided to remoive all fun from this boring piece of trash game by stopping modding!!!! This has only been done because they think oif people cant uise mods they will have to go on GTA online, therefore paying out the ear for ingame money as thats the only way to getthere. So take two and rockstar you can Fck off im done with you, you treat us likeso im never buying any of your crap again and anyone reading this shouldnt either.
