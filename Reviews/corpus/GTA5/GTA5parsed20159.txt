A good game plauged by microtransactions.The singleplayer of this game is really nice. Being able to swap between 3 characters at any time and do story that was made just for them is really nice.Multiplayer is great if you have too much money, or too much time. And when I say too much money, I mean hundreds of dollars to spend on this game. I havent spent a dime past the 30 dollars to get the game, and Ive had fun getting to where I am now.In summary, its a great game if you have 3 friends and time.The Take 2 openIV stunt was pretty bad, but its not a reason to hate a game I enjoy so much.
