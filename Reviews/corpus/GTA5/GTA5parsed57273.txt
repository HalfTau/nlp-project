I bought this game on the 360 back when it first came out and loved it, so when I switched to a PC I bought this so I could add some more replayability through mods. Now Take Two has spit in the face of its consumers with its cease and desist order against the Open IV a fantastic modding tool used primarily for single player mods, mods for which Rockstar has expressed support team and other notable singleplayer mod developers.The game still has a fantastic single player experience that I wish I could recommend to anyone, but the company that owns the game doesnt deserve our support. The online multiplayer is toxic and so fueled by microtransactions that it takes hours of painful grinding in a community filled with trolls and hackers to get anything special, or you could buy it with your own realworld money like so many of its annoying pipsqueak players who have nothing better to do with their allowance. Add that to the infamously bad customer support and the equally bad anticheat system which has autobanned players for using services such as teamspeak while actual cheats get off scott free, and its apparent where the decisionmakers priorities lie  and its not the gamers.Mods made the game worth it for me after all these years, since I lost interest in the multiplayer ages ago, but now that theyre cracking down on them, Id recommend you go spend your money elsewhere, with a company that really respects you as its consumers.
