Ive been a GTA Player since GTA 2 on the original playstation. Ive bought multiple copies of almost every title through the years. I will not stand by Take Twos action against its playerbase. This is a huge slap in the face of the community, and if their actions arent reversed, I wont continue to be a consumer of any of their products in the future.
