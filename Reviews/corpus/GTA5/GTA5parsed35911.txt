I played this game when it launched on PS3. I beat it, and put in hundreds of hours in online.I then bought it for next gen ps4 because I couldnt really afford a new rig to play this game at the time, On ps4 I put even more hours in, ranking my character up to level 200Finally, the whole reason I build my current PC GTX 1080, AMD Fx 8350, 16gb Ram, 2tb HDD was not only to be able to run THIS game on max settings, but Knowing there would be a vast modding community. And slowly but surely there was.Then...One by one, just about every ground breaking mod recived cease and disist letters from Take 2 Interactive rockstars parent company with the intentions of bettering their online communityThe final nail in the coffin was ceasing the production and FREE distribution of the GTA V and GTAIV modding tools known as OpenIV. Now the game is modless, and the creative community is taking the bullet.Take 2 does not care about the community, all they care about is how much profit the game takes in through the games virtual curancy known as shark cards, and mods such as 5M were a threat to that income.The only good thing that has come from Take 2 as of recent was the cease and disist of online haking and greifing tools players used to have an unfair advantage online, as well as inplementing a better hack detector in game.But why do single player modders have to suffer? Because of greedy corperations thats why.If you are buying GTA V on PC just because you havent played it yet. GO ahead! Single player is great and multiplayer is nonstop fun. But thats all.A year ago, I would have given this game a 10/10 reveiw... but now, I cant even rank it...It is just not worth it if you already played it or own in on other consoles.
