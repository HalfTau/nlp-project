I used to LOVE GTAV, id play it every night for hours.That was until they made it pay to win. you can lose money in the blink of an eye. Its all the ing time that I get chased but a 13 year old kid with a flying motorcycle with a jet and ing rockets.whos idea was it to put OP vehicles that can destroy you in a second.What the  are you doing Rockstar?
