I have grinded out this game in online mode for over 500 hours, done countless missons, countless races and had many fun times with friends. Then, out of nowhere, I get a 30 day suspension and GTA online progress reset. For being an honest player. Dont get me wrong I have been in lobbies where hackers are throwing money at you but having never hacked myself. After a a few days however rocjkstar contacted me saying they had reviewed the ban and lifted it. Reinstating my account. I appreciate that ban first ask questions later is a good control system but it still caused me much frustration.
