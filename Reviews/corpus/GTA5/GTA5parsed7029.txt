I purchased this game on Xbox 360, again on Xbox One , Again on Ps4. Now that ive finally built a PC i purchased it on Steam only to find out that they no longer allow you to do character transfers. Gta Online is absolute garbage until you level up and unlock content. Im not going to start all over FOR THE 4TH TIME!! It needs character integration.
