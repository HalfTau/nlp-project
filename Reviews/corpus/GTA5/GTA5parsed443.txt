I bought this game for the story line, and enjoyed the single player story line. It was unique, in its style of character choice and its impressive character development.Online however, I was definintely intrigued at first, and felt I really liked it. But the reality is I dont. Every session has someone who has modified the game or has hacked it. There seems to be no means of enforcing the rules against these hackers and it simply isnt fun. This is only of course after your game takes forever to load the online section of play. Then if the modder/hacker decides to manipulate the game where it crashes it on you, then you have to reload the entire process.Its upsetting.For the single player however, I would recommend the game.
