Cant even play the singleplayer because I for some reason cant connect to Social Club.I assume Ive been banned for cheating since the last and only time I played online a dude spawned a bunch of money on me. That seems to be the reason why most people get banned so I assume the same thing happened to me.On a side note, Take 2 Interactive has fcked over almost the entire modding community.Mods is one of, if not the, biggest reason to get the game on PC in the first place.
