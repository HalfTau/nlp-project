this is a love hate relationship. If you want to grind for 600 hours for 20 million ingame dollars including Criminal Mastermind, which is difficult and stressful af only for for rockstar to take 12 million because of unwanted modded money being thrown on me from the army of hackers that they cant seem to fix or dont bother to try. Also yes I tried to grind legit because if I get modded money the game is no longer fun for me.
