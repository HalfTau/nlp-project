I have 150 hours on record. If that changes, I would be amazed at this point. I preordered GTA V back in 2015 when the PC port came out. I was ecstatic. I played through the pretty decent story, and started to play online. Back before many of the shark card changes, inflation, and updates that made your wallet drier than the gobi desert. Back then, I was in love with this game.Since then, Rockstar has taken our game, and completely soiled it. These greedy moneygrabbing s that work at Rockstar gamed us. We paid 60 for a game. 100 gets you 8,000,000 of in game currency. Do you know what that gets you anymore? Nothing. A few fastish cars, maybe a yacht if youre lucky, and thats it. 100 for 4 or 5 3D models, many of which you wont drive or use because youre spending the rest of your time grinding missions for every penny they give you. Normal missions yield you chump change compared to what they used to.Dont give any money to this greedy joke of a company, theyre like your crack dealing cousin who always needs money. Its disgusting. I will never purchase anything from these extortionist jerks again. When I pay 60 for a game, I DO NOT expect to spend a DIME more for in game content. Gaming has been ruined by companies like Rockstar.
