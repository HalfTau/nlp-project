If you consider buying this to play online, please reconsider.They will ban you permanently for no reason at all and tell you that you cheated for just playing normally and it is no point to complain if they deleted your character for no reson because they have a  no customer service policy on that kind of thing.So if you wanted to play this online you will get a taste then they will take your moner and screw you good after investing at least a 100 hours of gameplay.Thank you very much rockstar, i used to like your games but you are on the wrong track and it is getting worse.Games are about having fun, NOT stealing money from people and ignoring them when they ask why.So the online part is full of cheaters and the customer service is just the worst i have seen in many years and i mean the WORST, but you are the one to get banned for it.Not recommended.
