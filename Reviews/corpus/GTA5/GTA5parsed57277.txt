Gta V was a great game, I loved every second of it. Gta V online ruined it. Its buggy and broken and drowned in microtransactions trying to get more money out of those who already paid 60 to play. Gta online has received numerous updates adding plenty of new content, but none of that has been added to singleplayer, leaving people to mod it in. During e3 of this year, rockstart sent out a cease and disist to mod creators, destroying the modding comunitee of this game, and going against many of the players who bought the pc edition soley for modding. Good job 2k, you had one job and you screwed it
