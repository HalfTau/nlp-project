With TakeTwos clampdown on mods, which make up a huge and, to many, completely integral part of the GTA V experience, I cant in good conscience recommend anyone purchase the PC version of this game on that basis, nor can I excuse TakeTwo for their inconsistent and boorish behavior with regards both to eliminating mods and vastly expanding the realm of microtransactions and monetization within their games.
