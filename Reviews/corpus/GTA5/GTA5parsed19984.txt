really good open world, my problem is with the stock market, the online loading time and ease of usenot easy to figure out multiplayer but u can get there.the stock market you can only access when on a good wifi network.as for online loading, that is self explanitory. however, when playing single player on wifi i noticed when moving really fast in a car that the textures were constantly updating and i had to stand still while it loaded.only happened on mid to low level connections, so now i try to play with wifi off. which in turn disables stock market, which REALLY sucks other than that its really good and what you would expect from a gta game.
