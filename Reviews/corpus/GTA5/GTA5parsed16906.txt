Meh not bad, Single Player is good but when it comes to MultiPlayer, Oh boyI mean its not bad that the DLCs are free but youll need like millions just to buy everything that comes with one DLC which can make it kinda p2w, unless u wanna grind your A on the heists and hit.Even for all of this, i still prefer GTA IV, it has actual physics and alot more which can make it better than GTA V, and if you think that the graphics arent that good o GTA IV go get some ENB mods and youll be amazed.Sp my conclusion is to not buy GTA V unless you wanna try the SP, but yea i still recommend it just cuz there wont be any other GTA game for years.
