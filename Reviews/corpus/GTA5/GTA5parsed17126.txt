Dont get me wrong I have lots of pointless fun in this game.  Unfortunately griefing modders make this game pretty tough to enjoy. Usually bad stuff happens when the stakes are high and there is a modder. Cant say it hasnt benfited me in many ways but Rockstar created a monster and it has lost control.
