I love this game so much... Ive had this game for 3 days and i have 22 hours already. The one bad side is there is ALOT of hackers and modders. I dont mind them but it can get annoying sometimes when they god mode and can 1 shot you. But i just leave the lobby, another bad thing is its very and i mean VERY annoying and grindy just to get to LV 20. But again its fun with friends but alone it gets boring really fast if you dont know wtf you are doing. But if you have friends and dont mind cheaters i highly recommend this game lol.
