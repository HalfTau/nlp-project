Ive had several issues not technical with this game in the first place, all of which being over GTA Online.To start off with, I did like the single player and probably the only reason I have 200 hours put into the game, fluid story with some very memorable characters, polished gameplay, the whole nine yards.But the amount of lies and t that became GTA Online was simply astounding, you thought No Mans Sky was bad? Rockstar promised that Heists would come with Online either immediately or a short time after. Que a year and a half later and they finally added it into the game. But what flabbergasts me the most is the absolute disregard for the playerbase, GTA Online is not a game or the online counterpart to such, its a moneymaking scam mascerading as a game. Everything, literally everything, is made to make you waste hours upon hours of your life to get menial upgrades/vehicles/houses/garages/whatever due to the abhorrent time/reward system Rockstar uses as a template. So naturally they have Shark Cards, which cost real money and are the ing worst cancer on the planet 100 ACTUAL DOLLARS gets you ONLY 10 MILLION in game currency, which if you havent been keeping up on the prices for items in GTA, goes by so quick that its literally worthless, hence why I say this game is a scam, plain and simple.If Rockstar continues to try to  over players who just want to play the game and not waste hours upon hours getting stupidto get what they want, then I do sincerly hope its the next gaming company to go under, the talent can be used by actual game devs, not greedy s.
