This game was already shady with its microtransactions but removing mod support for one of the biggest franchises in gaming in history is truly criminal.Things I hate about the game that I didnt bother clouding my judgement, but now I do Very bad GUI Frequent disconnects from servers Cheaters everywhere Too much focus on monetization Instanced based, nothing is seamless Police is all seeing, all knowingWhen Rockstar is done swimming in their giant pool of cash and decides to reverse this change than I will revisit and change my review. Until then, this review will stay.
