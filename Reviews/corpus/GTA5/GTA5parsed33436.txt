When this game first released it was fantastic. Since then they have ruined the game with shark cards and not supporting single player at all. The gta single player experience is what the IP was built upon and is what I personally enjoyed the most. I was able to mod my game to get the content rockstar should have added in the first place. Through greed that have banned the modding tools that allowed me to do so and I am livid.
