Wait, so this publisher/developer combo cant prevent people from being banned from their mediocre online service due to OTHER people hacking in the same server, but they can threaten to sue modders who make the singleplayer game more bearable? Nice. Real nice. Protip for you, TakeTwo and Rockstar The weeks preceding E3 are the worst possible time to do something so blatantly hypocritical and anticonsumer. Anyone reading this, I dont know if Rockstar was involved or could have done anything to prevent this, but they use a publisher who does not deserve your money.
