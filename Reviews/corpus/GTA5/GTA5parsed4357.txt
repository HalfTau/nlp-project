This game is simply outstanding! What more can be said? Rockstar never misses a detail and finds way to slip adult humor into mature themes. This open world sandbox can be enjoyed through the storyline or perhaps your like me and slip off into the occassional daydream aka a killing spree with an insatiable appetite in which i am only awakened from when i die and realize hey thats not where i was supposed to be going. Either way you will be more than satisfied with this epic saga. I cant wait to see what they do with their next installation fo this game!! !
