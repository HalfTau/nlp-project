Online is fun but gets old extremely fast due to the grindfests required to buy literally anything 50,000 for cosmetic items, really?, And people that sink real dollars into the game get a huge head start with their arsenals of overpowered and expensive BS. Heists need to pay more for how long it takes to get the people, load through all the levels, prep for everything, and INEVITABLY redo whole sections if any of your team isnt 100 there. Hackers still exist and are irritating.Good with friends, unenjoyable alone.
