congratulations Take Two and Rockstar, you just managed to turn the biggest part of your pccommunity, and especially the modding community against you.you got some great company though, with EA, Ubisoft and the newest member BethesdaZenimax.so, on top of basically banning modding with your ceasedesist letter towards the openIV team, you deliver the most horrible PvP oriented DLC for gta online yet with the gunrunning BS.way to go, really...
