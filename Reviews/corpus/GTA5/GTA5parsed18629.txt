Here are my Pros and Cons for this game. This is just for the GTA Online, though, not GTA story mode.PROS Invite Only/Closed Session where you can play with friends or by yourself and not have to worry about hackers. Besides the semiunrealistic gun sounds, the graphics itself is impressive! So, I grade it 8/10. Golf solo or coop, and Tennis coop! The missions that you can do, either by yourself or with friends, are really REALLY fun! Beautiful vehicles cars, trucks, motorcycles! You get to own vehicles, and various abodes bunkers, apartments!CONS No Punkbuster! No dedicated sessions! Thankfully, there is the option to join your friends. Still, that doesnt make me any happier! Love dedicated servers/sessions.PERSONAL RATING OF GAME 8/10
