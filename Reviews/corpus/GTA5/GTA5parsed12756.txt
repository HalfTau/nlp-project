TLDR  RockstarThis Singleplayer is one of my favourite campaigns in GTA history.However, The multiplayer is so bloody broken, there are 3 ways to earn money in this game1 Grind Money2 Buy Shark Cards3 Be a Hacker1  Grinding Money  You cant do this because rockstar will give you a warning and not give you the money because they think youre a hacker.2  Buying Cash  Theyre quick enough to take your GTA and your actual money but slow and the give out.3  Hacking  From the look of public lobbies, this is the best way forward considering ing hackers run the online and Rockstar bans innocent players instead?
