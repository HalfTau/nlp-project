This game was and to a degree still is a great game, however I urge anyone contemplating buying this game to hold off until TakeTwo undoes their decision to banmodding. Partly because of the gross dishonesty used to defend their decision, stating that this was done to reduce cheating in GTA online, while their actions dont affect anything but single player modding. But mostly because there is absolutely no reason why single player modding should not be allowed, players of modded single player do not hurt anyone.Edit TakeTwo went back on their decision, good job. Dont get me wrong, I still hate their guts for this, but the game is great again.
