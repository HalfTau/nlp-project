When will Rockstar learn that sure, they made a big game with lots of stuff to do, but none of that is fun or rewarding? The The modding community kept this game alive more than any of your seasoned updates with outrageously priced toys ever did. You had a gem, and you turned it into a mud clod. Great job.Sincerely,Every GTA V Owner, ever.
