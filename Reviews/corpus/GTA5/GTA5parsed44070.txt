Literally the only reason I bought GTAV was because of the LSPDFR mod through OpenIV, a single player mod that in no way affects anyone but the modder. I played through the campaign on Xbox and modded the pc version never went online. Now that I cant play with the mod I have no use for the game anymore and no reason to support any new releases unless modders are given their value back.
