It was a decent game, until the micro transaction enforcement came along. Now you either pay 20 to do anything, or you have to grind for an really long time. Went from 8/10 to 0/10.Also, they shot down the modding community, which was 9/10 of their player base.Good luck recovering from this Rockstar...
