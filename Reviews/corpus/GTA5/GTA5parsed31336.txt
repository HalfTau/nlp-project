If i could request a refund, i would. I bought this game for the mods. The fact that they probably want you to pay for mods is so ing snakeish. SO you ban mods? i dont think you remember what happended last time someone tried to mess with community modding. So buckle up rockstar. you didnt want to loose money? guess what? Its way too late for that. Rest in peace gta5
