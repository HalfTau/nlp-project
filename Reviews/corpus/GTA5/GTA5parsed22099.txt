At the start, the hacking was justified becasue the game had just come out on pc, there will always be hackers at the start. Hell I had hacks to give myself god mode so I wouldnt get killed every 2 minutes by an 8 year old. But after some time it got annoying. I was given a soft ban for no reason, assuming it was because I was given a lot of money. Then Rockstar changed their policy, and I was banned again, this time was again because someone decided to give me money in game, this caused me to start straying away from GTA V because they wiped my account, and my countless hours I took to get my vehicles and apartments was for nothing. I decided to log on and try out the new dlc heists and what not one day on my brand new just recently wiped account, an hour goes by and what happens? A hacker joins the lobby and starts dropping millions on every player in the lobby, just as I go to find a new lobby the permaban message pops up... I have literally no respect left for rockstar at this point. Fix your  game you s
