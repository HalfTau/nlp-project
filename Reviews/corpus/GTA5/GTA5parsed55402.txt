Once a game is purchaced it is owned by the player and they are able to modify any single player aspect of the game that they want. Take2games, the owner of Rockstar and thus the ownder of GTAV has given a cease and disist letter to a mod program that allows players to mod the single player campaign of GTAV. Unacceptable.
