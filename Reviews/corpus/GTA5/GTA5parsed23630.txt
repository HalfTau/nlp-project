I played GTA Online for hundreds of hours building up my character. I played every heist except the prison heist because  that only to be banned for using a mod... in SINGLE PLAYER... i used a mod to give me money in single player and found everything working great and went ahead and baught everything. I went back and turned the mod off so i could go into online only to find my account had been banned a few minutes before that. Im absolutelybeyond belief. And now they attempt to BAN SINGLE PLAYER MODS which make the game worth playing for me and many others who have been banned without warning and without reason. Luckily the internet shut that down but itll still never make up for the false bans. The team of GTA Online is a PLAGUE on gaming who ignore the people who use mods to troll, and ban the modders who just want to make their game more interesting. I just wish i didnt waste my money on this crappy game.
