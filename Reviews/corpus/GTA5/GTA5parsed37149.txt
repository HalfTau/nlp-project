Take Two and R are absolutely horrid companies. This game isnt even all that good. The campaign is entertaining enough, but there is a lot of busy work fetch quests and filler content in between the meaty story missions. Once you beat the single player, theres not a whole lot of replayability left, especially now that the published has killed off the modding scene. Save your money and get a better game instead.
