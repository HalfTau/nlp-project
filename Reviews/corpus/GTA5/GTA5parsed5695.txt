Loading screan simulator 2015. Honestly if you get it at a discount it is totaly worth it if not for anything else it is worth it for the story mode. The online part of it is honestly ed. Its super confusing to start playing i literaly had to watch tons of tutorials on how to do anything at all and after watching and reading ing everything about thishole i now know the secret on how to enjoy the online part and it is drum roll !!!SHARK CARDS!!! so yeah if you want to not grind and enjoy online to its full extent you will have to bring your wallet. Otherwise probably one of the coolest sandbox games ive played. The races are pretty cool aswell.
