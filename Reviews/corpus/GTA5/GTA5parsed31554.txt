This game was incredibly fun,  but as you all know take two and rockstar recently banned mods.  In light of this Ive been thinking of their free DLC the last 3 requiring you to spend significant amounts of money to even access the DLC missions at all,  the most recent, Gunrunners,  needing MILLIONS. I understand the companies want to continue to make money from their game,  but the level at which theyre currently   sucking money from their players is disgusting.  I would have to spend 100 or more to fully experience the most recent DLC. That is out of hand.
