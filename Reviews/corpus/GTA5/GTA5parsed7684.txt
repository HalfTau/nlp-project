Banned for literally no reason that I am aware of, and my lvl 195 character is going to be reset. All my assests will be deleted, making all of the time I spent on this game a complete and utter waste. I was not modding, was not interacting with a modder, and have no clue what I could have done to result in a ban and reset.Based on what Ive read on the rockstar forums, this has happened to hundreds of people and rockstar will not even listen to their appeal. Some say it is based on background programs you have running, others say it is a code error in rockstars anticheating software. Either way, Ive lost 90 hours of gameplay... and I literally just bought a shark card today... what a waste.Needless to say, I will never purchase or play another rockstar game in my life. NEVER.
