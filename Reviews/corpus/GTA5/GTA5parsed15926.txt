well the game used top be good... then rockstar saw dollar signs. Myself and our community took advantage of the rewards and bonus money on the missions for the update.. while staying away from public lobbies to escape the modders as you do if u want to do things the ligit way, yet the update gets released and they still decided to take a few million of mission grinding money to try force us to buy shark cards. bad move guys, if its getting money is all you care about the what you are doing is complelty counter intuitive. not very bright are ya rockstar. oh and notice how all the loyal players over 100 hours review is vs players under 100 hours... nice touch messing with your game reviews.would have recomended this game years ago.. would not recomend it now to save a life
