Story Fun with cool characters, I like FranklinOnline Endless money grind, destroys your sociallife, modders, hackers, etc.Funfact For some reason it fails to save my game so I cant get money or do anything online or in the story mode because I chose cloud saves over local. They deadass want me to call my ISP and they want my personal IP info and everything about my computer to help fix the problem. Damn.
