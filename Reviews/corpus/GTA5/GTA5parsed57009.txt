You need to seriously reconsider where you are heading as a company before I will ever purchase from you again. What people do with their own game should be up to them, and the idea of banning people permanently from the most up to date part of the game is laughable when they have bought the game. If you dont want people to modify game files or to cheat, then dont make it such a grind to get certain items when the point of the game is supposed to be fun, not work.
