A constant mishmash of button smashing, and aimbots. At least it feels like button smashing aimbots. Im sure some of the players are actually that skilled.Most of the DLCs are of no value. The only decent one, in the entire game is the CEO update, and that one requires far too much grind to enjoy without wasting actual cash.The only good DLC is the car theft one, as you can actually have a few moments of Zen driving around. The moto DLC is only good because of the bikes, picking up product, and managing the business is entirely garbage. Only the deliveries are enjoyable, and you need to spend so much time to get to them, that they have well worn out any glimmer of the hope of fun that they once held.Bikes are fun, choppers are fun. Most of the cars arent terribly impressive.You people need to take the grind out of this game, and a lot of the trash. The torture scenes were a joke it was like a shill piece for the waterboarding debacle. As if to convince me that well sometimes torture is just a necessity. It was a petty bald face attempt at desnsitizing people. The whole game is like those scenes, white washed garbage, with a little bit of fun thrown in.Shills, make your game great. It is possible.
