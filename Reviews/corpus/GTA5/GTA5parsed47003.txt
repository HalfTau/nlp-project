Take 2 interactive and Rockstar Games really do not know how to treat their customers. A 60 game turning into a microtransaction hell, with transactions being just as or more expensive than the game itself.And then this modding debaucle. Sending a cease and desist to a group of modders who have maintained the same program for the same game series for 10 years !, only as a function to front their microtransactions and remove competitors.Brilliant game, but awfully maintained. you, Take 2.
