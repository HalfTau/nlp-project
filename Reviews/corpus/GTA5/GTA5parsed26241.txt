I love the game but i reaaaaaaaly dont like rockstar. They are just milking content from this game and making everithing so expenssiv that its almost inpossible to have fun without modding. Atleast alittle bit of modding.And al because they want us to buy shark cards. And the stroy mode is okey ish nothing like the old gta 4 tho.This game isif your not ritch or have the free time as a 4 year old.
