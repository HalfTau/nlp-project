Game itself is fun just the way Rockstar release free dlc for the game that costs 1 Billion for each vehicle and takes too long to grind for money unless you want to pay for shark cards of course? NO DONT ING DO THAT IT ING GOES IN 2 SECONDS BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS SO OVERPRICED. Cancer players in the game using explosive weapons and constant bm over the chat. The only reason why I play this game recently is because of the racing. Me and my mates just jump on and do a couple of races and its a blast. If youre getting this to play by yourself you might as well rip youroff.
