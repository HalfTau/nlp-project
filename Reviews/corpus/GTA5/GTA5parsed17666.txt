I have bought countless shark cards on steam. Yet when a new dlc comes out you remove money from my account today April 25 830pm i logged on to find 2,687,254 missing from my game I have played over 849 hours on this game and I dont see why it was correct to remove that money from my account. I would like to c that money back in my account before the new dlc comes out. My friends and I are really having a hard time on pc when this and hackers impede our progress in the game. i dont pbelive it is fare for rockstar games to remove money like this and leave no way for the game to fight back. do not buy this game. plz leave comments and stroys here
