Single player is very well don, the characters have unique personalities and the story is well written. I loved Franklin, Michael and Trevor and their struggles.Online is good to play with friends, but solo and poor not so much. Plus all the leaderboards are plagued with hackers...and many griefers in public sessions... sad...And the vehicles have a better handling than the last games, except for the helicopters that with mouse and keyboard is terrible.
