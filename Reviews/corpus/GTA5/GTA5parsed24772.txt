I used to love the multiplayer to this game, and i still like the singleplayer. However, i would not recommend the unexpected and, frankly, dumb choice to ban mods that have been here since ever. The multiplayer has been the bread and butter for my friends and I.  But they seriously ruined the fun by the horrindous amount of grinding to get new stuff. You get enough money for the old cars and houses, dont get me wrong, but the new expansions price for entry is way too damn high. Millions of dollars to just start the bunker, and more to get the truck. Friends cant use your bunker to get anything and having them as associates gains them nothing. They really want you to buy sharkcards if you dont have a lot of money from the previous events. The grind has taken its toll and we were sick of it. All of this annoyed us out of the multiplayer, but them banning SINGLEPLAYER mods that have been here since launch? Makes no sense. Take Two said they wanted to take down modders that have plagued the online mode and made their sharkcards useless, but it just alienated the fan base. If you honestly just wanted the campaign and did not care about mods, go ahead. I just cant see this as having respect for its players, though.
