I mean, you know why Im leaving this review. Im jumping on the band wagon. Modding is an integral part of what makes this, and many, games awesome, and repaying your loyal fans by cutting off their creativity in an attempt to wring your customers wallets dry just isnt on.The game is awesome, and so are the people who made it, but the people behind this scheme absolutely suck.
