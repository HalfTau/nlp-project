Game has awesome potential but...somethings missing. I remember a day when developers cared about their games and not just solely about money. This company is about greed and doing as little work as possible with the intent of getting the maximum amount of sharkcard sales possible.What brings this game down isCEOs/VIPS/MC make all the money, associates barely anything.Online is full of Hackers/Modders/Griefers It is way too grindy. Good money making methods are limited to grinding heists / I/E / passive bunkerRockstar takes money from legit players while hackers get a slap on the hand.I really want to like this game, however I feel their intent is 100 money and 100 disregard for the quality of the game. It has too many bugs and lack of QoL improvements.
