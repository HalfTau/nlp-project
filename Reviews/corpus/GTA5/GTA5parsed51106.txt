ONLINER and Take 2 done ed it up...Ive personally had it with the shark cards and the hackers and the ing expensive dlc ingame money that you have to grind and grind and grind to make money because their rewards are even in heists.They want you to buy those ing cards so they made the mechanics and activities a grind fest in purpose.Do not justify saying the dlc is free ffs... since launch theyve been top 5 in sales all the time and made an absurd amount of money. They dont need the Shark Cards to survive or to cover dlc cost.I would rather pay 5 and maybe 10 for the DLCs. Why pay when its free you say? because right now you have to grind so much or either buy the  cards which would cost you a lot more than 10 to get millions and buy stuff from the DLCs.So,  the current state of online. Moving on.OpenIV SituationShutting down a tool that has helped and created material for your community for a decade is figuratively taking aon your content creators and consumers.Seriously,  Take 2 because Im pretty sure they push for these atrocious milktheconsumer changes and also  R for letting themon a previously AMAZING series.
