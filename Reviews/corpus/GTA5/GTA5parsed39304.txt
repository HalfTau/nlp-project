Take two has driven this game into the ground with its disturbing fetish with microtransactions. Most updates release new items to GTA online that are priced to encourage buying shark cards or else you spend 12 hours of grinding to get a single new vehicle.Also never forget the single player dlc that was long abandonded after they put all effort into milking money out of GTA online.Pray they dont bring these practices into Red Dead Redemption 2 or other future GTAs.
