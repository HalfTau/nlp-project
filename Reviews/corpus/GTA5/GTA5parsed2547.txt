Now the only thing i want to be very clear is that the not recomendation is for the ONLINE part of this game only.STORY MODEThis game story mode is basically flawless. Funny and compelling characters. Huge and immersive world, amazing details.ONLINE MODECheaters, cheaters everywhere.Insanely long loading times, not only the overworld but inbetween matches.Cheaters, cheaters everywhere.All the new items added in the updates are getting increasinly more and more expensive, obviously to make you spend more money in the game, witch is not gonna happen for me, not before the hacker problem is solved.
