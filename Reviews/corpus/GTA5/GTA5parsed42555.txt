TakeTwo decided to  over 10 plus years of work for the community to have their freedom in a SINGLEPLAYER environment which does not affect Online. Ive had this game since it came out on PC and loved even having the slightest mods like a car reskin, had previous GTA games as well and loved modding them, even if they were ever so slightly. This whole new antimodding campaign seemingly run by TakeTwo is going to kill this game and essentially this franchise, because a huge portion of this community, NOT JUST GTA V, BUT PRETTY MUCH ACROSS ALL GTA GAMES, love modding the game and have been promodding. Not to mention, modding is some peoples number one source of fun on this game. This doesnt only  up GTA V modding, but also previous GTA games, such as IV. Worst part is, this hasnt fixed the modding problem in Online, and I doubt it will. This franchise has been in a snowballesque downward spiral ever since Leslie Benzies left R North.
