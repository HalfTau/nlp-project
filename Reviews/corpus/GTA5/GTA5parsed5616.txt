It looks glitzy and like that multiplayer GTA game you always dreamed of as a kid, but make no mistake. This is a desperate cash grab ing full price game with microtransactions  off and it doesnt even pretend anymore. Doomsday DLC has t missions that spawn enemies in front of you directly after loading screens, and some of them are just verbatim copies of existing missions. Theres no way to make enough money to buy a ing crumb of content without dubious means. The people that DO have the money are free to harass you with t across the entire session, dangling t homing missile launching hellcraft with 4mil pricetags in front of your face, tempting you to even the playing field. hell now theres a ing orbital cannon you can shove half a million into to blow someone up automatically without leaving your stupid bunker. Who the  thinks this garbage up, rockstar? or is that you take two? Either way avoid this ing suffer pit with everything you have. If you see me playing this piece of trash anymore its because of sunk costs. Avoid being me.
