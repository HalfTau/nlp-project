I really recommend this game for those people that like free roaming games suchlike gta 4 and stuff.if you played this game on console. i thought that some missions on console are not the same as the pc. or it could be that i dont remember the missions on console or it could be that i forgot how the missions are and i was thinking that the missions were defferent. My thoughts on Gta ONLINE are different then the story mode because i dont think that you have a big chance if you dont spend irl money on the game. because either you get killed by a high level player or you get killed my a low level player that has added alot of money into the game and killes you alot. But i really recommend this game to other people that like free roaming games.
