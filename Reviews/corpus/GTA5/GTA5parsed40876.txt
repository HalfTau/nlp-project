For the singleplayer its great, but the multiplayer is a big part too.The game had immense potential for the multiplayer, I wanted something like SAMP something so grand. Yet the inability to create custom servers with seperate money/settings, all of the dlc based on having to buy shark cards or spend lots of ingame money to even gain anything is absolutely disgusting. Ive cheated, I bought things for 20 milion and never had them removed. There are people who bought 150 eur worth of shark cards that were banned for being in a lobby with a cheater. If TAKE2 would provide dedicated servers and more gameplay features rather than just different models/colours of cards id change the review. Build up on the heists, create better lobbies, make people join different sorts of events than just mindless money making because you cant afford anything.
