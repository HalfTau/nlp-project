I am very disappointed in TakeTwo and Rockstar, as they have issued a ceaseanddesist order against OpenIV, one of the most valuable piece of tool for modding SINGLE PLAYER in GTA v.Personally, I dont believe this has anything to do with cracking down on cheating in MP, as MP mods does not use OpenIV. I believe this is a direct attack on the PC modding comunity and to furthur increase their profit marginas if they didnt make enough money, cough cough Sharkcard couch. They want to drive people away from endless hour of fun in SINGLE PLAYER MODDING and encourage them to go to MP and pay for their  mod which they said is Free, as in Quit your job and play this game full time for two weeks so you can have a single item in this DLC! free,If you didnt own this game before, DO NOT BUY IT!.If you dont want to support a company who screw their customers over, DO NOT BUY ANY TAKETWO published games.End of story.
