I really want to recommend this game but i really cant. This game could be awesome if it had good anti cheat, shorter/less loading screens and more activities.With a good luck you can connect to a session semi fast. With even better luck the session has no modders. And if you are the luckiest man/woman in the world maybe your session is peaceful one with no Hydra s killing everyone on sight.Singleplayer is amazing and fun. Online is pretty slow at first and you have to grind missions to afford a house, a car, a CEO office or any other good way of making money, unless you have a friend who would play heists with you, then you will probably make some money fast.In shortExpect many long loading screens.Prepare for modders blowing you up constantly while they are in god mode.After buying every single business you will probably get bored.Prepare for KD/r hungry s trying to kill you.Keep your modding in the singleplayer.The game is good but a big part of the community is not.
