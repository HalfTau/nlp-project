Now when the mods are out of the game, I cant name a one reason to buy this game. You may think its fun to just drive around the map and kill people, but after few months, it gets REALLLLLLLLLY boring. Missions are completed quickly, and theyre not that fun. So do yourself a favor, and dont buy this game.
