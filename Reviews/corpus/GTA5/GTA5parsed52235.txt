I looove this game... With mods.Without them I couldnt be bothered to play, and I am sure as heck not jumping onto their terrible online experience. Every single time Ive tried has been regrettable at best, and out right horrid at worst.A company that cant accept and embrace modding in 2017 is archaic and utterly laughable, and I am urging you to spend your money elsewhere.
