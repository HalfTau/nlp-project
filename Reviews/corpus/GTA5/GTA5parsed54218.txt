The game is pretty bad. The modding controversy aside, every update is Online focused, featuring more and more expensive content. They inflate the price of the stuff you can buy more and more, and recently they started locking a lot of the content behind another expensive purchase. Wanna even begin to do the update? Just drop a couple million on an bunker, or a clubhouse, or a office, and only then can you purchase and use the new stuff which is also a couple million.Oh well I guess you can just play online if that doesnt interest you, uh oh! No one queues up for any mode in this game. Your options are racing, the 4 actual heists, or contract mode maybe. Even then, good luck getting people to join you in a timely manner for it.Wanna make cash? Just grind the Pac Standard heist over and over, getting about 250,000 a run, if youre lucky. Only takes a couple hours to do. Just grind that for a few weeks and then maybe youll have a couple of things from the newest updates.You got your brand new car, or your new APC or what have you, and youre ready to take on free roam. Ignore the fact this game has more hackers Ive ever seen in a game, its actually pretty rare to get a lobby that doesnt have atleast one cheater in it. At the same time I almost dont even blame them, because they actually get to experience all these updates have to offer, and Im stuck doing the same mission over and over, in the hopes of getting maybe one of the new things.Just dont bother with this game, for real. Even for the single player, which is pretty short and unfulfilling anyways. Its not even fun to mess around in this game like it was in the old ones because a lot of the mechanics were gutted.
