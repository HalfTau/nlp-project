The Single Player is great, but like most of you I bought this game for the multiplayer... and the multiplayer is just terrible. The community is just toxic, there are griefers, cheater and trolls EVERYWHERE. Rockstar even encourages players to grief and troll others. To earn money you need to drive a 10mphtruck across the map while everyone else can easily get armed and armored vehicles, chopper or aircrafts just to ruin your day. No chance to escape. You will lose a lot of GTADollars while the griefer gets less than what he would have made if he tried to really earn money in the same time. But Rockstar need to sell those shark cards, so they try to fk you as hard as possible...
