Definetly a game worth buying, but if you are thinking about playing multiplayer, id recommend playing a friends closed private session with 3 other friends. The online itself is very well made but the game has too many modders hackers that will kill you just to make their KD ratio go up. While doing heists, you better queue up with friends aswell because there are some pretty dumb people in this game somehow ?. Strongly advise you to play the singleplayer with a mod or two installed aswell, the gameplay and the story are awesome and worth paying to play!
