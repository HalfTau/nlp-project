Okay, I love GTAV but Rockstar needs to pull their ingtogether. The whole customer support is automized with prewritten messages and they never even bother to look at issues that players are experiencing. The servers are trash, ridden with hackers who Rockstar just loves to let slip while they ban people for using singleplayer mods.I used to have so much respect for Rockstar since they always give out every dlc for free and you have the ability to aquire everything ingame without microtransactions if youre commited enough. But this is t, even the thirdparty MP client works better than their official servers.
