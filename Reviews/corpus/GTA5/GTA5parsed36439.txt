So Take Two made mods illegal, Rock Star supported them, then the reviews went to and now we have single player mods again. Comforting except that Rock Star said Take Two reserves the right to reverse their decision at anytime.A anonymous source claiming to work at Rock Star has said that the higher ups hate mods and with that I do not trust Rock Star or Take Two and since Shark Cards will exist in Red Dead Redemption 2 and I doubt they will be friendly with mods, I will not be buying another game from them. Dont buy this game, get GTA IV and enjoy the great mods that are there.
