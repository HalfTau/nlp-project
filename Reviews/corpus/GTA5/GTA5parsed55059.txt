I got this game on launch, and while the singleplayer is very fun, the multiplayer is complete and utter garbage. Without even considering Take2s recent takedown of a major modding tool for the game, I can not recommend this product as its goal is to suck as much money out of its customers as it can. 10 will get you GTA500,000 ingame currency. This isnt enough to buy half the supercars, let alone any airplanes, rocket powered cars, or yachts. This would all be okay if you could try out these vehicles in singleplayer, but sadly that isnt an option. Rather, Rockstar would have you spend real life money for a car or a apartment that you MIGHT like. If you dont like it, then you can sell it for less than you bought it, effectively wasting money. All of this and I havent mentioned the hackers that plague the multiplayer and allinall make it an unfun mess of a mode that aims to take your money.
