Always love the GTA series. This game was super fun, implemented a lot of new things to the franchise like switching between different characters for the story missions or just free roaming. The main story isnt extremely long, but theres a lot of other stuff to do such as the side missions or tricking out your ride.The online mode sometimes works well and one of the main bad things about it is the connection. Sometimes when I try to connect to online, itll take between 510 minutes. You dont get the option of starting up the online mode in a private lobby or anything, so you have to deal with all of hackers and bots killing your and everyone in the whole lobby instantly for no reason  thats another bad thing about the online mode. Theres way too many hackers and bots who are not even penalized for ruining other players experience who want to enjoy the game. Its easy to just join a new lobby but like I said earlier, it can take anywhere between 510 minutes. However, if youve already been playing during a session it wont take as long because textures have already been loaded. Another bad thing is the grinding. I feel like theres just too much grinding to be done just to get an apartment for online heist missions, but its super easy to ask a hacker in the lobby for money, well someone who is willing to give anything at all.Fact of the matter is the game is playable. Yes, there are some really crappy things about it, but theres ways to get around it and still have fun. Even if you dont know much about GTA or dont like it very much, this game is still enjoyable because of all the stuff you can do.
