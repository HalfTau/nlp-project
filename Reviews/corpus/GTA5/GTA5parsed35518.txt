It was fun for GTAV online but they scred up modding for solo play and online play. Sorry but i have a full time job i dont have time to waist grinding away for all the stupid it was cheeper for you and 5 friends to chip in and buy another account. mod theout of it while you and your friends got loads of money. that 10 bucks that you and your friends chipped in got you way more then what 100 dollers could with there shark cards.i still like the game but rockstar and taketwo needs to fix this crap
