I purchased this game originally on X360. Then bought the PS4 version and the Xbox One version.Then finally, I purchased the PC version, solely for the modding community and the talented and fun enhancements for the single player version of the game. I have no other reason to own this PC version of GTA V, and now TakeTwo has rendered it unusable for me.I was one of many people who buys a game like this on multiple platforms, but never again.
