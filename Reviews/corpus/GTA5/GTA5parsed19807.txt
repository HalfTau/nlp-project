Singleplayer is pretty fun. Especially that we can use mods now. Except for the Liberty City mod that put GTA 4 and 5 together. Of course, Rockstar would probably lose money, so that was the only bad news about mods being back. No matter how much weeks/months/years it took to make it.We also may never get DLC for singleplayer. If they do release it, not everyone will be playing online, and they wont buy shark cards. But we get this terrible Gunrunning t instead.So about GTA Online...All they want is your money.Its very hard to get money. Youll spend hours just working for a few bucks.Modders in every lobby.Lots of items are TOTALLY overpriced.People getting banned all the time, when it wasnt their fault.People killing you all then time. And to make it even more fun, if youre doing a mission that you dedicated some time to, people can steal or destroy what youre doing to get cash and RP.Loading screens take forever. For me, joining online could take 58 minutes.List goes on.Rockstar wont change. Many fans are gone. And also, how is this game still 59.99????
