The multiplayer portion of this game is a sewer.  Rockstar goes out of their way to set outrageous prices for items and weak payouts on heists.  The single player is good and will keep you busy however, the multiplayer game is little more than a badly hidden moneymaking scam.DO NOT pay 59.99 for this game.   It shouldnt be more than 20.00 at this point.
