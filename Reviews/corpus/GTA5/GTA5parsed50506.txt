This legitametly makes me sad. GTA V has one of the most meorable campaigns in the series, and Ive played for about 50 hours on steam, and countless of the 360 when it came out. The game is great, I even enjoy the online play when you party up with some friends despite the grind.My high opinions of the product aside, I cant recommend GTA V or any of Take Twos products after the outright slap in the face to their community/fanbase.
