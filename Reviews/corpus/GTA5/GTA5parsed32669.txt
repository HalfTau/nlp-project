Once upon a time GTA 5 was a game that Id always hoped to return to and really get down and dirty with some mods. Those days are gone and much of what I loved about GTA 5 modding is sadly being removed and agression discouraged.If Id known this would happen I never would have bought the game, and neither should you now.
