Singleplayer is good, multiplayer was fun, but not worth the full price.Slow cash farming, greedy Shark Card microtransactions and autobanning my friend who didnt cheat, while having many real cheaters online, poor mod support, and atrocious customer support  attitude towards gamers, gets this game a thumbs down.Will avoid Rstars products in the future.
