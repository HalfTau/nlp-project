I love GTA V therefore I recommend it, its fantastic and I could play this game for hours on end without getting bored for a good while though there are quite a few pitfalls that I feel hurt the game a lot.PROS great story great main characters hilarious stuff to do great controls fantastic graphics awesome cars tons of customizability amazing multiplayer online activity terrific audio first person mode consistant updates can run businessesCONS no hunger and food system gtasa no gambling or casino system gtsa no fuel system mafia 2 no speeding system mafia 2 no roadspikes gtavc no good big random events minor ones do exist but theyre lame no bowling alley only a handful of enterainment things to do visiting the fair/carnival is a joke only a few things work there no restaurants to visit not enough stores to rob cant rob certain stores like clothing stores makes no sense its not very clear what the symbols are on the map for players in online multiplayer mode tough to find other players for some online multiplayer missions no crosscompatability inexcusable in this day and age cant hire any npc thugs to fill gaps in online multiplayer mode can only enter certain buildings not many why the heck is there oceans and rivers and boats and yet still no ability to go fishing???WARNINGSEven though this game is good and I recommend it do be aware of the following warnings.. modders and hackers abusing and exploiting the game is a constant problem this means you have to change servers to avoid the nonsense which is very annoying its become clear as day to me that rockstar simply doesnt care and will never fix this issue
