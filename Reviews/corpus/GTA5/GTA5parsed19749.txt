Very good game with good graphics.The reasons why you should not buy the game Not optimised, if you have a good computer, doesnt mean it will run GTA 5 very smooth, my computer is good, but seems like not eneugh for GTA 5, for some people it stutters and there is a fix for that, and for some people, it stutters, but there is no fix for that. A lot of modders, every time i join  a session, there has to be a modder or two, sometimes they play normal, and not troll people, but sometimes they be complete d!cks, and start trolling u, lke put you in a cage, put you on fire, or something like that. You need to work very hard to get some money, but if you dont want to, you can buy a shark card for 100 or so, and get 8million in the game, its not worth it.Why i recommend you this game It countains a lot of fun, and cool stuff in it, its like real life, you can go to barbers, you can get your own clothes, you even need to work for money ! Good graphics, and physics, very beautiful car customizations and so!So overall i recommend you this game, because its fun and you can coop with your friends and so, you can do whatever you want, what you cant do in real life!
