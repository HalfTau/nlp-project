Its a fun game, but it keeps crashing over and over again. Ive tried everything, from user suggestions, to the ones from Rockstar themselves, but it still crashes about 1015 minutes after I start playing it. I would love to complete even a single mission before Im unceremoniously booted out of the game.Maybe Im just unlucky, but I cannot recommend this game after my experience with it.
