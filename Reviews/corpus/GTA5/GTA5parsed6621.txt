I do not have much to say about this game, its a nice and complex game based on multy and singal.The story is very well designed and well thought out especially the final, I do not want to give a spoiler.The part of the multyplayer is a bit difficult to explain besides the toxic players and the satly children who follow you everywhere and do not leave you alone and offend you in the chat and scoff at you but there are also positive parts you can have your own bunk you do your army missions and looking after new upgrades for army cars, besides buncar you can also have Fasility in which you can pack and roll army cars dica to be serious you can have a car that flies do and hide and shoot with missiles that you can wish for, besides that you have the first motorcycle that can fly and fly.Thats how much I had to say yes if you want to get the multiplayer to have steel nerves.
