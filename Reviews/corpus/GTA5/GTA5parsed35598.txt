This trash is not worth buying, 1. you are punished if you are hacked without any warning 2. cheating in never resolved just watch an hour of modders and hackers after this big update and again anything Rockstar does at this point is useless, 3. innocent are always banned even after running from modders to lobby hop and  grind and play Rockstar created only missions to make sure youre not labeled a cheater but  these nut jobs dont care so as players why should we? do the world a favor and dont bother creating GTA 6 if the two of you meaning take two interactive and Rockstar are not going to correct the problem and always blame the innocent
