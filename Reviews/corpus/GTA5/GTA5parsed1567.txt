After about 3 hours of gameplay with a potato pc Hence my name I already have such a good feeling about this brilliant and massive game. Many different things you can achieve and with great graphics, it makes the game feel realistic. 10/10 game. Still wish I can get a better and faster pc soon so that I will be able to play such big and amazing game to the fullest.
