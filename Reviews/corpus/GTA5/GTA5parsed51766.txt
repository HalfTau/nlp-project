Honestly, its a shame. Rockstar is putting all their attention into multiplayer, as its more profitable than single player, thanks to those ridiculous sharkcards.And if you want to buy this only for the single player, dont. The story is meh at best, gameplay and everything is good, but there is no replayability, at least for me. Furthermore, you will surely want to install some mods to improve your experience I had 6 installed with OpenIV, these being AI rebalancements, extra content, graphical mods, you name it. Now T2 is trying to get rid of modding, by blocking development of OpenIV. Modding is a staple of PC Gaming and the GTA franchise on PC. This is nothing but an anticonsumer decision.Dont buy it, stop supporting greedy devs and publishers.
