The story line and side quests are so cool. However in online the servers are terrible. For example if your with your friends and join on the same instance after a game or after some couple of minutes it puts you in different instances for no reason? I tried solving it but nothing changed.If you see someone else on online in front of you, dont be scared shoot because there propable teamed with other memebers and they will spawn camp you for almost 3 hours.
