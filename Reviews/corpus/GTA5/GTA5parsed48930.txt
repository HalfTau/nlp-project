Since changing their modding policy back to being ok with it, ive changed my review back to positive, but the game isnt without its issues.The online content is vast and countless hours can be spent having fun but the grouping with friends and long loading screens, slow match making process means a night spent playing online with freinds is a good 30 re sending invites and waiting in long loading screens and general time wasting whilst grouping and waiting on firends to join.If they could add a mode that kept friends in a group so they could join games together and roam together and just make it a all round smoother process it would be a game i would spend a lot of time in.The single player is still a great game.
