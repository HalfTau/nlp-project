Its really sad to see a devolopment/publishing team opt for profits over keeping the player base happy. Ive purchased GTA V on every gaming system I own 360, and PC twice because I lost my game data accidentally and rockstar doesnt allow you to redownload after 30 days of purchase which I think is also pretty ed up and a hallmark of playing on PC is that you have wonderfully creative minds in the communtiy who try to make the game BETTER by modifying the game experience. However due to the fact that TakeTwo has decided to opt for a multiplayer centric model and cancelled their singleplayer dlc plans they see that creativity and community creation as a threat and use the empty excuse of It allows bad people to maybe, sometimes manipulate the game in unfair ways which is t. We as consumers should not stand to be pushed around by developers just trying to make a buck off our backs. I hope rockstar and taketwo take all of these negative reactions to heart and actually do something as opposed to just releasing halfstatements.
