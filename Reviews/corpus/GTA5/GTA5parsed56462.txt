With the  cheats this game has, installing mods was arguably the way to go. It made the singleplayer much less tedious and much more fun. Im sad and mad to see that Take Two has decided to strike out against something that has enabled gamers to play this series the way they want for nearly ten years. Though I love this game for how it plays, I cant support this decision. Its not the same without mods.
