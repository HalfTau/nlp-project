Grinding hours an hours, to log in later and see that 3,916,250 has been removed from my account because it was illegitimate.Its obvious they were running low on shark card sales, and this right before the release of the new Smugglers Run update. What a coincidence... especially since Im far from the only one with this issue.R Support was no help at all as per usual. Cant even double check to see if there was an error, that says enough.Same thing happened to alot of people right before the Gunrunning update, starting to see a patern here.Can not recommend this cashgrab anymore. Sad.
