I used to love GTA V, but I will NOT stand the Disrespect to its Online players ANY ING LONGER!Congratulations, thanks to your CD to the Modding Community, you just killed your Own Game. You killed the one thing that kept your game Running. Im not even a Modder and/or have Mods, and yet I can recognise the Frustration and Anger many are going through right now. I have my Time and Patience for things, Trust me I do....But not taking back the street for the Players and ending the Hackers who auctally do screw things up for everybody, not putting a stop to the Bugging and Glitching out of our Carachters we work hard on, and auctally silencing players who speak out on how Rockstar doesnt give a , and out of everything that goes on in there, YOU BANNING THE MODDERS... Made me Uninstall and Remove the game complety. Youll never see me playing this Again you EgotisticalYou refuse to look at your Players, and now we refuse to look back.To anyone reading the Reviews do NOT buy this Game.
