I remember when this game was about having fun, but unfortunately Take two has decided that they dont like people having fun in their games, even if it doesnt directly affect their profit margins. Unfortunately this game is no longer able to offer the gaming experience that many are looking for and as such I cannot reccomend it.Edit  As of recently Rockstar has gotten Take Two to back off and Open IV is back, allowing everyone to continue as normal. As such Rockstar can have their thumbup back for now
