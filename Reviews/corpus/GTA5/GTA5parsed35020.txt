Dear Take TwoModding is not illegal, and it doesnt harm anything, if ANYTHING it actually increases sales of a game.Apparently you cannot see that, so until you do see that, youre not getting anything from me.Note Modding, not cheating. Thats an entirely seperate problem and OpenIV has nothing to do with it. You cant even GO online when using it.
