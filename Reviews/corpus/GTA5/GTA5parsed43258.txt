SIngle Player Campaign is decent, although thats where the positive aspects of this game end.While Rockstar touts a free DLC model, the prices of DLC content with ingame currency are far too much for any reasonable person to grind. This is where their Shark Cards come in, which was originally branded is merely fast tracking your progress. In reality, its almost a necessity to buy them to purchase DLC content ingame, which seems almost ridicoulous having paid for this game already once before for the Xbox, and now for the PC. If only theyd made GTAOnline a seperate, F2P game, then it would have been a far more reasonable situation.
