I have never seen such a hercluean leap in logic before.  Until TakeTwo stomped its greasy, bloated, smegma encrustedonto the faces of every modder in a single effort to prove that it was the rightful  of the year winner for 2017.allow third parties to defeat security features of its software and modify that software in violation of TakeTwos rights TakeTwo 2017This is where Rockstar comes in on all fours, spreading its rump for TakeTwo on the matter. Going on the record to back Taketwos ongoing takedown of legal singleplayer modding.Its safe to say that all Single Player modding in GTAV is no longer allowed and can ban you from multiplayer. Thanks TakeTwo. You massively illiterate geneticmaterial dumpsters. If you had learned anything from the modding community, it was that the longevity of a game is based of how many active modders there were.See Skyrim, sitting at 6 years old and with 60K mods.Note Bethesda trying with paid mods is just as toxic for the community as this is for GTAV.GTAV isnt worth the space to install and keep anymore. Its almost 4 years old, and quickly approaching being a halfa decade old.Pass it up, Dont you dare pay 60 dollars for a 4 year old game. Simple as that.
