The one game I slacked on was  All I said was, Its bad. But let me tell you, its not just bad, itsEvery pixel in this game is a sin. First of all, I dont get the title. Youre not stealing cars, youre getting banned for making mods, or using them, if you prefer.Your only attack is this embarrassing dinky little punch which cant harm anything unless its right up in your Or should I say your cars not yourthats riding in the car. And, whats with all the ice stages? Youre supposed to be in Los Santos. Did you get sidetracked in the ing North Pole?Theres not much else to say about thisheap. I might as well just leave it at Its bad. But the truth is, its even worse. At least, we could check out the ending.And... thats it? Did anything else happen? Did the gangster say anything? Did the sight of the gangster make Michael sick in his stomach? Did the car stalk them in their sleep? WhatI assumed that I pressed the button by mistake and actually cancelled the rest of the ending, but no, Ive actually beaten the game multiple times just to try and solve this mystery, and theIt just stays on this screen until you press something, and it returns you to the main menu.But, Im aware the last screen is supposed be playing text that says Give your money to, but Im not seeing it, so Im assuming Im supposed to beat all 5 games to see the true ending, and Im not going through all that trouble. Although, Igive my money to Rockstar.Ooh, gah! Oh, jesus!
