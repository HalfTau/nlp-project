This game was almost a solid 10/10 before the last update. Since TakeTwo has removed modding I will not be recommending this game to any of my friends or any other game by the company because they have shown they will lie and make absurd changes that punish players who have done nothing wrong instead of attempting to fix their own game.Edit Upon lifting the ban I would recommend this game again. But should still be somewhat weary of what some of their future decisions as a company could be.
