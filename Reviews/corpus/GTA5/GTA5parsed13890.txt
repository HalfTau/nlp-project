This franchise is getting worse and worse. They should bring back the stars. Some people say the single player is pretty good but I have a tough time figuring out where to get my next mission.To best sum up the experience Id say playing GTAV is like being a rich kid wholl live forever. You got all the cars, planes and motorcycles you want. You have all the guns and you can be as crazy as you want and not get killed forever or get sent to prison for long and yet youre still bored to death.
