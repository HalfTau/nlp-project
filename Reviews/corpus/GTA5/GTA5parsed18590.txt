The singleplayer is alright, it dosent have the best story like GTA 4 but it is still a good story. Now if we talk about the online, hoo wee I could tear online apart like it was my steak. It is very hard to grind and when you do grind it gets repatitive  and boring. The only way to get fast money is to buy Shark cards which they already are overpriced. Some people resort to glitches which I really dont blame them for that. At the end of the day if you are going to get this game, get it if you like singleplayer but if you are a busy person and dont have that much time to play games, dont get it for the multiplayer.
