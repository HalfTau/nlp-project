Unacceptable antimodding behavior combined with a focus of DLC content strictly for the online mode has me disgusted. What happened to the single player DLC that was coming soon back in 2014? Im so tired of video games becoming cash cows. You wont produce a single player DLC and then have the audacity to try to remove modding services like OpenIV? Is the money worth becoming the next EA or Ubisoft?
