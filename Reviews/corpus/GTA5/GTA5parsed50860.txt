Rockstar Games is far from being as bad as EA or Ubisoft today. They worked hard to make GTA V a much better port than GTA IV was along with its Games for Windows Live. Unfortunately, their support sucks all those people banned for cheating they ported the game to PC only after 2 generations of consoles got it. If thats not enough, theyve decided to focus more on multiplayer and milk the game with pointless Shark Cards  effectively abandoning Single Player. Now, they are taking away the modding from this game and try to excuse this with their own incompetence regarding the fight with cheaters. Mods arent the problem, your pathetic anticheat system is. I wont buy any of your products in the future, unless you change this stupid tactic.
