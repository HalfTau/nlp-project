Grand Theft Auto V is a beatiful game, with a great storyline, and even better characters. The map is top quality, and is a great improvement from Grand Theft Auto Four. Although, everygame has their flaws, and this game defiantly has its flaws.As you cal tell, I dont really have much hours on the game. I bought this game, last Sunday, the 17th, of December, and only racked up around 25/28 hours of ontime. Although, I have played this game throughout the years, throughout many different types of systems. So I have quite an understanding on the game.The story mode is great, very good in fact, I have played it many times, and still in love with it.Online.. thats another story. Pretty decent, just go there to do some setups and grind some money and other times, just play in private sessions with friends, etc. Grand Theft Auto V, is full of modders, so be ware. Also online to me now feels like it is paytowin. Sadly..The addons to online are AMAZING, but I dont recrommend buying any Shark Cards, dont let those tempt you.All and all, game is very great, and very well made. Would recrommend, just be careful online.
