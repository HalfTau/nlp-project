GTA Online is so much fun, I love the RPG elements of progression, which can stack hours.My only complaints are, the controls in GTA are quite awkward and your character can feel quite slippery. This I feel can get used to and the devs cant change the games engine. Next is the servers hiccup frequently which can be quite annoying. Im not a huge fan of microtransactions, It wouldve been nicer if the microtransactions were used with cosmetic items rather than actual ingame progression for a paytowin system.However with these problems that either cant be fixed or can get used to, I can agree that GTA V / Online is a really well developed game that I want to continue sinking hours into. If you dont know if you should get the game because you have to start over or if you dont know if the game is good or not. Just know that GTA is a whole lot of fun,and  will take up many hours. Just be sure to have friends mainly 3 friends that will actively play with you, thats the driving factor.
