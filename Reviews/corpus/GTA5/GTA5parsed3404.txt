DO NOT BUY if you like playing online with groups of friends this seems to be a poor choice due to server issues and party members not being able to log into servers.    You frequently get the message Server NOT available, even on very low population servers.   Rock Star should be ashamed of this t with GTAV and its Server issues.   This game is not an open beta or early access game.   This has been released long enough that the servers should not be having issues and crashing.   The second issue is hackers seem to run rampant with crazy things like killing everyone on the server remotely and regardless of their locations.   When the servers are running properly and the hackers arent wrecking the game it is fun and the plotline is great with excellent activities.
