If it wasnt for the OpenIV fiasco I wouldnt have bothered rating this game, to sum it up Singleplayer is awesome, Multiplayer is if you havent played the Singleplayer yet, go ahead an get the game from one of the Key Sites like Dont bother paying 60/ its not worth that anymore, Rockstar and Take Two made more than enough money milking theoutta this.
