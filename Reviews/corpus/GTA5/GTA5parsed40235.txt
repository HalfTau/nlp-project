Modding is an essential back bone in any game. GTASA had/has one of the most prolific and creative modding scenes in the GTA franchise. Content creators applying their own time, with no expected pay, on new content for games. Many GTASA mods are still being updated to this day. Shame on Take Two for attempting to destroy the modding scene.
