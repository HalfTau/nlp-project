The single player lives up to the high standards of previous GTA titles. The online portion however has gotten gradually worse with increasingly overpriced and trivial content. I dont have a issue with micro transactions generally but when a car can cost 40 of real money its gone too far. Weve had no meaningful story or map updates in almost 4 years. A lot of the new DLCs are not only expensive but just reskinned versions of other DLCs with a few very minor differences in gameplay. Since the VIP update Rockstar seem to have taken to strategy of forcing player to do missions in public sessions and rewarding players for destroying other peoples cargo creating a very toxic environment. A lot of the business style gameplay is very dull usually involving driving to one end of the map picking up supplies and the same for resupply missions. Dont get me wrong there are decent elements to GTA online like the track creator, cars and heists being a few but considering within just 1 year we got 2 huge single player DLCs with new characters missions and cars in GTA IV it just feels like Rockstar/TakeTwo are getting greedy with GTA Online.I would not recommend this game on PC if you plan on using mods because the company have gotten greedy trying to get players to only play the official online to get more shark card sales. Especailly when a lot of the mods they are banning are single player only.Single player 8/10Online 5/10
