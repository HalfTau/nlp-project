Finally people see this game for what it is.Online is boring and repetitive, with everything they add to the game only being expensive as hell  but you have to grind like its an MMO for a few hours to enjoy any of it. Modding gets you banned, but instead of adding a modderonly lobby to have the most fun they ban you.Oh and they do this so you buy shark cards. Its hilarious that so many people dont complain about the microtransactions in the game, but for other games they will.Yeah, Im saying most of GTAs players that play online are fanboys at least the ones that didnt give a negative review prior to the restriction of mods from TakeTwoThe sad part is, its only now that a lot of those fanboys are complaining about the shark cards.I hope some of those people read this, because youre ruining games when you stay silent about this crap.
