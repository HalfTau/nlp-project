Despite the negatives, I love this gameI know I mightve joined late to the party but its fun despite other stronger players.Ok lets goIts fun as a second life  game. You can be a gangsta, a high valued CEO, A drug dealer, or just live a simple life during the day and go on a killing streak at night. Which is why Im so invested in it.It also has really good visuals and suprisingly doesnt feel empty like other open world games for a 2013 game.The weaponry is also a big plus. There are alot of guns you can use such as pistols, LMGS, rocket launchers, and shot guns and more. Not to mention tanks, flying cars with rockets and miniguns, and fighter jetsAlot to do. Like ALOT. Company jobs, drug dealing, heists, buying homes, and more! I even like just bringing havock across Los Santos in my town just killing the police!And also an amazing campaign! From what I heard I have not beat it yet...No lets go over some bad stuffThe Microtransactions. Oh wow! Its very optional! But you dont get as much money for what you pay 1,000,000 for 20 While alot of the good stuff is expensive, you can grind out for it and it feels more satisfying. Also getting money isnt hardThe unbalancing. My first game, I had just a littlepistol and a guy with body armor, a gattling gun, and a stealth tank pwned me. ALOT. Despite it being annoying, I found it gave me a bit of pride to take them down or seeing what is in store for you.And finally the biggest turn off...MODDERS! And a bunch of them! Now while some are cool and do goofy stuff, some.... SOME are complete Now while they arent in every session, there are a bunch of themSo here are my resultsGraphics and visuals  8/10Role Playability  9.5/10Gun fighting  7.3/10Campaign  ??/10 have not finishedCommunity  5.9/10 modders, hackers, and salty kiddies which is funny lol
