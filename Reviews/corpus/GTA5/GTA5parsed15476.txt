A fun and never ending game to do pretty much anything you want. GTA Online is the best bit because there is always updates coming out and it never gets boring. I would recommend buying this game when it is 20 because 40 is a bit pricey for an old game. Dont buy this game if you dont have at least 8GB RAM, i5 and a good graphics card because then you cant play it. Other than that it is one of the best games I have bought, I already have it on XBOX One but this is 10x better.
