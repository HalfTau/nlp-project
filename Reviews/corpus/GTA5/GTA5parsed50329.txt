The single player experience is GREAT, but sadly is no longer being supported. Rockstar is spending all of their time creating new DLC for GTA Online, with cool, but EXPENSIVE new items. It takes way too long to save money for anything added unless you buy ingame currency with real money. With Take Twos recent takedown of OpenIV, the GTA modding community is basically dead. This bars people who care about the game from creating new singleplayer content, even though Rockstar wont bother doing that.Lots of bad business practices from R and Take Two regarding this game, which is why I hope people wont support them.
