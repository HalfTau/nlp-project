As the first thing I must say, this game has amazing SP. Great plot, perfect graphic, amazing details.But the reason why am I giving this game a thumb down is because1, GTA Online is the biggest problem and reason why I dont recommend this game for online gaming  for SP its great, but price is still high AF 2. In GTA Online you see more loading screens, than you actually play.3. A lot of cheaters, played GTA Online for 4 hours and already encountered 3 cheaters that were killing everyone on the map at the same time by explosion. WTF are you doing with that money R? You could have the best servers and anticheat countermeasure. But you just focus on makey money from us, by spending it on ingame sht.4. Very annoying news from all sides about ingame things, or what activity you should do, etc.5. Bad balance in teams, some 4 dudes can be in team with lvl 60 and more together, but team with low lvl and me with 2 other low lvl dudes, and lets play now. You have 0 chance to freaking win anything. LEARN HOW TO BALANCE TEAMS! MY QUESTION AGAIN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH ALL THAT MONEY?! FIX THIS SCHEIZE NOW!6. Sometime lags, stuttering, and crazy psychics. Some dude hardly scratched me with his car and I just flew away like if I was hit by running HULK with Thors hammer in his hand.Really with all that money, and how many years is this game out I just cant believe how you dont give a damn about issues in GTA Online. Fix your sht or I will send Trevor against you!
