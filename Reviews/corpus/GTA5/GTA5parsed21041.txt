Prosgood story and soundtrackConsHorrible community full of kids and toxic peopleThe singleplayer mods are banned which makes the game boring and not fun at allAll the servers are full of cheaters but rockstar bans the legit players instead of the cheaters because the autoban system is garbageWhen you get banned,you cant appeal at all,you just get the automated message that the ban decision is final and also when you get banned they reset your character...Dont buy it. Its not worth the money. If you want to buy it just for the story then fine,go for it,but if you want to buy it for the online just dont do it. watch the gta online videos on yt or somethin
