I bought this game so I could do a couple of things Play GTA Online Play singleplayer with the PC experience PLAY SINGLEPLAYER WITH KICKASS MODS LIKE LSPDFR AND MOREWell, as you can see one of those reasons is gone.I now own a game I did not pay for, and Imoff and sad, because I found modding SP was truly fun and a great experience I had.And to clarify, I still like the game, but this just changes everything. It deserves a negative review from me.EDIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I am changing my review back to positive, because Rockstar really stepped up. D
