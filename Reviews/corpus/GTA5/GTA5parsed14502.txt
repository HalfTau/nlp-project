The game itself isnt too terrible, but what is terrible is the fact that you start with a small fraction of the hitpoints that everyone else has. If you want more then you have to level up which is a long, boring and tedious process. The other major flaw with the game is the extreme limit on the amount of money that you can make. It takes a lot of boring grinding of repetitive missions to be able to get anywhere and any kind of method that makes money a little faster is quickly nerfed into the ground. It does seem that buying shark cards is Rockstars plan for maintaining their profit margin on this game. Definitely pay to win and thats why I cant recommend this game although the single player campaign was enjoyable to play, stay away from online. Not really worth the price for a game that is only enjoyable as a single player.
