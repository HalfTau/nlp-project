Trash, the campaign is good. But the online is ed. They dont have centralized servers, so when other players mod, you could be included in the fun. But the downside is that if youre flagged for being a modder, they will reappriate, er take your hard earned in game cash. Had them take more than 1.5 million from me more than once due to someone modding in a server I was on ages ago. So as theyre clearly hellbent on these micro transactions, Im out, Golden Eye source is free and plenty more fun seeing a free game is the exact opposite as a developer who steals your experiance points, aka in game cash. Love tiny racers, but I mustve grinded over 60 hours between the weeks before and after July 4th, and now I have 50k after R  ahem, lost any record of them already adjusting my in game cash. Like I said all, I grinded 60 hours for that ing helicopter with two miniguns, and Im clearly never going to get it unless I buy the game from them again, I mean, purchase their shark cards. So have fun with your cash, but I bought a copy for a friend when it was on sale around christmas, and they banned him after creating his character and playing around 1 hour. He already had it for his PS4, but of course I had to waste my money and my time trying to provide a way for him to play online with me. ing figures Id get ripped off from a studio infamous for titles such as GTA.
