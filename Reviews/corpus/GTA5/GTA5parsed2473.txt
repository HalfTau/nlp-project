GTAV singleplayer is alright, mediocre at times but alright nonetheless.GTA online is a shtshow now since Doomsday DLC.The Orbital Cannons are a griefer tool for the masses with modded money, mod menus are next to undetectable and the cancerous GTA players are growing in number you know, the ones that exist just to ruin your experienceR and T2 are n the warpath toyou for every single cent you have with paywalls, overpriced vehicles and overpriced modifications to said vehicles.I cant recommend this game anymore to anyone. Do not give this game your hard earned money. Its not worth it anymore.
