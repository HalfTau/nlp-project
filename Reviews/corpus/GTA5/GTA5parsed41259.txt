They made a great game, but then Take Two got greedy and decide NO! we need more money. So they made online mode a grind fest to force people to want to buy shark cards. The story mode can become bland after finishing it, but mods helped fix that. But that means people arent playing their online mode then, so Take Two got greedy again and decided to destory the modding sence.Take Two........you screwed up, do not mess with the modding. Why dont you spend your time trying to make GTA V better?TLDR to much grind online, stupide shark cards, Take Two is greedy,  and Mods help games.
