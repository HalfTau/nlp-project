Oncegreat game turned into a cash cow by greedy corporate overlords. You either die the hero or live long enough to see your favorite game become another microtransaction generator. In short, taketwo has made mods illegal. The only reason I bought the pc version was to mod. That was the THIRD time I paid for the game. If 180 isnt enough for you guys, I can live without your game. If I could refund, I would. But Im fine with just never playing gta v ever again. I wont buy or play the next gta to come out either, because I can already tell what its going to be. Just another cash cow. Its disgusting, nowadays, how game developers try to get their money.UPDATE Taketwo have gone back on their decision to try to kill mods. So with that, Ill give em a thumbs up. But we shouldnt forget what happened here. Taketwo showed their true colors and we, as a community, said we werent going to stand for that crap. We really have the final say in these matters because we literally pay these peoples salaries.
