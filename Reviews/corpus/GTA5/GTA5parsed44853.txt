Ok Im not normally the guy to leave bad reviews on a game that I enjoy just because of some stupid political but OpenIV actually kind of hurt. ive never used it in GTA5 because i mostly play online and yer not supposed to mod the online stuff. but on GTAIV i used to use that tool all the time to mod out all the textures in my game and let nikos car be a bugatti and all the taxis where CTSs and so on. that tool was an amazing way to customize your GTA experienc, and make it lest of the same old tired gangster story that it actually is and mor of a custom fun experience.  killing this tool hurts more than just angry gamers like me that liked to have fun ing wiht littel things, theres an entire youtube community dedicated to messing around with stuff in GTA, there are numerous mods that not only improve gameplay but also imporve the overall look of the game hd texture mods and there are several custom events that cant be done without mods, youve killed that off rockstar. youve turned your backs on a large percentage of your players, and im not cool with that. heres the deal  I get why you did it,  you where lazy and didnt bother locking down the multiplayer code properly and openIV is able to edit it. hows about instead of censoring people, you increase the security on the multiplayer code and fix it so that open IV cant make changes to it anymore, or better yet hows abouot you work with the developers of the tool and use what theyve done to make steam workshop mods for the game that way you have more control over where they are running. but i digress you as a dev are lazy and just want those shark cards. and Im done at this point, i cant support any further development on any franchise you make untill you fix this up of yours.
