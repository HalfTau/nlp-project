I have played the GTA series since GTA2 and I am completely destroyed by Rockstars decisions lately. It is mostly Take Twos fault but I truly blame Rockstar as they developed the game into a pay to win sp mod and our customershow. GTA is what it is today because people mod it on PC. MTA and SAMP made GTA.Its pathetic. I trusted this company and was proud to support it for over 12 years. Now I dont know who to trust to make quality games that care about what their userbase wants in this industry.
