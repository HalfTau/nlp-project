Im shocked that this game has bad reviews.The Single Player mode is excellent. I knew before I played the game that playing GTA V online would be ridiculous, so I never did, and I have nothing to complain about. You people whining about paying 100 for 8M online dollars should just shut up and quit worrying about the length of your epeen! Go play CSGO and waste less money on tacky weapon skins.
