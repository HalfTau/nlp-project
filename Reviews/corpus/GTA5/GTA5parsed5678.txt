When I play games over 120 hours i enjoy the game...Online Salty people, bad community, and lots of time grinding for money. Rockstar makes you buy fake gta money for overpriced real money. I like online only when im in a private session or freind invite session. At winter they give you free items and thats about the only good thing about gta online. Ocassionally you meet a modder that puts you in a cage and makes you fly around in a animal or other prop.Story mode Great content moddable if rock doesnt change that and lots of other fun. You can drive in a Adder or zentorno and possibly havee a good time. The playable chaters in story mode are okay and you can make them rich with a few mods. GTA story mode doesnt have alot of vehicles but thats because Rock made it that way
