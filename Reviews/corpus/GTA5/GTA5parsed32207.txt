I originally bought this game on PS3 when it came out, and it was good, but not really something to repurchase on pc, except of course for the modding. That is the only reason I bought it, and I have made great use of it, enjoying all sorts of shennanagins in the singleplayer mode. I would never use mods for online mode, which just really isnt for me, I will play Dota if I want to play a multiplayer game. Gta has always been, for me, a sandbox to mess around in. Dont buy this game, dont buy shark cards, dont play online.
