Not a coop game.If youre looking to play this with friends as a coop game dont buy it. I got it to heist and play as a coop game and I am really not happy with my purchase. It is on me for not doing the research that was required. However, there are a lot of misleading articles and review I read that lead me to the purchase. In the end, Ill probably enjoy the single player experience but never touch online again. No mod support, horrible spam invites, pain in the butt notifications... Etc.In the end, probably a game for you if you like competative MP or single player. If youre getting for coop. DONT!
