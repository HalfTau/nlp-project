Online is a pretty  experience it feels like a pay to win free game but instead you have to still pay 60 bucks to get this game off sale which is a total ripoff the story is bland compared to all the other games and the new features are not good enough to compete with other games if you are on the fence dont buy this game its pretty terrible they also dont allow mod support. I dont understand why the developers keep releasing new cars for the online if it is almost impossible to get them without having to play the game like its a job. If a car is 2 million dollars to get and you are not going to buy loan shark cards then you can expect to have to do  races for over 50 hours because cash is extremely hard to come by.
