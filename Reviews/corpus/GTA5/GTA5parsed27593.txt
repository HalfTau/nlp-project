I bought this product as i played GTA 5 online on my 360 for a year before it was released on PC.  I really enjoyed online for quite a while.  Big fan of coop and this game had it,  with owning cars and the heist released,  was awesome.  But all their dlc for making anykind of money aftward while being free which is awesome.  Is based to be in open lobbies so you can be trolled and lose what you spent hours working on.  All to get people to buy shark cards, and while shark cards are good for supporting devs giving us Free DLC.  they devs  keep insisting the DLC be troll friendly and the smaller solo / small group gamer just have to deal with it.   And with the issues with the mod community lately.  And lack of pve coop content im gonna go with thumbs down for now.
