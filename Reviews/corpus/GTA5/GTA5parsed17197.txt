Do you wanna sink so much money into this game that even a csgo youtuber would be impressed. Than you should get this and play gta online. The only reason i rebought this for pc was so that way i could get money from modders, TakeTwo then made money a priority. Now I see all this expensive stuff, but only a veteran player will get them because of the immense money requirments. I cant stress enough about gta online and its money problem. The grind in this game is bigger than a free to play mmo. Lots of time will need to be put into this to even get something remotely good. All in all, if you have time than you should get this game. If youre a working person or in schooling than I dont recommend it that much.
