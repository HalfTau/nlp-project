I love this game. Its fantastic and I have been playing it since it first came out. But I ing hate the fact that TakeTwo has sent OpenIV a cease and desist notice. In my opinion, this is complete t. TakeTwo is taking away the creativity of the GTA community and Rockstar isnt doingabout it. They are just backing out of this like they didnt do anything. Like I said, I love this game. I have played through the single player 5 different times. If you want to just play the single player for about 2430 hours and then never do anything else with it, go for it and buy this game but I would buy it on sale. The multiplayer is a pile ofthat is way too grindy. I feel like Im playing some MMO and there are hackers galore. Rockstar says that they fix the hacking problem, but they dont. Dont buy this game because  TakeTwo and  Rockstar for not doingabout it.
