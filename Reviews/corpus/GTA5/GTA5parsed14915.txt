I wish I could get a refund. I loved the old GTA games like San Andreas and Vice City.ProsFun for a while but gets repetitive after 10 hoursConsGTA Online thinks you are hacking when theres nothing to prove of itSan Andreas has key elements that GTA 5 does not have for instance it was very simple and easy to understandIn order to actually enjoy the game you have to spend a lot of in game money which is not worth it
