The single player portion of this game is worth the asking price in itself. I cannot praise the production, direction, the acting etc enough, what an experience!! BUY IT NOW!Howfuppingever The online version is, ill admit it, an enjoyable grind.  I have clocked over 450 hrs on this game note the past tense.  I NEVER cheated and I NEVER begged for money oh, and there are beggers trust me.  One day a cheater/hacker entered a server I was in and managed to exploit the CEO system somehow??? This resulted in me gaining lots of money, holy wow!.  Its at this point the fun ended!! Following this incident rockstar began treating me like a pariah......not a victim....but a ing pariah note my anger....You see, the anticheat methods that arestar employ are impotent, and the support is terrible...... lacking even.  Arsetar treat valued customers like me given my 450 hrs  in a generic and thoughtless manner.  It is apparent that as long as that shark card does its job, why would we care about you, the consumer.I simply cannot recommend the online portion of this game because of this experience!I judge developers by my experience, this has ruined your reputation in my eyes! disclaimer  this is the opinion of a R fan that got treated in an impersonal manner.  This experience hurt, WTF!!
