I wouldnt recomend this game to people I dislike, let alone randome internet strangers or friends.  The singleplayer content is enjoyable enough, but has been completely neglected by Rockstar.  All of their focus is spent on multiplayer, which is a skinner box designed entirely to exact money from players on an ongoing basis.  This is an example of the very worst way to monitize an online game.
