The game is fun....However, the lack of single player content and the lack of heists which is the most fun aspect of the game were frustrating, but not something that made it bad, however 2k and rockstar taking mods away is one of the worst slaps in the face to gamers, they wont release any new single player content and now they take away the way that people could create there own well I hope they see that this game was not under monotized people already took issue with some parts of it but because of it being well made and there beings mods. Now they will see and hear what happens when you dont take care of your customer base buying your game for 60 possibly for multiple platforms. I bought the pc version for the mods. I wont be purchasing Red dead 2 or any other take 2 or rockstar game until this issue is reversed and mods are once agian allowed. BOYCOTT 2K!!!!!!!!!!!!!
