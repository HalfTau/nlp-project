Needs more mods. the only good thing to come from T2 is that they shut down the most infamous cheating menu. But then you wonder, why did it take this long? That menu required a 260 yearlong subscription, has this not ever bothered them before? I also agree that the DLC updates have always been overpriced. More than likely T2 forcing rockstar to nickel and dime the players.
