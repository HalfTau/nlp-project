I highly recommend this game for the story mode. Its insanely fun and beautifully done. One of the best games ever.As far as online, I have spent plenty of hours online and it has given me so much entertainment. The thing is this issue with modding software. It happens way too often where you are in a server and someone is modding and causing problems. There is nothing you can do but report the suspected person or join a new lobby. This is highly frustrating that we have to deal with it on a daily basis in almost every server. Not very fun to lose a big sale because 6 random vehicles spawned on top over you and everyone in the server. This has RUINED the online experience!!! !Story mode is amazing and definitely worth playing, worth the money. Online is very good if you can tolerate the modding that happens. Or the kids begging for free money. These are huge negatives for me in the online and I just returned with the new DLC after a long break.I recommend this game now for the beauty and story, but I warn you the online experience will vary and you will likely find yourself jumping servers frequently to avoid modding and griefing. Grow up kids!
