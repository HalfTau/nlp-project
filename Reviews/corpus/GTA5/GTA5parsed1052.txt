Story Modewhen you get done with all the missions, it will be pointless to even play it unless u install mods and have fun that way, but im sure itll get boring too.GTA Onlineif youre thinking about buying it right now and you dont have anyone to play with, then youll be very lost. I played it a lot on PS4 and stopped playing for about 2 months untill I got it on PC and there was so much new and expensive stuff that I got lost. Luckly I had a friend who is very rich in the game, but that still wasnt enough for me to like the game again.7/10
