After logging 500 hoursXbox/PC into this game I can most definitely not recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable online experience, not gonna waste my time with some extensive review because this game simply isnt worth that to me anymore. GTA Vs previous model before all the t of Finance  Felony and onward was simply more than amazing, Rockstar has effectively taken GTA and made it Saints Row esque with its ridiculous updates.All this game is good for is modders and the occasional logging on to mess around for maybe 45 minutes online... Im honestly worried for RD2 and its future. TakeTwo is now all about them sweet sweet microtransactions.. If you see this game onsale, stay as far away from it as you can. Its the prime example of when a company gets greedy and proceeds to release the game multiple times Bethesda anyone?? and throws all logical decisions out the window.If I somehow got banned, Id be okay not returning to this game ever again. I have the great memories of GTA/GTAO past... tainted with the games current state of milking its remaining playerbase. Thanks again TakeTwo, a company I once regarded as one of the best in the industry. As of recent theyve implemented miscrotransactions into the 2K franchise, seems they are taking a page from Activisions book of morals.
