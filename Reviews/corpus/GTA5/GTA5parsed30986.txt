I hate Online Multiplayer anyway, and single player mods are mostly the reason I bought this game, ya know besides the crazy single player carnage.PSingle Player DLC would be awesome, but no..  they cripple single player further to try and cash in on crappy multiplayer.Easy fix though Take Two, Support the Modders!Nobody mods a game they hate, they mod because they like it and want to create.Hackers destroy, theres a difference, work with the OpenIV devs and fix it.
