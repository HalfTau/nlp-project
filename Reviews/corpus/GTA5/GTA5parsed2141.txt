I played this game back in 2013 on a ps3, and it hurts me how much this game holds up with other AAA games released on 2017.Everything from the single player campaign is close to perfection. Gameplay, story, voice acting, animations and great characters keeps me coming back.That being said, the mp is okay, I guess. I couldnt import my ps3 and ps4 character to this version of the game, where I had lots of money, cars and es. Its difficult for newcomers to compete in certain events, and it feels like a pay2win model kind of thing.I had fun, regardless.Buy this game on sale, full price after almost 5 years of being released is not worth
