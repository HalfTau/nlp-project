I enjoyed this game on PS3, so I got it again on PC via a friend. I was enjoying the game once again with upgraded graphics. The online was better because I had friends on PC playing the game no one I knew was on PS3 because they waited for PC release, I couldnt. Nice right, that I ended up getting it on here because I have nice friends to help me out? I officially wish they hadnt done this. They wasted their money. This game has turned into a huge scam and money sink that I have NEVER spent on. You basically HAVE to use real world money to buy ANYTHING in game. This is highly anticonsumer. The horror doesnt end there thoughRECENTLY THEY DECIDED MODS ARE ILLEGAL AND OUTRIGHT BANNED THE MOD TOOL WHICH HAS BEEN MAKING MODS FOR YEARS FOR GTA IV, GTA V, AND MAX PAYNE.This is not only anticonsumer, its just flat out antiPC and anticommunity. One of the BIGGEST reasons people make the switch to PC is mods to add a bit more flavor to the game in fun ways. While its not always sunshine and rainbows, there are some baddies out there actually cheating via mods in Online...a blanket ban saying THIS IS ILLEGAL! STOP! is objectively...stupid. Get your sht together Take Two...or stop screwing up games for everyone and learn to be a bit more proconsumer. Your base officially hates you more than ever.
