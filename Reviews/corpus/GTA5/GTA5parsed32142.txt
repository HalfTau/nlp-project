I love law enoforcement and it is my dream to enter the field in the future, open iv allowed me to fufill a roleplaying experience when im still finishing school. There is no other game/mod software that provides access to top notch mods created by US THE PLAYERS with out own unique ideas and countless hours of modding for others to enjoy in SINGLE PLAYER. Take two has ruined peoples passion for role playing experiences of using the game they love into one for each unique experiences! We all have a story to why we use open iv, but one thing is for sure, companies like TAKE TWO likes to step on the little people for power over money! You take two! Bye bye rockstar games!
