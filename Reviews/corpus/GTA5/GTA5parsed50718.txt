So TakeTwo is shutting down Open IV in order to protect their garbage onlinegame mode, despite Open IV not contributing to any mods that affect Online, and Rockstar saying in the past that they support Open IVs contributions to their games and players. Quite honestly, this game has had a prettyhistory in regards to its Online, but this really is the pinnacle of both stupidity and greed.  this game, and  the people who produce it.
