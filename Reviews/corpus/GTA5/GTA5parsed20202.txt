Dumb decisions surrounding mods and an overfocus on online gaming aside, this is a great game well worth the price. If youve never played a GTA game before, you really need to pick this up. If you have a controller I would reccomend having it plugged in to quickly switch to when you need to drive, that improved my experience a lot.
