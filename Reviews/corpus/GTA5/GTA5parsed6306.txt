I wanna reccomend it because it doesnt have enough positivity and Ive had no issues with it so..The singleplayer is great, its worth it just for that, and if you can get it on sale, even better. Multiplayer has a bit of a naff community, always asking for modders to give them money and encouraging cheaters..Modders and the recent updates with flying cars and kinda put me off but the game all in all is decent.Btw, Ive only just got this gifted on Steam, I actually have over 500 hours on this game.4 hours played on time of review.
