I first want to say I love Grand Theft Auto V as a game.. In single player, its such a great single player but from the minute that GTAOnline came out you knew it was going to get left behind as Take 2 couldnt really make more money out of it without DLC.Single player modding tools like OpenIV helped to give single player a breath of fresh air.. Most of the new stuff they added in GTA Online at this point you cant even get in Single Player, they claimed that theyve taken this down to stop modding in online, though OpenIV was only ever used for Single Player Mods.As a result of Take 2s behaviour, I implore you to not buy shark cards, and until a time that they change their behaviour to boycott their products
