After recently moving and having my PC disconnected physically, and without internet connection for atleast a couple of weeks, Rockstars Social Club refuses to acknowledge the legitimacy of my copy of GTA V and my connection to the internet. Previously, I was prompted to go online to sign in as they conduct periodic piracy tests to make sure you purchased the game. Obviously I have purchased it, its in my Steam library. But I wait, and after about a week or so I have internet established in my new place. This is about a month ago now, and everytime I have tried to start the game it has server errors and will not connect online.Rockstar support, of course, has been no help in any regard. After trying several solutions online from forums and Rockstars offical support recommendations I am simply told that its your internet messing up and its not our problem. paraphrased. Well its apparent that it isnt, as Im writing this review and have spent my time elsewhere DOOM multiplayer, PUBG, R6S, etc.... I have uninstalled, reinstalled, rinsed, and repeated, to no avail. The game is unplayable literally, and I can only be greeted by the same offline Social Club screen.Aside from their previous and current screwups banning singleplayer modding, charging outrageous prices for ingame currency, removing legitmate players funds the game overall is pretty fun. But until they fix their and treat their customers right, I wont be supporting them.
