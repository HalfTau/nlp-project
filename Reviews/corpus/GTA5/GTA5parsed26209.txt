The singleplayer has only so much to do and what do you do once you have everything done well you istall some mods and have fun, not with this game lads as they have stopped the creative community from expressing themselves and gave us a middle finger.This is because some people create hacks for the game and hacks  no  for rockstar as who is willing to spend over 50 hours to get one car or spend over 30 just to buy one single thing, the game has lost its apeal to me and is just a boring mess or grinding non stop to get something thats not even that good, i know some MMOs that require less grinding than GTA V.
