Online can be fun to grind but maybe Rockstar could try to limit the number of hackers instead of removing money from nearly everyone. I probably spent 4 hours in public lobies at most and the only time I got money dropped on me was when I first started the game and it was only about 20k, unfortunately, that didnt stop Rockstar from removing a million dollars from my account nearly 2 years after.
