So after buying GTA 3 times 40 for GTA IV and 2x 30 for GTA V im done.Trying to install them on 4 different pcs my steambought and regular version of GTA V simply wont work.It has multiple errors such as Social club stopped working, GTA V has stopped working and even GTA V is not installed, try to renstall, and now social club wont even renstall...... and this is on multiple pcs that have high enough specs to run GR wildlands and mafia III on ultra 60fps, so im ing done wasting money on Rockstar Gamesmadethat wont ever work.EditAfter trying for 8 hours i finally got both the GTA V launcher and the Social Club to stop saying everything stopped working and guess what...Now it says the serial key for the game is invalid.This is crap because not only have i just wasted 30, i also cant buy a second serial because once its in your library you cant purchase it a second time...
