Take Two screwed the game and the franchise. The GTA games are known for the modding. Without modding the game is not nearly as fun. The multiplayer modding is also complete BS. Rockstar bans people who ARE NOT EVEN MODDING. Moders can get you banned by just giving you money that you didnt even ask for or want. There is no way to stop getting the money you are given except to leave the game as soon as possible. Its complete BS.Now Im not ripping on the game, just the publishers. The game is fun and all, but people buy the game FOR the mods. I hope something gets changed, but Take 2 has left a really bad taste in my mouth and I do not wish to support them any longer.
