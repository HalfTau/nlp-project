The game itself is fun to play if you have friends though, but technical part is just awful. I have experienced so much butthurt while playing GTA Online. Its just like loading screen simulator. Come up with your friends can take up to 10 minutes with all those loadings, even though there are many ways to make less loading screens with proper UI. Also there are many bugs and crashes, which makes you mad even more. And finally, 0 work with community. The Online doesnt load up, saying that there is a problem, and also servers are down. So why dont you tell us about this? Why should I discover this myself? Long story short, if you want to buy this game only for Online part, think twice.
