If you enjoy being plagued by cheaters online then this is the game for you. Rockstars inability to separate singleplayer modders from cheaters using modding tools online is dumbfounding. With no loyalty to their online players they passively ban accounts after players use the ingame report tool on a cheating player which the tool can be circumvented. This game went from good toreal quick. Save your money.
