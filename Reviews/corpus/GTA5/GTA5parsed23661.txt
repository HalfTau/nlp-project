If you plan on buying this game, remeber, everything rockstar does is to make money. They dont care about reputation or about user enjoyment. Meaning every new release, every car, every in game purchase is designed to cost in game money, which they then sell you. Starting this game is practically impossible, the best ways to make money start at over a million each and good luck getting that, winnning a race grants you a grand or two, same with robbing stores. Oh but what about heists? That requires 3 other friends, randoms dont help or join you, there is never enough people to try your luck at starting heists with the hope random people will join you. Also a complete heist only grants you about 60k so you gotta really work for that money. Maybe youll just buy a cheap car and not go for the exspensive money making endevors. Well too ing bad. Cheap cars that actually work start at 150k250k. Plus if you want to change anything about them be prepared to shell out 50k. This all comes back to shark cards, besides cheaters, the only resonable way to make money in the game, something thats required to enjoy the game.
