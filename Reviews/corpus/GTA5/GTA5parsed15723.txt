This in not the worst online game in history. Only the most disappointing. I love the idea, the player base is huge, but its damn near unplayable. Takes up to half an hour to even get into the game on some ocassions, then the multiplayer events are laggy to the point of absurdity.Read all the other reviews about hacked cash, reduced account balances from RockStar. None of that has affected me.That said, the single player is fun, and the playing as three charcters keeps the campaign fresh and enjoyable. Grab this game on sale for 20 if you can, and ignore the shark bundles for online play. If you are moderate gamer, the load times alone will turn you off, and if not that the lag will kill you.
