I dont suggest you this game if only every DLC only got nerfed. Lets start with the beginning. Evryvere you go or jobs you participate youre going to find a hacker who will spawn the neves items which can shoot rockets AKA NO FUN! And on top that I got scammed by rockstar support with a vehicle which got replaced with a bad one. Rockstar Support We are sorry to hear that you experienced loss of progress in GTA Online, but unfortunately we are not able to verify this claim. We have reviewed your account and are able to see that the Vigilante has been replaced by the Fugitive in your account as per our current data.Do you see the problem? 3 mill got replaced with a 500 one without my concern!This game was good 3 years ago. now cuz of mods and the DLC its bad
