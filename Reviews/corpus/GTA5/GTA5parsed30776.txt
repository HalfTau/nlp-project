Was a good game, but that was before gamers realized that TakeTwo and Rockstar cared more about their  microtransactions then the happiness of the majority of their customers. I strongly urge people to not purchase this game, or any of the online content such as shark cards. You are only feeding into the mindlessness of the situation that Take Two and Rockstar are trying to force on us. Mods are a part of every game. Making them illegal is simply asinine and a HUGE mistake. They definitely lose my sale for the new Red Dead Redemption and future Grand Theft Auto titles. We are players that spent many hundreds and thousands of hours playing the excellent game that Rockstar has created, but they put it up in flames that they sold their soul to microtransactions and robbing gamers of cash. I speak for the majority of gamers on this next statement. you Take Two Interactive and Rockstar Games.
