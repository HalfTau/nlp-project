If you get this game you will be falsely accused of cheating, and then get back a snobby remark from Rockstar saying you are a cheater and they refuse to lift the PERMANENT ban, you cant go online after that and it makes this game worthless, just stick to playing it at a friends house, dont waste your money for the PC version that you cant mod because its frowned upon and even the slightest mod will destroy your progress and cant be lifted.
