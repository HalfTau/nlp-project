Game had a great single player game! The time it took to come to PC was long, but the game is very well optomized and is awesome. I would recommend the game for single player only. Online, which Rockstar has put all their time/money into after the release is a mess. It also caused Take Two/Rockstar to prevent any modding capabilities since they could make their way into their online mode.
