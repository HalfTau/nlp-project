Garbage. The anticheat system is awful, the entire purpose of this game being made was to push Shark cards. Normally I dont have a problem with capitalism, but Rockstar focused all of their efforts on the Shark card system, the campaign itself was designed so theyd have an excuse for heists in multiplayer so they can push Shark cards. The campaign story is the worst out of all of the games, and I wonder why.However, it is one of the most optimized games I think Ive ever played. Its gorgeous and runs like butter.
