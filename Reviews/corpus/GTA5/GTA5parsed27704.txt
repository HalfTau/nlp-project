Since the whole ordeal with Take Two Cease  Desist action towards OpenIV is over, theres nothing holding me back to give a positive review to this game. Its enjoyable, the single player is great and the online is nice enough to provide me fun for over few hundred hours on over two platforms. Though Online having grind like nature with waay overpriced nuisance but Im the type of players who doesnt mind, yet its the best with at least one more friend to play around. Overall its pretty good game.And since the mods situations is resolved, I guess it would be nice for people to change or at least delete their boycott reviews not only on store page of Grand Theft Auto V, but other installments of this series as well as other Rockstar games available on steam platform, since from the logical standpoint, from now on reviews should be fair and square. Either positive or negative but based on personal experiences, not on boycotting an action, which already have been resolved.
