I have an excellent processor i73770 CPU 3.40 GHz, graphics chip AMD Radeon R9 200 Series, and memory 16.0 GB, and I was waiting on the game to load more than I was playing the game. You cant save your progress  if you lose a mission, you have to wait for the game to load all over again from the beginning of a mission. Further, when you skip a cutscene, you have to wait for it to load again. Each time I had to wait for it to load, it took at least five minutes not exagerating.
