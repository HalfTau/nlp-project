This game is super duper fun to play . Best GTA since Vice City .The online session is fun only if you have friends to play with or it can get kinda boring.But there are alot of modders in online that make the game unplayable and not fun.A lot of people are complaining about taking away their mods but it doesnt take away the fun factor of the game.In fact, getting into a game without a godmode killing everyone and trapping you is actually makes it enjoyable while roaming around in online.The single player is well done and well written. Once the story kick in the overall enjoyment of the game and its really fun to play. Just like GTA 4 , the characters are entertaining but better.If you havent played any of the GTA franchise , do yourself a favor and pick it up. Its worth the money , though i got a bargain when i bought the game but still , its awesome.The online is like playing an MMO with all the grinding.The heists both online and single player are super exciting.
