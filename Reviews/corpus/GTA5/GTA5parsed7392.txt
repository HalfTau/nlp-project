If you love Battlefront 2 levels of grinding and microtransaction, slow loading times, encountering modders on a regular basis and waiting for your contacts to pick up the phone insurance, mechanic who have nothing else to do as they are not even real players then this is the game for you. I do not understand the high review ratings at all. Also worst loading times ever. 5 to 10 minutes for just loading into a session.
