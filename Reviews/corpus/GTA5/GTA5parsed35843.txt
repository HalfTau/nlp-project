They dont add DLC to singleplayer. So mods are the way to go... oh, wait, no you cant do that anymore.OK so go online, thats were the DLC is so its ok.Oh, everything costs ALOT of money. I guess ill do hiests with randoms cuz i have no friends to play this with.They keep dying or leaving....ok so just normal missions i guess.WOW i got 4,000 in the 20 minutes that took.I guess they only way to play is to buy shark cards.
