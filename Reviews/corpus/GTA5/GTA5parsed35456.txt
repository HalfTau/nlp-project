Love the fact how mods were taken away for greed towards multiplayer /s. Not only makes me mad about TakeTwo, but also Rockstar, how about every DLC you release, you actually make it affordable for the consumers who actually bought the game instead of having modders in every session giving out money and being the robin hoods. After what, 5 years? you still havent given us DLC for singleplayer, time to cough up something after this t so we can be distracted from mods. I think its not as bad of a trade, but itll leviate the damage thats happened to your games reviews now. You whent from Positive now down to Mixed, learn something from this, and TakeTwo as well.
