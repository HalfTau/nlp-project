GTA V is a very very big game. The community around this game have been changing and modifying the game to make it more fun and enjoyable for years and the PC version has stood out as being the best version for its incredible customizability from settings to mods. Take Two saw this thriving ecosystem and decided that instead of letting it work and improving it that they would CD a critical SINGLE PLAYER ONLY mod that is REQUIRED for safe and fair use friendly modding called Open IV. I wish bad things on a laughably small amount of people, but Take Two have Taken Too many good things from our world and I hope they reconsider making such a blatant anticonsumer stance on something that they have LITERALLY no right to stop
