I played this game a little here and there, beacuse i dont play a lot of games.I bought the PC game when it first released, first of all beacuse of the modding community.I have modded only in single player and private multiplayer lobby, beacuse im not a crazy hacker that want to ruin others game, but only to satisfy myself with the modding.I was redownloading the game one week before modding was banned, i installed some mods, and was ready to play it on a LAN party i was going to right before the summer.When i got to the LAN party, it was an update for the game, then i waited.When i started the game, it was throwing errors beacuse i used mods.i uninstalled them and played a little, but quit after a short time.I looked for updates for the mods, but i did not find anything, but then i found out all modding was from now on, banned.Thanks Rockstar and Taketwo
