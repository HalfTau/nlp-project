I wasnt even gonna make a review for this game. Already had the PS3 version and got bored with the PC too quickly to make a good impression on the port.But with the news that they basically butchered any and all forms of mod support made me change my mind. Game devs take note you DO NOT under ANY circumstance shut down the modding community for a game.
