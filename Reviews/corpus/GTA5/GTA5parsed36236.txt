I enjoyed this game on single player and had a lot of fun playing the zombie outbreak and LCPDFR cop mods but those days are over thanks to the s at TakeTwo  Rockstar. I have played the muilitplayer before i modded the single player, with my fiance and a old friend and had fun but i cant stand the toxic sub humans that play online so i moved to single play and its fun mods, but as they updated the game my mods no longer work and so i now have no reason to play it and thus uninstalled it. I do know that i will not be buying anything from these two companys again as without mods gta dies off after the story is over and online isnt my thing. So in closing i had fun but there are other more mod friendly games out there and i wont waste my time with expensive games that have no life after the story is finished anymore.
