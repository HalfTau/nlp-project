I have bought this game 5 times over starting all the way back on ps3, this is the second time i have bought this game on pc. I have a lot of money on my ps4 character that i have tried transfering before but they wouldnt transfer it over to pc this was around christmas last year and now they have stopped all character transfers what the  rockstar, i cant stand anything this company does. all they do is take money from us and give us no fruit for our work and loyalty.  you rockstar
