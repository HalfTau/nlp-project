If you are buying it to play online, please please PLEASE save yourself 60 dollars.The entire time I tried to play there would be mass amounts of people dying because people do this campfire glitch and light you on fire. When you try and report the people doing it in the esc screen, by the time the player screen finishes loading, you get taken back to the game to inform youve been wasted by the same hacker youre trying to report. All the while your money is being dropped/looted.Id say every 2/3 sessions someone does this and Im just accepting that this product or Steam, however it works, now has my money.If you want the story mode, go for it.
