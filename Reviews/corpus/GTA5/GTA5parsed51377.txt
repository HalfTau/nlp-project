I enjoyed the game for a long time, largely due to the offline modding. OpenIV only allowed users to mod offline. This will fix nothing but ruin everything. Enjoy having a game with no offline players and no online players because this will do nothing to stop the modding. P.S. your pay to play cash cards that led to many online modders to begin with.
