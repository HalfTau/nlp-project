After a break of a few weeks I log on only to be confronted by a message informing me that Rockstar stripped me of all the money I obtained legitimately by actually playing the game instead of cheating...Without money this game is unplayable and to even reach a point where you have enough money to actually enjoy playing the game takes forever and feels more like a job than a game. And no, I will not pay for shark cards, because I already paid for the game... WHEN I BOUGHT IT!If this is the way paying customers are treated, I can think of better ways to spend my money Uninstalled
