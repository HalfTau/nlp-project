this game sucks, it was fun but now it is not, all they wont is money they dont care about anything else but money. every thing is far to expensive like 5 extra 0 expensive and you get next to nothing as a reward for the things you do, this means that you have to buy shark cards with real moneythe only way to be able to buy things is to buy the most explenisve shark card costing somthing like 70 poundsnot sure how much in dollers and that can only buy you 1 thing .the game would be so much more fun if you could actully buy the new things they add.old reviewdont listen to itI really like this game it is a lot fun and seen as it is still up and running a few years after its release proves how good it is. The single player is great and with mods even better and the multiplayer is a lot of fun to mess around on.I only have a few small problems with the multiplayer which areThe slow loading timesThe overpriced things causing you to buy shark cardsThe annoying idiots that keep killing you in online sessions for no really reason than to just be an annoying idiotAnd the low payout for doing jobs,heist and for the CEO stufffor the owner and there associatesBut apart from that the game is great.
