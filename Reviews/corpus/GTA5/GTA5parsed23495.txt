Bought the game recently to play multiplayer with some friends.Started a motorcycle club to have some fun. Enjoyed some missions, and it was fun that you could fail because other players interupted your mission.But when we fail because players come with flying motorcycles with rocket launchers and can make you fail your mission on just firing one round its just not fun at all. If you cant protect yourself at all its just pure t. And when you finally manage to shoot one down, he just spawns and can do the same thing again.So me and my friends decided to switch instance, but guess what, there is another one with a flying bike doing the same thing.If you are going to have this ridicilus tool for people, at least make it so rare that you barely meet anyone with it.
