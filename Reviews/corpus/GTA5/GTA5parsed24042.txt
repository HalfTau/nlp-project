I love that game but this is a review like to make a point to the company from the customer Take Two if you want to made money that is good, but if you want to make the more listen to the your customers and stop going for a money grab. Just do what Bethesda does and let the modder run free. Look at Skyrim there is almost an unlimit amount of content for that game do Bethesda did not need to pay to make it. So be safe back up the modders and you will get all the money your are wanting so bad and made your customers happy. Go for the win and win.
