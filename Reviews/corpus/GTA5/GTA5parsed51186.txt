Rockstar, You always deliver its the truth. 10/10 Games every single time GTAV is no exeption, but T2 deciding that it needs to pull off some dumbst like this? If I where you i would be worried about those idiots ruining what you have tried so hard to create. I can no longer justify purchasing any more of youre games, to be so unprovocedly slapped in the face by a company that i have never heard of as a customer who enjoys his PC ability to allow me to tinker with the inner workings of a single player game, who paid full price for your product to be mishandled in such a way. I find it disgusting how I am feeling towards you right now. This illegitimate law suit on a good modder whos only goal was to help improve a game he probably cares about ALOT is completly unacceptable. I feel I need to let my voice be heard. I know that this wast Rockstars decision I know this was T2 being , Giving us a perfect example of controlling, pure stupidity that actively hurt GTAs player base. No I cannot recomend that a persons 60 bucks should go to a company that is willing to threaten a member of this community over literrally fug nothing. Screw you T2, Screw you. P.S. I want to say that out of respect for a legitimately Talented and hard working  Devolopment team Rockstar I wish I could exclude you from what i am saying but i cannot. Your perant company needs to go at least if you want this paying costumer back anyway.
