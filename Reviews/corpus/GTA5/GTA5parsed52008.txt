For the past several years Rockstar has had a reputation for banning people from GTA Online for being attacked and harassed by hackers  that is, hackers spawn money on top of an unsuspecting player and the player is banned for reporting it. Now Rockstar and its parent company TakeTwo have compounded their negative reputation by declaring all modding of GTA singleplayer to be actively illegal and issuing Cease and Desists to mod teams working on not just GTAV, but GTAIV as well.As someone who has spent quite a lot of time in GTA Online and over 100 in Shark Cards and quite enjoys the game without ever having used a mod for it before, I will not play this game again until TakeTwo and Rockstar cease being ineffectual bullies who use the threat of hackers as an excuse to harass their own fans.Edit Since this review was posted TakeTwo and Rockstar have slightly relaxed their antimodding stance and actually moved to take action against hackers directly rather than targeting singleplayer modders... but popular mods like Liberty City in GTAV  a mod Rockstar itself once advertised  remain dead in the water due to the newly updated mod policy. I will thus not be changing this negative review.
