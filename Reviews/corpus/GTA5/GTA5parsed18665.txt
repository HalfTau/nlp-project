Is GTA V Fun? Yes, but its also aggrevating. The AI is atrocious, and the online play is a very mixedbag playing with one friend on a dedicated server still results in massive ghosting/teleporting, even though we both live in the same region. If you can get this title for 15 or less, Id say its a fair value, okay, maybe thats extreme, lets say 20 is the most Id pay for this bloatware.Also, be warned, saving millions for that bunker or office is only the beginning... If you want any functionality from such features you need to keep dumping money into them for upgrades.... Online play is a major grindfest if your goal has anything to do with .
