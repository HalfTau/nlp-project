You know, i thought getting banned PERMINATELY for falling off a bridge was a giant screw you, especially the part where their reply for my help ticket was basically Even if we made a mistake its still your fault. But when Taketwo places a cease  desist to the OpenIV staff, there is simply not a word for how stupid of a decision that could be made by someone. I honestly thought it was a joke the first time i heard it. On behalf of my friends, OpenIV, and i,  you.Now if youll excuse me, i am going to mod my game and donate to the mod makers. Maybe even make some mods of my own.Take me to court, i ing dare you
