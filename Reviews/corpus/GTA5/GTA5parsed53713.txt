Even though modding support for this game has declined, it can still be actively modded. Everyone is creating drama over nothing and is destroying a game that works great. I have had this since PS3 release, day 1. I have purchased 3 different copies, one for ps2, PC and xbox. I would reccomend this anyday and it is STILL receiving updates years later, 1 from me!
