A shamw that it comes to this, but if youre going to restrict single player in such a cynical cash grab manner, dont be surprised that people mod your game. To then send those modders a cease and desist for simply allowing us to play with content we payed for,  is shameless and ethically bankrupt. Single player was and remains my favorite aspect of gaming, and to see it targeted in this way is disheartening.
