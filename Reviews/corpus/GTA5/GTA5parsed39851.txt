TakeTwo/Rockstar just removed support for modding. The ONLY reason this game even lasted 4 years is because of the beautiful modding community. We kept this game relevant and alive. Rockstar is salty because their DLC Which PAINFULLY copies Payday 2 isnt selling, so they punish the community for it. Just because their bootleg, unwanted DLC wasnt bought. TakeTwo/Rockstar you are the worst. I uninstalled this game.
