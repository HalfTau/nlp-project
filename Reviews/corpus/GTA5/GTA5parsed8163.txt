A work of art reminiscent of the Ancient Pyramids of Egypt. Too many work hours to be counted by countless people to make a few rich while creating a snapshot of our time in light, language, music and movement containing sharp criticism of the current most powerful nation on our little planet The United States of America.Also a great multiplayer personal computer game with some flaws. Excellent screensaver. Useful for driving instruction.
