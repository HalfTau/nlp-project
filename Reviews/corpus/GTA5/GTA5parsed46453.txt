when i was modding gta 4 and heard about a release of gta 5 on pc i was hyped because i wanted to see all the wacky stuff people could make with it.  and gta online was fun at first but quickly disended to people spamming music calling you a  or just buying a tank and we all know how that goes and gta online has become a cespool for cheaters and a bunch of people who have nothing to do other than chase you wiht sticky bombs and blow your car up. so i retreated into single player and modded and had tons of fun with it but now with the take down of openIV i cant do that anymore and with no reason given because openIV doesnt effect online in the slightest and the fact that all the content in gta online is just a slog to make use of it cause its too expensive the only way you get it quickly is by having a hacker spawn it in or use on of many of take2s wonderful microtransactions in a game that you payed 60 for and is one of the top most selling games of all time so gta 5 has no value to me in the slightest anymore online is just anoying af to play and the singleplayer is just so boring after you beat it i am now going to leave this game its been fun take 2 but you will never see me playing yourever again  you take2
