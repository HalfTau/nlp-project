Amazing game bought it on all 3 different generations of consoles and have over 1k hours across all consoles, played the story mode multiple times. Sad to see all these children throwing tantrums because their modding is gone, dont lie you downloaded the mod then played it for 2 hours tops and moved on to another one, steam has nothing to do with modding so why give the store page a bad review? when someone who hasnt owned the game comes and sees all the bad ratings they might not buy it. If all your feedback reaches Gaben wtf can he do about OpenIV? Grow up and take it to rockstars forums or twitter.
