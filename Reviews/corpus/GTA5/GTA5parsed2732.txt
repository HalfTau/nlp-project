Great single player but you expect that.Cess pit multiplayer. If you dont use private lobbies, youre gonna have a bad time.Its a real shame the cheats/hacks/mods are so relentless online and interfere with EVERYONE in a session. Otherwise this game would be fantastic all over.Dont be a jerk. Use your mods in private with your own buddies.
