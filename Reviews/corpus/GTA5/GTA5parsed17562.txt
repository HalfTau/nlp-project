Singleplayer is a masterpiece, however there is nothing to keep you going after the main story unless you are an avid achievement hunter.Online was fun for a while, but as subsequent updates have appeared, it is now impossible to afford anything within them unless you have been grinding the game constantly since launch or spend real money on shark cards. No free bunkers or hideouts are given to get you into the new updates, you are just expected to pay several millions of GTA just to be allowed to take part. And the money drain doesnt end there.And after that, the result isnt even worth it. The game currently supports griefing and cheating while chastising honest and sensible players. If you want a fun online gaming experience, go elsewhere, lest your soul be corrupted.
