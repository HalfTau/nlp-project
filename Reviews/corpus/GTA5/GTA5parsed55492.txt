GTA V is brimming with potential but is abstract of any fun to be had by completely removing the ability to mod either single player or multiplayer at all. Slowcoming, barren, and lame as  updates come out and force players to buy shark cards in order to experience the 10,000,000 cost of added content and disguise it all as a free update. Rockstars insistence on making GTA Online a selfsustaining economyfueled RP scenario ruins any semblance of enjoyment as youre forced into a lame grindfest of an experience. Hilariously enough, I was actually banned long ago for spawning in snowballs in an empty private server. Letting the community enjoy your game in whatever ways they want in their own private servers is a necessity for this sharkcardpeddling service to ever be enjoying to play. GTA IV multiplayer had mod support, but weirdly enough, didnt feature microtransactions to be modded in. Hmmm...Stay away from Rockstar. Theyre trash now.
