I fully enjoyed GTA V, but found the recent actions of Take Two and Rockstar to be fully disappointing. I cannot support this, you guys made so many amazing things and are tearing it all apart for the sake of shortterm greed.Please, gamers and modders alike, protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this!
