Im really only making this review to give this a downvote, cause god knows this deserves it.The pay model is atrocious, Its like the iest of the iest freetoplays, but arguably worse. AND ITS 40 GAME. You want to use some of the cool new additions in the updates? Well be ready to spend millions of ingame  just for one item. To put this into perspective, 8mil ingame is 100. ONE HUNDRED ING DOLLARS ITS A FULL PRICED GAME RELEASED 4 ING YEARS AGO. You wanna make millions in game for free as you should be able to in a full priced game? Well in that case be ready to spend hundreds of hours of grinding the samewith the astoundedlymatchmaking system and loading times reminiscent of a cat  down your throat for 510mins for only a car or 2 with some upgrades and maybe if youre lucky, one of the many ingame apartments. Want more content? want the rest of what there is to have fun with online? Yeah? Well  you, be ready to dash out hundreds upon hundreds of your hard earned money to these turdeating bag shitmuffins.Also, Take Two banned OpenIV. them too.The online portion is a ing joke. If you want to play singleplayer, then just dont buy it. Dont support these devs until they stop being That being said there are other methods of obtaining the SP part of this game... Just saying.0/10  this this game. And  online for its existance.
