Grinded the hell out of this game and I loved it until 1st September  Rockstar adjusted my hard earned 1 million pounds and left me with 50 grand... Ive had enough of innocent players everywhere getting punished for no reason and Rockstar refuse to realise their mistake. They make it extremely difficult to contact  support and actually receive any helpful advice. So heres to another customer leaving this great game as Rock star are running this game and its ratings into the ground.I wish I could consider legal action for time wasted but its not possible as Rockstar claim no wrong doing  its a complete joke..Bye bye GTA.
