Much like every other GTA, you get a long series of very similar missions that involve driving and/or shooting. At first, the missions are fun, but become tedious later on when you realize its the same exact thing drive to mission, drive to location on other side of the map, shoot people, get away from the cops if you die, chances are youll have to start all over again. GTA V at least has a pretty good story with welldeveloped, wellwritten characters to keep things interesting. Switching between the characters any time you want helps to break up the monotony. The side missions are also fun and provide for a nice change of pace to the main missions. Outside of the main and side missions, there are minigames such as golf, tennis, darts, hunting and even yoga, all of which are complete wastes of time and unbearably boring. Seriously, why even bother including these? There are also your standard collectibles that serve to pad out the length of the game and are all very boring. And the radio stations are absolutely horrible. In previous games of the series, the stations used to have tons of songs and humor, here youre lucky if you can ever find a decent song and theres almost no humor. What the hell happened here? All in all, Rockstar poured a ton of money into making a very flashy, highly detailed world and clearly put a ton of effort into the writing, but failed to make the game an overall enjoyable experience. I would recommend GTA V only if you can get it for a cheap price and only play it a couple hours at a time. I cant recommend GTA V if youre expecting an enjoyable experience all the way through.As for GTA V Online, this is a gigantic, boring mess. Dont even bother with it.
