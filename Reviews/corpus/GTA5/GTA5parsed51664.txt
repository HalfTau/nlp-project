Absolutely disappointing. TakeTwo killed the one thing that kept singleplayer GTA5 more fun than MP out of greed, claiming that OpenIV allowed hackers to endanger multiplayerdespite the fact that the tools used are completely unrelated to openIV which only allows a player to modify the GTA 5 base files and prevents him from going into multiplayer and also piracy. What the , taketwo?the game was ok tho.
