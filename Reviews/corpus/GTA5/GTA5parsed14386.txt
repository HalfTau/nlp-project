This is a great game  funny, free flowing action, a stack of things to do and a huge playground to do them in and other people to do them do.When it works...  Sadly I cant recommend GTA 5 simply because of the shocking lag and framerate nosedives which make the game largely unplayable.  Ive tried lowering the settings, trying compatibility fixes  you name it  but in Windows 10 this game is like wading through treacle.  Whether this is  Win 10s fault is not the point, a company as big as Rockstar should have tackled this by now.  A pity, as the very small percent of time its worked well this is a great piece of entertainment.  If they do indeed fix it Ill sing its praises from the rooftops and urge everyone to play.
