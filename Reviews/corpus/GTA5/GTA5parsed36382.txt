I played this game for 4 years, but they kept pumping outyou had to buy ALL the time.Just to keep up, I did download mods to spawn in a few million bucks within a couple of hours, and of course got banned for a month, which I totaly accepted. When I was unbanned, my char was also completely wiped. So the past 4 years of my char was completely wiped, and I had to start all over again.That was the last time I touched GTA V. I did however want to try the RP servers people have made, but I can see thats not possible anymore either. Im done with Rockstar for now.I might give Rockstar a second chance IF, and only IF, Red Dead Redemption 2 comes out to PC.Until then, Im out.
