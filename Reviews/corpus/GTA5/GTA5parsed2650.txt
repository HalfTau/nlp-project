Eyyy pretty good, bought and played on PS3, PS4 and I didnt regret buying on PC at all. It has a solid singleplayer and multiplayer. The single player speaks for itself while not being on the same level as The last of us or Corey in the house its still definetly a solid 8 or 9. The multiplayer is also good and modders are highley miss represented and youll find a bad one in about 1 out of 20 lobbys and you can ewither leave or vote to kick him out, Either way not a massive issue.
