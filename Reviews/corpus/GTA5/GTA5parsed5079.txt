this game has a great S,P but if your buying it for the oline part i would look at other games not that u cant have fun in the online but the online fill more like your playing an app on your iphone then a 3a game that cost 70 the online use to be a fun time but as they add update the cost of the stuff went up it feel more and more payed to win. unlese u have all of  cash that u want to wast on 10 i would not buy the game or if u know how to modded your account so u can have all of money then u can have fun. the only goal in the online gamemode is to get better and better cars but the game as bein add pay walls after pay wall keep player from getting fun
