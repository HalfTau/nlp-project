Despite the obsurd amount of negative reviews on this game, i would still consider this game to be very good for what it is without any modding.I have played around 200 hours of GTA V, and have thoroughly enjoyed every moment From the continuity of being ran over by friends to farming money in the game, it has been a game that i would not be able to replace, nor would i want to.Much of the recent reviews relate to the modding situation where the owner of Rockstar Take 2 removed a major modding group mind you single player saying that they want their game to stay as it is. It is likely that they were using this as a threat to the online modding that is currently happening and should really be removed as it is ridiculous. Despite this situation, there really should not be an insane amount of downvotes simply because a game does not want modding in their game, because adding its ability of allowing modding into a game should not effect the rating of the game itself with me stating this, i do fall back on it slightly, with the reasoning that it is a good way to get the peoples message out that this is unjustified, but what i originally said still stands.Overall, the general gameplay, campaign, and the online experience is all excellent and would continue to play the game for another 200 hours so long as Rockstar stays active in their updates.
