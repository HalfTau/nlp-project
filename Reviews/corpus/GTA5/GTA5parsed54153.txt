I honestly loved this game. One of the best games I have ever owned. However, with TakeTwos recent actions I will no longer be supporting the franchise nor any franchise under their banner.You are starved for control, lunatic cashed up board members who know about as much about coding as a preschooler playing numbers up on mums work laptop.What a disapointing display from TakeTwo. These people work long and hard on these creations, often studying the craft of coding to become proficient in their mods and you crush their efforts with a need for control? Sure paid mods are sucky, and Bethesda has copped flak for that but atleast they are embracing their fans culture and what they want to see. TakeTwo you are purposely destroying this content for no other reason that wanting to be the big kid on the playground.Take solace in the fact that while my friends cant play their iron man vs war machine mod in GTA V youre allowing   to run around turn people into whales and shoot money from his star spangled bellend.Enjoy the rotting corpse of what you once called a company.
