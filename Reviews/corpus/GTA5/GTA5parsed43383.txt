FIRST FROM THIS UPDATE ALONE IT WOULD COST 625 USD IN SHARK CARDS TO PURCHASE EVERUTHING AND CUSTOMIZE IT FOR THIS UPDATE!!! I have played the Grand Theft Auto series for a long time and have been a long time fan... But currently Rockstar is wrong in what their doing. They wonder why so many people mod in the game yet price everything so stupidly high that even after hours of grinding you are still no where near your goal. Then they encourage people to buy shark cards for the game to afford these items yet a 135 card only gives you 8,000,000 which can buy you maybe two cars and customization if lucky. Then modders try to make their goals of getting the new DLC stuff obtainable with modded accounts, and people try and mod content to make the game fun like Take Two shouldve originally done and Take Two takes that away from us. I think its safe to say for all of the GTA V community wed like to give you a big  You, Greedy es.Sincerely,Your disappointed Customer
