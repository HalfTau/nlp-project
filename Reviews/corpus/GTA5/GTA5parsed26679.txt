I used to love the GTA games, but ever since GTA V came out, Rockstar stopped making new games because they rely on the microtransactions.I know I am salty because I got banned, i was not willing to spend thousands for a game, all I wanted to do is mess around.Its time to stop, by not buying or playing this 4 years old game that hates you if you dont pay them extra.
