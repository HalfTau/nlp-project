Take Two Interactives recent actions concerning Open IV The nearly essential modding tool for GTA IV and V includes issuing a cease and desist warning. Basically threatening a lawsuit should the Open IV development team not comply. This was because Open IV allegedly allowed for the multiplayer form of GTA V, GTA Online, to be modded, causing unfair experiences for the players in the session. These allegations are inherently incorrect as the Open IV development team did everything in their ability to prohibit users of the program from entering a GTA Online session.Take Twos actions have crippled the GTA V modding scene and Take Twos own relations with the PC community as a whole. So no, I cannot reccomend that anyone support them until this problem is solved in a manner that allows the modding community to continue to do what it does best.
