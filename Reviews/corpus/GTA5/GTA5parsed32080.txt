I loved this game, I truly do, it has a great story, awesome online modes and some great characters. The problem is, the Publisher has made Rockstar ban mods, which mind you was the best part of this game, all because Take Two is greedy and hates mods. They want you to buy Shark Cards instead of have fun in a game you paid 60 for, which enhanced the game and kept it running for so long. Either bring OpenIV back and modding back, or prepare for me to never buy any Take Two products.
