Awful game. Port is decent, works pretty well, but other than that I cant say I recommend this game.The multiplayer, while a great concept, is also very poorly designed in that it is a huge grindfest. Youre looking at several thousands hours of your time to get a sizeable car collection and the likes.Also, so they dont know whos a hacker and whos not, theyre banning and stealing money away from legitimate players, and even those who bought shark cards. No reason to buy this game.
