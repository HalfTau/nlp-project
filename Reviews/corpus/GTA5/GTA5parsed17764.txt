Singelplayer is the only aspect worth buying in my honest opinion.The storyline is fantastic, the world is alive and gorgeous and everythings just as fun and enjoyable as you would expect from a GTA title.But the focus here was clear from the getgo, Online multiplayer. TLDR microtransactions, the gameOriginally it was extremely fun. it delivered the experience of the same open, alive wolrd that singleplayer has.Ive got hundreds of ours in the original on xbox 360 and opted for the PC version when it became avalible on the relaunch. After that the money grabbing started. Every DLC added more content with ever soaring prices. When that didnt get as many sharkcard sales as rockstar wanted they started locking DLC content behind extremely expensive must buy objects. You need to spend 8 million on X building to even acess X content because thats the only place you can store it.The prices kept going up and the mission payouts stayed the same. You will spend hundreds of hours to amass a small ammount of cash. Rockstar has pulled out every stop to force your hand to buy sharkcards. The only other way is hacking, and boy are there a lot of hackers. Rockstar didnt care about the player experience being ruined by the antics of said hackers untill some robin hood types started spawning money.This cuased a knee jerk reaction to ban the use of any mod software including single player mods. Modding the game in any sense would result in a ban, Except it didnt stop the online hacking, It was just a huge middle finger to the loyal singleplayer fanbase.I have been a loyal GTA fan since the original top down style games. III and Vice city basically turned me into a gamer. I remember every kid in my neighboor hood going over to one friends house to take turns with Vice city and San Andreas.I will not give a cent or a minute of my time to rockstar or take two again. They have shown that fans mean nothing in the wake of easy cash and that we are just wallets to open.
