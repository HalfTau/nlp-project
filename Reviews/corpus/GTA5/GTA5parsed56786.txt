Take twos attack on the modding scene of this game is probably the end of this games life span, because while it is a wonder of an open world platform game, without mods its single player campaign goes stale. And the multiplayer experience is entirely dependent on whether or not you pay out for microtransactions that at the end of the day are a black hole for your money, as unlike in other games that would require the player to input so much of their money to make the online experience enjoyable, there is no online marketplace or stock market which players can make use of to gain resources for their character. Good job and my condolences Rockstar, you used to have one of the best games on the market, but I guess greed knows no logic nor loyalty, something youll probably find out the hard way when your next game doesnt sell half as well as you predict.
