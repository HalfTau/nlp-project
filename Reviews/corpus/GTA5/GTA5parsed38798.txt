Single player mode? Awesome.Online? Awful. This game has a free to play model you can either grind to get some cool things, or pay for it yet having a up front fee of 60. I have never bought a shark card, never will. There is literally at least 1 hacker in every lobby. Coming from GTA IV, this game is a step back in terms of freedom. Sure, there is more to do in V than IV, but why the  do we have to grind to get it in a grand theft auto game?UPDATE  Decided to give it another go 3 months after writing this, why not. There are explosive round snipers and flying bikes with homing rockets. Uninstalled. Back when GTAO first came out, the most expensive and deadly thing you could get... was a tank. Now a Rhino is nothing. Literally nothing. The cars and planes would cost at around 1,000,000 and now there are pieces of clothing selling for 100,000. Its like power creep in other games, meaning that the newer stuff is so signifigantly better than all the old stuff that it is now obsolete.Nothing about this game feels like GTA anymore. Traditional gunfights and driving are tossed out the window to flying bikes and jets armed with explosives that can kill anything in one or two shots.On top of all these problems, if you want this overpowered gear that ruins any form of balance, you have to grind and treat this like a full time job. It is actually more time effiecient to work a minimum wage job and spend all that money on shark cards than it is to play the game legit.
