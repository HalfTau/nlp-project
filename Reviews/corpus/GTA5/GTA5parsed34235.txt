Now that Rockstar has pushed TakeTwo to reinstate OpenIV for singleplayer use. I am changing my review to positive. This game is very fun and will keep you playing for hours upon hours. Great storyline and amazing features!The modding community for singleplayer adds even more playability to an already outstanding game.NOTE This review is subject to change based on whether Rockstar/TakeTwo leaves the singleplayer modding community alone.Should they decide tp again ban OpenIV, this review will then be reverted to negative.As long as they leave the modding ability for SP alone, I HIGHLY recommend this game!
