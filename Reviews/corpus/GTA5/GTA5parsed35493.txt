Rockstar says every time, that their dlcs for free. But their last dlc gunnrunning for example, costs approximately 40 Million ingame cash. 40 Million ingame cash is not free. The time for 40 million is not free too. 40 Million costs approximately 400 Euro / 446 US Dollar. Thats  also not free. For free is, i must paid nothing. No ingame cash, no real cash. They are liars and cheaters.But the main problem is, one dlc in this example cost approximately 400Euro / 446 US Dollar. Mostly other game dlcs costs 15 to 25 Euro / 16 to 30 US Dollar. One Season Pass 40 to 50 Euro / 44 to 55 US Dollar.Thats are facts and the reality of their bussines. Most people do not care about these facts. They play a lot of time, paid a lot of cash and make themselves blind for this fact. Me too until now.
