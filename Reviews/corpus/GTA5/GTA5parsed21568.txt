Unless you plan to play this game offline only, dont buy it.  The game is full of hackers.  My character was picked up off the ground, moved throughout the whole city, then killed multiple times.  Thanks Rockstar for letting this happen.  And thanks Steam for selling online currency to a hackerfilled environment.  Screw you both.
