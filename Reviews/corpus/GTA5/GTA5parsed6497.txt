Single Player is Good, Story is good, but I was hoping for ir to be longer. Lots of stuff to do.Multiplayer is fun if sessioned with decent players, griefing and PKers after heists are understandable because i think it part of the game, what ruins it are modders, cheater, and crews on public session voting to kick you, seriously, create a your own session and stop kicking players who are just free roamingStill I recommend it to gta players who are looking for a good single player game.
