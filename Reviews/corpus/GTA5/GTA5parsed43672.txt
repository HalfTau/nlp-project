Good and fun singleplayer campaign, unfortunately i can not recommend this game due to the fact that the publisher TakeTwo has decided to issue legal threats against modders of this game. GTA has always been a franchise where a big portion of the fun came from user created modifications to the game, even the developers Rockstar admited this in an interview, yet the publisher sees Mods as a threat to their revenue so they decided to go with the old tactic of bullying modders into compliance to stop them from distributing mods, they use the excuse of stopping cheaters but that is not the actual reason, people were using mods on singleplayer, something that the developers of the game Rockstar said that it was fine, but TakeTwo disagreed so they stepped in and are now using legal threats to end the modding community for GTA V, a real shame and a huge red flag of things to come from Take Two Interactive, and for that reason i cannot in good conscience recommend this, or any other TakeTwo game.
