One of the best parts of this game is the online multiplayer because you can do a lot of what you can do in the singleplayer game explore, shop, run from the cops, kill people, kill your friends, rob stores, buy a house, race, and the list goes on. The singleplayer game is also fun, and you can do some more things like hunt and do photography. The world actually feels even bigger in singleplayer. You can waste tens of hours in this game with your friends or even alone. I bought it when it was discounted to 40, and I can say that it was very well worth those 40.Also, its really easy to get ingame money! Its not worth it to get shark cards. You shouldnt be spending more on a game that youve already purchased to keep.
