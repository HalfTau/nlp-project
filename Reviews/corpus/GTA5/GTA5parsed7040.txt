Single player game is fantastic. Online, well I cannot really get into that to be honest, as this game has a major problem with hackers. And no amount of reporting will do any good. I honestly think that the dev team care only about releasing new online content and no longer care about anything but getting more money out of people. I mean single player content is null and void now, which is a real shame. But when you care only about the bottom line, then it is no wonder. I can recommmend the game for the single player experience as that is amazing,  but the online content, just avoid it like the plague unless your a glutton for punishment.
