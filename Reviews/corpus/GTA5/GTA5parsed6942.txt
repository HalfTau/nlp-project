Now that this is on sale again I guess it is time to write my review.Note, I bought this game for GTA Online and my review pretty much is about that. Since I never bothered diving into the single player I cannot really judge that aspect.My experience in GTA Online is terrible. First of all, loading times are just insane. By far the worst I have seen in any game. Second it is extremely buggy. Random disconnects, playing with friends often not working, and the gameplay itself is not bugfree either.When you do get to play it is not much better. The UI is terribly messy and hard to navigate, the goals are not very clear, user built races are just a terrible experience, you will get spawncamped A LOT. If there is much fun to be had, I have not seen it. It is a shame that I even passed the 2 hours on this, because I wish I had refunded this. It is not worth 60, or 30 on sale. Not even close.
