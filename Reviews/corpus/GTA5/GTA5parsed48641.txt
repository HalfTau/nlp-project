Ive been playing this game for years, I even bought some shark cards to help support R when the DLCs came out. R Took all of my money as part of the latest DLC. Modders came in and dropped money everywhere without anyone asking them to. Now I pay the price. R You have completely abandoned your audience and youre just trying to go for a money grab.I will nveer buy another R game ever again.
