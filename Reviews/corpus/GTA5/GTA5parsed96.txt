Pretty solid game when you have friends to play with. Sank hundreds of hours and with no sign of burnout anytime soon.Helps also that Rockstar have been going easy on the ban hammer with innocent players.Modders can still be a problem but cant get you banned as easily as before Although they can still be quite annoying if they choose to.Overall a solid game with a lot of care from Rockstar and a flow of DLC even though there has been a lot of dripfeeding content, the new DLC still comes through.Has its pros and cons. Grab it on a sale if you can with no regrets since full price is a bit steep.
