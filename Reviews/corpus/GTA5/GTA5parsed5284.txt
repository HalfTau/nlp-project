I love this game, I really do... but no matter how much new stuff is added, Im not seeing any real improvement. The singleplayer campaign of this game is a blast to play through and GTA Onlines content is great aswell, yet easily ruined. It is nearly impossible to be in a session that doesnt have a modder/hacker nowadays, and everything is very expensive making you have to grind for hours on end to get anything... or succumb to microtransactions... or beg for some modder to give you money and risk getting banned.
