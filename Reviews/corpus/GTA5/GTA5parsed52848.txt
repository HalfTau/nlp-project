Great job ... shooting yourself in the foot, Take Two. Heres hoping you burn so much money on your next game and nobody buys it because of your backwards stance on mods and moneygrabbing schemes on crappy online multiplayer which has always been super prone to hackers, and OpenIV doesnt not allow online play. Heres hoping EA buys you and lets you rot. Heres hoping the Rockstar team leaves you, creates an openworld game that you wouldnt have dreamed of, and steals all your sales. Id take two sihts on whoever decided banning free mods was a good idea.
