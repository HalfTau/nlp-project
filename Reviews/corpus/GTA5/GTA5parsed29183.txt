BUYER BEWARE T2 has issued a CD against OpenIV which is a backbone of the singleplayer modding community, common sense suggests that they did that in order to force players to play online in order to raise the shark card sales. They then had the audacity to claim that they issued the CD because OpenIV allowed cheating after the community backlashed that insued. OpenIV has never allowed hacking and even discourages it. T2 is being blatntly anticonsumer with this move and it would be of your best interest to stay away from this game until T2 goes back and allows OpenIV to continue. If T2 succeeds with this move the antimodding anticonsumer behavio that T2 has shown may spread to other companies. T2 is the parent company of rockstar. If you want modding for singleplay games DO NOT BUYTLDR Take two the parent company of rockstar are currently waging a war against singleplayer modding and it may spread to other companies throughout the game industry, if you care about your consumer rights DO NOT BUY.EDIT T2 and R has recinded their CD of OpenIV, however this review will stay as a negative. Why is it still a negative? you may ask, the awnser is simple. T2 is still on mylist, they are on probation as far as im concerned, T2 just demonstrated a complete disregard for the customers who have paid for this product in their latest fiasco, i will not be giving any money to T2 for an indefinite amount of time, that is, until they show that they care about their customers, The same could be said for this review. Good game,company.
