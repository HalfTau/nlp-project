Plagued with/by hackers,colossal prices on new content,riddled with loading screens,peertopeer connection.There are only 4 ways to play this game, in this state,full of hackers 1. ALONE Solo Session,with limited activities,barely anything worth doing for money2.FRIENDS ONLY Friends Only Session,same thing as above,but with friends3.SOLO PUBLIC Solo Public Session,essentially,you can do everything,you are alone,but you may access this mode solely through glitches4.PUBLIC Public Session,same as above,except you are not alone,and that this mode is riddled with hackers,modders,griefers,whatever you want to call them.Only Masochists play this mode.Singleplayer is awesome,and multiplayer would be amazing if not for the peertopeer connection and hackers.Regarding the prices,yes,theyre skyhigh,and youd have to grind a lot to get what you want,but its fun,even more so with friends.Perfect online experience for you and your friends if you can stomach the hackers and peertopeer connection.Sadly,I despise hackers,so Im not going to recommend this game.
