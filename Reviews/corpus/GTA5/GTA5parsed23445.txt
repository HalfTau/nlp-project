The game is a masterpiece but the community is total cancer, ive only seen one guy thats isnt shooting everyone so far and the others are just maniacs with rifles .Also i think there should be alot more missions againist bots for starters because mostly when u try to do online jobs everyone is busy shooting each other using rifles in freemode..Still as i said the game is masterpiece 0.0
