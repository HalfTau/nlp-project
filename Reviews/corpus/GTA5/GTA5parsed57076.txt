Filled with microtransactions and hackers... hmm are those two words connected? Dont buy also Take Two Interactive decided to bully not developers to stop developing mods that ultimately make the game more enjoyable. Im glad to know the devs have our best interest at heart.Bottom line Dont support a garbage company. Want a good game? Bethesda is a good place to start.
