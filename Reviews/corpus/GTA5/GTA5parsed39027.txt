Rockstar, congrats on letting your publisher take control of your game and ruin the amazing relationship you had with your player base. Cause newsflash, closing OpenIV does not stop your terrible Shark Card business plan, lack of single player DLC, or stop the myriad of multiplayer modders.Also wtf, no business stuff in private sessions? What if i dont want my 500,000 dollar shipment blown up by a 14 year old in a jet?
