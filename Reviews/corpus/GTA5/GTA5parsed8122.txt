This used to be a very fun game, however after the recent dlcs this game is just a pure money grab. The new vehicles cost 2mil to 3.5mil each. A player grinding for that legitimately can earn 300k an hour. If you want to buy a shark cards 100 will get you 2 maybe maybe 3 vehicles. Not to metion all the hackers that run rampant and rockstar making no effort to fix this. Take 2 really did ruin a great game.
