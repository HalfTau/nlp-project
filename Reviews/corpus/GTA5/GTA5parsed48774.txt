This game was once the best game i have ever played , even tho i still play Multiplayer every now and again , they have finnaly literally put a cap in there, i will never buy another gta again because of them like wtf is wrong with you Take two interactive , GTA 5 Single Player Modding was one of the best things to be seen in gta and you have ed it up now , Take two interactive will have there small amount of GTA online people but they will never be as popular again ..Oh and on behalf of OpenIV sign this petition , to save GTA 5 Modding so that we can get it back
