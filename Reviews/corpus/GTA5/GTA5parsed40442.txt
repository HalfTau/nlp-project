Take Two publisher is hostile to the modding community that made this games online mode really special, purely for profit, which is strange when theyve already milked the community dry with P2P servers / shark cards. Alongside that, theyve also never released the singleplayer DLC that was anticipated and highly desired by the community, instead releasing miniDLCs for online mode that you have to use ingame currency to access properly  again choosing the path of greed instead of delighting customers their own words by fulfilling their promises and retaining any shred of ethics. Add that to their yearslate and poorly optimized release of the PC version, so that they could pressure fans to buy the game multiple times for that sweet profit, and you are looking at a game warped by a corrupt publisher a perfect example of the lowering of ethical standards by some big names in the gaming industry. Dont stand for it, and dont be a sucker. Take Two doesnt deserve your money.
