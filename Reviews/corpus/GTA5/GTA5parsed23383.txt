They may have brought OpenIV back, but that doesnt change the fact that everything costs a  load of cash, so your only options are buy shark cards or cheat, but thats just how I see it /Edit I figure that I should also add in the fact that if youre hoping for your singleplayer DLC, give up. Theyre never going to do it because it wont make them money. Sure, theyll get a oneoff payment of like, 50 because odds are that theyd charge that much, but in the end its not enough. T2 is more focused on milking the online community for shark cards
