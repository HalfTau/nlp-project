GTA was a good game when it started, sanandreas, gta 2.. 3.. 4  and now 5.This has turned into a pile of t, im saying this because of the shear amount ofthey do to force you to buy shark cards... orrrr they just dont give a damn.For example, today... a hacker was droppingmoney things on my head that gave me 2000i got confused but in the end i said to hell with it..... nothing happend several hours latter... so i get a reaper and upgrade itAS SOON as i drive out, banned... perminintly... even after making a tiket about this, they refused to respond. They are worthless. And if you are reading this now.... avoid this game.its a pay to win...
