Having played on Xbox 360 and now on PC, I enjoy the game, especially the singleplayer story. Modding the singleplayer can make it even better. But in order to continue selling their Shark Cards they focus on Online and dont release DLC or other content for their great singleplayer which a lot of us would love.The multiplayer is fun if you have a few friends to play with all the time, but if you have to play with randoms I wouldnt bother, the public sessions are filled with cheaters that they cant seem to put in protections to prevent without tons of DRM stuff that also hurts and slows down legitimate players. And while Im talking about online, the price of buying almost anything is insane, you earn next to nothing for missions and have to grind for hours to legitimately buy most interesting things, I understand they want to sell their microtransaction Shark cards but its quite ridiculous considering even the highest one will only buy you 2 or 3 of the most recent things for its insane price. If they were to add an option to host a personal/private or LAN server where we could enable mods and enjoy the game with friends it would be much better, even with the insane economy, because again, we could mod it to reasonable levels.And now lets come back around to the modding, recently TakeTwo shutdown OpenIV, a popular editor and manager for GTA mods. Sending the developers a CeaseandDesist letter stating that OpenIV allow third parties to defeat security features of its software and modify that software in violation TakeTwos rights. Ignoring the fact that mods are typically made for singleplayer and serve almost no purpose online, trainers should be their issue if anything, not our singleplayer mods. And they should be able to patch their game to prevent some of the very easy to do hacks.While I may play with friends still occasionally and may finally complete the story again I will not be buying anymore Rockstar or TakeTwo games for the forseeable future.So long and thanks for all the long hours of grinding in order to get the fish TakeTwo and Rockstar.
