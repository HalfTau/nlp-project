ONLINE MODEThis game shouldnt be dealing with such long loading pages, unskippable long cutscenes and many more non user friendly gameplay.UI of this online mode was the worst experience i have ever lived in an online game. It is such a joke.You cant even party with your friends, the servers are always changing randomly and most of the time there is something wrong with the server it kicks you, you may stuck in the middle of the quest. etc.. needs more content for the online mod, it is fun sometimes but you may feel the repetetiveness of the single player experience in online mode.Still, this is a GTA franchise game. If you play with your friends and get use to the idea of these mechanics maybe you can love it but i must warn you as a brother.Also community isnt that toxic. As i seen.
