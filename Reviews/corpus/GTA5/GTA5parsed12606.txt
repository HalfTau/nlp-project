Gta V is a beautiful, open world experiance that everyone should play atleast once in their lives. Now, I know what people say Gta has too vulgar language, Gta is too sexual, and the worst is Gta causes people to be violent in real life. This is possably the biggest lie I have ever heard. Firstly, GTA doesnt make you Violent in the real world. This is a lie of the media trying to hate on such a sucsessful game series. Secondly, swearing in gta. If you have ever played a AAA title from the 21st century, 90 of the games have exessive swearing in them. 1. with our modern culture, swearing scould be expected and overlooked nowdays, and 2. if your ageinst swearing, then you probably shouldent play video games. And finally, GTA is too sexul. No, gta is not too sexual yes, you can go to the stripclub, and yes you can find  p r o s t i t u t e s steam censors things, but you never actually see the sex. In the stripclub you can only see the strippers boobs in the private dance. In the end, I love GTA V.  I think that it is an Amazing game and enjoy it thouroghly. I hope that this review helped you in your decision to buy this game.
