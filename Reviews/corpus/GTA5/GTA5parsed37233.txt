So first of, dont let my playtime fool you i bought this game on ps3 too, and played it for aprox 200 more hours. And in all those hours i only played offline. I dont really like online tbh, too much of a grindfest, wich is why i played with mods.However, with current evolvements concerning the mods in this game, I have no choice but to make sure as many people as possible steer away from this game.Dont get me wrong, even though Im not the biggest fan of online, I do know a lot of people who do. But if you want to buy this to play by yourself, possibly with mods, youll be dissapointed.For people who do not know why there are all these negative reviews, check these videos from OfficialNerdCubed Or you know, use googleInitial responseFollowup
