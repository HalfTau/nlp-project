My 465 hours spent on this game has mostly been on the SinglePlayer mode finishing the story three times and then modding the livingout of this game. I soon grew bored and tired of the game and stopped playing but still TakeTwo majority of your PC players mod the game. Dont give that limpexcuse of GTA Online cheaters it wasfrom day 1 in my opinion it sucked because it was ridiculously hard to earn money and the heists sucked without any friends. I cant believe you just ripped out what is one of the best parts of your game and then spat andon it. Sincerely go  yourself TakeTwo.
