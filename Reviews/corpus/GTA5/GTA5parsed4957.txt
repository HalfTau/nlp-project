So, at the time im writing this review, i have 26 hours on this game.You probably would think that i spent 26 hours playing this game, that isnt the case.I spent maybe about 18 hours actually playing the game, the rest was looking at loading screens.Im not even joking, everyone seems to rant on this game about GTA Online p2w, hacking, modding or Rockstar being money hungry, which is also true, but loading times are a WAAAAAAAAAAAY bigger problem in this game and i doubt that Rockstar is going to do anything about it.
