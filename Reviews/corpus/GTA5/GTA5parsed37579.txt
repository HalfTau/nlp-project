Well since Rockstar Games decided to screw modding on this game by ordering OpenIV to shut down, Im going to leave a poor review on how the graphics look like absolute garbage, even in 4k with a GTX1080 SLI setup, now that I cant use the REDUX graphics mod. This is the third time Ive purchased Grand Theft Auto 5 and i bought it, specifically, after i watched a video of this mod running in 4k and now it looks like absolute garbage to me and I dont even care to finish the final missions.move, Rockstar.
