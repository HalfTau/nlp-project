I was going to rate this game a 5, but since they essentially said modding on singleplayer, something that wont give and advantages or disadvantages in the Online world, was illegal. Because of the fact I was going to use a few mods to reanact the Batman v. Superman movie in singleplayer mind you I was looking thru the OpenIV mods to do so. Since they banned the OpenIV modding tool, I cant do this. I was on the fence for this game since they fired Benzies last year,  this just pushed me away
