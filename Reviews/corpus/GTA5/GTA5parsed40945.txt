I so much liked doomsday heist nevertheless its unfair difficulty and thus low paychecks...And then, some kinds of issues came one after another.First, Hermes was handed out for free for 535k GTA.Then, hackers flooded the servers, spawning money bags from the shops and minigun/railgun wielding bodybuilders/Jesus Christ cosplayers/Clowns.Then, those damn servers are continuously in trouble for two ? days now.Final touch is that they broke this new competitive modes where one of those hide with flashlights whilst the others utilise shotguns and then teams swap once per minute you can basically see your enemy on your radar via player blips as if it was god damn death match.Get your sheissen together, Rockstar, you got so lazy because of that pile of money you generated since 2013 you cant even do your homework and keep your updates nice and clean. Not even talking about cheaters destroying my gameplay. Again.I do not recommend this game to anyone and suggest ranting against Rockstar Games since they are turning into one of these AAA game studio knightly liars and tters who only abuse the trust of their fan base for their own benefit, just like Noobysoft and many others before them.
