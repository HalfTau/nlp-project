I would definitely recommend this game for Single Player part of it. But not for multiplayer, which is lately more and more P2W and basically ruined at this point.What R is doing is, theyre adding overpriced businesses which are making zero to non money and vehicles. Plus when you want to make some  in these business missions for those vehicles, there will be the most annoying AI enemies, which are respawning every 50 meters.Way to go RIm now just hoping R will not ruin RDR2, the same way.
