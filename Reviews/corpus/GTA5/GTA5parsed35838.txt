Although the online game has hours of gameplay and all DLC sofar has been Free, They recently took action against Mods which make the Single Player experience Worth playing after youve beaten the story. They say its because of mods being used to greif and harrass players online, however in my expierence played since Oct 2013 the Greifing was happening on Consoles moreso than ive dealt with it on PC, the main reason i purchased this game again for PC was to be able to try out Mods that make the graphics more realistic and crisp, and bring real physics, and real versions of the cars to the game. However ive not had the time to look for a mod to use and now with them taking action against so many of the Mod makers, Ill probably never be able to experience Story Mode with mods on. Therfore I wasted the 60 I spent on this game when i bought it for PC, I dont play a lot of games for PC as im usually using my Console because my friends can afford PS or XB but not a PC as PCs can become overwelming to people whove never built them before, and they can easily become quite expensive to build correctly for Gaming.
