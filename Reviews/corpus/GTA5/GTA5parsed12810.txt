As someone who was basically scared away from this game by hacker warnings early in its PC release I stayed away. Now that I have purchased the game I regret that choice. Yes there are still the occasional hackers that will disturb your gameplay but for the most part it is relatively hacker free. Does start to get somewhat repetive after 200 hours but still some stuff to do as far as collecting if your into that.
