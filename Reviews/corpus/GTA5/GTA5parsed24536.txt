It was great until they descided unilateral to ban modding. It was a fun thing to do and it could bypass some of the issues the game had. Certain lags, other bugs etc. I know my account says 19 hours playes but in reality it is more like 500 hours becaue i have this game on ps 3 and ps 4. So it used to be fun but now it isnt anymore. thanks take two!As for the online version it is utter snot. You get soooo many cheaters on it it isnt fun. It seems the only reason these cheaters are playing this is to agrivate other people, getting some perverse pleasure out of it because their real life isnt worth all that much or isnt interesting enough. Thus they want to spread the hate a bit around....Now for the game itself1 graphics ok BUT there are some nasty bugs in it that the devs havent addressed  even though it has been reported since day one2 great story line but a bit predictable.3 sometimes it just feels like grinding grinding and more grinding.4 fun level  Not so much anymore.5 GTA online is utter guano. Ifyou want to have a MMORPG with action elements go to old republic, LOTHRO or some other massive multiplayer. Either you make a fully operational MMO or a singleplay with co op not something half baked in betweenDo i recommend this game to others? In this current state, seeing they devs havent put in the effort to fix their broken game, having a lot of difficulties with the bugs and the fact that they want to monetise their game more with micro transactions  planned to be put in, from what my sources say, taking away the mod oportunities, etc I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO SNYONE IN THIS STATE! You want to play MMOs there are hundreds way better ones out there.You wanna play GTA game? Go for the GTA IV. You dont want to see thisagain? GREAT VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET AND DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON GAMES LIKE THIS!
