i wonder if take two actually cares about the people playing their gamesseems to me like all these big publishers are just trying their hardest to not care about players who care deeply about their products and just continue to cater to all the casual players just buying their games for the cred or to those who dont care about the actual quality of the game theyre playing and are willing to spend money for microtransactions
