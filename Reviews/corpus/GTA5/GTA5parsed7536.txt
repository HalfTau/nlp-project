This is actually a good game,but ruined by the online experience.If youre looking for a game that can play when youre having your a little bit free time,then you can ignore this game,it is not suit for you.I played this game since its available on PC 3 years ago,back then It actually not a very bad gameat least compare to now days,but look at what now!All cheaters in online public session,all kinds of people swearing each other.And thats not all,this game really makes me feel sick is because of the money is so hard to earn in GTA Online these days.For example,a Vapid Retinue cost like 615000 GTA Money,and what will you get from a Heist?Thats even not enough for the car!But after all,this is a good game.It ruined by the horrible online experience.Thats all,hope this comment can help those people wants to buy GTAV decide if they actually want this game.
