This game was once a great one. Great story and amazing online components. But now its just a how. Almost every session I joined contained a malicious modder hellbent on ruining fun for others. One day some modder gifts me tons of cash and rp, the next day Im banned from the game. If you youve played the game in its hayday think back fondly on the good times. If you are just now looking to get into it, I wouldnt reccomend it. Its no longer fun or safe.
