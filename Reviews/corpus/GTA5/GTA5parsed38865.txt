What TakeTwo is doing to the Modding community of this and GTA is a new level of . I agree with a vast majority of people in regards to this. If, as Rockstar has said in thier mea culpa to the community, was ..not specifically targeting single player mods... then why didnt Rockstar even try and pull back on the leashes of the T2 Lawyers that they sicked on OpenIV?If you really wanna hit RockStar and TakeTwo where it hurts Dont just halfyour negativity and Down vote this to hell, go out Unsubscribe to Everything related to TakeTwo YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc., and downvote Everything in your Steam related to TakeTwo or a subsidiary. That means Games like Civilization, BioShock, The Bureau, All the GTA Games, Any Game by 2K Games. Not a small task but will send a clear message.
