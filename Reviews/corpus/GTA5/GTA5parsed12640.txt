The most interesting part is online mode. Lots of fun, races and just fooling around... But I dont think the developers do enough for new players. If you want to have a challenge and fight your way up to be actually able to compete against most of the online players, this is the game for you. If the developers do more for the people, I might be returning to the game. For now, I am not recommending this game.
