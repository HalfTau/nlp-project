Dont buy this game for any reason other than modding the singleplayer, and even then, dont count on them not taking the chance to get rid of it once more.The multiplayer is filled with boring grinding, modders that serve only to destroy your hardearned vehicles and to toy with you like their own playthings. Even ignoring this, the matchmaking is awful. The game tries to get a semiMMO thing going, but instead just puts you in sessions with players who have put a significantly larger amount of time and effort into the game than you have. This essentially means people chasing you on rocket bikes across the map just because killing you might give them some more ingame money. Which is another problem. Most things can be bought with the money. Unfortunately, grinding for it takes ages, and if you splurge its gone in seconds.Of course, if youve managed to steal mommys credit card, you can feed Rs gaping maw with cash you will never see again in exchange for pitiable amounts of ingame currency. Please dont ever do this.Dont buy this game. Just torrent it.
