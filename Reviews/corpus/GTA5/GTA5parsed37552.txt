 you Take Two you ing greedy s.Taking away modding from this game is the most disgusting and ing horrible thing to do.For people who dont like online, and just want to play single player, thats like taking away half of the game from them.Dont forget the people who have worked hard on the mods.And to the people at OpenIV and Script Hook, i am truly sorry for all that hard work you have gave to us to have an amazing experience...Has gone down the drain..This is truly disgusting and will be uninstalling this game until this is fix by the  heads at Take Two
