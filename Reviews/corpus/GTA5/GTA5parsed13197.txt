Single player game play is GTA. Good to go. Multiplayer game play is fun but way too many modders hackers in multi player at times. Can totally ruin wahtever your doing at any time and without warning. Nothing can be done about it either. Hacking is built into the game. You will have your game ruined by hackers pretty much every single time you log on and play multiplayer. You jsut have to keep changing servers untill you find ones with hackers that arent killing eveyone.Just get ready for that. Can be really annoying till you get used to it or start hacking yourself. Otherwise its a decent game.
