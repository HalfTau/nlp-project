Alright, here is my situation. I love this game because has a ton of replayability, great multiplayer content to enjoy with friends or on your own, an amazing single player campaign, and the devs continue to support it even now.However, the problem is that Rockstar and TakeTwo are beginning to show signs of turning to the darkside. They only just removed their cease and desist on a singleplayer modding platform, have made only minor steps in removing hackers from the game, and are milking their shark card revenue stream to death with more and more expensive multiplayer content making it nigh impossible to enjoy the content without having a disposable income or way too much free time and only this game to play.Do I recommend this game? I think it is definitely worth the money especially on sale, and there is plenty of content here to enjoy and still be worth roughly 60 dollars. However, Dont expect any single player content beyond the base game and mods if they survive into the future. Also, expect extremely long loading times and hackers in multiplayer, along with not being able to afford the most fun cars in the game unless you save for a while or shell out actual money. Not only that, but their multiplayer is stupid, not allowing integrated dedicated servers and not having moderators for their own servers.Also, there are a few bugs that may or may not crash your game, not load you into lobbies, or require you to restart certain missions. They dont pop up that often, but just be prepared for when you sit on a loading screen for twenty minutes only to realize you are never going to load in without a restart.TLDR one of the most fun games in my library, but plagued by obnoxious monetization, multiplayeronly dlc, a few bugs, and losing your expensive as  car in singleplayer if you didnt store it in a garage that one ing time because singleplayer gets  all for support.
