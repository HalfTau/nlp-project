A game worth playing, but is not worth playing alone.It took me about 25 hours to make 1,000,000 in game. Doing missions participating in free mode events. Unless you are a hacker like the other half of the comunity that can enjoy the game. You will never be able to afford any of the things  you bought the game for without spending hours constantly doing missions and heists. It could be a good game if they went back to reasonable pricings or better payouts.Just an update, It managed to uninstall itself. I have no idea how but heres to another 11 hour minimum to installing.
