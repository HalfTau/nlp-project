As much as I loved this game, I simply cannot recommend. The story is great, but boring once 100. GTA Online is really trash and the only means of getting money legitimately is to grind which you only get one car out of, or to buy shark cards their way of getting money, even though this game is selling like crazy across the PC and Console platforms. Modding is the only way of fun. Youre better off watching videos on GTAO instead of playing this game.
