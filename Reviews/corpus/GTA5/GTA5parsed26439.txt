I have never used a program of money or another programs. I play GTA V with pure spirit. I just got hit by the person in the same server pulling my character. Then use the program spell money on me. The first thing I did was to get out of the game. I hope Rockstargames will keep this message open and allow me to play normally without any reset. Thank youIn the past, I earn money in the game honestly. And have sponsored to buy money in the game through the store Rockstar correctly and bought a small amount of money. I was upset and unhappy that my account was suspended for 30 days.
