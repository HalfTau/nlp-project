If you are buying this game to play online then i advise you go look for another game. all you will find is lobbies full off high ranked players spawning in military vehicles and blowing up everything.No one is willing to do the low lvl missions and once you unlock the heists you will spend most off the time looking at a loading screen, followed by about 2 seconds in a lobby only to get kicked because of your low rank, followed by another 5 mins off looking at the loading screen while waiting for the server to load up.
