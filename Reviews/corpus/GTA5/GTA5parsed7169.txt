What can be said? Its online crack, the game is a virtual facebook page. Notice how EA gets hell for microtransactions but no one is complaining about GTA because theyve done it right with this online world. Everyone racing to get the same car and apartment.And now that the new heist is here, lol, there will be a huge surge in players returning like myself to check it out.But know this... when GTA 6 eventually does come out, ALL the time and/or money you spent on gta 5 will be for nothing. The games will not run concurrently, you will be rebuying everything. The more you player gta 5 online, the longer we wait for gta 6.
