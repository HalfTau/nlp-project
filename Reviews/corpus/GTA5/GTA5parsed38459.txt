You know exactly what youre getting when you pick up GTA V. Lots of fun, runnin around murdering each other. Its a blast! Recently theres been an influx of negative reviews, almost entirely because Take Two has in a move to help curb the modders forced a mod maker to stop distributing their mod. Ive never used the mod, no one I know has used the mod, yet some of them are leaving negative reviews just because its the thing to do right now.It strikes me as disingenuous. These same friends leaving negative reviews continue to play and have a good time. Oh well. If you truly ARE looking at reviews, debating whether or not to purchase the game, I and probably the majority of people leaving negative reviews would suggest you do! The story campaign is a great time but GTA Online is where the game truly shines. Ive had nothing but cheeky fun times while carving out my little piece of Los Santos, Im sure you will to.
