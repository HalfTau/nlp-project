This game is the sh!t.Seriously if you liked any of the previous GTA games, you will enjoy this one.Storywise GTA 4 has better script, especially if you count in Liberty City stories DLC, but this game has so many things to do. Runs great on PC none of the console port performace issues that GTA4 had.Excellent open world game set in modern time line.One note though, get it just for a single player. Online is way too toxic these days.Rockstar Make a story DLC for this one!! !
