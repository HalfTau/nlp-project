The game itself is honestly pretty bland. Funish open world, but otherwise its run of the mill. Looks beautiful though. What made this game great was mods and as Im sure youre aware Take 2 and rockstar recently started getting mods removed and being well just a  company. Then again this isnt surprising. They lie about the game being on sale to trick people into buying shark cards and all kinds of shady stuff over the last few years. Theyll probably start selling mods too.Ill let you all in on a secret. Red Dead Redemption 2 was pretty ing boring. Its very bland riding a horse around desert for hours and is ultimately praised because we dont get much western cowboy type stuff. Dont feel bad boycotting the next red dead if it releases on PC. We actually dont need this company producing games and if GTA style games are really as good as people say someone else will come in and take over while avoiding the t that caused R/T2 to geton.
