Theres very little that can be said. The hacking is so insanely rampant in this game that it is borderline unplayable. I have just switched sessions 4 times, only to find hackers disrupting the gameplay in all of them. It is horrific. Absolutely do not buy if you are hoping to play online. Despite a pretty good platform, there is no fun to be had.
