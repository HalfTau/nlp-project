GTA 5 still holds up as one of rockstars greatest games. Online however, is a total crap show now. in 2014 it was ok, it lacked a lot of content but it was still fun. Now it has devolved into a paytowin hellscape of hackers and 12 yeear olds blowing you up as soon as you spawn. I would still buy 5 for the single player, just be prepared with 12 gigs of ram or more, anything less will make the game unplayable. 8/10
