Glad to see Take Two doesnt give aabout its customers.I bought this game on the Xbox360 and Xbox One when the both came out, and I also anxiously waited for the PC release. While waiting for the PC release, I beat the story mode on both consoles and thoroghly enjoyed the game both times. Yeah the game had its fair share of issues with multiplayer when first released, but that was to be expected from such a highly anticipated release. Overall the gameplay is pretty good and decenrlt captivating.For a little while.Eventually you run  out of things to buy in singleplayer, so you start playing multiplayer by yourself and with your friends. Here you realise that you dont have enough money to buy anything to run any businesses in game, nor do you have enough money to buy weapons and ammo for the missions. How do you overcome this? MICROTRANSACTIONS OF COURSE! !Finally, like me, you get fed up with the modders, cheaters, lack of depth of new content, and  microtransactions, that you start modding singleplayer to add new elements in game and basically make the game better than when it was initially released.HA! YOU THOUGHT! you Take Two for releasingcontent and all but forcing players to buy cards that give them in game currency to use it. you Take Two for not allowing modding anymore. you Take Two for being the money hungry, selfcentered company you are.
