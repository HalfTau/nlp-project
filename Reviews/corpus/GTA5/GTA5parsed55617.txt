Seems theyve allowed OpenIV to mod the game again, we shall never forget what happened. And lets hope this is a mark in history not only for GTAV but any game in the future.I love this game and everything in it 3But Take Two and R, you done fcked it up.Majority of your playerbase as a whole want to be able to experience modding in your magnificent game, but youre gonna  treat your community like sht and on this road you go ahead and make modding basically illegal?...OkDont give these ruskies any more money
