Ive been a loyal R player for years, and have enjoyed many of their gamesfor taht time from Smugglers run to GTA. The single player content for this game is fun, San Andreas is fun to explore, and the sotry and characters are brilliant. So why the negative review? GTA Online.GTA Online never mixed well with me because Im no exactly an MMO player, and its built very much like an MMO, and theres so much promise and potential with it. New content is released constantly, but making money in game to actually have fun is tiring, espicially if modders make it impossible to do. Some modders are great, as they just spawn really dumb stuff, and give you lots of money, but most just kill the players with commands, and its really ing annoying. Not only that, but the servers generally have bad connections, and lag most of the time. If you could get all the online content for single player, this game would be amazing, but they tie and constrict us to multiple microtransactions,  servers, and  players.singleplayer 9/10Online 2/10
