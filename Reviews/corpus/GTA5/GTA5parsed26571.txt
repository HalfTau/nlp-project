Dont normally post reviews on games but I have to help in the protest of the OpenIV mod takedown.GTA V is an incredible game and Rockstar did some amazing work making it but with no DLC or updates to the single player mode and campain, mods have been a vital part in driving up the sales on a already 56 year old game. And if your someone like me who does not have amazing enough internet to enjoy the online mode, we have to settle with the vanilla single player and flavor it up with mods. So until ROCKSTAR which is the same company as Take2 resolves this and brings modding back in, I will not be playing GTA V.
