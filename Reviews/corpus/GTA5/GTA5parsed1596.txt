GTA Online Pros Cool to play with friends. Good radio and cars, they are pretty fancy IMO.GTA Online Cons Glitches AND glitchers, a lot. Hackers, A LOT. There was an OVNI hovering randomly next to the Motorclub, someone exploded me, spawned me on a custom building for some sort of battle royale with fire inside it. Poor Rockstar Support, they dont give a sht about hackers and stuff. Griefers. As you have to use some glitches to join a solo public session yes, lest you want to have a high risk of having 6hours worth of effort going for naught due to griefers exploding your cargo. Poor weapon damage balance. A .50 shot in your chest might do nothing against someone while a single minigun shot might just kill you easily.Grade 5/10, play it just if your friends request it.
