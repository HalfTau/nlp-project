GTA 5 Download IssuesHello, Just quickly want to touch bases with you and inform you that I not too long ago bought GTA 5 from you guys  started the download as you would. But Ive been noticing that your servers are shocking/unstable. I have been at work for the last 4 days leaving my computer on hope that it would finish but instead it 8.9gig through the download? That isnt right and my internet speed here is amazing enough to play any online game without any problem connection wise but every 5/10 minutes your severs drop?
