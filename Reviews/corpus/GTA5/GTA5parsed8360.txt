Just for the record, Ive never once played GTA Online, just story mode.That being said, Ive 100 completed story mode twice now. Love the game! Great radio soundtrack and news updates about the things youve recently done. The characters have very deep backgrounds and connections, and the story intertwines them together greatly. Even if you dont want to play story mode, you have the freedom to run everywhere and do anything. Would definitely recommend to anybody interested.
