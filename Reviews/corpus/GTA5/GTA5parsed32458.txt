Still one of the greatest games of all time. Its getting a lot of hate lately because of the crackdown on mods. I personally dont mind because I dont use mods. I would like to play the game the way the developers meant for it to be played online. The fact that 8 out of 10 times youll find yourself in a lobby with a hacker really sucks. If this crackdown helps get rid of those hackers Im not against it.I dont really understand the people who complain and justify hacking because its too difficult to attain things otherwise. Things are better when they are hard to get. Its makes those things more special to have. Maybe you dont have to have every car, plane and helicopter. Maybe you could just work hard and get the things you really want.
