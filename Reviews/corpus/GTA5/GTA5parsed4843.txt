Hello! Im posting this after playing constantly for more than a year and I came to a result, if you have 23 friends to play with the game deserve to be played. Most of the content of GTAOnline is meant to be played in a group. The game is still playable in 2017 after so many DLCs and alterations that were added in the past 4 years or so. I still recommend this game to be played if you have friends.
