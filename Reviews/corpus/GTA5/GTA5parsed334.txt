The story mode is really great and it is pretty neat to have 3 main protagonists that you may switch to at any given time. When I first played GTA V on console I was very blown away. On PC it is even better since you can enter firstperson mode and achieve 60fps. It is a shame that they did not release any major story mode DLC, which isnt too bad. As for Online mode, there are lots of great things about it, and things not so great. When GTA IV came out with online features, it was cool to be able to free roam or do death matches or whatever. GTA Vs online has evolved way beyond that with the ability to customize your character, own and customize vehicles, and live in apartments. I am extremely impressed with how long Rockstar has been able to keep the updates and new content coming for  GTA Online. However, over time things just got worse as ingame items have become more and more expensive and if you dont grind for days, you pretty much have to open your wallet to buy shark cards to keep up with everyone else that like to blow you up for no reason or have maxed out cars that have the advantage in races. Besides the ridiculous prices, I am still blown away by the core features of Online which let you drive/roam around freely on such a huge map, hang out with friends, race cars, do missions either solo or in a group and a lot more things to explore. As great as GTA V is, I cant even imagine what they will eventually bring us with GTA 6.
