Rockstar has finally responded to Take2s action against openIV, and has actually come to a conclusion that modding is not a bad thing and should be kept in the game. A game company that can admit a mistake and reverse a stupid idea is a good company. I enojoy this game and i will be removing my negative review and going back to a positive one!
