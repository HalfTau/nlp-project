Gta used to be amazing. I used to play on a different account, but I wanted to start iver, hence my low play time. Anyway, GTA was amazing but because of multiple horrible updates and modders, the game isnt as fun. I mean, the new Super vehicles just make it so much easier for griefers and try hards. I mean, Ive been stuck in the same place for 30 minutes being spawnee killed before I could use my overpowered obliterate Cannon to kill them. Speaking of that, everything is now way to expensive. I mean, it costs 500k to use that cannon. Whatever. Luckily Im rich. Im not going to get started on modders, because you could just watch any gameplay video and find one. Its ridiculous. I dont mind modders that kind their own business, but the ones that just kill you over and over are just so annoying.Yeah, it may seem like Ive been trashing the game, but its still super fun. Although it takes a stuiped amount of grinding to get rich, once your rich, its so much fun. Im not gonna explain the fun, just watch some BEST WINS AND LOSES COMPLICATIONS videos to understand. Also watch some Doomsday heist videos cause thats a really fun thing to do.To conclude, if you have time to spend at least 56 hours a week for like a month or two then buy it. If you only have like an hour or two a week, this game will bore you to death. Gta is super fun, and I DO RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY IT but only if you have some time. Also, get the app Gamerlink to find people to play with.
