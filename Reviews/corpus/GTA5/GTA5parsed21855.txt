I do not understand all of the negative feedback this game is receiving! I spent nearly an entire week glued to my desk playing it. From the fun and immersive story to the nearly limitless online play, its one of the most fun titles Ive ever played. I think so far, the only thing Ive found to dislike about it is the poor optimization. I myself play this game on relatively high settings and pull around 4560 fps. That being said, a few friends of mine have struggled to run it on their low to midrange pcs. So, if you are gaming on a lowbudget system, I might go as far as to not recommend it, unless you dont mind lowvideo quality.
