Dont listen to the other idiots complaining about Take Twos shutdown of OpenIV.The reason that OpenIV was shutdown was not because Take Two hated the modding community. Its not because everyone at Take Two is just a complete fking ahole. Its because OpenIV was supposedly the cause of the rampant hacker infestation of GTA Online. In case you didnt know, atm there is about a 50 chance of getting a modder in your game. They can completely ruin the experience by insta killing everyone in the lobby, destroying your cars, ruining your CEO missions, etc. OpenIV was allegedly allowing people to mod like this, and thats why it was shut down.Take Two is fine with normal modding for personal pleasure, but not fine with trolls ruining the game for other people.Other than that the game is great, buy it.
