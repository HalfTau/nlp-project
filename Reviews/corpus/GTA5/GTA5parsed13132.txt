Online gameplay gets boring fast... its a grind, not a pleasure. The online community is extremely hostile, if you prefer a more exploration / mindless fun type game... this isnt it. They tried to make online play into a serious PvP FPS instead of coop centered play. I gave up on it despite how cool the game is... the online community and the lack of interesting noninstanced gameplay killed it for me.
