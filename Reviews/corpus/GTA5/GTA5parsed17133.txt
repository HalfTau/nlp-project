GTA 5 is a great game to be played with friends.The Jets are really fun, Huge map can explore for hours.The downfall i would say is the I would recommend this game to  anyone who likes cars shooting weapons and buying houses etc,i would also recommend having a Headset with mic.Buy this game you will not regret it, as i have only had a really short time in game on PC, do not worry i had this game on XBOX ONE / PS4 for a long time had all items in game a shame i have to start again... as progress is not carried over
