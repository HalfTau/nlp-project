Online is really bad, you can never buy anything because everything is expensive as hell and missions do not pay off.Not to mention most of missions are PvP or adversary t like they like to call, there are just a few limited PvE missions. And they keep shoving down filler boring adversary modes each update. You want to play solo or with just a group of friends without the boringkids spamming bullets at you? Too bad.They promised SP content but it never came too. A shame because the singleplayer is actually well crafted.And on top of that Take Two is antimods, any company that is antimods have my disapproval, Take Two may aswell Take Two big sticks and shove it up back there.
