This game as of recently is very disappointing. The prices for items is SO high and the prices keep inflating while, at the same time, the missions and heists stayed the same or have even been nurffed. As a veteran player, I would need to play roughly 50 hours just to make enough money to afford the prerequisites required to play the doomsday heist.Really a shame the dynamic of this game has changed so drastically. Its likely in part to so may people modding and cheating but also more likely a result of pushing people to pay for micro transactions/shark cards.On a side note, the shark cars are way over priced. Id almost consider one if it wasnt so expensive USD  In Game Currency
