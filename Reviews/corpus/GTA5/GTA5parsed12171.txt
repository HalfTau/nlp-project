about 75 hours to beat you can knock off about 10 hours more or less because I was trying to do the lester stock market missions by holding them off and try to go for that 2.1 billion dollars account also because I was dicking around at times but not alot.for the most part I FREAKING LOVE THIS GAME! Speaking as a Vet of all GTA games THIS ONE takes the cake for methe story oh my god by far the best than any of the previous games but that is my opinion GTA san an had a great story but this one I lovethe only thing that bothers me is that the map should had stayed the same for GTA San AN ya it may be big but I want the old map but HI DEFmultiplayer is another story I cant touch on solely because I didnt get fully in to it and I think rocketstar are beingand think that they made a multiplayer and can sit back and let us gamers dish out our own hard cash as theyaround. I SAY NO F U ROCKETSTAR!! !so for the score10/10 love Trevor and all the others
