I enjoyed the game mainly in single player, only for a few days ago to wake up and I wanted to mod the single player only. But when I try to do this, I see the OpenIV website it says that they are getting a cease and deseace from one of the companys that own GTA. They destroyed one of the main reasons to play this game if you dont enjoy there multiplayer. 5070 of the player that play this game would mod the single player, have been destroyed. I would have recommend it, but the only reason why I am not giving it a positive review is because of this one decision.
