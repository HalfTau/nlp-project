I really want to like the game, single player is awesome but online is unplayable. You can hang around do whatever but its impossible to do any MC or CEO activities. As soon as you start a mission a modder is going to ruin it for you. Rockstar Games does a really bad job on stopping it. There are modders in 9/10 lobbies at any time of the day. It would be very easy to have a handful of people to monitor this and ban any modder on sight. Cant recommend at all right now.
