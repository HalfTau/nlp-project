I have 141hrs on this game and 2M in game. Thats after purchasing an 8M shark card. 141hrs!!!! That was enough time to max out a character in ESO. That was enough time to become invincible in Skyrim. I have a coke house, a weed house, a biker club, a car garage, and a cargo garage, and I have nothing to show for it. The grind is rediculous!!!!!! Dont waste your money.
