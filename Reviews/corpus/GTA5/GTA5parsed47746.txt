TakeTwo, I really hope youre going to do something to ease the raging inferno thats going on throughout the GTA modding community.I love the game, but I currently cant recommend it until some form of solution can be made so that modders can still freely mod the single player portion as they wish while allowing the multiplayer portion to run with fewer risks of running into cheaters.
