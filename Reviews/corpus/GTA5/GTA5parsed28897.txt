I personally love Grand Theft Auto V Story mode and Online. And before you start complaining about hackers and other bs you have to deal with online hear me out. The shutdown of OpenIV sucked but i havent seen a single hacker since. The story mode is  amazing. Ive almost beat the main storyline and I cant wait for the ending. Rockstar is by far my favorite game developer.10/10 57 in game hours played. Cant wait to spend a few more days of my life in this game.
