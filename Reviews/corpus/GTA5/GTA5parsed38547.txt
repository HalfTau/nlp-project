Basically buy this game if you wanna spend 6070 dollars depending on your region and then get nickled and dimed online. This game WAS really good when it came out and then it got worse and worse. R does nothing to really moderate online and cant seem to patch hacking worth a damn but then proceeds to demolish the modding community associated with this game.Also for a game thats been released 5 times or so between all the consoles and the PC theyve really failed to innovate. They add some new stuff to MP every now and again but mostly its not much, the last several expansions have all felt like cut and paste copies of eachother with different skins. Also the replayability for the singleplayer sucks. Once youve beat the game once theres no real reason to go back and play it, you just accrue a bunch of money that you cant spend on anything new because all the new weapons, cars, clothes and houses are multiplayer exclusives. Half of my time spent in this game I spent on single player mods like LSPDFR and now I wont be able to use those because TakeTwo and R are so greedy that the HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS that this game has generated for them ISNT ENOUGH. So yeah, spend your hard earned money elsewhere. This game has been out for years and still commands full price and then theres shark cards to top it off. Half the time the server load times are outrageous, the game crashes and freezes for no reason whatsoever and 6/10 sessions get hacked. There have been times when playing this game where I spent the entire time bouncing server to server with friends because either the server didnt work right, there were greifers or hackers. NOT WORTH 69.99 CAD.
