GTA V was a great game until their Publisher, Take Two decided to be more greedy and ban all modding within the game.  It has become increasingly clear the relationship with this publisher and gamers in general has gone down the crapper. As difficult as it was, I have cancelled my preorder for red dead redemption 2 as well. I can only imagine what kind of money sucking mechanism they will put into red dead 2 after seeing this. Rockstar thermselves have always backed modding in general and have even encouraged it in the past, wich makes this very confusing. Take Twos focus is now to penny pinch their customer base even a little bit more. It makes me sick and angry and I am out, see yah guys!
