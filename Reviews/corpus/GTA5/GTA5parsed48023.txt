Well Im glad rockstar stepped in and took care of all the bs going on with take two. GTA online is still flawed though in the sense that you make very little money doing things that should give you lots and to buy one thing its millions of dollars. Take Two still is pushing microtransactions very hard for a 60 game and I despise that. I also dont like being forced into a public lobby to do certain things to make money, where any  can just blow you up and ruin everything. So overall this game still kinda blows.
