TakeTwo has lost and mods are back.If your gonna buy this game for the single player stop reading this review and buy it.The online experience is a different story though. Rockstar has been hard on hackers lately. With the new Gunrunning DLC out it seems like Rockstar wants you if not forces you to buy Shark Cards  F you Im not buying no shark cards. If you have a lot of money buy this game. Its essentially pay to win. The new weaponized vehicles cost a lot and are very powerful. I would strongly recommend this game of you have a buddy or two to play with.Overall this isone of my favorite games of all time.10/10 There some things that can be improved, for example why cant we get battleships instead of those useless Yachts. It would make that freemode The one where you have to capture the Yacht in free mode event like a warzone.
