Original review below, but as promised, I can now recommend this game once again, because the publisher Take Two Games listened to the community. Hopefully this warning shot from the community is enough to discourage attacking your fanbase and the core of the PC gamers/modders that promote and buy your games.If this mod banning behavior goes ahead, never again will I purchase from any Take Two entity, this is the second time I purchased this game BECAUSE OF MODS! This will gut your community and enthusiasm for the game. this review is reflective only of the move by the devs/publishers, the game is great, but is about to get worse. And I cannot recommend it on that basis. If this stops, I will update this review accordingly.
