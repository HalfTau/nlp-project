OpenIV has existed for ten years.. and now they decide to send the cease and desis? Conveniently around E3 too? TakeTwo are purely attempting to take all the fun out of Singleplayer and force you into their bs online mode. Want to buy a supercar? Have fun grinding the same bs mission with consistent idiotic randos who constaly die and force restarts. Oh and dont forget all the waiting when online, want to join a mission? open your phone and go make some popcorn  it takes that damn long to load. Having mods for singleplayer were essential to the survival of this game, one should be able to modify their own property with the tools the community provides as long as it stays in an offline mod. I really hope TakeTwo undoes this
