Story Mode is damn fantastic, completed it 4 times across PS3  PC.GTA Online, played over 750 hours in it across PS3  PC. Really good, butis pretty damn expensive these days, does tend to get really grindy, but still enjoyable.The reason I still play this game almost every single dayMods.Adds a whole new level to the game.LSPDFR is damn brilliant.Take Two tried to take mods away from us, but we backlashed them so much they retracted the order lmao.Overall I 100 recommend this game,  maybe wait for the sale though.
