Of all my 1,680.9 hrs on record, at least 1650 hours was spent working on a personal project that I was wrapping up by Q3 this year.Take Two interactive just had to take the fking pss on the harmless Singplayer Community with this shtty illegal modding CD years after the game has come to PC. Closing down Open IV was totally uncalled for.EDIT R worked with T2 to rectify the situation in a notsoshortbutnottoolong timely fashion, and single player modding is in the clear, OpenIV was brought back online... lets hope it stays that way.
