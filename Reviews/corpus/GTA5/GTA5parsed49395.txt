Having fun in this game is like driving a coal train that runs on dollar bills, you gotta keep shovelling money into it to make it work. Dont buy it, without OpenIV and mods the singleplayer get super boring after a while and the multiplayer is just full of hackers and MicroTransactions, because making money takes ages.
