The story mode was a great experience and was not the original reason i intended to buy this game. I bought this game to play online with friends.GTA online is one of the most frustrating things i have experienced. Rockstar releases amazing content but puts massive price tags on them pushing players to either grind for hours on end or buy a shark card. The shark cards are so ridiculous that it annoys me that ive actually purchased them in the past. You pay 40 for a game and yet to actually play it you need to pay even more. I would definatly not reccomend this game unless you want to experience the story or your an arabian prince.
