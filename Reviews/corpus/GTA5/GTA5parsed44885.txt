Game used to be great. But everything changed when TakeTwo became so hungry for money as if the 3 billion dollar they made from this game wasnt enough and started eliminating every threat in their way. Modding is one of the threats and they do everything to prevent this. OpenIV was created for singleplayer use mods only. Even though mods installed with OpenIV can be used in online, OpenIV development team said they were against online modding ever since and created OpenIV for singleplayer mods only. Dont feed TakeTwos pockets with your money. Even if game looks awesome. DONT BUY IT!
