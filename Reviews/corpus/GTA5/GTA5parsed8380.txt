Probably the only game Ive bought on two platforms at full price  Once 3 months after it came out for Xbox 360, and once on the PC release.While there has been some controversy lately with tar doing some shady it is still a dank game though I couldnt tell you about most of it since I only really do racing withxd.Rating 8.7/10
