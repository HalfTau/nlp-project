TakeTwo, the publisher of GTA V forced the developers of OpenIV a mod creation tool to cease development because mods were made that were used in a malicious way in online play. Instead of correcting thier security or working to produce official mod creation tools, they just ended all modding since OpenIV is the only way to create a mod for this game.I cannot recommend a product when the company behind it is so incompetent as to blame the modding community when their games online security is defeated by a few people. Regardless of if they change their stance, I cant recommend this or any other TakeTwo product.
