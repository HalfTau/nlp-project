What happened to this game... it was such a masterpiece... The singleplayer still is, but online, everything is different... what happened to the low life criminal adventures you could have with your friends, the realisticly priced cars, the missions, people who didnt kill on sight... the fun...Take2 Interactive... you ruined it... you ruined it all, and we will not forgive you. The reason youre still alive, is because of 12 year ols, watching youtuber hyping stuff up, increasing your shark card sales, so they can have that cool stuff the youtubers have... you made having fun, into a pay to be accepted...
