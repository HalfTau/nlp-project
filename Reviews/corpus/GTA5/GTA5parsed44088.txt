The only reason I got this game was to mod it. I put up with the horrible 3rd party stuff from rockstar. I even gave a terriable company like Rockstar and T2 my money. I deeply regret it now as this thing is just taking up so much of my SSD now and will be removing it. I will not install this game till OpenIV or some other way to MOD this game gomes out as it is not worth your time. All they care about now is the Online content and not what made the GTA series great. GTA got hudge cause it is the best sandbox game out there and MODs made that even better. RIP GTA
