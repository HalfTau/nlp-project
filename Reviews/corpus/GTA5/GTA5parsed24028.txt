They stomp on modders as hard as they can even though they say they support modding.The online system is also equivalent to pay to win free to play games except you pay to play and pay to have more fun. Not only that but the Shark Cards, the thing you buy to get in game cash, are grossly overpriced. 100 real cash for 8mill in game. 8mill may sound like a lot but in this game its practically nothing. Combine the cost of Shark Cards on top of the 60 upfront cost for this 4 year old game and you have a bloated company looking to take every cent from your wallet.
