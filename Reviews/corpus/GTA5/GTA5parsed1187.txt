GTA Online is the worst part of this game, because hackers with highest levels  which are impossible to get  kill you in one hit. And the modders too. Also i once was playing an online mission and then I saw a dude flying around in NoClip mode!! WHAT? I just seriously wish that they fix or do whatever to make it aa better place to play.
