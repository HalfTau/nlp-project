I wish you could give seperate recommendations for single player and online, that being said the online is what this game is most famous for so that will be the basis of this recommendation. I am not going to write war and peace on this subject, but the online is an absolute mess, it is littered with modders and cheats  I know this sounds like a cliche, but in this case it is very accurate and has been subject to ridiculous cost inflation designed to encourage the use of mico transactions, the UI is also horrific and clunky and could easily be fixed with numerous simple QOL changes. The whole thing just feels lazy at this point, mostly because it seems that R are trying to accomodate the bottom of the barrel in terms of their player base which is the ADHD COD teenagers who just want to blow things up and rage in chat.This game series has always been quite the oxymoron in the sense that it is a very adult and mature game that is primarily consumed by adolescents and children, that in of itself is not an issue as you cannot force people to be responsible parents but when the developers start making that consumer base their primary target audience then I can no longer support that franchise.
