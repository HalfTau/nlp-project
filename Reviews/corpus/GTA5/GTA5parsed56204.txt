Welp you have the gun to your head, I really hope you dont pull the triggerOpenIV!EditWarning minor swearing ahead...Now all the modding stuff is over but I have to keep my review as it is, Multiplayer is unplayable because of how much of a complete cash grab it is. I pay 60 ing dollars as it is TWICE because of the held back release for pc and you still cant be happy with having one of the best selling games and not dropping the price a bit from the original.The only reason I still play this game is because of the single player modding community who have salvaged this game a bit, and you almost ed that up as well so nice job there.I would say that the new dlcs being produced for Online is a plus but even that is just another scheme to get there greedy hands into your moms purses by making them cost so astronomically high that the fastest way to get the new stuff is to go out and get a literal ing job which takes less time then grinding out the boringmissions or playing with friends.I really wanted this to be a fantastic multiplayer that you cound roam around and just have fun like gta 4 but you cant even do that anymore with all the people who payed for military class vehicles and even worse the hackers in every other lobby who just blow up the entire world.Oh but dont worry the modders cant give out money anymore, Rockstar made sure of that becasue if people had money to actually play the ing game then they couldnt fill there greasy pockets full of yourparents hard earnings.
