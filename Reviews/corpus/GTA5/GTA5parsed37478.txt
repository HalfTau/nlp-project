Absolutely insane that they would kill modding for a game on the basis of it can be used to hack multiplayer, which is already rampant even without modding. There was simply no need for this and an obvious power grab to make more money by selling sharkcards, trying to force people into multiplayer, by gutting single player modding for continued fun in the game. Its far easier just to uninstall and never support either Rockstar or Two Take again.
