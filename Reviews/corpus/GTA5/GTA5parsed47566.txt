So, this game is a good game, and I would give it a positive review, but some recent actions by TakeTwo have led me to give a more negative review. The gameplay of singleplayer is good, and the story is quite good. The online is quite fun, though the emphasis on their longing for money is evident in the high prices and advertising of microtransactions. But TakeTwos recent cease and desist to OpenIV because it enables recent malicious mods that...interfere with...GTA Online... pushes me to write a negative review. OpenIV is not a script mod, which is what most Online hacks are. OpenIV has never had malicious intent, it was a basis for modding to mess around in singleplayer. TakeTwo has just made the wrong decision here. If they had a problem with an Online hack enabled by OpenIV, they could have tried to work with OpenIV to stop the Online hack rather than shut down the entire modding community. This was timed in such a way that one could say it had to do with the work on a port of Liberty City into GTA V, but I feel that there is not a single person who would buy a game just for the map. The experience of Liberty City in GTA V would be completly different from GTA IV with the different physics and lighting and stuff. I would advise you to also leave a negative review on GTA V to get as much attention as possible.EDIT Now that OpenIV is back, I give this game a positive review because its fun, but I advise you to avoid large public online sessions.
