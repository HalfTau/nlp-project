GTA V was a really good game. But Take Two is a bad, gamer unfriendly company.They threaten to sue the developers of the OpenIV modding tool, a battle too expensive for the developers.So it is too easy for a rich company like Take Two to ban modding in singleplayer mode even if there may be no rights violation.Shame on Take Two, shame on Rockstar, shame on the legal system.Please protest by giving this game a bad critic or by not buying it.
