GTA V is a great game.  My time logged on Steam is a fraction of the time I spent with this game since it first released.  You probably dont need to read a review section at this point to make your decision.  Since the game is on sale for 50 off at the time of this review its a good time to buy it if you havent already.Since Rockstar is resolving the OpenIV debacle the tool is receiving updates again and clarified their and TakeTwos stance on single player mods, Im leaving a positive review to help balance out the negativity.Thanks for listening to the modding community.
