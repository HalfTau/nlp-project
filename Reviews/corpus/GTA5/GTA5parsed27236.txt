Ie had this game on two platforms for years and played single player mods on both. I hate the multi player aspect of the games as i dont enjoy playing a game with a buch of childern. If Take 2 had a brain they would clap down on 8 and 9 year olds playing a game they have no business playing, not a modding community that has made them millions in sales because the mods are better than the orgional game content. As im concerned they can take their ridicilous over priced shark cards and all future titles and shove them up thier bank accounts. There work any more is repeditive and there  other games that you can mod where the owners arent money crazed nut jobs. I feel like ive wasted three years and alot of time for nothing. I say anyone with a  concious should boy cott the rock star servers and not buy any of their stupid card junk. Their new dlcs seem like a modding community rip offs any way
