Boring, incredibly easy, uninspired, tedious.  Majority of missions are drive ab or do some annoying minigame occasionally you get to shoot someone, but its so easy its boring too, I dont think I died a single time during a mission to gunfire.  Story is generic trash too Trevors character as a minor exception.
