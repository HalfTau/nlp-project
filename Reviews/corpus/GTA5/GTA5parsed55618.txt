A publisher that is not modfriendly is not one I want to support, neither is one that is microtransaction greedy ALONG with alientating the singleplayer community by abandoning that half of the game. Modding should be free and open, Tale 2 can expect never to get any of my money along with other publishers that think its okay to CD things that HELP their game gain more popularity and players.People play GTA for the mods and have for years, and Open IV was a huge pioneer in this, making a free tool to simply replace textures and assets. It does not steal content, it does not turn a profit, so other than being a P.O.S publisher there was no reason to take that away from the players.
