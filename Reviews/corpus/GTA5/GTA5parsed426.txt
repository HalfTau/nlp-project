No one knows how to game it anymore. They did too many updates and should make Mods part of it so you can have blocks against attacks and drop tons of money. That is all people want to do and socialize. More like the SIMS and less like GTA5. I dont think banning people who are cool helps but they must have a thing with the mod sites to allow it to a point. Why not just make a money gun and spawn where you want at any time? No Pimps hats with the feather. No Lasers. People can no longer game really, They are dumped online and have no social skills outside a SAFE SPACE so R has failed to commit to a game and want to make it more of a casino where you keep buying shark cards to cut having to earn the money. No one can affford 5 million dollar car and 10 million dollar yacht in the game. It is really poor logic and takes away from social hour of trolling in game about how cool my rims and car look. The mental levels continue to degrade in the game. Max age is 5 or 6 I would say. Just a place to babysit kids for free.
