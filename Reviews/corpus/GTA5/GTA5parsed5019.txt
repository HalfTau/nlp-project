Fun game to play online and great story.  But 1 thing I dont like about it is Online Like to be honest I love online its great with friends but Sometimes I would join a session and I would just find a hacker. And I hate GTA 5 Online for that because they can  your day up like if you were doing a MC mission or a dilivery for your weed farm. Yeah but I still reccomend it.Join my group as well for latest updates on free games!
