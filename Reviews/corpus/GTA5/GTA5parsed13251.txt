Despite coming out  in 2013 orignally on the consoles, this game still holds up on its own now in 2017. The PC version as always is the best version to get.There has been a lot of negatvity surrounding this game but which GTA isnt controversial most notably the GTA Online componentread microtransactions as well as the single player modding tools. I cannot say much about the modding as i personally enjoy the vanilla game as is.Microtransactions have plagued the industry and this is no different here. I just dont buy or spend any money on that so, problem solved.That being said, the game itself is very enjoyable with a memorable cast, narrative and a welllived in open world.The game is still hugely popular which is why its still full price. It does go on sale frequently so you could wait for that.Now, if only Rockstar could bring Red Dead Redemption to PC.
