I have played this game since june of 2015.After i completed the single player mode, and messed about in the online, i stated to use mods. I really liked the modding community and was waiting a few days after every update to use mods.I have spent around 100 hours playing with mods.Taketwos decision to shut down OpenIV A very important modding tool is stupid and the only reason that decision was made, is to get people to play the online mode, which at this point is just a hell of mindless grinding and microtransactions.Its time to do something. I encourage everyone that owns GTA V to post a negative review. TakeTwo are idiots.On behalf of GTA modding community, and the OpenIV team F YOU TAKETWO!
