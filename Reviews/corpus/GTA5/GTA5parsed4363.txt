I used to love this game until they raised the costs of everything online and decreased the rewards to the point you actually lose money doing missions...It was already extremely grindy before now its just unplayable online..Im glad I got most of my stuff before the changes.Not to mention for a lot of us vets like myself who logged in recently years later, all of our money disappeared. I had somewhere between 1020m. I login and only had 69k..................
