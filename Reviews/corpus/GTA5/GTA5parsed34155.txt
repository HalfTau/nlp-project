Like most people i too will join the  gta v bandwegon, but tbh they deserve it. Imagine if Bethesda would send a cease and desist to the devs of skse and make 80 of mods unblayble. Yes and microtransactions in a full price 60 game to milk players for money is not so nice too especially with the updates, that are nice abd what not but, the cost of these updates is pretty steep if youre not planning on buying shark cards, a prime example of that is nerdcubed video on gta online The Henderson Challenge. Allinall its a neat and polished game with great mechanics and attention to detail but, microtransactions and no modding for pc its not worth it. YOU TakeTwo Interactive and  YOU Rockstar you cucks, openiv is not a hacking tool you are justpushing for more money through microtransactions in the online. Have a nice day, yours truly Ushanka.
