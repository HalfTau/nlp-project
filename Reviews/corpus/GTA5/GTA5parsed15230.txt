If youre looking to have fun, look somewhere else.  this game,  rockstar, and  take 2. Not only does this game run like , they fill the online portion with hours of grinding so you end up doing the same repetitiveover and over until you either quit or cave and buy a shark card, which are insanely overpriced for the small amount that they give you. I also cannot run this game properly, even after reinstalling drivers, on a GTX 1070 and an i5 4690, this game runs like absoulute Its borderline unplayable at spots, especially when it comes to driving and flying. The game literally locks up for 3 seconds or more sometimes, making it virtually unplayable. You cant even have fun online because thedevelopers refuse to do anything about the huge hacker issue going around, and they punish legit players by making them grind for hours on end or spend huge amounts of money on shark cards while hackers get to roam free and do whatever the  they want. Also cheated me out of hours of grinding due to deceptive wording in game when in came to the vehicle cargo.. tricked me into buying a useless ing garage instead of what I actually needed because the game doesnt try to distinguish the 2. Bottom line,  this game, its an unplayable grind fest with performance issues and a ing F2P business model, which is pathetic considering how well the game has sold and is still selling, yet they STILL try to milk the legit players for all their worth. TWO FATDOWN!!!!
