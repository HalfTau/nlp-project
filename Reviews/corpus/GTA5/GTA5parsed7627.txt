the single player is great, its worth the price alone to play the single player. if you delve into multiplayer though expect to be confused at first, not a lot of hand holding but its a decently fast game to pick up. the pc community is strong and there is no lack of content, but the online portion is 100 based around the grind. so if youre not looking for a game to last at least a couple hundred hours then prepare to pull out your wallet to pay for in game currency because it takes a long time to earn.there will be hackers, they will ruin your lobbies and kill you, but most 85 ish of the time nobody bothers you in smaller lobbies.
