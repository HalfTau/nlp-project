So, the story mode is quite fun, however my review will be more centered around GTA online.GTA online overall is pretty fun, its cool to play with your friends, drive fast cars, fly planes, and just do dumbThe downside is though, to do these things, you have to do a lot of grinding, when you start the game, you have 0 so youre forced to rob stores to get money before you can purchase vip to actually start making money. The thing is though, is that robbing stores is a pain in the and only gives you about 1000 per store. And vip costs 20000. And then, after you get vip, youre gonna wanna get CEO, which requires you to have at least a million dollars. So you have to do vip missions which give you about 20000 per mission all the way until you can get ceo, then you can actually start making good money, keep in mind that you still have to grind ceo work, but at least now you can get actually cash.I totally recommend the game due to it being very fun with friends and having so much to offer. My only warning is that assuming youre doing the grinding by yourself its gonna take you a fair 20 hours into the online mode before you can start enjoying a lot of the coolin the game.
