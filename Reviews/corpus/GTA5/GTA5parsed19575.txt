The story mode is pretty good, but online is one nightmare for new players and existing players1. Everywhere people throwing sticky bombs and destroying your car.2. You have to do the same mission so many times of you want to earn money.3. If you encounter a hacker/cheater you can get banned too!But its a well made game and you can see there is a lot of effort put in this so 6/10 the Online ruins it.Oh ehhh, the loading times.
