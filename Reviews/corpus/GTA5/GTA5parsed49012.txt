Take Two does not deserve your money, it is legal precedent that modding through OpenIV was legal, but they chose to disregard that anyways. No one buys this on PC for the vanilla or online, they screwed over all the community. Take Two does not respect you, dont give them any of your money until if they possibly reverse their decision and they wont.In other words, never buy or play anything from Take Two Interactive again.
