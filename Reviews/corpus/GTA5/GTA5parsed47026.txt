This is a complete and utter money pit. The base price for the game is 60, but you are going to have to spend AT LEAST three times that if you wish to enjoy some of the new content Rockstar has been adding into GTA Online. On top of all this, it looks like single player modding and enjoying the game for free even though you have already spent 60 at this point will be impossible in the near future, with TakeTwo actively trying to take OpenIV down so to speak the only software that allows you to edit the game files. There also really is no sensible way of going about making money in GTA Online, even less so for the kind of money the new content requires tens of millions of ingame dollarsTo sum it all up, GTA V is a fantastic game in itself, but at this point is too saturated and hindered by microtransactions to even be playable. To top it all off, TakeTwo have now shown their true colours in trying to stop the only way their customers can make more out of their game without paying.Conclusion Rockstar and TakeTwo Interactive care a lot more about your money than they do their customers.
