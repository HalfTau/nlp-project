GTA V is trying to fix their game by banning modders. This is complete T. Heres why... You spend 20 hours grinding to get the new super car... thats about maybe 4 days after work gaming time, and just playing this dumbass game... Now two days later Rockstar says Nah fam yoaint the best car no mo and releases the newest sexiest car that makes yours look like shiiiiiit. Now thats not to mention guns, houses, businesses, garages, clothes, helicopters, yachts, boats, planes, and special vehicles... Its a pay to win crowd where the Youtubers who make money on this content will spend loads of money on shark cards, because theyll make the money back in two videos which is like maybe 3 hours of clipped and edited gampley for a 4 minute Funny GTA Online Comiplation 8 video. Rockstar is money hungry because they cant keep up with the real developers who make decent games that dont need microtransactions to make even more money and who care about the player base. You Rockstar.
