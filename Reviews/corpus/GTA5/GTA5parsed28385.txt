Rockstar have shut down modding. They have lied to their community outright and have used legal force to shut down any and all obstacles threatening their bottom line, including single player mods that expand the games creative potential and allow new communities to form. Its all gone.Rockstar are clearly communicating that if you arent intending to be nickelanddimed for every last cent at every opportunity, you can go  yourself. They have no interest in you, and this game has nothing left to offer you.Do not buy.But more important than that do not forget. They have pulled this here. They WILL pull it again, and the next game, and the next. Vote with your wallet next time, and do not fall for it.
