Rest in peace, GTA.I loved the Grand Theft Auto series for a long time, because modding was available. And now? Take Two, take yourand leave this world. I hope they allow the usage of OpenIV and mods again, otherways I wont buy anything of them anymore. This is way too much and all the modding has to be reactivated.
