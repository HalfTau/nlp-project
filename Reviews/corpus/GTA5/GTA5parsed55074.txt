Ive bought this game three times. PS3, PS4, and when I finally built my PC, here as well. And I bought it the third time, FOR THE MODS!!! I am SO glad to see these mostly negative reviews recently and I TRULY hope this terrible press continues for Take 2. Honestly, if I could refund all three FULL PRICE purchases to deny these s the money they so badly desire from microtransactions, I absolutely would. Its asinine that BILLIONS of dollars isnt enough... that they need ALL the money. Go  yourself.
