I hate this game and every hour I ever put and am going to put into this game. Its a constant grind and living in fear that some kid with issues in your lobby is going to come with his undestructable car with a minigun mounted on it and is going to destroy your fragile asshipment. Rockstar lives from their cancerous community which makes it hard for people to earn money by grinding and makes them want to buy ingame money, aka shark cards which are incredibly expensive with real money.I would only recommend this game if you have 45 people to play with. Anything under that is useless. Otherwise, dont buy it. Youll waste your money and your time.
