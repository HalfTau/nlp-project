GTA 5s singleplayer, in my opinion, is the core and most fun part of the game.9/10The multiplayer in GTA 5 is known as GTA Online. I believe it to be the secondary part of the game.6/107/10While the singleplayer is fun and there is a wide range of things to do due to the large modding scene you can eventually run out of things to do since repeating certain things can get boring. Once you go into the multiplayer there tends to be a modder in around 1 or 2 of every 10 lobbies. The missions generally dont give you much and tend not to be fun. With mediocre updates that add items that cost millions of ingame dollars which tend not to improve or add to the fairly generic gameplay and devs who seem to be running out of ideas as well as the fairly pay to win microtransactions. I would recommend this game to those who want to play a good singleplayer but would also like some form of multiplayer even if it isnt great.
