Up until recently, I could not recommend this game enough.Single player is pretty good, the game world is amazing, graphics are fantastic, racing in GTA Online is fun, although Online seems intentionally grindy with how expensive newlyreleased content tends to be.Once youve beaten the single player story mode, there are many hours of fun to be had with mods. Vehicle handling mods, new content, additional missions and campaigns, GTA V is or rather, was a great sandbox to play with these things.Now that Take2 has effectively axed modding support from the game, I pretty much have no reason to play it anymore. Because of modding, I put 70 hours into GTA 4 without ever finishing story mode.
