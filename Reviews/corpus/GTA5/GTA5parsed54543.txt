GTAV is a genre defining sandbox game, I mean, what game isnt at least partially based around mechanics forged from the series? Over the decade, it has evolved and developed into a unique title with every console generation.Now for the online game. I want to like GTA Online. I really do. Since I purchased the game, I have not sat down for more than an hour of online foolery with friends without at least one modder/hacker/scriptkiddie dropping in and parking a bus in my garage, or instakilling my cargo shipments from across the map. Or selling off all my cars.When I do and its a rare occurence manage to find a lobby thats not full of hacked cars or screaming kids, I do manage to have a half decent time. Until I hit a paywall, needing another 2 million dollars to progress my business. Rather than provide interesting, diverse gameplay to achieve the many expensive things in the online mode and there are a lot of expensive, necesary items, Rockstar chose mircotransactions. Lots of them. For the low, low price of 9.99 or so, you can chop nearly a dozen hours off any grind for any item through the in game shark cards aptly named payment for direct progression. Oh, but theyre not necesary! Sure. You can grind for dozens and dozens of hours for a small bit of progression, and the Shark Cards get a little expensive for larger purchases. You can hit your head against that wall as long as you want. However, as far as Im concerned, direct money out of your wallet for small chunks of progress undermines the entire point of the online game.TL,DRThe game is quite enjoyable at its core, however, total lack of moderation or consideration towards players spoils the online mode. Microtransactions, although not totally necesary to progress, ruin my enjoyment of the game by always lingering there as an easyout option.
