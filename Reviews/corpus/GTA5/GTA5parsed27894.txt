did you ever hear the tragedy of darth take two the dumb? I thought not, its not a story rockstar would tell you its a capitalist legend. Darth take two  was a dark lord of capitaliosm so corrupt and powerful he could use the shark cards to influence the wallets to create, profit. He had such a knowledge of the shark cards he could even keep the ones he cared about from playing modded games. The modded side of games is a pathway many consider to be better than the base game. Take two became so corrupt the only thing he was araid of was losing his players which eventually of coure he did. Ironic, he could save other games but not himself.
