Played online for a few hours, got banned for no reason.Story Mode is fun to play.Dont buy this game at full price.Dont purchase ingame currency. Not worth it, and not worth them taking more money until they fix things.Oh, and customer service is the worst I have seen in games. Auto reply without answering my questions, resend the ticket, then Im banned from sending another request ticket for 12 hours.The support guy is Sean R. Straussfeels like theyre banning everyone and everythingI never knew modding in game is bad I didnt mod, I just happened to read some posts talking about itSo in short, if you want to play GTA 5 with mods, I highly recommend to play pirated or cracked version of GTA 5. When you get banned online or story mode, doesnt matter, both are screwedand cant play anyway.
