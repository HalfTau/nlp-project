To put it simply, the game itself is enjoyable and theres a good reason why many people like myself have put this many hours into it. This does not change the fact that TakeTwo, unhappy with their football stadiums of cash, want to deliberately attack fans and modders of the game. These passionate fans put months of work into crafting something to fill the desires of those who wish to see more single player content, and TakeTwo has squandered this in the pettiest display of corporate greed I have ever seen from any company.Rockstar doesnt deserve the flak this game is getting, but TakeTwo sure as hell do, which is why I wont be purchasing Civilizations 6, XCOM 2, or the upcoming Red Dead Redemption 2 for TakeTwos anticonsumer practices.
