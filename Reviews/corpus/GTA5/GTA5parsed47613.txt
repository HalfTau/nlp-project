This is the first GTA game I bought, but TakeTwos action of taking back mods will guarantee this is the last purchase of theirs I make. If it didnt support mods out of the gate, that would be one thing, but canning mods after this long?Modders work hard to craft what they do, and stringing along a community before crushing what is likely untold thousands of hours of work thats disrespect I wont ignore.
