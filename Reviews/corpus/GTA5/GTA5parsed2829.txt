Ok I finally broke down and got this game because friends playing it. Thank Jebus I only paid 20 bucks for this single player marvel and complete multiplayer hack fest trash. First the main issue...1. The developers do NOTHING to stop people from hacking the game2. It completely stops you from just playing with your friends. every damn mission the game forces you to join public or throws some random joe into your misson. It FORCES you to join public servers and deal with those hackers in order to do ANYTHING with your buisnesses.3. It only supports MODS in single player. There are some AMAZING MODS for this game like the graphics overhaul mods that are only on your end and in no way affect the game for ANYONE ONE ELSE that are straight up not allowed into online because of rockstars BS controling how you play the game. So in reality the is NO MOD SUPPORT FOR THIS GAME!!!!4. the SUPER BASIC concept of alowing players to create their own PUBLIC SERVERS, allow who they want in their PUBLIC servers, and have the ability to browse PUBLIC servers that are online has aparently escaped rock star. THIS alone would have made this game amazing and would have completely looked over the other glaring issues because they really wouldnt be an issue....THIS would eliminate 90 of this ing games problems.5. STOP AUTO CORRECTING MY HELI FLIGHT AND ALLOW FOR MOUSE AXIS PITCH CONTROL!!!So overall impression of this game. If your looking for an AMAZING singleplayer game that is deep and entraling in its execution and has SP Mod support... This game is an absolute must...If your looking for a multiplayer even close to most other games basic functionality and options for multiplayer.... STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE
