If you are planning to get the game,get it while discounted.Most of the negative reviews are pointed toward GTA Online and its problems with hackers giving out money and innocent people getting their money taken for nomy review I will put the entire online aspect aside.I have around 50 hours on the PC version as of writing this  at least 100150 more from the PS3 version i got in 2013.ProsStunning visuals in a stereotypical US setting there is a large map and everyone will find somthing for his/her likenesstypical Rockstar humour,either in dialogue or subtly hidden around the map,which makes every minute of the game fun.a HUGE amount of activities racing,hunting,golf,tennis,submarine,and way more and side missions/collectibles which are quite rewarding and add to replayability of the gamethe first person mode,which makes the game look fresh and new,and even gave me the feel of playing for the first timean amazing modding community,if you get bored of the original game,there are some sick mods such as the LSPDFR or even online RP mods similar to SAMP for GTASAgood optimizationConsSingleplayer is singleplayer,it gets boring when you realise you are alone in a huge world.As i said,get some mods.Rockstar not actually supporting mods.Remember GTASA or IV and the easy mod manager?Well forget that now,even installing a simple car requires 5 or 6 steps and changing scripts/adding lines etc. which is a huge bummer.Seems to me they have an ego issue with their game being good enough to play without any mods.Its a large problem because the modders are the soul of the community and not supporting them is killing your own fanbase.So to sum it upDefinitely get the game if you are a fan of previous games of the series,especially if the game is discounted.I bought the game twice first for PS3,full price,and now discounted,and it was worth every single penny.
