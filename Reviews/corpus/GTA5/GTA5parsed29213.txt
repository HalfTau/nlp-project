Modding is the soul of a game and extends its lifespan.I loved GTA Vs core game, but its limited and this was fixed by mods.Now that Take Two and Rockstar has in practice banned modding on a piece of software we have purchased the right to use, I have no more use of this game. If I could I would demand a refund, but as I bought it years ago, I will have to be satisfied with leaving this review and not recommend it to anyone else. you.Love,Loki
