Ive loved GTA games for a long time. After taking a break from this game I was planning on coming back and giving it another go. The fact that Take Two justall over modders is pathetic and will only hurt themselves in the long run. Its really sad to see a company thats responsible for such a great series of games go down this path when modding has done nothing but given this game a much extended life. You only need to look at a game like Skyrim thats coming up to 10 years old to see how modding can keep that game fresh.If this is there idea of smart buisness sense they need to get there corporate heads out of their asses and wake up. Unless they realise there mistake and fix it I will not play or purchase any of there games again. And I highly recommened anyone considering buying this game or coming back to play it to do the same.
