I played this on my mac and it ran exceptionally. I simply love this game. It has beautiful graphics and an excellent story. Most games either have a good plot, or good graphics, not both. I LOVE these characters. The game also comes with an online mode, which is very fun to experiment with. I recommend this to anyone looking for a storyrich video game, that also loves good graphics.
