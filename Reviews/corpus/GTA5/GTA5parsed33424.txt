I was always a fan of Grand Theft Auto series and have been playing it since GTA 2. I was appalled to see legal action taken against modding tools and the mod community in general. Ive seen great multiplayer projects taken down and nobody really cared, I understand the whole concept of protecting the take two property, but its no way to be involved with your community, the people who have bought the game over the years. Future projects may be less successful because of this reason.Something needs to be changed for a better future of Rockstar games.
