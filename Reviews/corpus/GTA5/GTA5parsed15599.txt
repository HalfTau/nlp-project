Used to be OK.  Now it is terrible. There are hackers in quite literally almost every game. It used to be only occasional. They will laugh when you talk about reporting them becasue Rockstar doesnt care about banning them. Only the ones who give money are banned. Numerous times have I been mocked by blatent hackers that they will not get banned. My friend got ALL of his money taken. Legit money. GONE.Insane grindfest. Even things that are not useful for anything more than fun or looks are still extreemly expensive. The grindfest becomes worse when you consider griefers and hackers. The only way to do anything is to get in a lobby with a few other people who are doing what you are doing. Which is CEO, Bunker, Air frieght etc. Or you can look up the ways to trick the game into putting you by yourself.The single player is amazing but it is still lame that they took out police, fire and ambulance missions. They improved the vigilante missions in 4. They could have built upon that and do the same for the others. You also have very little car storage and a small amount of cars you can buy compared to online.I also though it was very lame that I could not buy houses especially with all of the real estate ads spread about the game. It felt like I was being mocked by things I used to be able to do in GTA.I miss when I could pvp with my friends aganst other groups and not worry so much about hackers.Some of the most fun times were when me and my friends were in a private at a good stunt spot stunting motorcyles until eveyone we had has been destroyed.
