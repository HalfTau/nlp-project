only if its on sale. 60 dollars still for a game that came out on 360 LOL. modders are so common it surprises me when i join a lobby without getting killed every 30 seconds by just falling over. they will give you like a billion dollars and youll get banned for it. fun game, just a terrible community and the developers doesnt seem to care. buy only if its on a good sale
