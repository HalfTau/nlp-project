Do yourself a favor and boycott Take Two. Chances are you are reading reviews now because you saw somewhere about the CD of OpenIV. It as im sure you are aware of is a very anti consumer practice. I cant in anyway see a stading reason for its removal, Nor can I see a reason to support this decision in any positive light.
