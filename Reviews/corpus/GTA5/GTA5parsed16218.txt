I got this game the first day when it came out for pc. I played the enitre single player story in one night becasue I was hyped for this games release. I 100ed single player and modded wiht open iv becasue the mods were amusing. I didnt mod online becasue my friends were and they were getting banned. I first relaized that completing races/challenges would get you money. keep in mind that this was before heists and all that fun stuff. I played online until they added companies that your player could run. They just making prices higher and higher for the DLCs and it was just becoming pay to play. pay as in real money. This game is literally reverse inflation. Back in 2014/2015 I would have recomended this game, but by now I would strongly recomend that you avoid this game for your time and wallets sake.
