Listen. I love this game. Absolutely adore it.Only one issue. The company behind it.The modding community is not very happy with this game, as they basically said Screw art experission in our game unless its our way and/or giving us money, lets legally threaten the one tool used a lot to create amazing content for all GTA games. Was it used for hacks? yea. But it was also used to create art, stuff that can not be replicated in any other game, and that was all taken away for some ingame store content shark cards
