Singleplayer? I honestly dont think this SP has worth of 30. But now about GTA Online. Im really getting annoyed by certain things Grinding and dropfeeding. Hi we added new cars..., of course you want to try them, dont ya? Then you need to get money, how to get money? Either buy Sharkcards or grind. Reffering to dropfeeding Rockstar just brings out content that is already in files, but unrelased. Thats the whole Online experience. Miserable console port with terrifying community. Do you want a simple advice? Dont buy it. Dont.
