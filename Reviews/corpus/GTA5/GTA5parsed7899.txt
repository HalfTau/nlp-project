Single player is fun, the story is pretty decent and the mods in single player are a lot of fun, but GTAO is a mess, inconsistent ways to earn money, every vehicle thats decent cost upwards of 2 to 10 million dollars and the hackers are cancer, matchmaking is slow and horrible with inconsistent connection to lobbies and the microtransactions are near worthless 8mil for 99 and 8 mil can barely get you anything. Get this game on a sale and just play SP with mods, MP is not worth your time and money it is a very stressful experience.
