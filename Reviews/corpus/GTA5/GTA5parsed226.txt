Honestly I love this game. You can really find your own freedom here and do anything you want to do. The highlights for me is its graphics and AI.Story mode is perfect and those characters and conversations are absolutely impress me. However, onlie mode is not as good as single playing. I dont like the policy that you have to do missions to upgrade because it really costs a lot time for me to do something I dont want to do.Story mode 9/10Online 5/10
