I really enjoy this game. It is a great game. Fun, open, and a fantastic story. I, for one, think the devs have a right to control their game in any way they see fit, and so if that means shutting down a modding tool that ruined the online experience of those who didnt wish to use it, then I support them in that. Too many entitled babies think anything they want they have a right to have. Thats not the way the world works.
