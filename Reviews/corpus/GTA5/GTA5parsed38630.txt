While the campaign is fun and has great moments, GTA Online is a complete mess. Loading screens take up a larger portion of the game. Most of the games data is stored clientside so its riddled with cheaters too. Rockstar would rather invest in paying somebody to make repetitive updates to Online than address these issues or create any enjoyable DLC. Not to mention their archaic approach to modding banning people for singleplayer mods and sending cease and desists at every chance they get.4/10 Cannot recommend.
