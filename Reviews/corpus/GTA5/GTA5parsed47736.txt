I guess ROckstar dosent care about their fanbase and what drives them. How can you do this? you think you can shun an entire comunity that pays you? Are you really that greedy for virtual money? you like selling data so much that you do not care about your fanbase anymore? I guess it has always been about money for rockstar. I grew up with GTA and you can expect to not get a penny from me and ill teach my kids to hate rockstar, especially learning about their putrid, dishonorable ways. Go sleep with EA and live on that greed, I have lost all respect for the developers of such a popular franchise that was shaped by modders. Shame on you Take two.
