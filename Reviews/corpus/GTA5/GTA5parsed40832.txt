I have played Grand Theft Auto from the very beginning and played every game. Ive also bought every GTA game several times since GTA 3 due to switcing between pc and Playstion even bought a copy of one of them on xbox. However take two and rockstars current position against the modding communityin single player is slowly changing my mind on whether to support the franchise in the future. Will I buy GTA 6 is not the question...the question is, will they support the modding community or will they lose me as a fan.
