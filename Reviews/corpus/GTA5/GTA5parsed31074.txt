Although TakeTwo may have taken back their stance on banning OpenIV, I still do not recommend this game. You cant get anything in the Online mode without grinding or spending 99 !!! for a virtual boat. You cant even do that much with it except wander around the mere 3000 square feet interior or walk on the deck. Not to mention the fact that they do not update single player with any of this content, forcing you to spend hundreds to properly enjoy a game you already spent 60 for upon release.
