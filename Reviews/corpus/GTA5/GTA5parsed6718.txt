I really enjoyed the single player experience.I picked the game up for 30 on sale and I am very happy with my purchase. Ive sunk 85 hours into it as of writing this review. I see most of the negative reviews are for the online portion. I wish they had separate storefronts because the single player is well done. Excellent story. I loved it, except there was a few characters that I wish we could of had the option of killing as they were extremely annoying people P That was by design, so I guess rockstar achieved their goal there. I thought Franklin could of been hashed out a bit more. Trevor definitely stole the show, the guy was hilariously mad crazy. Lots of really funny missions with him. Excellent voice acting and characters. All of the voice acting was great. Fun and satisfying gameplay mechanics. I enjoy all the driving and combat mechanics. Lots of variety in the missions.  A small amount of player choice in the direction for major story turning points was fine.I dont really have a lot of negative. A few odd AI annoyances here and there, but all in all, I enjoyed the game very much. I guess having purchased it so long after release, theyve had time to work out a lot of the major bugs. I didnt see many.I havent played the online portion and Im not sure I will as I dont really care for online games, so unfortunately this is only a partial review. I do plan to install some mods to keep playing around in the city for a bit.For the price I paid, I feel the game was completely worth the money. That comes out to something like .35 cents an hour to play a game of this caliber. Seems like an amazing deal to me.So if you are looking to buy this only for the single player portion and on the fence because of the poor review rating, I would say ignore the ones complaining about the online game. This single player game is great and well worth the money. Ive seen it on sale for 30 a few times this year as well. Definitely pick it up if you want a fun single player game.
