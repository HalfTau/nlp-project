The standard game, as many people have said is amazing and full of enjoyment. If youre thinking about getting this for the online content, only do so if you enjoy the following 50 of your in game time spent looking at loading screens. Difficulty finding others for group content. The ones you do find for group content are window licking potatoes with sponges for brains. Never finishing any missions because of said window lickers. No actual instructions for how anything works or what youre supposed to do. Being disconnected more often than finishing a mission. Latency and lag making all of the combat impossible.If you like those, go ahead. If, like most people you do not, then go rub your nipples across a washboard. Itll be more enjoyable.
