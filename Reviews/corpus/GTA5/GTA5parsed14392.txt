So many people complaining about the online experience but forgetting that they are actually reviewing GTA V, the single player game...GTA V is one of the greatest games I have ever played to say the very least. The level of detail is truly immense, the missions are fun, graphics marvelous and everything else about this game is well made.The online game is a bit of an add on to the game which comes for FREE. It has its problems with being internet based, loading and getting kicked out of sessions just as you were about to make bank and instead lose some because you had invested your money and time into the mission.If you dont mind banging your head against a brick wall youll probably enjoy the online game, othewise stick to the single player game and have fun for days.
