Now, its a cluster of Hydras, MK2 cancer cough I mean snipers, unbelievably powerful waterboattankmachines that demolish everything in their path and just pure, pure stupidity fueled mongs playing it.Rockstar are moneygrabbing to new lengths, forcing you to either grind to the point that you lose your job and your wife leaves you or mod money in and get banned onetwo months later. I mean, I guess you could buy shark cards, but then you lose your wife AND your money. suxSo, basically, youll never make enough money to afford any of the cool stuff and everyone has so much of a headstart that theyll consistently annihilate you in freeroam until you do one of the above .Depressed grinding, modding or buying. newbs.
