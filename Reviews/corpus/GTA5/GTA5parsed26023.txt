Story Mode is good, great evenOnline is fun but works more as a pointless time sink, a good game to lisiten to podcasts  while grinding missions, pretty pointless, but if you enjoy the grind just because it gives you something to do then its pretty good.Despite this, the online mode suffers from flaws inherent in its systems and the game has turned into a sort of money making scheme by Rockstar. But it can be avoided by not buying shark cards.Basically if you want your cake and eat it too like me. then just dont buy shark cards and enjoy the game for what the grind provids. Kinda  but thats why this review is negative.Buy the game if you want, just dont buy the cards. Or do, I dont dictate how you use your wealth.
