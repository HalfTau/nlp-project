One of the best openworld games I have ever played.If you have friends who are playing Grand Theft Auto V Online  youre good to go.If not, then better stay away from the cancer.Grand Theft Auto V Online consists mostly of  infinite loading screens toxic players modders zero customer service all is too expensiveBut it is good game.
