If this game wants to support mod developers to help enhance the online experience, then why the hell did they shut down OpenIV? They didnt even contact the developers to ask if they could fix the problem. Once Rockstar saw that there was a hacking problem going on in online they instantly issued a cease and desist to the developers of OpenIV. I would recommend this game if only it cared about its community and continued to support the wellbeing of ALL players.
