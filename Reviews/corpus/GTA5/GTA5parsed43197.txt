Ive been incredibly disappointed with the DLC, lack of online support, blatant greed, and downright collapse of integrity coming from Rockstar in the past years.Now your parent company, TakeTwo, has killed the modding community in a misguided anticonsumerist fury. How does Rockstar respond? With a weak, cookiecutter public statement. Its obvious to me now that you have no intentions of changing your greeddriven downward spiral.Enjoy the millions of dollars youve reaped for your subpar services it only cost your integrity and the faith of your customers. Rockstar and any other constituents of TakeTwo wont see one more cent from me.
