I never cared for the story mode on this game but its not bad, just not the direction I would have liked after playing GTA IV, GTA V is pretty uncanny and over the top with MANY memorable parts but I liked the more gritty and realistic feel of GTA IV but that is just me. As far as story mode I would recommend this game but multiplayer has panned out to be crap.Rockstar has fostered a community that caters to 10 year olds that use shark cards to buy all the tanks, jets, helicopters and whatever else toon everyone. Skill doesnt matter and after 3 years hackers are still everywhere. A lot of the missions are in free mode so youll enjoy the hackers and op vehicles just ruining your game and costing you time and money. This game always had problems but at least online was still fun, parts of it still are but its all about who has bought the most op vehicles. Came on here from 360 and I cant hardly stand this game anymore and Ive got prolly a total near 1000 hours.
