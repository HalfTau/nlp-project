Rockstar removed ALL my legit 30 million when a modder drops 50k money on my head and now i have 100k left making the game unenjoyable since everything is so overpriced with all those Dlcs a 100 Shark card could only get u a few things ingame and not enough for one GOLDEN plane which cost 10mil.Maybe making things less overpriced might reduce the amount of people taking false money ingame.GTA Online use to be good...
