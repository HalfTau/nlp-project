Another great addition to the already storied Grand Theft Auto franchise. Ive played and finished this game on 3 platforms 360, XOne, PC and its still fun years after its release.Pros1. Great story and character development2. Three characters to build upon3. Fully interactive game location4. Dozens of weapons and vehicles5. Stock Market shenanigans can give you billions6. I aint scared of no POPO7. FPS!8. GTA OnlineCons1. F KIFFLOM2. Getting Gold on Strangers and Freaks missions is challenging3. Using firstperson view is a little wonky10/10. I bought this game at full retail and I was angry at myself. But Id like to think I got all my moneys worth in the strip club.
