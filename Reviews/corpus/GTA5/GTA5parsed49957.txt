I love this games online play a heck of a lot. The story was great and there is so much to do in the game its got hundreds of hours of gameplay. However, that said I cant support a desicion to ban modding. For one thing rockstar in the past was very open about allowing mods in single player only, so they shouldnt be going back on their decision this far along, too much time and energy has been put forth by people who love this game. The banning of single player modding while their servers are flooded by hackers, who can literally spawn a giant ufo in the middle of downtown, or make invincible crome hydras, or just continuously blow up the entire map in a lobby killing everyone over and over masking whos doing it by giving credit to a random person in the lobby, is a giant waste of time and horrible priorities. Until take two and rockstar decide to start helping players rather than hindering their enjoyment of this game I cant recommend anyone supporting them.
