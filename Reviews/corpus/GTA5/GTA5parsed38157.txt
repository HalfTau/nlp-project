While I didnt get to mod this game yet, now it looks like Ill never get to. Modding is a big part of the PC gaming experience for many of us. Modding the single player experience should not be punished. If take two and rockstar are going to treat us like this, then im no longer going to buy your microtransactionriddled games.
