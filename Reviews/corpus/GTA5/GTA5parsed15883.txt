Hey Rockstar, why dont you focus on pleasing whatever fans you have left by1. Not ing them over by stealing their legitimately earned AND PAID FOR cash.2. Not releasing content that is so damn lackluster that its actually driving people away from your product.3. Releasing that single player DLC thats been rumored since 2014.4. Actually punishing hackers.5. Getting a support team that is actually ing competent.6. Not ing with vehicle statistics so people dont waste 2.4 MILLION on the games fastest supercar Thats Two Great White Shark Cards, 39.99! only to have it become the THIRD fastest7. Not ing over the single player community by putting a halt on ALL forms of modding I dont care if this was back in July, its still a massive up that no one will forget anytime soon.8. Releasing more weapons, maybe?I fear for the future of Read Dead Redemption 2 and the Grand Theft Auto Series as a whole. Grand Theft Auto V is nothing but a F2P game with a 60 price tag that was made by a greedy company with no regard for their fans.
