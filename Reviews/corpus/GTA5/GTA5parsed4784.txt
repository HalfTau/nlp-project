I love this game. the single player is easily one of the best single player games ever. the multiplayer literally has endless stuff to do, and i enjoyed it. I never bought a sharkcard or used any micro transaction option but i still had a bunch of fun. The progress in the multiplayer is slow, but i still enjoyed it. its especailly good if you have a friend or a few to play with.Totally recommended.
