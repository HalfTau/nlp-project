Honestly, I used to think of the publishers of the GTA series, Take Two Interactive, as a great company, allowing many freedoms to the players. Hell, I even wanted to contact you guys for an opportunity for a job. But, on behalf of the Cease and Desist letter sent to the OpenIV Team, I am determined to never buy another Take Two game. They are also completely ruining somewhat half of their income, because practically all of the fans of GTA buy the game for PC for the sole purpose of modding. Nonetheless, OpenIV isnt at fault for GTAs online security Which was why the CD letter was sent as there are multiple precautions from the modding application itself to not let players with mods onto online mode. An idea that could possibly save OpenIV, if Rockstar ever gets around to reading this, is to make an asi scanner, so if the OpenIV.asi file is found during loading, you may only enter singleplayer. Whats next Take Two, FiveM,, etc...You ban our mods, we ban you income...Save OpenIV Petition is hereBTW, dont hate on Rockstar, IK we are downvoting the game, but Take Two is still reflected by this it is Take Two Interactives sole fault for this. Rockstar emphasizes the creativity of the community.
