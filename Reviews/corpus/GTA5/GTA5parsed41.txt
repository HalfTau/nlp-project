To many modders!  Probably lost over a million in game from modders stoping easy 30k missions. Online not to afk friendly.  Not a place to chill out or cruise.  Rising Storm 2 Vietnam would be more of a place to chill out and relax. no modders .  Also unless you can get a lot of shark cards this game is a grind for in game cash only to have your hard work ruined and interferred with. I got 2 Megalodon Shark Cash Cards and many more are needed to avoid a lot of missions and to buy what you want. Odds of modders in games is like 7 out of 10 or greater when logging into gta online.  Have fun.I am thinking of uninstalling this game or using it to watch myself get beaten and thrown around some more by players with god mode.  I am also interested in how much all other regular players lose on average from this in game.
