Edit Im now changing this review status to recommended, because OpenIV situation has been resolved for now and TakeTwo / Rockstar have reviewed their stance on it, allowing the development and existance of this crucial tool to continue. However, my opinions remain on overall moneymilking, ingame currency inflation and over pricing, and most importantly mismanaging bans and lack of proper anticheat measures.If Steam allowed to rate the product rather than just bw yes/no on whether I recommend it or not, I wouldnt give it more than 8/10 due to abovementioned flaws.original textAfter several takedowns of community created alternate multiplayer mods and map expansion projects, TakeTwo has dropped the biggest ball yet by effectively banning OpenIV, the one and only tool used for creation of like 99 of single player mods. That screws up not just mod creators, but also video/machinima authors and all those players who enjoy single player modifications.And that is after two years of Rockstar failing to implement proper anticheat measures in Online, mishandling of bans, inflating ingame prices, introducing gamemodes noone asked for, cancelling single player DLC in favor of milking more cash from Online and shark cards  even locking new content to Onlineonly, continuously ignoring feedback, and generally turning Online into a heaven for griefers/cheaters and a dreary routine grindfest for those who want to legally acquire the new content.
