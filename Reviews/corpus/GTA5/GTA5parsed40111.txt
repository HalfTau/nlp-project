Game is fun at times, but with the knowledge that a hefty amount of gameplay was cut from the final release in order to accomodate the online play of which they do not support individuals or innovation, but rather Rockstar and Take 2s own pocketbooks, I cannot reccommend that anyone buy this game in good faith. I am now VERY concerned about the release of Red Dead Redemption 2.
