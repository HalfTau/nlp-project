I dont have much money for games, but I spent 60 on GTA V on PC strictly for mods. I didnt have to buy it, because I already have the game on Xbox, but I spent my hard earned money on a full priced rerelease for the one fact that someday, when i have a PC that can run this game, I can mod the hell out of it and have a blast with it. You can see my new loathment for a game I used to love here.
