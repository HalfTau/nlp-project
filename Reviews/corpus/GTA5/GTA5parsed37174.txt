I would like to give a honest review for my most beloved game franchise. Another two is Command  Conquer and Mass EffectsPros  Its a freaking world, a big one, you simply can do anything from jacking cars like you did before in the previous installments, to sports. The dialogue, the connections between characters, its world designing, its character development, its crappy R only logic.... The game was made in 2013 and its graphic is still look beautiful. What I love most about this game is how much afford the team of developers took into this game, the level of details, lightings, iconic characters, animations.... simply incredible. Its GRAND THEFT AUTOCons  Storyline is weaker than San Andreas, and IV. Something great in previous games they just dont put it into the game, fighting system, NPC effects, Jetpack, dynamic of environment, what I hated most of this game is they dont let us to walk into restaurant, like we can in the previous games. NPCs are s, theyre basically hostile to you no matter what you did, good or bad.Climax  Multiplayer system is ing grindy crap. New systems, new patches are simply moneysucker, with boring money making method. Multiplayer is FULL OF MODDERS AND HACKS, AND ROCKSTAR KEEP BANNING INNOCENTS INSTEAD OF PREVENTING HACKS. I didnt get banned by R but speaking of the truth, FYI. Instead of making expansions or single player DLC fans are waiting for, like in GTA IV. Developers choose not to do it. Taketwo Interactives action against offline modders is unforgiveable, from now on you shouldnt touch any product published from taketwo interactive because they simply dont give a crap on what you want. Rockstar is basically Bioware under the control of greedy EA. Unless you want to get fascinated by how great single player is, dont buy this game. If youre looking for any open world multiplayer games, there are a lot more to choose out there.
