Story modes good!Online is a mixed bag. You could play for days without any greifers or hackers, then one evening every session will have teleporting modders with explosive miniguns killing everyone before just spawning infinite explosions under everyone. this has the added effect of locking you out the menu as for whatever reason the death screen takes priority over menus, so you have to alt F4 out the game. its been like this for years and R do nothing to address the issuebut theyll gleefully adjust your money balance sould they suspect you have hacked in money, because god forbid you dont spend hundreds on shark cards.Yes im fantastically butthurt. if it wasnt for the sloppy design choices from the console porting and if anything was done about hackers then itd be a really good time online!
