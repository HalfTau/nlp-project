So first the positivesStory mode is solid aiming is good along with a redone cover system that flows minus a few glitches beautiful graphics good for about 5060 hours of play offline.The cons once you buy a gun you are stuck with it. Would have been better if they allowed you to take some weapons out of your inventory. online mode is terrible unless you have ADHD..... then it is fun i guess. No direction and it forces you to play with others in order to make money in pre designed missions that are just GTAV versions of team death match and capture the flag with some racing. The missions are fun property the player can buy in story mode and online looks like the devs forgot about it completely then added it in later as a patch for online only. It also is a waste of money.Over all a great game but replay value caps after offline mode.
