Single player is fun and has a great modding community behind it. Unfortunately the multiplayer aspect is poorly policed by an automated system so you have to avoid public lobbies or risk getting banned for existing. If you dont want to grind for hours to afford anything you have seen in videos or screenshots you better be ready to open your wallet again.
