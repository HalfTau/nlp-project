If youre complaining about OpenIV youre just being picky. I dont see Xbox and PS players complaining that they dont have mods.If youre complaining about the lack of single player content, what would happen if they added SP DLC? You would just play through it, then there would, again, be nothing to do.If youre complaining about having to grind so much, then you just need to actually put your mind towards something and work.If youre complaining about modders, which is currently the biggest issue, then either play in a solo session, or my recommendation make an empty public session. Hackers wont be bothering you if youre alone.Zig ZiglarSo basically stop complaining about what you dont like in the game, and start enjoying what you do like.
