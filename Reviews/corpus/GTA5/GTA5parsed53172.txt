Had such great promise but has been ruined by both Rockstar and Take Two on both single player and multiplayer Loading screens Toxic community Microtransactions Overally expensive DLC features only as expensive as they are so that you get frustrated with the grinding and buy Shark Cards, making it pay to win The initial war they had against mods at the start, banning any mods at all from Online and preventing the multiplayer servers that werent official ones so that you couldnt get around their paywall for the features and didnt have to deal with all the otherin an official server Singleplayer is missing features from online. Again so that you buy the micro transactions. And now the shutdown on Singleplayer mods. They did it to prevent people from having freedom with the game and to shove Shark Cards down your throat. Instead ruined twitch viewership and YouTube videos, and have shown how greedy the people behind the game are once again. Loading screens.Take Two have ruined GTA V and will do so to all of their other games under 2K and Rockstar.The CEO has literally said he loves microtransactions.
