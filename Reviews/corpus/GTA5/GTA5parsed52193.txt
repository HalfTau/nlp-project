Rockstar stole 100USD from a friend of mine. We received hacked money while in a server we randomly were placed in. With this update all but approx. 20,000 GTAonline was left in our accounts. My buddy had all the hacked money taken including HIS OWN PAYED FOR CURRENCE. Take Two has closed his ticket and refused to refund or replace the stolen money. I will never support any rockstar game again.
