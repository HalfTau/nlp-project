Update 6/24/17  Now that things seem to be back on track with mods. I can go back to enjoying the game and future products from Rockstar.Thanks!There should of been a better way of handling this rather then just cutting off the modding community.I bought the PC version so I can enjoy the single player mods along with the game.Since this game has been released I have bought it three times. I first got it on the 360 then the Xbox One and now for the PC.I find it very disappointing that they would do this when in reality it has nothing to do with the online part.It has always been a guarantee buy/preorder for all of the Grand Theft Auto games and other Rockstar games. But after this im not so sure anymore.You took away something that I highly enjoyed along with everyone else that loved modding their game.Please reconsider your decision on this!
