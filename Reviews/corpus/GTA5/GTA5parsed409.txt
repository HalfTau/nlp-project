This Game is probably the greatest game I have ever played in my life. It keeps you coming back for more and the new updates get lots of hype and never disappoint. I have lots of fun both online and offline. The only problem I have with this game is online is to much of a grind and a cash grab. If you dont have any real world money to spend on gta you cannot get anything new and you would have to spend hours grinding for cash. People who can spend money just sail right through everything. anytime something new arrives they can just buy it while regular players have to spend months or days. Aside from that this game is very good. I would give it a 9/10 if I was a critic and that is what most critics gave it. This game feels very real and that is why players keep coming back for more fun.
