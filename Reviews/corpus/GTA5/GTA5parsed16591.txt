GTA V is still 60 and it feels like a free to play game. The grinding is in fact, worse then most free to play games that Ive played. However, the painful amount of grinding could be avoided if you decide just give Rockstar all of your money. I would say that for a 100 shark card, you will have enough money to get started with the basics of the game. A game which is fun if you play it will friends. Heists and missions are an enjoyable and just messing around in freeroam is worth the 60 that this game costs. It is not worth the grind or the extra shark card money. I guess what Im saying is, if you have alot of money to spend and friends to play with, this game is great. If you are a normal person who doesnt want to spend all of their card earned cash for a virtual apartment, ware house, car warhouse, office, bunker, motorcycle clubhouse and hangar to enjoy the multiplayer content of this game, then it isnt for you.
