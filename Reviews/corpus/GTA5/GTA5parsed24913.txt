Everyone talks about modding but i want to talk about GTA V. My friend baught it long ago and told me that it is perfection of single and online gaming. Week ago i bought it and start playing online and all i can say there is no real action in the game cuz you cant make session with friends, job is like for 24 people and u need always to choose, saw lots of cheaters, lagging like hell driving your car and the mob car spawns infront and etc. I cant belive that this game is so popular even now, probably cuz cheating kids stil buying it. I cant belive but Rockstar made really bad game with bad connection. I dont know what about singleplayer but online part is a real piece of garbage. IMHO
