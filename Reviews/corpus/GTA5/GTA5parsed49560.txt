until take two opens up the modding again this review will stay negative. nothing is wrong with modding especially for single player modding. their our numerous developers out there that welcome the modding community and even support modding of their games. As far as im concerned once we buy something its ours to do what ever the F! we want to do to it as long as it is not effecting other players/people.
