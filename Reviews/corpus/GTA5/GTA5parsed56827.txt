What a wonderful game this is... Undeniably a ground breaking game, however T2 Management have decided to go and selfdestruct their business with the worst derailment since I installed train engineer mod for GTA5. This game and modding go hand in hand and its a shame to see T2 not noticing this. Instead of more DLC for us, please can you fix the people within your business who make decisions that will bring them more money instead of happy clientsShame
