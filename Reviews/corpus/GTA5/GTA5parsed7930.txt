Grand Theft Auto V is a good open world game and it is really big, the story is good and online is is alot of fun. The only bad thing with  GTA online is that there is so many modders/cheaters and that makes online really boring, almost every session has a modder that destroys the gaming experiance of the game. Other than that, this game is a blast. 9/10
