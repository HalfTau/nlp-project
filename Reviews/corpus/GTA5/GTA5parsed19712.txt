Single player stories are very uninteresting and the online has become absolute Theyve taken all the fun out and turned into to hours and hours of grind to be able afford ANYTHING. Theyre basically forcing you to buy sharkcards which are complete rip off! 100 dollars of REAL money for 8 million in game currency? 100 dollars is more than the in game costs! DO NOT BUY IF YOU LIKE TO PLAY FOR FUN!
