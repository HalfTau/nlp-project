I dont personally have a lot of hours in this game, yet, and I regret ever purchasing it. Ive recently seen a lot of videos that had me itching to play, but since Take 2 decided to squash modding, I wont play it and I urge everyone else to not buy this game. Its too late for me to get my money back, but you can keep yours to give to better developers.
