Single Player Amazing story Characters with their own unique personality and abilites Tons of missions to play Great replay value No splitscreen / LAN system to play with others4/5Online Lots of griefers and hackers, cheaters as some would say Very difficult to get started as a new player Unless you have friends, random MM will get you nowhere with missions Jobs such as races from Martin, dont give much RP, or cash Getting to level 12 is difficult unless you have friends or a lot of money Playing with friends is great fun if you have any You have character customization options Theres special ranks like CEO, that are fun to get3/8
