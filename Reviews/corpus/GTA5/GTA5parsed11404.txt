As someone who played GTA online for PS4 and made a ton of progress I am not happy with the new changes as of recently this year. All I wanted to do was transfer my PS4 character to PC but rockstar had to be a totaland shut that down. I wish I had found out of that before buying this shitbag. but thankfully I have the ability to refund it. This game was pretty in dope until now.R.I.P. GTA V 20132017
