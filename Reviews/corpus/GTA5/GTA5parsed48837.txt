Getting a little too gready for a healthy future.  Killing Mods is selfdestructive in the long run.  There again, you may not have a long run, seeing as you are ignoring the people that pay for your product.  GTA V is ok albeit overpriced as a standalone.  Multiplayer is a waste of your game time.  Unhappy bunch live there.
