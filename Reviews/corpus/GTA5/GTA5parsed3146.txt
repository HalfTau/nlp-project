Grand Theft Auto Online by itself is incredible experience on PC. Fullyoptimised at this point for Steam and a GTA game has never ran or looked any better on my machine, at least.The Story Mode, however wellwritten it may be, isnt nearly as long as the GTA IV Story Mode in terms of character development and a gritty tone, this is set Los Santos after all, and not Liberty City.I do praise the game highly over the sheer amount of detail and customisation options available in both Story Mode and Online Mode, especially.
