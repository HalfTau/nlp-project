This is my first review and I want to start by telling you all that GTA V is, in my opinion not what everyone else says in all these bad reviews and this is also my first time buying the game ever so I might be able to shed some light on people who want to buy the game for their first time too.Single Player  To be honest, ive played like 5 missions, not really dipped into the single player too much but everything looks amazing, it runs very smooth and it is a very well optimised game, I see me having a lot of fun on the single player when I do decide to play it.Online  Now this is probably the need to know things about online from my limited experience.Yes, there are hackers. You might find yourself online in a free roam lobby and hackers will spawn you in mid air, drop SWAT on you, youll see people on the side asking for cash and all that, me personaly, I just left the lobby and let them do their things, I wasnt going to let myself stay in a lobby with them after hearing people getting banned for accepting money and stuff so I just leave the lobby and everything was fine. New lobby, hacker free, easy. I did however have one issue and that was, after going into single player the next day after my first day online, my single player character had 2 billion in cash, every gun non dlc and all the guns had full ammo, now I was kind of annoyed about this because I wanted to do everything without cheating or anything and I was super confused about why I had everything, my friend even called me out on it a few times because he didnt believe me, luckily I was only like 5 mission in so I just deleted my saves and started single player again which wasnt too bad but still was super annoyed about. But really thats the only bad encounter ive had.Online is amazing. I was scepticle about buying this game because of all the bad reviews and everything but I really cant recommend this game more. The online races with about 8 people is hilarious, there are jobs you can do online with friends to make cash, buy garages to store cars, make a gang with your friends, make enough cash to buy houses, I feel you will easilly play this game for a few months before getting bored.So to end this review, im giving a 8/10.Id give 10/10 if someone never screwed my single player over but hey, things happen, I hope you get this game and enjoy it as much as I do.
