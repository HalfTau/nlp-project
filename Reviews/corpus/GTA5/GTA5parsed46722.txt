Gta V single player is great and worth about 40USD in my opinion. Its worth the full price if you are allowed to mod, which is no longer the case.GTA Online has arguably more content than single player and would be worth paying the full price of the game for if it hadnt devolved into a huge grind fest.Overall, I would not recommend the game for the price.If you love the usual GTA single player experience, however, this is a good game for you, just maybe wait for a discount.
