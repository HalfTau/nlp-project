Completely boring game, everything offline, like singleplayer and modded versions are fun to play, online is complete garbage, full of cheaters even though R is apparently taking actions against cheaters now, Ive spend a good 300 of my hours in offline mode, with mods like zombie apocalypse or LSPDFR you can really have a good time,  online though. Increased Inflation due to R constantly releasing new expensive vehicles leads to moneygreedy cheaters and tricks legit people into buying shark cards, gamemodes like racing are completely unbalanced due to some sportscarscoincidentally the most expensive one outrunning supersportscars, different free content dlcs were implemented adding new propertys, facilities and useless vehicles, which all cost millions. The only thing I could really get some fun off was the new Heists, but they were barely rentable. Buy this game on sale, play online sometimes with big groups of friends, modded offline and campaign are worth a try. Please dont spend 60 on a dead game.
