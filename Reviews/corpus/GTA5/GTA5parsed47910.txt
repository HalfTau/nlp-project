Great Single player! Lots of do even after finishing the main story. Lots of side missions during the campaign. What else can I say? Modding is amazing OFFLINE, cars, skins, scripts, you name it. Mods are what making me come back to this game ever time! Buy the game on sale tho, not really worth 59.99. Game runs decent on Intel HD graphics 520 with intel i7 6500U at lowest settings.
