Congratulations TakeTwo. Youveoff your PC market in a big way. Is the money not enough? Is the constant microtransactions and general ery in GTA Online not enough for you? Is it not enough that a lot of the users on Steam probably bought the game once for console and then again for PC? And you want to  over these people?Is the Joker your CEO? Does he just want the world to burn, or did he just fail out of Economics 101 in college? Because we bought your product because we liked it and because we wanted to mod it to keep the fun rolling because we liked it so much! Now youve poked the bear and did you forget what Bioware had to do when they decided do a crappy ending to ME 3? Or how about Bethesda and the Horse Armor DLC way back when  in Oblivion?Youve basically declared mods to be illegal, you idiots, and if you think wereoff now, God in Heaven help you if you  with a game like Kerbal Space Program where they actively embrace modding. To quote Sheriff Eli, you will be Capital F ED.Tell me honestly TakeTwo, have you ever heard the phrase Dont bite the hand that feeds? Because that is what you are doing, during E3 no less, and we will NOT stand for it.
