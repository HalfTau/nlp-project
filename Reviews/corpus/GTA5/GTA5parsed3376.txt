If you have ever played this game on a seperate platform xbox or playstation you will not be able to transfer your previous character. This is the most stupid decision rockstar could ever made. They are penalizing their loyal customers that have purchased their game on multiple platforms as a way to prevent hackers. I have spent many hours building and creating my character on the xbox only to find out I can not transfer my character to my newly built PC. I have now purchased GTA V 3 times and this is the thanks that I get.
