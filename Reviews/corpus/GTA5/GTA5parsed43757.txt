As a fan of the GTA series, and someone whos enjoyed GTA V enough to play it through multiple times, Im really sad to hear of T2s attempts to curtail modding. I appreciate that people who are as enthusastic I am about modding are in the minority, but it upsets me that theyd prioritise their own profit over the experience of dedicated customers. Id still recommend the single player game, despite the lack of single player DLC, but Im disappointed to hear about this.
