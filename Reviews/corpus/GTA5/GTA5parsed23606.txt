this game can be alot of fun, even more so when you have friends to play with but, the game is a long grind. i have spent hundreds of hours on this game but it was just grinding for money because all of the dlc rockstar adds cost millions of in game cash which is not easy to earn. I only had fun when i was playing with my friends and then the game felt enjoyable, but when youre alone its pretty boring.
