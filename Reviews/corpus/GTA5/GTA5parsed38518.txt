I really like GTA games. I really do.But since GTA IV and the poor way they handled how to fix its PC version, left me with a bittter taste...But now, with throwing CD to modders, specially the ones who made OpenIV i cannot recommend giving them money. This is the act of being greedy as . Its a huge flip the bird to the community.Heck i would even recommend to download GTA V ininstead of buying it. Online has become boring and full of hackers, and Rockstar does not do So youre not missing much.
