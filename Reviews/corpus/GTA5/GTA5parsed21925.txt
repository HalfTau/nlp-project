I remember playing GTA3 when I was a kid, all the while dreaming with my friends how cool it would be to play this game with one another. Well its here, and Take Two and Rockstar took one potentially amazing, experience I know we all shared and shoved it right up a cashcows  Yeah, you thought GTA online would be fun? Well it would, if it didnt consisnt of countless repetitve hours, and I mean houuurs of grinding in instanced minigames over and over again just to afford basic things like cars and apartments. Why is this grind so tedious? Well let me introduce the Shark Card. Whats that you ask? Dont want to grind GTA minigames like a full time job? Well just spend your hard earned cash on in game money.GTA V Online is a blatent cash grab in the worst possible way. The single player was what you would expect, was fun but all in all theyve shifted all dev time to their cash crop, the online. No single player DLC and all the online DLC that comes out is available for tens of millions online, which most of us who cant stand to grind for 40 hours a week, are forced to buy shark cards to access the DLC or forgo the experience all together.Im seeing a lot AAA gaming these days go for microtransactions, and I can not recommend a game that supports this so disgustingly. Really taking advantage of your playerbase guys, not cool at all.
