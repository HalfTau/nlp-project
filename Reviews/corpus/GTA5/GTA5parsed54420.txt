The single player is great, and although Ive never used mods, Im a firm believer that mods are a part of a game and helps the game grow. Now they are just pushing everyone over to multiplayer to squeeze more money out of people by taking down the biggest mod that most mods need to run in hopes people will ditch the modded SP for the micro transaction fest that is GTA Online.
