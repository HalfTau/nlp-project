this game is dead, dont waste ur money on it if u havent yet wait for payday online. rstar has no control of its servers its all just modders with trainers cheating and griefing other players. rockstar made 4 billion dollars in profit to date and they have given zero back. this is after the fact that the modding community basically built gta v for them so its quite a deal to be a rockstar dev. no clue how they can claim to manage a game that has no restrictions on cheating. its utterly out of control its really sad that they fleece gamers and give nothing back. get use to it folks developers dont care about u or your gaming experience they care about money. half of the paid trainers in the game are released backdoor by rockstar devs. your just another source of profit to them and their greed knows no bounds. well at least trumps president and the world will be over soon. maga
