After over 450 hours put into GTA V and GTA Online, Im finally calling it quits. Its become such a chore to play every time a friend asks. The game itself is beautiful and very well made, save for the immense grinds to get the money to buy anything. But the online community is awful, and the devs are far more concerned with earning money than dealing with modders and griefers. I would not recommend it to anyone that I know, and I will not recommend it here. I used to love this game, and I kept coming back to it hoping that it would be better. But its only gotten worse. Id say that its like an abusive relationship, but at least you dont have to pay money for one of those.
