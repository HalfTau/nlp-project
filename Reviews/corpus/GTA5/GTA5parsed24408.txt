The publisher is sending ceaseanddesist notes to mod makers, who did nothing but make GTA the game its. Yes, you heard it right, GTA series wouldnt be NEARLY as successful as its without the mods and the makers behind the popular ones from them. Please dont buy, support or recommend this game until the publisher stops their desperate attempts to milk the game.
