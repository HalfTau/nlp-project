This is an awesome game. Dont let me playtime fool you, I played a lot on PS3 and I later upgraded to PS4. PC marks my 3rd purchase of the game. The single player is loads of fun  so is the multiplayer. There are plenty of games nowadays that will focus on either multiplayer or single player but not have a quality offering in BOTH, GTAV rises above.Currently a lot of entitled gamers are forgetting what an awesome game this is , because they hold Rockstar  Take Two to such incredibly high standards High standards that the developer and publisher have earned due to being INCREDIBLE and offering AMAZING games, are slamming this game with undeserved poor ratings in a childish attempt to strong arm the developer/publisher into changing their position on a modding issue. Its a matter that belongs on the discussion boards, NOT in the reviews.This is a good, solid game. The single player is great, the multiplayer is great, the open world is amazing, the freedom of vehicles is ridiculous, the radio stations are great, the DJs are hillarious everything has raised the bar. There is literally zero reason for any complaints as far as the quality of this game is conscerned.
