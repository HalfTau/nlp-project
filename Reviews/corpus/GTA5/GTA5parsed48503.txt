Modding is the only thing that keeps this game alive. Even rockstar showcases pictures and videos that were made by mods. I get trying to eliminate hackers, but people can and still will be hacking more than ever. If your that scared of people hacking in online that means your anti cheat is shiot. Bring OPENIV back or i will never purchase another one of your games.
