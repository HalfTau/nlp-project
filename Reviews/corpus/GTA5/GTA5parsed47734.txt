I like the gta series,  I really do , but recent actions by rockstar and take two have made my opinion change. First gta onlj e , such a shame less cash grab , everything is over a million dollars and money is super hard to make without buying a sharkcards or hacking. And recently take two has taken down openiv and called modding illegal. I have never bought a sharkcard and never will , I would rather stub my small for on a solid gold coffee table than support take two and I am scaredabout red dead redemption 2 online now , I say buy watch dogs 1 or 2 , just stay far away from gta online.
