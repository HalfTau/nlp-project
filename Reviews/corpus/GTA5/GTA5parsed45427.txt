I really enjoyed this game for a while until I ran out of things to do in the single player. I moved onto GTA0 and I found that all you do is grind for hours  to get the money to do one thing fun, that is unless you spend money. Would not suggest this game in its current form! Unless you think you are lucking and can find a modder that will give you like 10 mil.
