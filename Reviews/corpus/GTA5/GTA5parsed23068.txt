After the spray and pray banning system rockstar has in place which affected many innocent gamers like myself experienced il never purchase another rockstar game which is a shame as I did love gta as for the game its self I loved it but poor management of banning real hackers and subjecting hard grinding players like myself to being banned after hundreds of hours hard graft was such a bad way of handling it and refusing to even hear out pleas for players its disgusting way to treat loyal fans that paid a lot of money to play I bought to different copies for xbox and pc so I guess over all my review is a angry one .
