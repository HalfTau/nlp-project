This negative review is for Take 2 Interactives new policy against single player mods.Edit I origianlly wrote this as a way of joining with the community to help OpenIV and other SP mods. Id like to add to this review. Rockstar is being controlled by the heavy hand over at Take 2 who dont give aabout the people who play GTAOnline. There are so many little things that could be easily fixed but the powers that be dont give a damn about fixing their broken game in that sense. All they care about is making money off of shark cards. The second that a new money glitch comes out, they are right there the next day with a hotfix. Why isnt this same attitude taken towards so many other things that are broken in the game? Until there are some major changes, this review will stay negative.
