This game doesnt deserve the hate it originally deserve. Yes, Rockstar Games are moneygrabbers with the microtransactions, but even without Shark Cards, Ive played this game over and over on different consoles and computers. The story line is just amazing, and it is large enough that by the time you finish it, you can play it again without remembering it all. The online mode I enjoy just as much, though I wish they had a little more story in it.
