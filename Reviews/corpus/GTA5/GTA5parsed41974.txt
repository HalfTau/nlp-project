Despite the creators removing OpenIV which resulted in a lack of mods the core game is still pretty amazing.Yes it was a dck move to pss off millions of people, but in retrospec the game itself is still good.If you were looking to mod then youll have to come back another time as thats not really a thing as of now, however if you came just to play the story mode and mess around online then this is the game for you!
