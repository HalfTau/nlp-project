Do not buy this game on Steam. Useor pirate it to make sure Rockstar doesnt get your money until OpenIV is both legally allowed to continue development and given a sizeable compensation for its wasted time and inaccurate negative publicity. If these things never happen, then never buy a Rockstar game on Steam again. If you choose not to do these things, dont ask me why when your rights to a personal SinglePlayer experience are systematically stripped away because Rockstar are apparently too incompetent to ban the actual hackers plaguing their online servers without banning half of the legitimate playerbase.
