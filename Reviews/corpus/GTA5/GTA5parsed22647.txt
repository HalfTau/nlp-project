Spending Only 16 hours in game I can already say I love it, Graphics all the way up, first person or third doesnt matter it is still great.Id say buy this, but be wary it takes a good gaming computer and a stable internet connection to fully enjoy.GTA V Online offers time passing fun, or just general fun. aside from people who are just there to trollFiveM allows for even more fun, If you have no idea what that is, google it.Pick up your gun, rob that store and steal that rich players car and sink it! I did and it was hilarious!
