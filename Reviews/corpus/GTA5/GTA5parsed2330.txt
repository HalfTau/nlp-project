Whats not to love about GTA? Only problem this empire has is the inability to do away with Modders in public servers which make it impossible to play at times. If they find a way to control them they will have the perfect gaming platform. Just be ready if you enter this crazy world you may not get to actually play because of someone thinking its fun and cool to ruin others play time.
