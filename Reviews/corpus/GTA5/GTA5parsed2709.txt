GTA Online is UNPLAYABLE.Im sure its been said dozens of times before, and it needs to be said again. GTA Online is unplayable. Between loading screens, random session crashes, the impossibility of joining with your friends in a group, and dozens of other problems, this is one of the worst purchases you could ever make.Everyone at R Should be held accountable for our wasted time and money.Disclaimer I love this game so much I bought it twice. It does not work. It is the steamiest pile of crap that has ever been sold for 60.
