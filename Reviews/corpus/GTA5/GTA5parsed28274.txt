I played gta from the first one and modding was always a thing. I played the game with custom skins so it was more like a British street real vehicles id see on my roads road signs as i would expect to see it visual enhancements and extra npc cars tou wouldnt get in the game all added up to a whole better experience. Think of it this way i paid over the odds for a game i ended up replacing everything you did. Why ban me or the mods? You got your money let us have fun
