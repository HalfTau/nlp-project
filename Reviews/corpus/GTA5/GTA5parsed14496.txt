R is currently taking legitimate money away from hundreds, possibly thousands of players. Their cheat detection is flawed and honest players are paying the price for it. I worked hard during some of their double cash and RP events and had it all taken away as illegitimate right before the release of the next DLC. I thought it was in error, and I put in a detailed help ticket explaining how I earned the money through their events. I received a generic response that I was exploiting the game. My shark card money was taken away as well. Do not buy this game.
