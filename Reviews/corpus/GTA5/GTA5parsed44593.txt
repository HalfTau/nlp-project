Rockstar and TakeTwo are a bunch of greedy scumboys that hate everything about you except your money. TakeTwos president even said they werent making enough off you. Plus, with the recent attack on the modding community, theyve taken away the only real reason to play the game.In the online portion, everything costs way too much money to encourage you to purchase their currency with real money, and the single player portion hasnt seen actual new content since the game released years ago. Plus, its a nearly 4 year old game thats selling for a premium 60 price point reminder that this is before youre forced into buying the currency for Online so you can stay competitive, since not everyone can just grind all day every day.Save your money, folks.
