Not much to say, I bought this game on pc solely for the amazing modding potential, Now that Rockstar and 2K have nixed that, the pc version is basically worthless in my eyes. I dont and never have given a ratsabout mulitiplayer. The 200 hours on my record are just from messing around with various mods. I wish I could get a refund now.
