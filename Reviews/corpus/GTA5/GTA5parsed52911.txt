If youre going to deny the single player community the right to play with mods, then were going to deny you the right to positive reviews. No matter how good you make this game, no matter how much you hackproof GTA Online, Im not changing this review to positive until you bring OpenIV back. You bring it back, send us a legitimate apology, and kick TakeTwos jackass CEO out, and maybe, just MAYBE well forgive you enough to give you MIXED on the review section.
