After purchasing this game for PS3 twice since my wife and I both had separate systems and played together, and for PS4 when we upgraded to one, I decided to get it on PC after upgrading the rig expecting to be able to transfer my character that was a high level with a decent amount of cash. After spending 16 hours downloading it and installing it, I find out that online character transfers are no longer available. And when checking the website, and finding this change buried, the response is essentially a big middle finger to the customers. TAKING AWAY a feature that was supported for years with the response, I guess youre justout of luck has to be the most disrespectful approach I have ever seen from such a once respected company. There is no technical limitation as their Social Club services are run globally over all platforms.Now I have also discovered that the cool custom jobs that were user created  which is the whole reason I wanted to get it on PC  are also going away because F U. Regardless of what this company releases in the future, I will NEVER buy another product from them again.
