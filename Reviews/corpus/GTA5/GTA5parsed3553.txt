Grand Theft Auto 5 is a great game that I just can not recommend. If your in the market solely for the games single player campaign then by all means buy it. If your looking for an immersive multiplayer experience then you should look elsewhere. GTA 5 Online is simply a tedious grind for cars/weapons that are massively over priced and in some cases nearly useless. These oversaturated prices are just there so Rockstar can sell more shark cards which by the way give way too little money for what your paying for. The next biggest problem I have with his game is the community itself. By far GTA 5 is one of the most toxic communities I have ever come across. You cant enjoy freeroam without some try hard trying to kill you, heists are a joke if your playing with randoms, racing is just whoever doesnt get rammed off the track and you may as well forget about starting a business cause youll get blown up by a troll in a hydra. Then there are the issue on loading screens in GTA 5 online. There are a lot of them and they take forever to finish loading. Somtimes youll just get an error message that says you cant connect. Finally what kills this game for me is how little respect Rockstar has for its players. I see all too often vague responses to a players problems on their support page and now with that whole antimodding fiasco. So unless you just want to experience single player mode or have a lot of friends who play this game on a regular basis then Id say to avoid this game.
