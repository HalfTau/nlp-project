A fun open world game for players who like to just do whatever they want and explore the game at their own pace.I highly reccomend this to players who like the following games  The Witcher, Skyrim, World Of Warcraft, Far Cry, No Mans Sky,etc..I found this game extremely addicting because of CARS.Theyre expensive of course, but thats what makes you want to play more! You need currency Also obtainable from buying Shark Cards which makes you feel rich online but really youre broke IRL! I mainly enjoyed going on adventures with my friends. There is also a story mode you can play by yourself. There are mods you can download to play RP, I personally havent tried it but tons of people seem to enjoy it.Overall if youre looking for a review you can always watch twitch and not read these t reviews that I do
