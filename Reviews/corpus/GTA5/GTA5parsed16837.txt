Absolutely love the single player.  Gameplay is fun, the plot and character development are far better than what we get in TV shows and movies these days, and the world is amazing. That said.... the company seems to only care about developing the online part of the game.  Nothing new is ever added to single player.  How hard would it be to let people enjoy the stuff added to multiplayer in single player mode as well?  I have a RL career to focus on, I dont have endless hours to spend grinding the same missions over and over in multiplayer.  Just want to enjoy the game by myself when I have a little spare time in life.  As much as I love the single player, I dont recommend people buy it until Rockstar actually puts some effort into expanding the single player mode more.
