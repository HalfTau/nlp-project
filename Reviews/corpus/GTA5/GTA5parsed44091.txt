While the core game is quite fun with a great story, unfortunatley the publisher of this game takes greed to new levels. They have actively shut down any sort of MP modding possible and now taken it a step further and shut down a renowned tool called OpenIV modders used to extend the games appeal over the years. Keep in mind Take Two Interactive reaped the benefit of user created mods through more copies sold however that wasnt quite enough for them, they want to control the entire ecosystem and sell you shark cards to use in their very limited multiplayer mode. It is all a big money grab from a company that has already made billions from GTA Vrather than reward the community that has made it a success, they spit on them.For that very reason, AVOID BUYING THIS GAME AND ANY OTHER MADE BY ROCKSTAR/TAKE TWO INTERACTIVE.
