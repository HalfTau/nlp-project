Worst. Controls. Ever. Never Buy This. The AI makes no god damn sense either. You pull a hit and run, no alarms, you punch a guy in the face after he starts beating you up and every cop in the city is trying to murder you! This is a terrible console port with no thought put into it, not even for the console controls. Im gonna keep playing cause if I dont thats 69.99 down the drain, but buyers beware.
