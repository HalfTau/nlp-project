Great game both single player and multiplayer saddly ruined by the rediculous amount of hackers/modders Rockstar seem incaplable of doing anything about.Hackers have the abilty to boot you out of your vehicle, insta kill you, and even spoof data so the insta kills show up as another player having commited it. Tried for over an hour tonight to try and find a GTA online session free of these cretins to no avail.My friend has uninstalled this game as a result I stopped short of doing this. I live in hope that someday Rockstar will actually fix what at the moment is a heavily broken online mode.
