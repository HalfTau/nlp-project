After reading comments, you guys are right. Take Two has ruined their own reputation by attempting to shutdown OpenIV. Whether they apologize or not, it still happened and that should never be forgotten. Modding will never die, no matter how hard you stomp on it. The haters are right too. This isnt a legit review, its abusing the review system. Fine.
