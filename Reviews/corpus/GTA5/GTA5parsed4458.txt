Horrible memory leaks with this game. If you have pagefile disabled in windows and 16 GB of RAM the game will crash almost instantly. The game needs 2030 GB of RAM to run reliably. If you dont have enough RAM the OS will try to move stuff onto your pagefile on disk and that causes really bad stutters, especially when driving. I thought it was an issue on my side initially, but apparently everyone has this issue.Only recommend this game if you have 3264 GB of RAM.
