I put nearly 500 hours in to modding los santos to replicate my home town, never played online mode. The companies behind this game have taken legal action against the program I used to make these mods possible, now stuck with the vanilla or default game I have no interest in picking it back up. I was excited for red dead redemption 2, but now I will no longer reccomend Rockstar  Take Two games, I will instead let people know that they only want your money  if they can not milk it, they will ban it. You know how I mentioned I never played online, thats why they sent the cease and desist their revenue only comes from playing online and as a modder who plays exclusively offline, that was a kick in the balls.
