You have a game like GTA V which is virtually a player sandbox. The modding community was always strong and gave players access to incredibly different levels of fun in this game. They took their fan community, and beat theof them. 3 months ago? Id recommend theout of this game. After current events,  no. Community is everything. Why do these companies keep wanting to mess with mods? If the system is not broken there is not need to stick your hands in it.
