Take Two has officially ruined the community for the entire creative side... I dont quite think they realize how many yourtubers, content creators, and communities relied on Open IV. Millions and millions of supporters are now gone. All in the sake of saving their precious shark cards. I think that was the final straw so to speak for the community. The game has been a constant let down, from the release of heists, to taking away SINGLE PLAYER MODS....... I mean all in the name of of FORCING ITS USERS TO PLAY ONLINE AND BUY CARDS... I really wish Rockstar would take up for its millions of players... I mean, we bought the game 3 times bassiclly, you guys are litterly 3 ish away from being the most selling games, you would think that for ONCE, we would be aknowleged after YEAR AND YEARS of playing this game. Anyone using OPENIV is using to play the game our way. Buy playing as iron man, or better yet changing cars around.... Congrads R and T2 youve litterally ruined your game!!!! Have fun with ALL of those negative reviews
