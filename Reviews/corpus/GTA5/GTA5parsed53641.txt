The single player mode is pretty good, especially when you can have mods. The story is very welldeveloped, especially with the relationships between the characters.But online is an entirely different story. I mean, wtf has this game become? Hackers everywhere, and the cheating system is so damn broken as well to the point where they target innocent people a lot more than cheaters. You have to grind forever to buy overpriced crap, or just buy overpriced shart cards with real money. And as I said before, I dont understand at all how Rockstar games cannot fix their anti cheat system even though they made so much money through this game. And speaking of money, why the hell is this game still 60 dollars for the base price after quite a few years? With a system this broken, this game is NOT worth 60 dollars.Now for a personal story, when I first started to play this game, school got in the way, and I could not play online with my friends. I was really mad because of that. But looking back from now, I am glad that happened. I am glad that I did not waste my time grinding only to have the broken anticheat system take a bunch of my hardgrinded ingame money away.But if you just want this game to play with mods on single player, go on ahead, but definitely not for multiplayer. Wait for a time when the game gets discounted if you dont want to pay 60 dollars.Final Verdict Not worth the grind
