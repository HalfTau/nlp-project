I buy the GTA series specifically for the story and modding. Ive been buying them ever since GTA II. It seems as if Rockstar and the publisher have really forgotten about the roots of the game, its so sad. You cant mod anymore, and the single player seems to have been forgotten about. Ill miss this game and what it always represented.
