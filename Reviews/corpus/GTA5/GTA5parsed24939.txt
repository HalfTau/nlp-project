Growing up with OpenIV and seeing the developers removing modding because of false statements is outrageous. None of the hackers use OpenIV since it wont even let you join if you edit the game files. And the fact that GTA Multiplayer is just updates where you require to buy their expensive shark cards makes it no suprise that there are so many hackers. Only good thing remaining about this game was the mods for SINGELPLAYER and they even removed that. GTA is dead as we speak. Dont buy this
