I recommend playing this game,if you have actual time to.You cant get nice cars and Houses in the Online Mode if you play for like 2 hours you will have nothing.Now we come to the bad part Everything is so fckn overpriced,its unreal.You have to grind tons of missions over and over to get one nice car.Thats not how you make an Online Mode,rockstar.You PUSH the People who play this game to either get Mods and Cheat Money,or to buy IngameMoney with Real Money.Thats bad.
