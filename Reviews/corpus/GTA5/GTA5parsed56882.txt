I feel bad for all those affected by false bans, especially after the gun runner update that removed all hacked stuff..then 2 days latter Im being pulled out of my car droped 5 miles from the sky,traped in a sideways glass prison / ferris wheel. read how many got un just bans, their legit cash removed along side funny money dropped/shot with/spwaned on bags of cash by a modder all the while modders still terrorising it just so disheartening.
