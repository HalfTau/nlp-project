Piece of garbage.Bought 3 Shark cards, banned for 1 day, called support, system ban, cant be helped.A week before I even login again, then a month after a little playing of heist with my friend, now total ban.Shark cards dont count as ingame earnt money.lesser than 100 hours in the game, got banned first time at around 40, posted help in support page, smart guys out of nowhere start to call me a liar because they are so mind reading and such tech geniuses they could tell that Im a lying hacker, because my spent money is not adding up to earnt money in game.Know people mods, not one banned.The only game in the universe that bans you for paying them.
