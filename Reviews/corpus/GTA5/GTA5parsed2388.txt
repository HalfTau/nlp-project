Its really sad, but RS have gone full EA and just sold the game out, just milking the hell out of multiplayer content combined with bad customer service in relation to support and such. The single player is still pretty great but just doesnt get the attention multiplayer does because they know people will throw their money at overpriced crap. I also have this on the PS4 and the multiplayer environment there is also as bad as it is on the computer, unless you have a group of friends you can form a gang with. So yeah, if you want this but dont want to deal with the multiplayer crap, wait until it is on a good special deal. Theres still plenty of fun to be had in the single player, and you dont have to deal with awful people.
