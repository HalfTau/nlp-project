Expensive content will make you grind for hours and some ahole with modded money will buy mk2 explosive rounds and kill you nonstop while youre doing your ceo work very fun.This game was fun when everything was simple times when the fastest car was adder and people did missions without being aholes.Not mentioning poor rockstart support accusing players for modding money while youre playing your normal game but a modder gives cash to everyone on the server and you get accused by it resulting your legit cash removed also haha!Dont even get me started on the TAKE 2 MOD DISABLE stuff its just pure cancer and killing of the creative communityI guess all the matters for the rockstar is little kids who take their moms credit card and buys megaloon shark cards for new dlc content
