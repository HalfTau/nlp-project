Take Two have lost my trust as a publisher with their recent undermonetization talk and the takedown of OpenIV for no good reason. Im hestiant to put the blame on Rockstar as they are most likely being controlled by the heads at TakeTwo. Never thought Id see the day where EA wasnt the most hated games company.
