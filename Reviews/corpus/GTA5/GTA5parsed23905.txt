Was instantly banned, it was lifted then I was permanently banned the same day it was lifted with no reasoning to why , waste of about 200.00 in shark cards, but hey you live and learn wouldnt trust Rockstar ever again, wont even buy the next version of GTA, their support is horrible, I guess banning you and taking your 59.99  whatever else you paid for in game currency is part of their strategy anyways folks find something better to play this will more than likely end in you losing money. 734 hours played all gone to hell thanks Rockstar D
