An unacceptable example of corporate greed. Give us our mods back. We will not be forced into microtransactions in gta online.  You know for a fact that open IV only works with singleplayer and is not responsible for the hackers in gta online. Maybe if you put some money into actually developing antihacking software you could stop them.
