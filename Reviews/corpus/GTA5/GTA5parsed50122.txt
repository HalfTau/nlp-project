So i bought This game Generally To Have Fun.When i go online i just crash because my internet is crap.So all i do is mod GTA Singleplayer.After This ing ban on Modding By Take Two. Theyre Sales gone down,Players gone down.The only reason theyre doing this is to get ppl to play online and get shark cards so that Their Company can get money,I personally enjoy this game but my enjoyment went from 1000 in A MilliSecond because of this.Not Proud Rockstar.GO make some money not like u already have billions and want trillions. off Rockstar
