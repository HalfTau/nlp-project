Do NOT trust the System Requirements. I have much better stuff than the say you need, in my computer, but i still HAVE to have Safe Mode and I only have 30 fps. While it is in Safe Mode, it does not lag at all, so if you dont care about graphics then i guess it is worth it.  It takes a lot of time to get money in the game and if you would buy ingame money with real money then I am just saying it is really overprized. So if you have A LOT of time and/or a lot of money then i would recommend the game and if you would have good computer of course.
