This can be fun enough if you have friends that play this game, or you can find some through heist like me. I only recommend this because theres still a lot of friendly community. But hell yeah cheater everywhere, almost in every session. Some are friendly, but mostly are just an ahole that will blow the sht out of you and the entire session. Anyway, I always get into solo public session so I can grind money in peace alone or with friends. Check the discussion page if you want to know how to get into the solo public session. If youre newbie like me, dont be shy, just try to start a conversation when youre in heist, listen to senior instructor and youre good to go. They might invite you till the final heist though.Overall its 6/10 from me, but everything is so expensive in here. Dont ever spend your money on sharkcards though, not worth it. Also when you get around 600k ingame, buy armored Kuruma, pretty useful for single vip work such as Headhunter and Sightseer, even for heist to gain profit.Note  Becareful of money drops from cheaters, just stay out of it if you still loves your own money.
