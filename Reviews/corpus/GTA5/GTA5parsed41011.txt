GTA 5 is overall a good game, the singleplayer campaining is good and actionpacked. GTA Online on the other hand is a mixed bag, the content at this time is vast and enjoyable, but the constant push for more money which basicly means buy the bloody shark cards is absolutely ridicolous, as I mainly play multiplayer and have to cope with the constant pounding of by this, buy that and then being offered the shark cards as an easy way out I find is frustrating. Paying 70 bucks for 8 mil ingame is bonkers and unacceptable, for this reason peaople turn to hackers who make a decent profit from the annoyment aand desperation of others. Rockstar has since outlawed the modding community and tried to milk the last bit of money out of the players. For this reason I must leave a negative review. Get yourtogether Rockstar!
