Single player is really, really good.Multiplayer had so much potential but they turned it into a shark card milking machine. If you want to unlock anything fun in multiplayer, be prepared to spend your time in loading screens and doing repetitive as  fetch this fetch that missions. Heists were fun though but there wont be any more of them. Last nail in the coffin was the cease and desist letter to shut down OpenIV. This is not how you treat your customers. I give TakeTwo a big middle finger and refuse to buy any of their games ever again.Also peertopeer multiplayer...really? REALLY?
