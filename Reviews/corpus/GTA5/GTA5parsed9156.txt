While I recommend this game overall, its really clear that GTAV is being geared more and more towards extracting money for the online version. Everythings gotten very grindy to sell Shark Cards. Singleplayer has been largely abandoned when it comes to updates and, worse, theyve seriously crippled singleplayer modding to drive more people to GTA Online.
