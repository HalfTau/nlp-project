About half the time, the servers are down and its not just the online game that is affected. You have to have a social club for single player gaming too and if thats not enough even your single player gaming is comprimised when the servers are down. I can understand the measures that have to be taken against piracy and stuff but at what cost? The cost of regulary interfering with the players experiences who bought the game? If the company wants to take measures then thats up to them but why mess up the basic things of the game like loading the parts of it that doesnt even require connection for people who have paid for it and just want to play sp when og is not available? If the cost of securing profit by preventing piracy was equal to forcing the players who have acquired it to comprimise, even small companies would have thrived on such immature shortsighted algorithms. For such a company to take this cheap and we rule we dont care attitude road its not just something that you would expect considering their reputation. This review is for my overall experience after playing for a little over a year and I do think that just loading the game shouldnt be a part of such otherwise great game as not every person has the time to stare at screen for an hour to load the game and get the error message.
