I got all my cash reset and im mad. Nah im just playing, I cheated that cash in so im not too butthurt, but It doesnt change the fact that I seriously do not enjoy this game. The singleplayer is fun but not worth a whole purchase maybe get it on sale. The Multiplayer which was the side I thought id spend hours with is such a boring grind, there wasnt a single heist that was actually fun to do, or even worth doing. So really, its no wonder I cheated and so many others did. They give you three options, Waste your time grinding worst option imo, Spend your or your parents hard earned cash, or cheat. What option sounds the best to you when laid out? When all the fun stuff is locked behind money and levels that are so tedious to get it makes your game a chore. If you want a gta game to screw around with your friends like I did, just get gta4, Otherwise youre gonna have to invest so much time and money into this snorefest.
