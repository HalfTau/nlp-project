The game has a great campaign with 500 hours of content, but the multiplayer lacks what it used to be. It used to be fun and you could do heists and buy cool cars and all that. But, now its all about the grind and getting killed repeatedly. I wish they would fix the Pay2Win aspect of multiplayer. Overall campaign is recommended
