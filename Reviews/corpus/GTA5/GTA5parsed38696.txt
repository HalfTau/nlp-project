I dont mod GTAV. Its just not something I do. Sure, mods are great, but, Ive never had the desire to use them. That being said, the audacity of Take Two is mind blowing. To shut down a vital program in modmaking, basically making mods illegal, is one of the dumbest things they could have possibly done. I enjoy the game, but the fact that theyre removing the option of mods is rageinducing.
