Story Mode Its amazing how seemlessly you can transition between characters during a heist and you can feel the relationships building over time.Online Its very unlikely that youll find a good community with people who dont blow your car up while you head to Los Santos Customs. It is also extremely hard to make money in heists unless you have friends that can join but even when you do make money everything is so expensive.Overall The controls in this game are extremely simple to master and lead to great gameplay.9/10
