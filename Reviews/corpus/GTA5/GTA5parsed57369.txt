Ive been a fan of the series since san andreas, and played gta4 on console and played all the great single player dlc, but I was extremely dispointed with gtavs online portion instead of going with the same style of online gta4, and red dead had where you simply played it to enjoy the game and ranked up in red dead to unlock morethey tried to present it as a stand online game gta online rather than gtavs online portion. red deads onilne was amazing. this however doesnt have the simliar fun of its lobby or rank up system that didnt make you feel like it was  complete grind this game however has the same grind of a free to play  mmo at a 60 dollar price tag with the same microtransaction or grind economy in a fully priced game. and, now they are targeting the modding community around their game, after theyve spent years banning coppies to preserve their  microtransactions, all while not producing a single bit of single player dlc, there hasnt been a single story addon after 4 years because they have made half a billion dollars on selling people digital currency with no real value while releasing content thats just new cars and rehashed grinds.  I dont have an unlimited time on this planet Im not going to spend it grinding for digital currency or giving up my money to buy digital cars. Im simply going to play another game. and I recommend you guys do the same.
