A fun story and a soild singleplayer experience, the only reason this game is a Yes recommendation. If you like GTA then it wont disappoint and a serious step up from the heavyhanded seriousness and dull interpersonal management of IV. Remember the fun of Vice City? Its not quite so wild but more tightly crafted.Multiplayer isnt so hot. All the DLC thats been produced is amazingly uncreative be prepared to spend large amounts of money on businesses which require large amounts of upkeep and highrisk on each job to ensure the profit from them is as slim as possible. Each new release also comes with vehicles which require even more money than the last. It all adds up to make getting money a daunting task for anyone unwilling to commit thousands of hours to the game, all in a thinly veiled attempt to force incredibly poorvalue microtransactions on the players. Its pretty easy to tell what they care about when it seems like the only hacking they activly persue punishing is the stuff that impacts their microtransaction economy.Rampant greed aside, the experience online will also vary greatly sessiontosession. Having a few friends with you will help smooth out the gradual progress to be made, just be aware that PvP is inherently encouraged by the game and going passive will severely hinder what you can do.
