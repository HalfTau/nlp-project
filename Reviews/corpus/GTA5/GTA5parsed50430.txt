Great singleplayer. Multiplayer is the grindiest experience ever for little payout. A majority of my hours are racing and they dong give anything unless you win a 16 person race. Also, terrible devs. Modding is how many great games are created see Dota and evolve into a great experience see Minecraft, GMod, COD Zombies on PC. Their free DLCs for GTA 5 are matched with terrible community with griefing players and a huge pricetag or hundreds of hours to match other players. Would not reccommend buying from this company ever again.
