The campaign is really good and quite long. If you want to purchase it for the single player, do it. However, if you want to enjoy yourself online, you are going to have a bad time. The online part is well thought and has a lot you can do. The problem is EVERYTHING costs a lot. A lot more than you can make in a few missions. You have to grind like crazy to make that money to afford a cool helicopter or a top of the line car. This was all made in order for rockstar to make money from their multiple microtransactions. I enjoyed myself for a while in online because hackers were giving away money to people for free and I could buy a lot of cool things. This made online enjoyable and fun. Otherwise it is horrible. Before gta5 I thought Rockstar were one of the few remaining developers that were not greedy, but they stooped very low and lost all my respect.TLDRCampaign is very good, online is a grindfest if you wish to enjoy it.
