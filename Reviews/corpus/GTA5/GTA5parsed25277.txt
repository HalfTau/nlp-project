Time for me to make my own review and as much as I want to review on how many of the reviews are only reviewing online aspects of the game I wont. The game is great online and offline, the time you spend on story alone is worth the price tag. Yes there are cheaters online, they will ruin your fun unexpectedly, yes there are random players who just play to kill you even if you are fresh out of tutorial and you are a level 1. With that being said there are communities/crews you can join so you can be the one stomping on the griefers and have majority to kick the cheaters and the try hards. Now ignoring the online aspects of interaction with others online jobs provide fun challenges, its better with friends of course and some jobs require more than 1 . . . Ok Im going to stop here basically I dont understand the negative reviews, and the game is totally worth the price!
