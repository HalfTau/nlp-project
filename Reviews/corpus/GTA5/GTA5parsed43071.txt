Remember when Rockstar enjoyed the GTA IV mods? They even said so in their own blog hereThis game was enhanced with many mods, including graphics mods to make the game look better, and Take Two decided to kill off the mod community. Very nice.Modding controversy a side...This is the weakest GTA game in the series. The soundtrack is horrible, the map may be the biggest map in GTA history, but there is very little you can do in the map. Its just a big empty space where only a small fraction of it is interactive. Whats the point of a big massive map if it is barely interactive? I rather have a smaller map with alot more interactive objects in it like how the older games had restaurants you can walk inside for example. The graphics are good and the game is a very good port, but it becomes meaningless since the game seems boring with nothing really to do. There isnt even options to change the games FOV, since I prefer a wider FOV to help with motion sickness.As for GTA Online. The character creator is horrible. There is very little options to customize your character to make them look the way you want it. The interface is horrible with a ton of time wasted on waiting for other players, and even then, online is filled with trolls. The game also forces you to buy a shark card microtransactions to get ahead in the game, since the other ways to make money in game is limited.Overall, its the worst GTA. You are better off finding a used copy of Vice City or San Andreas on PS2 or an original PC copy if you are lucky. Those are a much better GTA experience, even with the removed songs due to licensing issues.
