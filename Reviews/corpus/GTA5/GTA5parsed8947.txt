The single player is what youd expect from GTA, a solid sandbox experience in a whacky alternate reality city where everything is taken up to the satirical max. But nobody is still buying this for the single player, which lost any future story support almost immediately upon Rockstar figuring out how much cash they could get out of kids with credit cards.Sad to see the beginning of the end for Rockstar single player games as being anything more than a vehicle for milking cash out of games as a service.Fostering a community of hackers as a means to sell digital currency is disgusting. Period. How EA gets so much hate and this crap slips by, Ill never understand. If you have a group of friends to roll with, its entertaining enough as a sandbox simulator. Otherwise, stay far away. Youll find nothing but hackers, headaches, and woefully underdeveloped solo activities.
