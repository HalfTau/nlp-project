EditThey have since backtracked on this decision. However, the reason this happened in the first place still stands GTA Online is deeply infected with the disease of microtransactions. It is filled with increasingly bloated prices for stuff thats really not that worth it, while all the missions continue to pay out pathetic amounts in comparison even the heists  hell, especially the heists, considering the time and effort they take. None of this is for a sense of progression, or ownership. It is entirely to inconvenience and annoy you, so that the microtransactions look ever sweeter. The microtransactions which, by the way, will not last you very long either.This infection is bad enough that it is seeping into the singleplayer. Even before the major incidents such as the above, they have neglected the singleplayer. Constant updates and new expensive content for the multiplayer, but none of it made its way over to singleplayer. No sign of any expansions or anything for singleplayer. They just threw it out and forgot about it, because theres no extra money to be made there.If ever there were a case against microtransactions, it is this game. It could have been so much better. It should have been. But corporate greed intervened, apparently unhappy with merely being one of the bestselling games of all time, across 3 releases. Lets just reiterate that last part  they sold this game 3 times over, and are still not satisfied with the money they made.It serves as a sad representation of the AAA game industry as a whole.So yeah, even though I like a whole lot of this game, this is staying negative.
