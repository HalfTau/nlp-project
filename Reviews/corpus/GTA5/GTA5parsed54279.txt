The game overall is very fun indeed and the PC version is the one to get, provided your computer can run it. Theres a lot to like, and sure it may not be the best in the series for some users but its a game I liked quite a lot. Although IV is my fav.However, the structure of GTA Online and recent actions by TakeTwo prevent me from recommending this game.Any free dlc added to the game is only accessable via the Online mode, none of it is added to singleplayer. This content must be bought with in game currency which requires the user to either waste hours grinding away or to submit to Take Two and purchase Shark Cards.Recent comments from Strauss Zelnick, CEO of TakeTwo, stating that he feels that the publisher is undermonetising its userbase really do not do the sentiment towards this game and the publisher any favours. Essentially any player who is not yet buying shark cards are seen as unchopped wood or a cow yet to be milked by him.Finally, the CD towards OpenIV, a program that has existed for years and allowed for singleplayer mods across many games made by Rockstars studios is the nail in the coffin. Rockstar and T2 can beat about the bush and blatantly lie to news outlets and us users but the fact that this specific tool was targeted at this particular time does appear to be T2s way of preventing single player users from enjoying content otherwise hidden behind Shark Card paywalls.Play the game, by all means. Just do it in a way that involves Take Two not gaining any income.TLDRT2 want the entire userbase of GTA V to be buying shark cards, their actions and recent dialogue to the public clearly demonstrate this. The games industry is pretty  and this is par for the course for this sort of thing but it still shouldnt be supported. Dont give them your money.
