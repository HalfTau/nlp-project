There was lots of controversy when OpenIV was terminated by TakeTwoBut I dont need to  about it.The game is really good. I like the story and its real fun and open.The variety of things you can do is insane.Now about the MP... I dont really like it a lot. It is really grindy and you need lots of wasted time to access the newer stuff. Every Time. They are going a little too far with the sharkcards.Also the MP is not that good at all. Yeah it can be fun if you have some friends to play with, but if what you really want is play it alone or with random people. I really cant recommend it at allThis score is mostly for the SP wich is one of the Best experiences I have had in videogames
