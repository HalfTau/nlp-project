To all the people hating on Take Two for taking down the mod menu support You are all a bunch of hypocrites! I use to play this game online quite a bit, and just about every time I would go online there would be someone using a mod menu to screw other players over. They would use these menus to gain an advantage, to drop themselves money for things that took us legit players a long time to earn, to kill other players, to put ridiculous constant bountys on other players, spawning vehicles that they should not have, this is to name a few things that the mod menus did to ruin the online experience. Now that the menus are gone the online world should be a much better place to play this game with friends. Does it suck that you cant use them in single player anymore.... sure. However this does not make this game a bad game nor does it take away from the accomplishments that GTA V has made since its release oh so long ago. GTA V is a great game and will go down in history as one of the most in depth, fun, crazy adventure open world games of all time. If you are salty about them getting rid of something that was ruining the online play for most people then you do not deserve to play this game in the first place. Kirby
