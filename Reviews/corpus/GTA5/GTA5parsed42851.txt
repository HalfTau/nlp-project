Heard they want to start charing for mods?Heres an idea, maybe charge for online pay?Make a DLC campaign, Ill pay for that.Make online more robust and turn it into an MMO with subscription model for access and use a different launcher client to scan for cheaters/hackers I would pay just for that service alone to clean up theshow that is GTA V Online right now.Better then taking away modding from the game.If people like your content, they should pay for it and online has its own aspects worth paying for so just work more on that instead of being greedy and stepping all over the user community. Absolutely will not pay for something that was already free and was the only reason to even buy GTA V for solo play on the PC after playing it on the consoles i.e. OpenIV.
