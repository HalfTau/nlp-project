All GTA games were esentially more fun thanks to modding and now they ban it because they made a cheap online system that uses p2p with litrually bad detection for cheating and modding and then just decide to ban modding in global so they no longer have detect anything now they just need to check if you modified something to the game.This company has enough money yet it takes the cheapest possible solutions that being p2p and istead of writing a decent anticheat for mods they just ban mods in general so its cheaper, while also publishing more expainsion packs so you can keep buying so that you run out of money and buy there wireshark cards.tldr Rich company, using cheap solutions, no modding and dont buy.
