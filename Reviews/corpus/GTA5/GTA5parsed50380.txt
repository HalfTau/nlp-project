What was once the crown prince of open world games has become a circle jerk of microtransactions and mediocre online play. Its very clear rockstar has no plan to take GTAV into a direction worthwhile, and I lament because of this. The single player story and gameplay both showed so much promise back in the day, but it all went down the  with time.
