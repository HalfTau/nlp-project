OpenIV sends their regards.anyways lets be honest, GTA V is an overrated piece of sht game with a bland story, forgettable and boring characters, or just plain annoying, It has really slow and sluggish gameplay and gets pretty boring real quick, And you already know how shtty Online is so Im not going to touch that.Just play GTA IV or GTA SA...They are better games.Go fck yourselves Rockstar and Take two, You greedy backstabbers.
