Take Twos position on GTA modding is a ing joke. Not only is OpenIV not interfacing with GTAO whatsoever, the mods that are possible thanks to OpenIV such as FiveM do not compete with GTAO because were interested in role playing, not driving around gunning each other down in deathmatches.FiveM is the reason GTAV is trending on Twitch. Good job T2
