I am sad to see a great game like this lose its modding support. Allowing mods for a game is beneficial in many ways. It allows creators to express their creative minds for a game they love. For users, it allows them to experience the game in new ways that they may never have imagined. Developers also benefit from this as well. This encourage people to continue to play the game after the player has experienced the vanilla content of the game. Modding also attracts a broader audience since there are players that may not like all of the vanilla aspects of the game, but they still buy the game because they know they can changes the things they do not like. Though there are some negative effects of modding, such as content being added to the game that the developers did not want to see in the game, I believe that the good aspects of modding outweigh the negatives. This is why I am so disappointed with Rockstar Games and TakeTwo Interactive. I hope that these two companies see the public outcry against their decision and take action to reverse their cease and desist order. I also hope that other developers see how unfavorable this kind of action is for the gaming community and do not take a similar course of action to ban modding.
