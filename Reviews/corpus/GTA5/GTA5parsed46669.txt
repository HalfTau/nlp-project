Sorry, but modding is a big part of the PC space. I totally understand that the online sections of the game need to be protected, but the way to do this isnt by targetting groups that bend over backwards to ensure their modding work doesnt cause problems, abuse and interference to online components.Going after those in the modding community who work hard to make games even more enjoyable and interesting is counterproductive. I cant do much to express my distaste except with this negative review... so hopefully Rockstar and Take Two get the message. This will be change if and when the modding situation changes.
