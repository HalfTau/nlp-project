IF YOUR BUYING THIS TO TRANSFER DONT DO IT!Bought this game in hopes of grinding out Heists and missions with friends to relive those moment back on console, But quickly ended when you find out Rockstar says they want everyone to start out at level 1 again. No Character transfers means no fun for retuning players with PCs. RIP a great game.
