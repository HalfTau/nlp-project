How I enjoyed this game upon launch on the xbox360. I got it as soon as it came out on PC, replayed through the whole story. Online was fun for awhile. Finally modders revitalized my interest in the game, the enhanced graphics, being able to play as a super hero, tethering vehicles together. Ive experienced online modding too and most the time it wasnt even that horrible, getting tased nonstop, people flying in cars, the bannableyet free money theyd often give away. None of it made my experience terrible. But experiencing these fantastical mods only to have them taken away, that is terrible.
