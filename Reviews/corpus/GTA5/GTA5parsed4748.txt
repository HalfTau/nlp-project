The main storyline is the backbone and all the real substance of the game, Switch to Online, and youre stuck with a ragtag set of missions that revolve around people stopping from killing each other constantly for five minutes. While Online is a fun addition to the base game of GTA V, more often than not it leads to you getting stuck with people whose only interest is to mess with other people and to ruin their experience of the game.
