Extremely dissapointed. I bought this game for the modding community that has supported Grand Theft Auto and now theyre taking it away from us. If games continue to put money above players I fear that we the next generation will never know what they are missing out on. But, we will. Take two, you have dissapointed us all. Guys, go buy Titanfall 2, a complete game with serious potential,.
