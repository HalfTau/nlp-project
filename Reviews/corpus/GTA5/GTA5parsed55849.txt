I wouldve recommand this game, if it arent take 2 anti consumer and anti modding policies which is complete bullsht! Even if we can complain all we want, is not gonna change anything because of consoles and kiddies, this is unacceptable and greedy on every side of the spectrum, they totally forgot what gta was all about and why it sold a lot on pc.
