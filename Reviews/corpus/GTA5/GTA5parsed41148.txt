yayy, mods are backthis should go without saying but dont cheat! You almost got our mods deleted.You know what its like to have gamer ADD right? Where you kind of just hover over games and always come back to a few?Well I have a small hard drive so there was a time when GTA just didnt cut it in my playtime any more to justify its giant size at the time. So I uninstalled it, sometimes I would reinstall for a week or two but always uninstall for other games.Then one day I started modding. Suddenly the game started transforming into something that became GTA the way I wanted it to be.The work of the modders is just so incredible.Basically my mods transformed my playstyle into a game that offered infinite replayability and it has been installed for half a year now.I set up an improved cops and stealth mod where if nobody sees you or calls the police you can get away with virtual murder. I set up a fuel and food mod and interiors mod where cars have random amonts of gas and any fast food area has a red blip that heals you.I made pedestrians drop more money, gang members some other poor targets that I wont mention would drop STACKS.I set up a mod that did multiplayer random missions in Single Player so I always had a crate, van, assissination, car steal or car blow up mission.I set up gta iv euphoria rag dolls so i could shoot people in the arms and legs and they would try to keep standing and roll around crazily realistically.I set up the game so I could get immerssed into my nasty despicable antiheroes and actually live their lives, eating, sleeping, stock trading, getting investments from businesses.I had mods that unlocked all the new cars like the parachuting one with misslesMan my end game is glorious,looking forwards to Red Dead 2
