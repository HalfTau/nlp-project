GTA Online was fun at the beginning, now Take2 takes down 2 things Modding and putting out updates which are behind a huge paywall.Everyone who thinks now you dont need to pay for it just play the game   i dont have the time to grind for something like this.If i can sit in front of the pc i want to play a game which is fun and grinding to GET to the fun is not really fun anymore.
