After 400 hours spent in this game Ive decided to sum up my experience and share it with you.Ill make this short soPROS A lot of content in both single and multiplayer A lot of mods for single player The best story ever. Very interesting and time consuming, the game having updates very often so you always find new content for GTA OnlineCONS Microtransactions, but you can grind for money the way of doing this is only up to you and sometimes may be funnyBad hackers Yes, there are a lot of good hackers too, that will make you enjoy the game. But I am talking about the bad ones that locks you in a cage on the bottom of the ocean still its kind of funny seeing this Long loading screens The toxic communityHowever, I still recommend this because you can anyway have a good time with this game. And this is only up to you!
