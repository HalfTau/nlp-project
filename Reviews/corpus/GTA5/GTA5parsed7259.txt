ProsDecent customer service network difficultiesExcellent singleplayerGood replayability singleplayer and multiplayerConsMultiplayer has become unrealistic who thought it would be a good idea to let a criminal buy a ing fighterjet/bomberLots of griefers in multiplayervery hard to start as a new player in multiplayerlots of grinding in multiplayerMultiplayer only fun if played with friendsDont buy this game if you havent played it before on other devices ps3, xbox, etc., because it will be a huge grind. Even for someone like me, having played for over 3 years clocking in 800 hours in total and having made around 6 million ingame cash, there are still things I havent unlocked yet. And with the new update, where you can literally buy a functional sovietera bomber, the game has lost its realistic touch.Buy the game for 20 bucks when its on sale, and just stick to the singleplayer.
