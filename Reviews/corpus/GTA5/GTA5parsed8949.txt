The best singleplayer game I have ever played. 10/10 story, graphics, music, humor, characters. The game has pretty high replayability value at least for me as you can choose different ways of doing heists and some other missions. After you are done with the story and all optional missions there is not much to do unless you are into roleplaying.As for multiplayer, do not even think about playing it if you do not have 3 good friends. Public servers are filled with cheaters, trolls or the combination of these two. But! If you have 3 or more friends you are going to love it. Just create invite only session and you are all set. For me the main purpose of multiplayer were COOP heists with my friends and we had blast playing them over and over again.People say that you have to grind a lot or buy GTA cash with real money to get the best cars, properties and the end game gear. All you have to do are 3 challenges in heists, these give you 12 millions GTA dollars. You will be able to buy pretty much anything you want.About the I was banned for no reason controversy. Do not install any mods, do not play public sessions and you will be fine. I have not been banned in my 300 hours, nor were my 6 friends.TLDR the game is really worth the full price solely for the singleplayer, if you have friends you will enjoy the multiplayer as well.
