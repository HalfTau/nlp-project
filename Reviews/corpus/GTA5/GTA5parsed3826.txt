Still a great game. Unsure whether I would recommend it at full price but if it is on sale then it is definitely worth it  especially if you pay the little bit extra for the bundle that comes with 1.25M.The 1.25M is enough to buy yourself any high end apartment which allows you to do heists once you are level 12 and work your way up. Definitly worth the extra 5 for the boostA couple of negatives I can think of are the people you get every now and then in jets killing people, the long waiting times for heist crews hence why playing with friends is the best option and the money grind in GTA Online
