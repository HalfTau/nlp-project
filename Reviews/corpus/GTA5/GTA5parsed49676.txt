Singleplayer Interesting story and characters Lots of things to do Great graphic and different landscapesBesides that you now have 3 different characters its basically the same, if you liked GTA IV you will most likely like GTA V singleplayer too.Multiplayer Like singleplayer but with other people Less fun than singleplayer because oh you destroyed another ones car? Pay him, with your hardly grinded money! You play to grind money to get cars and other stuff instead of already having stuff to play to have fun Grinding money and RP until you have no longer fun How about we make everything in the next update even more expensive? And let us give you ingame money for real money  GTA Online  cash cow Also dont forget the loadingscreens, all the ing time, which takes several minutes Lets ban mods! The online hacker? No the singleplayer and RP ones!Tldr GTA V singleplayer  top, GTA V Online  pure
