9.5 / 10GTAV is a great game to play, especially if you find friends or a crew to play with.I notice in the reviews that a lot of people complain about how hard it is to make money in GTAV thats kinda the whole point of the game.You complete Heists with your Crew of 4 to earn 200,000, 500,000, or even 1,000,000 in some cases.I would recommend to purchase a 500,000 shark card so you can afford an Apartment thats around 250k plus a nice car for Heists.I hope my advice helps
