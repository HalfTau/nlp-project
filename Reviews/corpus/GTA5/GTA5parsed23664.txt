Please note Im writing this review from a stock aspect  I wont be discussing mods or anything except updates/FREE DLC.The story is GREAT in my opinion. Completed it on the PS4 and Xbox One, though I really didnt feel like a third playthrough for PC. It might be a bit of a let down for some, but I sure had a lot of fun with it  enough to play through it two times apparently. Once you complete the story though, theres pretty much nothing to do unless you get mods, but im not going into that as previously stated.GTA Online however, is a total how right now. Every single update adds things over 3/5 million and to get that kind of cash you gotta grind heists for 45 hours at least, or fork over some of your real life  and get some in game . The other thing holding back Online is modders. Rockstar and Take Two might be trying their best to crack down on modders, but my god are they really bad at it. Trust me when I say it wont be hard to find a hacker.TLDR Play for the story, then refund and get San Andreas and mod the hell out of it.
