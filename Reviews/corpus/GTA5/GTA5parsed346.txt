the story mode is great and you can play with mods wich is also greatGTA ONLINE on the other hand was fun once but the developpers ruined it..everything cool costs more than a million and rockstar keep adding useless cars and properties that wastes all your money.back then you could buy a tank wich is probably the most powerful thing in the game for 1.5 million and now a buggy with miniguns is the same price.the game is not even close to what you see in the trailers unless you play story mode.if you dont want to spend hours doing boring missions to get money, dont buy it.if you only want to play solo mode and play with mods, it is great but you will not be able to play with friends and you will be bored after finishing the story.
