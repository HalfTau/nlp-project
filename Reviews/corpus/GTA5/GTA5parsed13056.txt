So originally, I didnt recommend this game. To be honest, it was partially due to me being a little miffed that all of the new content for Online was ungodly expensive in a game where jobs pay small sums that will take scores of hours for you to be able to afford just one of the new items. And the fact that the devs seemed to refuse to add any of the online content to Singleplayer In case you didnt want your expensive car to be blown up by a troll.BUT! If I ignore that, and go about my merry way, its a solid game.The singleplayer is where its at, in my opinion. The story is a dramatic overthetop story as weve all come to know and love from the franchise. A massive world to explore, and explode. Hundreds of hours of fun to be had, I can attest.The multiplayer is also good, it just takes a good long while to get to where you can actually buy things. It takes patience, a lot of patience. A LOT of patience, but you can get there. Of course, rockstar is kind enough to offer ingame purchases for ingame currency, which has ticked a lot of people off, but its an American company whos focused on making money, so I cant really say I expected any better.All in all, a solid game that will have you playing for hours and hours, and hours. Pick it up if your computer can handle it, you wont regret it, I guarentee.
