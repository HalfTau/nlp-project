Grand Theft Auto V is a great game but it has one issue. That issue is online its good and all but the modders and hackers are getting annoying and they are ruining online to be honest. Yes its a good game to mod but its not for online just story mode. I wish Rockstar would put a little more effort in fixing online but i know they are doing their best. I would rate Grand Theft Auto V 7/10.
