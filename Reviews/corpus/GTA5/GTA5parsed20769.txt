Good game, community ruins it though. Usually keep to myself and help my buddy do resupplies but every 30 seconds some asshat comes flying through with a hydra and slaughters me or theyre riding around in some armored vehicle with a machine gun or rockets. Not worth the money, dont even get to enjoy it.
