I bought and played the PC version for the mod support alone and have had a lot of fun messing around with OpenIV. This decision by TakeTwo was handled very poorly and now this game will sit in my library unplayed because it cannot possibly be as much fun as it has been ever again. I am not a GTA Online player, never have been so I personally havent seen this tool be abused but the publisher has ruined my single player experience. Thanks for that.
