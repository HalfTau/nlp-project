All developers that do such greedy andmoves deserve nothing but shame and boycott. Referred to the events of OpenIVIn short Dont buy this game until Take Two decides to fix theirand stop asking even more money of us despite GTA V being one of the most best selling games of all time.Also, by sending this cease  desist they just ruined one of the biggest reasons why people bought this game The Modding Scene.. how stupid.
