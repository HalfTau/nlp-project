OpenIV is Back This game is something special. One moment youre driving in a mom van across San Andreas and the next moment youre killed from an explosion from a modder. But dont get me wrong, modders in online can be really fun and funny. But, there are some rotton apples in the bunch. With over 700 hours on PC alone, over 1000 on Xbox, I can confidentaly reccommend this game.P.S. Rockstar is a great company, TakeTwo is not.
