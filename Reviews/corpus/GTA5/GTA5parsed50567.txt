After three years of playing the most recent title from our friends at Rockstar games,with great regret, i would not advise buying this game. Not because of any problems within the game or anything related to the game. but its because of the recent CD against OpenIV a modding tool for GTAV  GTAIV. i enjoy this game along with millions of others across many platforms but this has truly soured my thoughts on TakeTwo and Rockstar.
