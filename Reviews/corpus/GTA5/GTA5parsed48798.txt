This is not a good time to buy this game for pc. The developers have a strange way of interacting with their customers and loyal fans Price hikes before sales, banning players for using singleplayer mods, etc. Take a quick glance at its recent reviews, they speak for themselves. If you havent picked this game up, dont bother until they change their attitude/business practices. Vote with your wallet.
