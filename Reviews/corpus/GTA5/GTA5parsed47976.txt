So they decided to stop modding of their game under the lie that it is to prevent hacking online.We all know that isnt the case.I am pretty sure they will demand Steam remove the negative reviews regarding the CD of OpenIV because those are Fake Reviews.I am not going to get anything Rockstar ever again on ANY platform.
