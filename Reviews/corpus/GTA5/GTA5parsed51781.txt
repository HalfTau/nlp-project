I bought this game specifically for mods. It is a modding paradise and very few games are like that. Take Two has ended my love for Grand Theft Auto 5. Taking down Open IV kills the game for millions of players. I only use GTA V for the world, because all I play is LSPDFR. Now it seems thats over with. Thanks TT, you killed the PC version of this game.
