I bought this game on Xbox 360, Xbox One, AND PC! Why did I go out of my way to buy the game a third time? So I could mod it! I always loved roleplaying as police in the vanilla version, however it clearly wasnt meant to be a thing and thus didnt really work well until I had the help of mods. Mods gave me a refreshing take on GTA and made me love the game even more. It is a tragedy that Take Two is killing off a portion of its loyal, respectful fans who use OpenIV to alter their single player experience only.
