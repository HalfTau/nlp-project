GTA 5 was launched in the same year the WiiU launched. Skyrim was released less than 2 years prior. The Xbox One was announced 5 months before GTA 5 was released on ps3 and xbox 360.The absolutely incredible amount of money theyve gotten from the games microtransactions has allowed the company to survive and pay its hundreds of developers despite not releasing any new games since 2013. They are a game company that hasnt made a game since the year the first Tomb Raider reboot and Bioshock Infinite were released, and theyre still making an absolutely profane amount of money.The multiplayer is completely unchecked, with hackers running wild in around half of all playsessions. The single player content hasnt seen any support or expansion since the year it was released, the same year Call of Duty Ghosts and Dota 2 came out. The game is still unoptimized as hell, suffering from performance problems at above the recommended spec. The online support is a beaurocratic nightmare, taking weeks or months to respond to basic inquiries. Rockstar basically spends next to no money or effort on this game or its upkeep.So all this being said, why in the absolute nuttering shite is this game still 60?
