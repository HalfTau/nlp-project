Remember that time they pulled this game from Steam during a summer sale, then relisted it at a higher price so they could still sell the game at full price? Well, I do.It seems theyre going back to their roots of scummy, anticonsumer buisness practices and have taken a strong antimodding policy, threatening to literally sue anyone who dare test them.Get ed, buy this onif you have to, that way Rockstar and take two wont see a dime.
