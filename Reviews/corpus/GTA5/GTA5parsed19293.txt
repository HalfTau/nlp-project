GTA 5 singleplayer Fun, decent story, nice graphics, well optimized.As a car guy the thing I liked the most was that the cars had good handling, well balanced car specs. Interesting different differetials  AWD, RWD, FWD with different power distributions like 30 front 70 back and so on. It was a little annoying that there are many rwd cars but non of them can be drifted. After using the handbrake seems like the car goes from 200hp to 50hp. But yea the most interesting part of the game seemed to be the cars for me.Some things are still really unrealistic like killing a npc with a gun what has a silencer, nobody sees or hears it but u r still getting cops on you. So.. messing with the npcs like a silent murderer doesnt really work.GTA onlineHackers and cheaters everywhere,  you up what ever you do. Even when you are a legit player and some idiot hacker uses his hacks on you, makes you fly or gives you 10k money, you will get banned and rockstar will say it is still your own fault.  The updates have added so many ed up weapon and machines that freeroaming isnt an option anymore. There are like 1020 different machines what can  you up. Only way to freeroam is to be 99 of the time in passive what makes it boring cuz u cant kill npcs and cops. Community is SH!T full of 12year olds cancer, support is even worse giving zero s when you got banned cuz of a hacker who used his hacks on you.The only place where I was able to find normal ppl was races and stunt series where some ppl were very kind and respected you when u were one of the clean drivers, not ramming on purpose and so on.I recommend it only when you are going to play it with your friends 3 friends  you. Doing heists and races together, exploring the map and doing some weirdchallanges together, sumo, bike stunt in freeroam and whatever else.Playing it alone full AIDS.PS. I have 2 accounts, one is lvl 130 and the other is 250 having a total of about 1000hr of gameplay so... I kind a know what im talking about. xd
