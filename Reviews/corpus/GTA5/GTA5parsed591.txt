This game is awesome, story is amazing, car customing is just great! I loved every minute of playing this game then i came to online... For the first couple of hours, it was great.. but then its just making money the same way and it will get boring more and more, servers full of cheaters so u cant find new people to play with .. but at the end its fun when u got friends to play with! just driving a car around Los Santos and looking on that great scenery, just something amazing! So yes, i recommend this game!
