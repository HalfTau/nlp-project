I play GTA V solely for the singleplayer. I never touched the multiplayer and probably never will. Besides if GTA San Andreas had thought us anything about the GTA series its one thing SINGLE.PLAYER.MODDING.As soon as I finished the single player story missions I grabbed the craziest mods available and off I go to  wild blue yonder of madness.
