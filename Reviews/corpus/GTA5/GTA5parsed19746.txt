This game appears to be getting raked through the mud due to the abhorrent pricing on Shark Cards. Games fun and all, but that just wont slide. Best recommendation is to fight with your wallet. Dont buy Shark cards, because so long as they get a sizeable revenue at the end of the day, their actions wont change. We as the community have to make the difference, otherwise the company wont lift a finger.
