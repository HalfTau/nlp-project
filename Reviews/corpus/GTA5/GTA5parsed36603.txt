Single Player is great, i keep getting this Online glitch that is deleting my ammo including ammo for guns held in my office firework launcher contacted r support lets see if this will be fixedEdit rockstar gave me the money back for my ammo but lost firework ammo which you can only get in special events. and still sometimes ill check my weapons and ill have 0 ammo on rifles or something so now i just walk around with about 2k bullets instead of maxed out like i want to.And i also feel like the game has become pay to win everytime i get into a battle with someone they will spawn all types of crazy armored stuff and make it very difficult for me to kill them i dont have any of that stuff and ive been grinding for hours currently level 111 and have only made around 20mil in my lifetime everything just costs crazy amounts of money and if you dont have any friends like me its almost impossible to make good money quickly
