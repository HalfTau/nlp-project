Well the single player experience is unmatched, especially with graphics mods and other mods that you can choose to your liking. A ton of fun to mess about and explore.The Online is great only if you have people to play with, and not worry about the whole aspect of money and xp grinding. You can find these groups online, and a lot of them are very friendly and genuine people. With friends, you can mess around in free roam, setting up your own games, or play one of the many gamemodes/missions that no one plays anymore, or make your own gamemode and objectives. How Online is meant to be played is to make you pay, but you can avoid that.However, I dont want to recommend this game given the questionable direction the game has taked since release, which is probably well elaborated in other reviews. The Online isnt just for fun, its for them to earn money, but you can still mess around with friends in a pretty fun fashion.
