Actually what in gods name is rockstar doing. What they are doing to this amazing game is making me ing sick. Rockstar before this game always had integrity and was never looking to keep there hands digging deeper into your pockets. Now, theyre going down the EA/Konami/activision releasing free dlcs that arent actually free becasue to acutually use ANYTHING in it you need an exhorbanant amount of online currency which can only be attained through hours of grinding or buying shark cards. And its not getting any easier or at least more entertaining to grind either because it keeps getting harder and harder to make any money in the game and the prices for things keep going up. Not only are they using this sketchy bussiness tactic to drain your bank account now they decided to ban modifications that dont affect multiplayer... like seriously  you rockstar, I had so much respect for this company before this god damned game. Please if your considering buying this game, dont. Go buy a used copy or from a friend so they cant make any more money that they dont deserve and dont dare consider playing gta online or as I like to call it  you give me money simulator.
