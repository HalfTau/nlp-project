I dont use mods for GTA V, Im an online player that is sick and tired of the hackers and cheaters. However removing mods from the singleplayer guys doesnt fix our online issue and is just a  you to the singleplayer guys and Open4.You ed up TakeTwo, you should fix this. You have a great game and a nice legacy with Rock and your releases. I have  stopped playing your game and will not spend any more money until you do the right thing.Dont become an EA.
