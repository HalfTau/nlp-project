Decent story mode, though Id already beat it in the 360 version.Dont bother buying if you dont have an army of people that have already bought it and they all want to play online simultaneously, because theres absolutely all to do in multiplayer, people with hacked clients all over the place and a huge enphasis on trying to get you to buy ingame currency which is just ludicrous.Hope you like microtransactions and no mods.
