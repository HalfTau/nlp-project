I mostly play the online portion of the game but when they started banning people for cheating i was fine with it because you shouldnt cheat BUT a modder gave me money and levels without my consent and i was banned for 30 days and both of my characters were deleted and I am A lot of the money and levels were modded but I had reached level 60 on my own and had a good 500k on my own which isnt a ton but still it took time.
