Take 2 sickens me with their unabashed money grab in GTA Online. I get that they are a business and the bottom line is important, but its sad that they sacrifice a  beautifully crafted single player experience for  the fun for a bit but  impersonal free for all of GTA Online. Whats worse is that they then try to bleed you dry with microtransactions. They artificially inflate GTA onlines success by making all new content exclusive to online so you have to go online to try new cars or missions. They are parasites. Now they deal out yet another FYou to their hosts, I mean fans by trying to shut down the Mod community. SCREW YOU TAKE 2!!! You have ripped the heart out of GTA.
