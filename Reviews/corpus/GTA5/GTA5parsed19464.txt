Single Player is fun, so maybe buy it if you want to do that.  ON SALEI do NOT recommend buying this game for Online, the entire game is based on trying toyou off to the point that youre forced to buy Shark cards.  I have no idea why i play this game literally.  lol, and Im in a crew where we control the servers and dont let anyone else join.  All you do is buy things to make money, to make more money..  Or go Grief people who just spent 8 hours to try to make 400k where you can destroy it in 5 seconds.  So if you enjoyoff people this game may be for you.Or if you enjoy a boring, Endless grind that has no real purpose.Dont even get me started for regular pubs dealing with griefers, Hackers, Modders etc.Or the CONSTANT diconnects and horrible netcode.
