I dont usually write reviews, but when I do, its because I believe I have good reason too.Do not buy this. Mods are what make PC gaming. Show your support for the free mod community by writing a negative review and/or signing one of the many petitions against this practice.GTA V is a great game, but what made it excellent was the mod community. I would play LSPDFR all the time, but now that way I used to play is under threat.Dont buy this game or any game that shows such anticonsumer practices!
