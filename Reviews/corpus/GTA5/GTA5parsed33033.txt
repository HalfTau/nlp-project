You go and have massive ban waves on this game, remove all of my items and money, even when modders are at fault so I said screw multiplayer ill just have fun with crazy singleplayer mods tsunami being my favorite, and now you remove those because of your precious profit margins that arent even affected. What happened to you rockstar you used to be cool.
