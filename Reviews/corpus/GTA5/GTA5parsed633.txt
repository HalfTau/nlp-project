Good playable single player game with limited achievments once completed.Online play is interesting , like others have said there is alot of hackers and modders ruining the online experience but i have input a fair few hours into online play and there are always lobbys that you can find with genuine people in there looking for heists and missions.The bottom line is online play is slow to start with being lower levels but gets alot better the more you play.Good game , Good graphics what more u need just dont waste ur money on shark cards , grind out the  and you will have fun.
