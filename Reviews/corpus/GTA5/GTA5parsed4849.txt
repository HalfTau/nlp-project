In singleplayer, theres not much to do after the game is done apart from trying out mods.However, multiplayer, if you get enough friends together in a closed session, can be an awesome experience.Its very hard to make money efficiently, so if its hard, keep on going, dont buy into the microtransactions. Play heists with friends and save up any profits.I strongly recommend getting this if many of your friends have it or want to get it soon, because all you need to do to have fun with your friends is to annoy them and itll very quickly turn to mayhem.
