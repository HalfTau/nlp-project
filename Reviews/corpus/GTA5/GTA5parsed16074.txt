I wish there was a neutral rating on steam because GTAV was actually a very enjoyable game in story mode. The graphics were stunning, which complimented the epic action scenes and stunning environments of the game. Combat is simple but not easy. The AI is still dumb as hell, but what can you do? The story is amazing and put together really well. The voice acting is sharp and its clear that a lot of time and effort was put into each scene. As usual, driving the plethora of vehicles is very fun, however the flight controls can take a while to get used to.All of this is only half of the game. The other half is GTA Online.Its not fun. All of the OTT action and humor that made GTAs story amazing is lost in the multiplayer. Its riddled with hackers and the lag is appaling. Money is very difficult to obtain. The easiest way to make some cash is by doing hiests. However, due to the rather toxic community, working with randoms can be a choir, and trying to get in the same lobby as your friends is even more of a choir.Overall, get GTA on sale. Whilst the story is great and you can sink a lot of time into it, the lack luster online mode and the lack of any new single player content leaves much to be desired from GTAV. For now Ill recommend it, but only for the story mode.P.S There are microtransactions to get cash in the online mode. Thanks Rockstar. Just what we needed /
