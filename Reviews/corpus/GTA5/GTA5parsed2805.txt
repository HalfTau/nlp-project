Grand Theft Auto 5ProsExtraordinary single player Campaign.Amazing online career mode.Brilliant graphics.MixedMost of the time a great community to make new friends.Most things are overpriced.ConsModding is out of control.There are plenty of trollers to make you upset.Excessive unneeded swearing.ConclusionThis is absolutely one of my favorite games of all time. IAfter beating single player there is still so much to do online!There is practically two different story modes. Its also a veryfun experience to voice chat with friends while playing.
