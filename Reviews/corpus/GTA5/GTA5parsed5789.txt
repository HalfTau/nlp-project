I really liked GTA, it was a fun game dispite the grinding but now everything has become too much of a grind to actually have fun. Everything that is being added to the game is so expensive that you cant make enough money to get what you want without spending actual money on shark cards to get in game money. In short Rockstar have gotten greedy and addopted a dont give aabout our fan base additude and turned the game into a scam, some of the things require around 3 million might have changed, i havent played in a while and for 100 dollars you can get 8 million. I understand some people will try to deny what i have said here, but this is how i feel about the game now. PS its riddled with hackers and bans even for those who play legit  griefers who just want to ruin the fun for everyone else. This game is dying and Rockstar is letting it happen.
