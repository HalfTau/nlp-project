Gameplay wise its like every other GTA, if you played one youved played them all. Literally nothing new.The singleplayer is filled the the brim with unlikeable characters who are all ingfor the sake of it. Cant get invested into the story.Multiplayer is bare bones. Hardly anything to do. You can see all there is to it in an afternoon.Speaking of multiplayer, did you expect for grinding to be a big part of GTA? No? Well thats thanks to the company wanting money, the online portion of the game had inflation, EVERYTHING rose dramatically in price over time for no reason besides to push this disgustingly scummy practice of selling ingame money for real money. This didnt just effect end game vehicals or housing, it effected basic equipment to do missions with.Recently Take Two decided that players can no longer mod their single player game because of their ing mental gymnastics of saying it would effect the multiplayer side of it, despite large counter meassures in the modding client to stop just that.So instead of getting a better anticheat method, better admins, which Ive had friends permabanned with no appeal for just being in a server where someone was cheating and admins just carpet bombed everyone in the server with permabans. They just decide to shut down modding.This is all disgusting practice by themselves but then you can easily piece togther that theyre directly relateded.tldr Fans cant mod their ing singleplayer games because of the companys mental gymnastics it means that some rando who plays multiplayer is gonna cheat, so he can cheat in FAKE IN GAME MONEY so that he can buy BASIC ING EQUIPMENT because the multiplayer had massive inflation to try to force players to buy ing in game money with real money.
