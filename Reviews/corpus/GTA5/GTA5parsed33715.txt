Dont release any singleplayercontent cuz they want to focus on multiplayer and grap money from 13yr old boys so they can buy cool cars. The players release singleplayercontent themself. Rockstar likes this but Taketwo doesnt.Taketwo bans the TOOL for modding, and therefore lots of mods.Taketwo owns Rockstar btw.The game is good, and even better with mods. But eat dirt Taketwo
