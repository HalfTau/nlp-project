Garbage, constantly crashing. Online is nothing but a joke, no actual career modes, youre stuck playing missions constantly with other people even if you selected to play in a private session. I was legit killed within my first 10 seconds in game before I could even do anything. Money seems to take way too long to earn to be able to do anything. Average race is about 5k, cheapest apartment 420k, so thats roughly 85 races to be able to buy an apartment... Not even counting a bunker at 2m. Awful.
