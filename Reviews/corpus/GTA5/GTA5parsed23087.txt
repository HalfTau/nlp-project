Pretty much after years of mods being a part of the game TakeTwo decided to cease and desist OpenIV developers whose program allowed you to run modsEdit After reinstalling this game I decided I would give it another shot. Unfortunately what follows are tales of woe my friend.ProsIts a well made game and I enjoyed it for the time I had with it.Consr u fuccn kidding me with the goddamn microtransactionsIts like 30 to buy dlc in game money to get me ahead of where I currently am online.I get called in game while playing online constantly. Some calls I have the option to hang up while others. Specifically the ones for whatever new dlc came out where they want you to purchase a forclosed hangar for like 2 million. The problem is that it feels like Im constanly pressured to purchase the property and I cant devote the time into the game. If you have time and money then come sit on ur bigand playThere is always one hacker in the server.I paid 30 already not mention I have also purchased this game on console twice at the full retail value. This is me just being stupid and not devoting myself to one device.Basically what it comes down to is that the game is big af but it runs slow as hell the matchmaking is Ive ran it on an SSD and it still didnt run well. The amount of money you make compared to the amount of time you need to devote into it.I enjoy playing multiplayer games but I dont want this kind of social aspect. You need to have friends to play with to make a lot of money but I dont have those options.TLDR TIMESINK CRAPSHOOT MICROTRANSACTION HELL WITH GOOD GAME MECHANICS
