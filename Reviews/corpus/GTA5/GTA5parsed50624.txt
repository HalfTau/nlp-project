My Library says I have 16.6hrs in the past 2 weeks of playing.... all that is, is LSPDFR on SP only... I guess thatll turn into 0 for the rest of my life since I cant really play MP anyway in which I really dont mind since I had SP to play almost everyday... Hence the offline thing there...I got permo banned from GTA Online so why would this even pretain to me I never hurt anyone playing offline nor did anyone else.The reason I got banned was because a mod menu I had downloaded was coded to ban people in other words it was coded to by default to give everyone on the server money without the modders knowledge it was stupid on my part yes... But I had no idea I was doing it.. I have friends that were still modding until the day it became illegal  I was right there with them modding very carefully online like spawning a custom cop car driving it around  actually doing our work to earn things  never harming anyone else Rockstar didnt seem to mind... I wish that I never downloaded something that was not known in our community just for it to get me permo banned..Anyway SP is now boring as ever since it is illegal in real life to mod a life that is offline by yourself away from everyone..you get the picture right you know what TAKE 2 DID!!!Goodbye to A great game  great mod community...Peace
