Why do people keep complaining about the multiplayer? The best part of every rockstar game I have played is the singleplayer. That is obviously where the production went. But now everyone spams the game with negative reviews despite hundreds of hours on the game because mods were removed. They are struggling to fix the games cheaters and that was there attempt at getting rid of them. It was a bad idea and so are the microtransactions. But the base game is amazing. The singleplayer alone is worth 60 and is a masterpiece filled with interesting characters,fun missions, and great gameplay.Dont buy for the mp it is full hackers and halfupdates that add nothing to the game other than weird cars and new ways to grind. They must have like 3 people working on this game right now and are focused on RDR2.
