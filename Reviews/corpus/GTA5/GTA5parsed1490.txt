Awesome single player! One of the best i ever have played.But idk about multiplayer, it has become so unrealistic now because they have added so muchinto the online like the flying cars and more. Everyone that has those cars always come and blow you up for no reason. I wish they did single player dlc like they promised in 2013 but i guess shark cards changed their thought about single player dlcs.I also hate that everything is so expensive in online, like before clothes costed around some hundred dollars but now it costs around some thousand dollars. There are even clothes that costs over 50k. Thats just ed up.Buy it on sale its not worth the full 60 P
