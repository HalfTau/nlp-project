could they please come up with an update that keeps my computer from buffering and lagging all the time. i love this game but i cant play it on my huellet packard. it sucks that you have to have a beafy computer to play it. i like how they pay a lot of attention to the events and things like that to keep us intertained but i hate when i lag while aiming at the target and then missing the shot
