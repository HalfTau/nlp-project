Since GTA Online theyve become increasingly antigamer.  Hell an FOV mod that made the game playable in first person a while back was dismantled.  One of the reasons I stopped playing as riding around on a motorcycle with a comfortable FOV was one of my little joys in this world. Now they go after independent modders? Yea if you havnt purchased this game dont, the rest of us already wasted our money making it a success.  I feel shameful for contributing to that...
