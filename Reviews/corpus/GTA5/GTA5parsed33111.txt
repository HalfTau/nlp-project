First, I couldnt even get the damn game to work on my PC due to this game being unoptimized trash. How i even managed to get 200 hours in this unoptimized trash shocks me. When I did for a short period of time, progressing in GTA online is a  of a grind, and not a fun one to say the least because playing with randoms isnt fun in this game. And to add insult to injury, now with TakeTwos cokehead executives going against mods now, whats the point in going back now?
