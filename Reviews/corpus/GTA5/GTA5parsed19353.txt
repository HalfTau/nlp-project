GTA 5 has one of the best storylines of all time, no doubt. Its even more to fun to play single player on PC. I would reccommend this game if ONLINE wasnt so terrible. There are too many hackers and modders that make it so unplayable. It has just gone down hill since its release. I hope that GTA SIX will have a better online world and it would be better montitored. The unessecary bans to innoncent people have gotten way out of hand! Rockstar what are you doing?? Oh and dont get me started over the expensive shark cards...
