This game is really incredible. The story is really really good but I believe that the online section of the game is where the real treasure is. It is a really fun and interesting world to explore and progress in the game.HOWEVER this is one problem with the online part of the game which is how Grindy it is. The amount of times that you have to wait in lobbies for a car race to get the first 50k is so annoying. it gets even worse later in the game when you realize how hard it is to get anythingeven with this the game is still really incredible and I would reccommend it to anyone who is considering the game
