With a large highly detailed world and a large selection vehicles. GTA has much to do. Play it for the campaign ONLY.Online Mode is a complete mess. Full of Hackers/Modders that will go out of thier way to break your game and the PVP is very unbalanced.You will have a very hard time as a new player.
