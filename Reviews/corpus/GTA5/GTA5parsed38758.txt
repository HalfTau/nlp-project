I used to like this game. I would mostly play singleplayer with mods, but sometimes I would play Online. Now Im not going to touch this game again. Take Two, the parent company of Rockstar Games, has shut down OpenIV. Without OpenIV, you cant mod the game. The game is worthless to me now. If they give up this stance, Ill bring back the positive review.EDITApparently they retracted the statement or something. As I promised, here is the positive rating.
