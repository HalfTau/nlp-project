Anticonsumer and antimodding policies. TakeTwo shut down Open IV as part of the ongoing issues with cheating in the game cheating that primarly harms their ability to sell overpriced microtransaction ingame currency.They have previously banned users who were affected by cheaters when they themselves have not cheated, and have no regard for those who have paid to play the game.Instead of working with the modding community they opted to openly and actively work against their customer and fan base.
