Single player is fine, but lets be honest, who cares about that? You wanna know what the multiplayer GTA5Online is like, right?Grab some popcorn...Pay to win, in public lobbies full of trolls and hackers, in an online mode that is unforgiving to people that dont have friends, with fun sandbox stuff that is locked behing boring missions and paywalls, with glitchy mechanics, and slow servers.Sure Ill recommend this...to Youtube content creators with tones of money and fellow YTFriends to play with.Basically, the 2 of the gaming populus.Ill wait until they release GTA6Online, and this gets WAY better player hosted servers...2025 anyone?
