I bought this game 3 times on console, loved it so much I bought it a 4th time on PC with the hopes of playing multiplayer and once and a while modding the game in my singleplayer world. Well Rock ruined the multiplayer by making everything astronomicly expensive and turning this game into a pay to win. I have never bought a shark card and I never will becuase I have given this company 240 of my dollars. And Now take 2 screwed me out of the only other part of the game i enjoyed after beating the campain 4 times. The take 2 anti modding policy is terrible, I paid for the game I should be able to do as I please with it. Ill never pay for another take2/rock game again, unless take 2 fixes the mistake they have made... If they can at this point.
