I bought this game for the mods and the single player. Now Take Two has made modding illegal in all but name.Open IV was a mod that only worked on single player so no it didnt bring in the hackers that allowed you to do everything from change cars to make little missions. It was amazing. I got to do everything from be an actual cop to replaying the first Fast N Furious movies.Now its all gone and I dont get a refund. Im either stuck with a bland singleplayer or a broken multiplayer. If you like modding do not buy this peice ofgame. Arma 3, Gmod, and the Bethesda/Obsidian games are all better for modding and single player fun. This game is dead.
