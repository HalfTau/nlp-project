Ill start off by saying this. Single player is amazing and Id recommend it if youre looking for that and only that!Now, because the single player mode is limited with what you can do because, lets face it, going online will give you more options to play more of the game, I would not recommend the game at all. Its not fun.If you go online and play with the public, its likely someone is cheating and ruins the game play. Now, you have the option of going into an online area on your own or with your friends... and thats really great  until you decide you want to go into a mission and it will automatically pop you back into the public area, and not necessarily with the party you started with.
