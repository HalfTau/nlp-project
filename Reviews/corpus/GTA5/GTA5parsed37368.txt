Horrible and unethical publisher/developer. They are currently trying to shut down modding to the single player game and prevented multiplayer modes separate to their built in online. Oh, and the problem in online with cheaters mostly comes from the fact that they dont have a place for those kinds of players meaning private servers without character progression so they can have fun with their friends or other players that like to mess around.
