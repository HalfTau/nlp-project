People mod because people dont like being robbed for their money, devs rip single player content out and place it in multiplayer, they release DLC and the DLC content cost 50million and up ingame. Of course you cannot have the spirit to grind for this so you look into buying 8million ingame cash for 100 real life cash, its criminal. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR MP.
