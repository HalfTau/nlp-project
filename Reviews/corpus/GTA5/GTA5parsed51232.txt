Its a great game, as long as you stay away from OnlineBut the fact that most of the games content is locked behind the Online wall, is extremely disturbing.So if anyones interested in buying it for the Story mode, either buy it with 70 discount, or pirate it for free.There are no updates for Story mode anyway, and 70 of it, is Online only content.
