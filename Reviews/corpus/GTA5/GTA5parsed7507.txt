Depending on what computer you have this computer may or may not be the game for you. Most people in todays markets cant purchase a computer that can support high res games while having other games downloaded onto the same computer. Me personally I have a regular computer you could get from Walmart. Now this game is so bad that I have to play it on 700 x 900960... Somewhere around there. It is just pathetic that the screen has to be so small... If you have a cheap cpu, dont purchase. 700 x 900960  cpu
