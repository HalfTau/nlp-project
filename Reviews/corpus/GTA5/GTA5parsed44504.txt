Dont buy this! A completegame. Rockstar steal ur money from ur online bank accounts, that u have payed hundreds of euros on insanly overpriced shark cards on, just because ur a innocent receiver of some modded cash u never asked for. Complaining to their  suppport, u only get some links in return, that shud only be given to cheaters! AND the online gameplay is total crap, set up in favor of griefers and modders, just lookin to destroy the game for others. Rockstar is some greedy ers, who dont care about their playerbase.. ONLY about making money. I will never ever touch a Rockstar/take two game again! In addition to this, they have now decided to remove the modding tool, wich make it a nogo of the planes of bringing Liberty City to GTA5, wich was the only good thing that cud happen to this game.
