So, I know R are suing OpenIV or something like that, if that stops, thats gonna suck a fat one.Other than that, this game has impecably good graphics, and the gameplay is awesome, the story flows wellm but the only problem is when it comes to online, the ammount of little hacker 9yearolds gets extreme. But oh well, I guess we have FiveM for that LOL.
