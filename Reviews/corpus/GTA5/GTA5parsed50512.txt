Do not buy this game until Take Two Interactive removes their CD against OpenIV, one of the most important projects in single player modding. Selling you the game isnt enough. They want you to BUY SHARK CARDS FOR MONEY IN GTAONLINE, which lets be honest isnt rewarding in the slightest. If you want people to play online actually make the game engaging. Dont just make everything really expencive and encourage people to spend money on  micro transactions. GTAO is a dumpster fire, dont give in to their t.
