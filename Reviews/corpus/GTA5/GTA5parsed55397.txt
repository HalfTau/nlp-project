Today is a sad day. Take Two Interactive, the parent company of Rockstar and 2K Games has taken legal action against OpenIV. OpenIV was a powerful modding tool for GTA IV/V Singleplayer that allowed creators to create third party content for the game, from 4k retextures, new vehicles, NPCs and ofcourse there were many bizzare creations out there as well. All of it gone. GTA Online is, always was and will continue to be plauged with cheaters. This doesto stop this. If you were planning on getting GTA V for its singleplayer then know that the creative potential for this game has been almost completely stripped away. There are a few mods out there that dont use OpenIV, however that is likely subject to change. If you were planning on playing GTA Online then bring friends and get it on sale, with about 1360 hrs and counting  I can say with certanty that it will take you a long time to progress in GTA Online, especially if youre on your own.
