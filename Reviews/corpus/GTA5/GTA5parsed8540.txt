Amazing singleplayer game. Gameplay, story, characters, voice acting, graphics, animations, sound effects, music, first person perspective camera, preparing and executing heists, everything was fantastic. The only thing I didnt like was not working mirrors in cars, which would be helpful in driving in fpp. Overall very good experience.
