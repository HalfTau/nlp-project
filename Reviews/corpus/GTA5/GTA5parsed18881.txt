Overall impression A total blast, even if it plays to my darker desires.StatsVoiceacting/Sound 10/10Story 10/10Gameplay 10/10Adventure 10/10Graphics 10/10.Objective View Expansive Southern California world with more quests, tasks, and activities than most games ever created. Requires a Rockstar account for some reason, the Steam DRM is evidently insufficient. Even with great bandwidth this takes forever to download and/or update.Subjective View Great character development, awesome gameplay. Awful lot of push to play online for some reason...
