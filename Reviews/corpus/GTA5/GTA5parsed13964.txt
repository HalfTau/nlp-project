There was a time when I loved this game more than any other. So much has changed since then.Beyond the fact that I have been unable to log in since late August Its now mid OCtober when I could get on, the hacking and modding was a nightmare. My crew and I often needed to use Net Limiter to try and keep the s away, but after awhile even that didnt work. You cannot enjoy the addons because people would rather screw up your business rather than build their own. I recommend this game to you, the , who loves to do nothing more than ruin everyone elses day. I recommend this game to you, you masochists, who love nothing more than to be hacked countless times, and you, you sadists, who love to give the masochists exactly what they want. Someday, I might actually get online again if the impotent tech support can ever get their nose out of the teir 1 support guide book where they copy and paste everything into the email they send you. Until then, take my advice, and spend your hard earned money elsewhere. This one is NOT worth the aggrivation.Love and Enemas to Rockstar
