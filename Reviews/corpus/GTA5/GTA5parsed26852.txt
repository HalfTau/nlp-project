Very good and entertaining game, and especially fun to play with friends.On the other side though, everything in gta online FREAKING OVERPRICED and it feel like all that Rockstar wants is for you to buy their equally overpriced shark cards...The last thing that I want to mention is Rockstars fked up online servers. I have been having huge problems with gta online servers and cant even join my friends any more. After hours seaching for hours to try to find a solution on internet, I am finding thousands of other people complaining about the same issues, and rockstar just ignores it...Until this is fixed, I am sadly unable to give this game a positive rating
