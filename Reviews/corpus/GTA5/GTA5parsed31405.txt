Rockstar and TakeTwo, what have you done ?! the modding aspect of your games has always been huge, ever since GTA 3, just look up websites like GTAinside or GTA4Mods to see how ing huge the modding community is... you betrayed your fans and lost some of my respect towards you. Right now, you guys only look like greedy s who wants money through microtransaction. I get that online modding is something wrong, but singleplayer modding ?! man that is where the fun is at, especially since you guys cant stop chocking yourselves on the money you make through GTA Online and release a goddamn singleplayer DLC...Im done here, hope R sees how bad of a decision this was, the community unite, WE WANT OUR MODS BACK
