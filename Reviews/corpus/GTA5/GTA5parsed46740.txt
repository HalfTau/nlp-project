Just.... Take 2 interactive man. Seriously. They sit on their hands for years and let themodding scene grow, just to then take legal action against it in a shambling desperate attempt to feel powerful. You think you can just do that with no backlash? The community willthat crap. Enjoy the reviews guys, I just hope you dont drag Rockstar into the dirt with you.
