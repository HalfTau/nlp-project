WORST PURCHASE IVE EVER MADEI remember when GTA had a dark story and how you had to build your own crime empire to make money. But now its a ing playground for kids full of comic relief characters and of course SHARK CARDS! Which doesnt give you neeeeeeeeeeeeearly enough money to buy anything for a 100 of REAL money.The singleplayer is pretty good but gets boring without mods, and the online is just a ing grinding simulator.Also the servers in online are filled with modders, connection errors bugs glitches. And the most unrealistic NPC AI.
