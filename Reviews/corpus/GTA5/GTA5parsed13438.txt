ALRIGHT I get it you are looking at these reviews to try and see if this game is worth it and overall due to the negative reviews you are steering against it. BUT dont let these fool you the game is very good. The singleplayer is phenomenal plenty of fun to have there if you dont want to do a bit of grind for money in multiplayer which brings me to my next topic.Multiplayer it is really unfortunate how many people ARE TOXIC . But it is ok as long as youu have like 26 friends playing you willl have fun regardless. If the multiplayer really isnt your style I would recomend single player but when you play always beat the game and play as much as you want THAN I would recomend downloading scripthook which is a mod menu for story only it is free and you cannot be banned it is just fun to do anything anytime and no ban like you would risk modding in multiplayerBut I guess folks thisll be the end of the review.
