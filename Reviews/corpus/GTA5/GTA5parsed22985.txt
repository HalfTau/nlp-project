The only reason Im buying this game is because its actually have large modding community and currently the best GTA game Rockstar has ever produced, I was heart broken when I heard that they banned modding and OpenIV, slightly relieved when they just recently unbanned them because of fan backlash, this left me speechless because this is the first time I aware that Rockstar/Take Two doesnt have a very friendly terms with the modding community and the majority of the GTA community as I thought they would be. From what I played, thats true of almost everyone said that this is the best and most realistic GTA game that Rockstar had produced, the content are very polished and you can spend a lot of time playing it, further more being the very better and improved succesor of GTASA and GTAIV, and the story telling and other new mechanics and features are absolutely great and refreshing. But the only reason I became addicted to the games is modding, Ive been playing GTA games with various mods since GTASA and GTAIV, various mods that change the script and models of the games for your personal pleasingalthough I prefer lore friendly mods so I dont go crazy on changing models. The mods personally Im using usually are mods that make game more realsitic, like Euhporia natural motion Overhaul Mod or NPCs of Lost Santos mod. Its not just an addition, its an extra polishment to the game that you always needs, the moding in PC games has been my thing for TES seriesEspecially Skyrim, L4D2, Half Life 2, Garrys mod and other Soucemods, it adds endless possibiity and endless more hours of addictive gameplay contributed by the creative and talented communities of gamming and modding thats why Steam created workshops for some games just for that reasonin fact some games are created because of the creativity of modding like Team Fortress 2 being the very succesion of a Quakes mod but thats another story. Anyway, GTAIV and GTASA being 2 the main foundation of GTAValso with other Rockstar games, GTASA being the concept and features while GTAIV sharing the Rage engine and features with additional original concepts that our latest GTA game itself excels combine into wonderful speciment of what we called Grand Theft Auto V, even better that GTASA, GTAIV and GTAV both having a very large modding communities and mods.As for GTAOnline, havent played it yet, so I cant make a review on it, Im not expecting anything from it though.
