I used to love this game for the mods... it allways added that replayability to the game without having to go online... But the greedy Take2 s ruined it when they made modding illegal, because there were some kids that were going on GTA Online with mods, and just ruin the experience for everyone else, and sometimes giving money showers to others. A large majority of players would only play the game for the offline branch, mostly because of FREE modding, because Rockstar Games will never make offline DLCs for the game, since their money earner is stricted to the Online mode...Take2 attacked what they suspected to be the core of the problem, wich was the absolute heart of the modding community, OpenIV, because they were lazy and just couldnt resolve their Online modders infestation in any other way, wich were hurting their Shark Card sales... even though they are already swimming in money right now, but Rockstar Games and Take2 dont give a flying  about their players, and so they are doing this in an attempt to force players to give up from the offline mode and enjoying mods, and go online, where the new content for the game is focused on, locked behind a massive grind... because all they want is sell, sell and sell Shark Cards...And now they ed themselves over with thatmove... wich resulted in this beautiful backlash, because OpenIV is an OFFLINE MOD TOOL AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ONLINE SCRIPTS!!! So well done Take2...
