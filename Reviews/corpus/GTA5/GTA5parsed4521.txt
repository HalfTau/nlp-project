Great Game, nice rich story and lets you do what any game of this type will let you do. RS needs to shift more focus to story  DLC for Casual Folks. way too much focus to this online gig of theirs with a severally broken system for online,  too many planes flying without any mechanics of flight, like a WoW flying mount. and trucks like Golioth from Knight Rider that cant be blown up. Recommended for the Story mode and some certain parts of the online experience but free mode in online it is hard.. best to do story mode on that one.
