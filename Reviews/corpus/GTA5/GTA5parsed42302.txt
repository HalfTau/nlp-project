Modding is now illegal... After 16 years og GTA games where modding was a huge bonus with the awesome games Rockstar makes, they now choose that an almost decade year old modding tool which is GTA Online friendly, doesnt interfear with the GTA Online experience is now banned for an unknown reason. Dont buy GTA V or any other TakeTwo interactive titles before this is resolved MORALLY...If you are wondering what games are owned by TakeTwo interactive check their website and keep a look out for those games. Dont buy them.
