Its a great game for a reason, especially if you have friends. The campaign is long and good filled with memorable characters and moments with lots of gameplay to do. Plus the multiplayer is constantly changing. The only reason I didnt complete it is because I had no friends to play it with. Still, a must play game for everyone.
