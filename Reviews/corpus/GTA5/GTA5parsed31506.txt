Grand Theft Auto V is one of the top bestselling games of all time. Yet, it got to the point were online is getting so milked, even the singleplayer mod tool gets a cease and desist letter because taketwo are afraid it might be used as a hacking tool online... Which, in fact, IS NOT the case with the modding tool Open IV. They even specifically states it isnt possible, and goes out their way to make sure that their version cannot affect the multiplayer. This does not stop the multiplayer hacking tools because they can still build their own versions of hacking tools.This is bad.
