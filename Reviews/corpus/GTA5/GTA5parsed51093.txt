Im not going to lie, Im laughing my butt off looking at over 22,000 people in the past 2 days gave this a bad review.Hell, I wasnt expecting this to happen this fast but I agree.. Take two doesnt care about us gamers. They care about the money. Dont buy anything from these scumbags thinking money is more important then people who go to a store with are time, here to buy a game that they helped make. Havent you made enough over a billion youve made and you are that greedy. Screw you T2, and screw you Rockstar for not fighting back.
