One of the best open world, sandbox games you will find, if not THEE best. However, the company seems to recognize this to a degree that is a bit sickening.If you shell out the  required to become OP on this game, then you will have fun to the point where you start missing work and require an addiction counselor at some point. Just the fact that you have to spend hundreds of IRL dollars to gain your power or be willing to put hundreds of hours in to get to that level  it creates an experience so depthy that it starts to infatuate.This game is so bittersweet it is the definition.ExampleBuy GTA 560Realize  its a bomb af open world experience, GTA 5, online, and is just unique and groundbreaking in concept.If you just stop there and find satisfaction, just stop, trust me  the rest is fckin brutality in a cycle.Buy 20 dollar shark/steam card to fund your experience, buy a house, a car, some guns, armor, other cool sht.Youve bought one or the other, and now suddenly realize you just spent 20 dollars on that 1 fckin thing, eitheryouve just bought a house with no cars in the garage, or a car with no garage to put it in, its mad expensive.So now, a bit annoyed, you decide to go pump another 20 in REAL QUICK and be done with it.Youre all setup with a car and a house, now its time to make some money without spending more real money!You go around and steal cars, do missions, etc... you play for 5 hours doing nothing but grinding and earn about 50150kYou suddenly realize that you just spent 5 hours earning roughly 12irl dollars.By this time real frustration kicks in, it is becoming obvious what they want you to do now. You research into it a little bit and realize that you need to be spending even more  to have the oppertunityyes, the oppertunity to have a shot at making more money doing special missions activated only by spending millions more.There is a crossroads at this point, if youve come this farwhich Im willing to wager a good portion of people whoown this game have put in 2050 dollars at least one time. you can either pump more  in, play as is, or justabandon.Example ends here  I chose to end here because there is a pattern in this game and ive laid it all out already, you can chose to insert a few different titles here and there and you will have the same pattern, but an entirely different portion of the game.
