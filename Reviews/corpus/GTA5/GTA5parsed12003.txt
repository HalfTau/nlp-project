Its Grand Theft Auto...Five! Need I say more....? But just in case you crawled from under a rock I will. I have GTA 5 on every platform except PS3. I love playing this game. It is definitely one of the best series every made. From the top down versions to the glorious, immersive, semiphotorealistic Los Santos. The game sold 800 million dollars in the 1st 24 hours and 1 Billion in the 1st 72 hours, and is one of the best selling video games of ALLTIME! And that was on 360 and ps3...I mean honestly though If you need to read a review to know what GTA is about and if you might wanna buy it, then you might not be a gamer...If you like amazing video games then the odds are that you will love it.
