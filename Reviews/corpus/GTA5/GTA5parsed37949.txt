I cannot recommend this game to anyone at this point. I dont foresee simple reviews having an impact on the TakeTwo decisions with how they impact players experience with their games. I do hope that these reviews will serve as a warning to those who are thinking of giving the support of their wallet to a company who cares little for what their player base thinks.The single player game is pretty decent, And most people buying this would be satisfied by just purchasing the game for that mode. However, modding adds to that experience and allows the community to turn an amazing game into something even better.The online mode for this game is not anything to write home about. I tried to play it off and on and could never get into it. However, The modding community that was impacted was not one that was even touching the online play. All I can see by TakeTwo shutting down the modding community on the single player mode is they are trying to shine the s on their multiplayer experience and suck as much money out of it as they can.Think twice before buying games coming from TakeTwo and supporting their choices in hurting players experience for the sake stearing their players to pay them for a crummy version of what the community can do better.
