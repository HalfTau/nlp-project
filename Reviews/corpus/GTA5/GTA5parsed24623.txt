Rockstar has recently decided that their playerbase is only good for their wallets.  Thats right, our beloved GTA developer is following the path of EA.  Adding microtransactions was one thing, but then they started banning innocent players from online while the hacker Aholes continue to run rampant.  The hacked money wouldnt even be a big deal if TakeTwo wasnt using the monetary system as a way of milking the players for those damn Shark cards.  Instead of trying to fix the mess theyve made WORSE, TakeTwo shot themselves in the foot with a nuke by attacking the modding community with the ceaseanddesist sent to Open IV, the tool made specifically for harmless SINGLEPLAYER mods.Do yourself a favor and dont let them take advantage of you with that shark card B.S.  If you want to enjoy GTA 5 and the singleplayer campaign is quite good, I reccomend just pirating it and installing the Iron Man mod.  Way more fun than the garbage online mode.
