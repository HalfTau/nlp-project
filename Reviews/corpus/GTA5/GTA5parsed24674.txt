Well, Ive changed my mind  this game is good if you dont mind GTA O, story mode is pretty good and immersive, alot of things to do.Edit Played a bit online as well, its more fun if you have 34 friends to play with you, makes your life easier. If not, you get a people who give up and bail if the mission fail once there by cancelling the whole heist, youd have to start it from the beginning.
