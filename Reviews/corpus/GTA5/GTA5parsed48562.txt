Started as a great game, the creators have slowly disabled features and user options and replaced them with paid options. Single player has been completely forgotten for a long time now in favor of pay to win online only content. Why would they take the time to make new vehicles that are completely inaccessible offline? Not only can you not access this content in single player AT ALL, but to use it in multiplayer you must buy game money with real life cash, as if this game being full price 2 years later wasnt enough.
