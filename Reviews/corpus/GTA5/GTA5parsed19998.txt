I myself enjoy the online gameplay, though the main issue is money making methods. Essentially, Rockstar forces the player to do two different methods to make money grinding missions or buying shark cards. By grinding missions, I essentially mean just doing missions repeatedly for hours on end. By the end of this you will have some money, though not much to purchase things. Simply, money is hard to get unless, which leads me to my next point, you purchase shark cards. Rockstar simply makes money hard to come by so that players purchase criminally expensive shark cards. If you purchase the most expensive shark card 100 USD for 8 million ingame money, it will only get you a few good vehicles. Simply, Rockstar is greedy, and I suggest you do not purchase those horrid cards and throw your money away.
