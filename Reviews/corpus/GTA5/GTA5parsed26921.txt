The company that produced this game does not encourage modding and puts down the community around it for any creative and fun alterations and fan made content. It used to be a good game, but ever since they started to just want nothing but more money about a year after its origional relise, it has become just a joke of a game I am sad to own on 3 platforms.... bummer gta 5 is dead, and now the future of gta 6 is dead to me even before release...
