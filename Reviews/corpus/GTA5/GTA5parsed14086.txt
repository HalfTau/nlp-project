Modders create economic inflation. They create chaos virtually in every activity you join  ruin public servers.Not all of them mod to mess with people but, so many people mod that you need a menu to play this game without getting bullied.R isnt going to do anything about it. Whats the point in releasing these new game modes/stunt races when someone with a menu will just teleport everyone into the ocean?
