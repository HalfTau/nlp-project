Hey Rockstar, we need less multiplayer modes and stuff, and more performance updates. The game is a bad enough port from PS4 and Xbox, do an update to fix the random stutters that happen for no reason. I go from 200 fps to 20 within seconds and shoot back to 200. also would be nice to look at grass without my gtx 1070 saying, nah fam, you dont need to look at this.. It just causes my FPS to bomb its self. Please do performance updates. Other wise too many online stuff that dont really make it fun, its still a good game.
