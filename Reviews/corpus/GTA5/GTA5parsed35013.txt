The Steam platform and with it, the entire Windows video game industry, is designed for games that allow modding and customization by their communities, so that even old games can still thrive and be played for years after the release, because of the hours of work modders put into them to make more content.If Take Two wants to make games like Apple makes iPhones, go ahead. But your profits will, year by year, decline. Thats inevitable. Grand Theft Auto is not a brand that will keep your bills paid forever.
