Multiplayer GTA5 online is so outrageously balanced for 4 players working together that i would never recomend playing by yourself. heists ceo work, motercycle clubs, gunrunning, and smuggling runs, expect the player to have 3 teamates, often giving 2 2 person vehichles, or 4 vehichles for missions or deliveries. having 1 player is often impossible, having 2 players leaves you volnerable, having 3 players leaves one player volnerable, but having 4 is well rounded. the game attempts to suppliment this by allowing you to recruit other players, but players will rarely join, and due to lack of communication, or them being on the opposite side of the map, they are often unable to do their job. there are a number of random freemode events that allow players to obtain money, however the payout is extreemly low for what they require. it would be better if the payout of these were at least 100,000 for delivering a breifcase, and 75,000, 50,000, 25,000 for first, second, and third place in events. another thing that would be nice is having some solo missions, that only require 1 person, and tweaking existing ceo/gunnrunning/smugglers run missons to work based on the number of players in the organization.
