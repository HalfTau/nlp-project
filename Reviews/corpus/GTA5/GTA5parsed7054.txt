Only started playing but love this game already. Campaign Single Player Online Multiplayer is also enjoyable but not always noob friendly and the starting grind can be quite difficult. The only other down sides are 2 things1 When you are a high level with LOTS of money out have nothing to do with it but waste it trolling low levels.2 Everything is now EXTREMELY expensive.Other than that the game is fairly enjoyable with hours of gameplay to offer.
