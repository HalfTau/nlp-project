TakeTwo the parent company of Rockstar Games have made mods illegal. They have completely shutdown the tool OpenIV which was used to install mods such as car mods etc. As a result of this TakeTwo have ruined the PC version as it was mainly used for mods. So if you wanted GTA V to mod singleplayer dont bother because you cant.
