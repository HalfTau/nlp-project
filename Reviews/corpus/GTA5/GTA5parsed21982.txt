Better buy shark cards for 45 than meeting some hacker online who gives you money with a minigun. He may steal money from you but if you ask nicely he may not let your game crash! /Im mixed about the game. The Story is nice and has something of GTASan Andreas  a unique touch BUT it seems more like a guide through this GTAVworld. Going from one place to another every 35 missions or so.I prefer GTAOnline for the Heists with friends. Other than that there are too many cheaters and its too grindycash cow hate etc..
