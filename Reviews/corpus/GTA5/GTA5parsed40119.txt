Take Two decided to take a massive sh!t on the modding community because they want to funnel people into online so that theyll buy microtransactions.GTA is not GTA without OpenIV, mods are what makes GTA great and targeting them because they want people to play online is disgusting. If you still want OpenIV you can pirate that sh!t.
