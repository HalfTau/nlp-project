Got banned from this just about a year ago, I wouldnt reccomend this at all, considering its now only hackers, if you want to play without hackers, if some of your friends have it, hop online and create a friendsonly lobby. Considering I got banned for no fair reason, but idling when there were hackers in the lobby giving me money, I never did wanna play this game again, and considering i was PERMABANNED due to thishappening 3 times, I never did play this again, I would like to give this game a chance again but Rockstar services are cucks, they make you rebuy the game if you do get banned.  Never modded or anything, just Rockstars cheat detection is
