This game can easily be compared to a rich spoiled kid that got everything they wanted, considering that this, in a lot of ways, was a step down from its predecessors. San Andreas and GTA 4 had much better story designs for the campaign and it was really fun to play, which was never dragged down from how realistic the game wanted to act like, however, GTA V tries its hardest to be good and realistic as possible, but it never had that much effort put in it to actually give it the GTA feel, it feels more like a game thats only good from its popularity and was fun for the first 100 hours I put into it.GTA online has to be the worst possible experience from any Grand Theft Auto game Ive ever played. Right from the start they force you to do a lot of really dumb missions in order to get any money at all, and if you arent playing with friends, then you have to learn everything basically by yourself. Playing with 90 of the strangers if a ing nightmare and Im even surprised some people can actually deal with the overwhelming amount of cheaters, trolls, micspammers, and people that are just trying to ruin the experience for the rest of the people. 50 of the lobbies Ive been in have consisted of at least 1 cheater, and someone flying in a jet thats almost impossible to destroy but they have homing missiles that can destroy any vehicle under 1,500,000 instantly. Along with this there are the VIP people that have a whole crew that mind their own business sometimes, but will gang up on people just for the sake of it. Doing missions and heists are the most frustrating. There have been people in my heist lobbies that will literally do the whole mission and leave at the last second, which STOPS THE ENTIRE HEIST TO RESET. Most of the devs have given up trying to add material that arent cars and more melee weapons that are extremely overpriced, not to mention that loading time of eons thatll make you wait, which is where I even got most of my hours from.If you have no friends, dont buy this game, go use it on something better.
