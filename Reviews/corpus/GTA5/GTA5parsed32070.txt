I used to play this game a lot, thats evident from the amount of hours I have in this game. Ive taken a break since January of 2017. Until I heard the news of OpenIV and TakeTwo. TakeTwo REALLY put the nail in their own coffin. The only reason why people still buy these older games from Rockstar is because people are making new content, breathing new life into their old games. Bringing more enjoyment to a iconic game. I can no longer recommend this game, or another future title from TakeTwo, until they fix the situation they caused and openly apologize to OpenIV group, their counsumer base, and Rockstar for making them clean up the mess they made.
