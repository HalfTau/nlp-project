This game is the aids of microtransactions. They wonder why everyone mods, why would anyone pay 100 for 8 million GTA dollars that can buy you only like 23 vehicles, when you could pay for a mod menu that costs 1520 and do whatever the hell you want?Lets say you drop 5 to get the 200,000 GTA dollars or even 10 on half a mil. What in the hell are you going to buy with that? Literally nothing is at that low of a price point in this game. This games economy is so ed up that Rockstar unintentionally created a whole 3rd party market outside of theirs for people to sell modded accounts. If you join a lobby literally 3/4ths of the players are modding/modded. This wouldnt have happened if Rockstar wasnt so goddamn stingy.
