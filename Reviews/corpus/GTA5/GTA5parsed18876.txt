GTA V is an open world sandbox game with a decent story mode, but a multiplayer experience that is a bit iffy.Story Mode/Singleplayer has a great story with the 3 protagonists you can play as and is moddable with thirdparty programs such as OpenIV, a modding tool which allows people to create player models, vehicles, and several other additions. Singleplayer alone is a good reason to get this game.Online is just a mess that makes you unsure if you either love it or hate it. Reasons to love it would be that its one of the best ways to play a sandbox game with friends, plus it has quite a few good gamemodes like deathmatches, races or jobs which are all enjoyable. Reasons to hate it is that its VERY grindy to get everything you want like supercars, weapons, owned property, literal fighter jets which are all above GTA1,000,000. Because its so grindy, players are encouraged to buy Shark Cards with actual money for ingame money. Around 55 in real money is 8,000,000 in GTA money, which is just SO fking greedy for Rockstar to do. Sure, you can get some sort of business to gain money, but even that is slow, boring and still grindy. Though, if you do want lots of money fast, doing heists when youre lv12 and have a highclass apartment is the way to go Alternatively, a challenge called Criminal Mastermind rewards you with 10 million IF you play all the heists with the same people and DONT DIE AT ALL.Overall, Singleplayer is great, Online is a mess, you decide if you want this. Im outt of here.
