Honestly, I can just remember how hyped I was for the release of this game. And it was awesome, really was. And, I played it way to much on my ps3 and ps4. I bought it for PC, and I dont know why. I just dont know how developers can be so fcking ignorant to what people say. The DLCs were okay sometimes, usually garbage, and when they did release, I had no money to buy anything. People argue, oh, you just have to grind it. I SHOULD NOT have to spend 3 whole days of game time in order to buy a fcking car online. And the shark cards, I mean do I even have to say it? If only Rockstar stayed a good company. Bethesda is following in the moneywhre mindset. Great time for games.
