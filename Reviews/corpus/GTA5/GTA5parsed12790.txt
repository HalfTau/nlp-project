Great game when it comes to the story which in my opinion is of blockbuster quality and many people agree with me, and I would recommend buying it on sale for that and only that.When it comes to GTA online, this thing has become a huge mess with the microtransactions and the random banning because of joining games with hackers. Since GTA online really is the biggest part of this game I cant recommend it. The optimisation isnt ideal either, though Ive never really had problems with my old R9 270x or my current GTX 1050 ti.
