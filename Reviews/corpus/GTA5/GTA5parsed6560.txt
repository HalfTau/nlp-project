The singleplayer is great, if you wanna buy it for that, its ok.GTA 5 Online is horrible, there are lots of Cheaters/Modders and they can get everything. The latest update makes you do missions in open lobbies with other people sounds fun and it is but there are too many cheaters and they have the best vehicles so, they can easily kill you.Rockstar is offering SharkCards and they are overpriced. DO NOT BUY THOSE. You will be paying so much money for that nonsense while cheaters unlock everything with modded cash without getting banned.If you can ignore the cheaters, the game is not that bad. AND if you want the best online experience, play this game as 4. Most of the missions require 4 people in total.
