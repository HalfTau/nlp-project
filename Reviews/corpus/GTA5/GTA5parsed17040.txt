EDIT People are down voting because the hate train is still ative huh? disgusting. Dont listen to the whiney babies, this game is amazing. Just dont play online mode.Now you may see alot of negative reviews about this game, but those mostly consist of reviewing Rockstars disgusting actions and online mode. This review will be focused only on single player, and as far as that goes...Its amazing. This game is one of the best Ive ever played. The amount of detail and hard work that Rockstar put into making this games world and characters is jaw dropping. The story was really good. I was honestly always a waiting my next play session, so I could continue with this story. The characters were really well thought out and really fun to watch them interact with eachother. I HIGHLY recommened this game if you want an action packed adventure with surprises at every corner. This one is now one of my favorites.9/10
