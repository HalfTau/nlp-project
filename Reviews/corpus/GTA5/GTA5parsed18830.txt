gta is a nice game to play with friends but you must have A LOT of patience because rockstar is garbage when it comes to treating the users.gta singleplayer is good, i dont remember that much because i played it in 2013 but the experience playing it was really nice about gta online, its complicated to tell economy is garbage, some of the features of the dlcs rockstar realeased are very good and interesting but sometimes it can let you down the fact that you have to already own or get so much money to purchase that stuff. or you can pay for the money but i dont think its worth it i play since 2013 and i still cant believe it takes so f long to load, i think almost half of my hours played were shift tab while waiting for game to load. money making gets so repetitive you have to exploit whatever is the most profitable way at the moment, at the beginning the missions were more fun, for example martins missions are good but not worth if you want to get cash. its really sad that rockstar is so into the money that they dont even try to hide it, some things are just unbelievable, like in the pacific standard finale they fixed the kuruma glitch 34 years later after it came out and now its the heli glitch that its even FASTER and SAFER, like... rockstar pls xdand the endless list of bugs this game has its just amazing, it can be fun and frustrating sometimes, but well they dont care that much i feel like its a battle between rockstar v users when it comes to bugs, glitchs, exploits, etc.. and i think people always trying to find this stuff bc what i said about economysome are good like the kuruma glitch when it was working, but there are some ones that are disgusting and they must be patched everytime like car duplication or things like that in MY experience, the community is not that badi can count with my fingers the times i saw cheatersmost of the people let you do your business, but when you resupply or sell stuff there is always the chance that there is one bored aole/low lvl that doesnt understand/autistic kid that comes and tries to destroy your stuff, but its a small if you wanna pvp in public sessions it can be so fun except you dont want to and you get in the middle of the warzone doing heists/missions solo it can be so frustrating because1 for setups you usually have to wait a long time to get people to join2 50/50 chance you get a low lvl joining and you wanna kick em bc in most cases you end regreting you started the mission with them3 people that dont understand how to do the mission and you have to coach them and they dont always listen4 selling stock from your business requires more than one vehicle most of the times so you need someone to help you or a calm/solo public session and you can be up to 30m doing the delivery.....but what makes me recommend this game to someone is that if you play with friends you can have a nice time and have so much fun with this game, but it makes me sad about the game decisions rockstar made, the online had much more potential..
