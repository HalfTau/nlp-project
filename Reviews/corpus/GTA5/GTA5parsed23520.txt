Online play is terrible.  Easy to beat, grindy, hostile community.  Youre no longer allowed to mod.  So the gameplay doesnt change at all now.  I personally am fine coming back here for the singleplayer story, but the need for me to relive it happens about once a year.  So replayablility is absolute zero to one percent.  GTA V Had a really great start...now were watching its end.
