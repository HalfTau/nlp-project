I think by now you already know whether you want the game or not. It isnt new to the market. Youve probably seen gameplay by now. Youre likely here to see if the game is as much fun as what you saw in the videos. The review is exclusively for GTA Online.If you have good friends to play it with then youre golden. Its a good sandbox. It has a lot of toys.The downsideThe load time terrible. Theres also the chance to get kicked into single play from GTA Online withoutany prompt, then you load again.Hackers are not uncommon, but its easy to change sessions.Acquiring anything worth having is a tireless slog, and ten minute drives to mission locations gets old.The menu UI is garbage.The time needed to max stats seems like an unnecessary gateway considering the amount of grinding needed naturally to acquire the interesting vehicles.
