First of all, the game is a masterpiece of the action genre. The storytelling is great, satirical and purely awesome. Flawless. The singleplayer campaign will have you spending hours and hours and always wanting more. This is the power of the grand theft auto franchise. The Online part of the gameis updated periodically. Sad thing is that the OpenIV tools cannot be used anymore for modding. Even though, I would still recommend the game, mostly for its singleplayer campaign.
