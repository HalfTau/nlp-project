I got GTA V during the Summer Sale, and I got sucked into it, as my playtime has shown. Its an amazing game with so many vehicles and now planes and just a game I can play with friends and just have a generally good time.Though, I cant recommend it.It sucks you in, and you still hate it, but you cant just stop playing it, its a daily grind where you just have to spend countless hours just to buy a plane youll never fly again.The fact that R has taken legitimate money from honest players is baffling, yet they dont remove my friends money after he got 30 mil, the day before the new update. Absolutely ridiculous.They ban modders because they make the game unfair and break the system. However, dont your shark cards that cost an insane amount of money do the same thing? Put the player at a disadvantage from other people who can afford to throw away thousands of dollars? No wonder theres a modder community, people have to earn money some way.I love this game, but I cant recommend the Online.If youre getting it for the Story Mode, be my guest, every mission except the Strangers and Freaks, they get old way too fast are action packed and different, and very enjoyable.
