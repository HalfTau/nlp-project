Grand theft auto and the developers of it must have the worst ideas on how to treat the community. The game shouldnt be called a sandbox but rather be called do what I tell you to, and if you want to do more you gotta pay. The game runs smoother but at the expense of gameplay features such as mods that existed in GTA 4. The management of brilliant minds modding to SINGLEPLAYER not MULTIPLAYER are terrible done and shows the greed and disaster that take 2 together with rockstar is. Do not buy this game as you would support a company that doesnt want to fill you with joy but fill their coffers with gold
