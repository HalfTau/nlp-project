Escape. ESC. If you get stuck on Loading Story Mode or maybe even loading online stuff for 5 centuries, smash ESC like its  after a lengthy prison sentence.I do not recommend the game due to the eternal load screen, horrible multiplayer experience constant murders by hackers, false bans for hacking, a system that promotes twatting about being number one etc. etc. and the acts that have befallen modding.The story is alright I guess, the characters are not likable, except for Franklin perhaps. He seems to be the most down to earth and level headed character as level headed a mass murdering degenerate, blowing up vehicles and people can get.Ive heard that multiplayer is actually great, but I wouldnt know, I was unable to enjoy it, but thats just me.The PC port itself is beautiful. Great work, game runs and looks great, eternal loading aside.The game is fun, and I DO RECOMMEND this game if the only thing youre after is A GTA SINGLEPLAYER STORY AND IMPROVED GAMEPLAY, and you dont give two squirts about the multiplayer and modding. But out of pure principal and handling of the product, this review will not come with a thumbs up.
