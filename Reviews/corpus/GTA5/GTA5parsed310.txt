Might be one of the best games ever made, it doesnt hide the fact that it lives off its past Glories.I still play it frequenly whenever a money grab update is in or a new free dlc comes up or my wifi sucksand Im force to play the singleplayer campaign for the 6th time now but the grind is even worse than the price tags of everything in the game! you could buy an uglybunker that looks like a precarved penal drug den for 1mill but you could also spend your cash on a top secret militarry facility that looks awesome, provides an entire questline, can store a crapton of vehicles and looks like something out of an Avengers film. Also, I could list off a few more downsides to the game like The  community of 12 year olds and ugly cancerous grown men, The gap between the poor and the rich, the struggle to do something important without some jackass in a Hydra ruining youre efforts and the lack of content other than Making money is the real gameplay which is a pretty good title ruined by  REWARDS AND EVEN IER PRICE TAGS.I actually like the game tbh, but the way money works is dragging the poor to hell and driving the rich to hentai haven. I would give it a dislike for its system and its flaws but I cannot force myself to hate on something you worked hard for
