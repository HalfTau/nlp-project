I am taking this chance to give the game a positive review becuase i for one am glad they are doing something to get rid of all the modders. This game has been in my library for almost as long as its been out on pc but i hardly ever play it becuase you cant join a match without someone exploding you for no reason.. you can mod theout of the campaign mode till your game breaks for all i care but when you mod online u ruin the experince for many other players like myself.
