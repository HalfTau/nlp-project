Id say Online part is what killed GTA V for me, like it did to many other games.Grand Theft Auto series are my favorite games of all time, from GTA II to 3 and every single sequel was fun and a great time killer, GTA V is great overall as a standalone game, it is super detailed in every aspect, technical and gameplay side is great and all, but it has one of the worst publishers ever who sued modders because they cant fix their anticheat system and screwed up the offline modding community which didnt have much to do with online hacking and modding.The publisher sued the modding community to cease offline content and lure players to Online play, to sell them more Shark cards, unless you want to grind for hours, days, weeks to earn good amount of money to buy a few cars and businesses, and then continue the grindfest cycle.Not to mention, online part is filled with 13 years old toxic players, who have slept with your whole family, and modders which would rain millions of cash on you, abuse you, lock you in a cage, and kill you every time you spawn over and over, and make your game crash in the end.So instead of fixing their they decided to screw up the offline modders which was the only reason I played the game after finishing the storyline.
