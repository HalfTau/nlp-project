These greedy idiots at rockstar got me banned from online by using mods offline because they cant just help the modding community, in return making more people play the game. It would be nice if they had it like skyrim or fallout where there is a modding community in game, but Rockstar is right up there with EA in terms of not caring what the players think, so long as they get their extra few dollars.
