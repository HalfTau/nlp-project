I bought this game on sale and have played for 15 hours.When I discovered OPEN IV, I used the tool to mod the AI of Cops as well as the physics of pedestrians.These mods made my gaming experience 1000X better.Unfortunately, my computer isnt quite powerful enough for this game, so playing has been on hold.Upon learning TakeTwo has made Open IV tunavailable, I can no longer support this game.Modding is essential and made this game so much more.
