The story mode it cool and fun.The Online mode its fun, when theres no cheaters in the sessions.This game its completly FULL of cheaters / hackers, people install modifications and ruin your game.I pay for this, I dont want them in the game. I already lost some vehicles that were purchased, due to modders actions.GTA V it should have something like the Valve Anticheat technology, a detection system for game integrity.Those who cheat or install any mod, should not only be banned from the game, but also from Steam.If Rockstar change the security of Online game mode, I will change my review for positive.Until then will be Negative, because this game in Online mode its good to play in PRIVATE sessions.
