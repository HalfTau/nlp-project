I have bought the game 3 times once on 360 again on Xbox one and PC I mainly play online on my Xbox and i feel like my PC purchase was pointless since I as many others love mods and the modding community making ideas and gameplay features that frankly Triple a developers dont want to risk witch opens soo many possibilities mods are a great feature of any game it creates new possibilities even games counter strike for example its essential to keep it going or we will end up in the stale boring palace of Triple a that were getting into I wish for take two even tho they are a corporation with only monitory gains that they realise that this brilliant part of gaming culture has to be supported for the long being of the industry
