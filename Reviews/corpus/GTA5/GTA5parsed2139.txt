Toxic players all over, hi lvl players will most of the time hack your stuff, kill you or make your missions fail of in your missioncrew.!!!! ONLY play if you use friends from steam ,of not dont bother. Singelplayer campaign is ok but you really want the online stuff.. but that is really hard to keep playing with all those anoying no lifers out there messing your game up. So that is why i dont recommend this game, more so sinds no one frome the companie makes a effort to stop the hacking.
