TakeTwo Interactive has targeted the innocent modding community. I encourage people to stop supporting the GTA franchise and all other T2 interactive games. The GTA V online expierience has just become a cashgrabbing game. I have been playing T2s games for years and I have never seen such an idiotic move by them. This is not OK.On behalf of the modding community, FIX THIS!Never playing or purchasing a T2 game again.
