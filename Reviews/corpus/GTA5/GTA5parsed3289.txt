Absolutley disgusting horrible servers. seriously. gameplay is fun and good, but its pretty ingwhen youre spending about 20 minutes on a treasure hunt, and right before you get the last clue the rockstar servers are unavailable. This is not a one time thing. it will happen. alot. not worth it at all.
