Pros Enjoyable story, free DLCs using the word free very looselyCons Modding was recently banned and all content from the DLCs basically requires you to have no life beyond that of playing this game in multiplayer to afford the content  the grind is almost physically painful, or you pay microtransactions through Shark Cards ranging from 1.99 for 100,000 to 59.99 for 8,000,000 to be able to afford small fractions of the DLCs.I bought this game on my PC almost solely to enjoy the thousands of mods available, but because of the cease and desist order sent by TakeTwo to OpenIV the developers/tool used to mod the game this is almost impossible, so I heavily encourage you not to buy this game in protest against Rockstar and TakeTwo.
