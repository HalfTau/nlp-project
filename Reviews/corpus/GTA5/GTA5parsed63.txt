Good game, for 30 its just worth even if you only play singleplayer. Good optimization and story but online is going down.Quite grind based, hackers may help you get some money so you buy CEO which is best money making method but still to much grind. Servers are infected with hackers and updates over the span of 2 years made online worse. Not hackers but vehicles, every vehicle has now a minigun or some sort of gun, can fly, jump, parachute much more. Hdyra which used to be OP just fell down to the bottom of food chain. All of those vehicles are great but adding guns to them was too much.
