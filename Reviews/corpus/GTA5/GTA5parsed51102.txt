Played the Xbox 360 version finished the story, done and dusted. Bought the PC version for modding and now cant mod so worthless in my opinion. Congratulations to Take Two and Rockstar for effectively destroying any longevity to their own game. I will stick to Skyrim while I can still mod that to my hearts content and still play over six years later, over 400 hours on PC, GTA 5 about 7 hours on PC which is a shame as now I cant refund it.P.S Please support the OpenIV team and help them fight against the cease and desist from Take TwoP.P.S Executives who dont play games, STOP ing with our games
