I diddent want to write about this game before becuse it woud have a tumb down, but it was only becuse of the massive amount of cheaters on the online part, now at last it has gotten better and the cheaters you meet in this game is easy to notis they use somthing they call mods so they can edit the rules of the game.so start with singelplayer insane fun and good story, the game itself dossent messure up to GTA san andreas to littel end content.now to multipalyer ton of fun alot of end content, i belewe no matter what kinda gamer you are some part of online game will hit home base, evan if you are playing the game alone or with a group. nice mixure of pve pve/pvp and pure pvp, there is all kinda race you can partiepate in. you got a huge company system were you can own propertys and run them. and so mutch more...non of these thing are obligated to do, you play the game the way you want and have fun. this is the best gta so far.
