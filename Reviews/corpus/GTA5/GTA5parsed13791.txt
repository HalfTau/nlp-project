 Easy to get into. The story mode teaches you everything you need to know. The online is fun. Easy to mod. Made by a multibillion dollar company. Pretty sure Rockstar knows what they are doing. This game made a billion dollars in profits. Best selling game besides Tetris and next to Minecraft. Pays attention to detail. Theres so much you can do. You will occasionally find little kids in multiplayer. For some reason the game is 18 but it censors swear words...? It is REALLY REALLY HARD to make money unless you cheat or buy shark cards. On top of the fact that it is really hard to make money, trolls will most likely blow up your cargo or supplies which is one of the only ways to make good money and when you question them they say because the game told me to. So you wasted literally an hour of your life roaming around and driving a car. ON TOP of the fact that it is really hard to make money and people prohibit you from making money, you need a  TON OF MONEY TO DO ANYTHING IN THE GAME! YOU NEED LITERALLY 1.7 MILLION DOLLARS TO GET EVEN A DECENT AIR VEHICLE! Not as big as a map as previous GTA games but it is cool either way. Great lighting. Shadows are the best. One of the best games of all time for good quality graphics. Even at the lowest possible settings it literally destroys other triple A titles in terms of visuals.
