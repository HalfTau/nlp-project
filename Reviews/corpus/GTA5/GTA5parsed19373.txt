First off, Id like to say that this game really has alot of potential, and it is obvious how far this game has gone with sales hitting the charts. This sandbox idea is really good and very innovative, youll have fun playing it.HOWEVER, Rockstar needs to get their sht together and actually think about players welfare. Random disconnects, long loading screens, numerous hackers, bad support crew, bugs make this game annoying to play. Multiple times have I played when I get randomly disconnected and have to sit in the clouds to go back to singleplayer and rejoin GTA V Online. Recently this has happened to me numerous times and I dont think this game is playable anymore if im always tranferring between singleplayer and multiplayer all the time. I played last week, and I couldnt even get to play 2 heist setups before losing connection randomly. P.S my internet connection is very strongIts such a sad thing when you see such a game with so much potential just go to sht. Start fixing community problems before getting ahead of yourself, Rockstar.
