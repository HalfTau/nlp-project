Between modders and R pushing Shark Cards so goddamn much, GTA Online is no longer fun unless youre in a private lobby with only people you know. Otherwise, you can expect to get instakilled randomly or griefed by people in invincible aircraft or tanks non stop.Used to enjoy this game. Now its just a sht show.
