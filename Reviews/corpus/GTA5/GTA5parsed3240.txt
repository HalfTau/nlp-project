I bought this for the sandbox experience and MODDING. Rockstar and Take Two have not been kind to the mod community lately, and seem to care more about milking the online product and console jockeys than to giving any consideration to PC gamers. Its a shame, a truly beautiful game, but missions for single player run dry fast... and the online is an unregulated playground of predators waiting to murder you, repeatedly. It gets old quick, and I came from a WoW pvp background for years. Btw, if you want ANY of the newer, cool cars or items you MUST play the online version and spend money bought or earned in game for them. Because the original cost of the game wasnt enough...
