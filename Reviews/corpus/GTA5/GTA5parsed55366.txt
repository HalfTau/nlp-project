I will start off saying most of my game knowledge will be from GTA Online, but I have watched the entire single player campaign twice and confident enough to state an opinion on the game. The game always had a great cinematic feel to the game and pointed out some great discoveries through satirical context and the personality of every living and perhaps brutally murdered citizen in Los Santos. As odd as this might sound, Ive always been curious of any players end result at the end of the main campaign where it records everything youve accomplished typically of carnal pleasure and kill quotas.I enjoy through observation and I will use that as an opportunity to get to my real point. This game, online especially has amazing memories that you, the player, achieve through your actions, where one day youre fist fighting on a moving bus with another player, to then immediately transition to that same player screaming in agony as a heists escape plane shreds them from head to toe after you fought off an entire prison complexs security force. Eventually though, as free content flowed into the ocean of code for GTA, the creativity in most players dropped, one end because a grind would ensue that many people just simply do not have time for, another end because something as taboo as ONLINE modding suddenly is the only excuse to play the game. Due to some news at the time of this post, Rockstar and Two Star are at considerable fault for allowing something of that scale to remain untouched as long as it did, and caused honest reviews and thorough critique to overwhelmingly cease, the community preferring to put a game they had enough passion for to comment on burn to the ground, and anyone new to GTA should invest time in videos released between 20152016, both singleplayer and online.This game is not for people who prefer a much more casual form of entertainment through the online platform, but the original content of the singleplayer is absolutely amazing and price efficient for that content alone. Bring your lighthearted humor and darkside to the life of crime today.
