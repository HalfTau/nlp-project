BAD IDEA!!!!! DONT BUY!!!! !Played 170 hrs, have enjoyed this game from release.However I wouldnt buy this game, rockstar have become money driven!!!!. Account has be wiped twice not my fault, lost eveything right before the last 2 large updates. They then expect you to spend a fortune on shark cards to afford anything in the new update.Rockstar has ruined a perfectly good game with the dependance on micro transaction.
