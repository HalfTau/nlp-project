Normal people dont have time to grind out missions to  make money to buy anything in the game anymore. Also, Im not wiilling to throw down 100 for 8 million just so i can buy one or two items from the new DLC cash grab. Rock star and  Take two NEED to grow up and stop this t. All you do is take the money and you dont care for the customers any more.
