Modding is what makes GTAV one of the only games I come back to constantly !Without OpenIV and the mods that I love playing this game is really bad.I dont play online, SP content was never released as promised, all efforts are put into MP which again I dont play and dont want to play and OPENIV was the only thing that made the game interesting.How many games can you say you go back to constantly? Singleplayer games not Multiplayer? Not many. I tried playing without mods today and hate it. Deleted from library.
