AbandonedSure it gets those big updates every once and a while.But when half the time after I do something the game crashes or gets stuck in a loading loop.Its crap, the sheer quantity of bugs I have encountered in the online  mode is terrible. Im absolutly tired of it. I cantNot only that, since Im a new player, regardless of the time Ive spent on online... Im the bottom of the stack litterrally just getting carpet bombed in every session i join, Its all a bunch of grievers.... and If you want to actually not farm the adverserary games for cash, you make an MC right.. too bad everyones too busy carpet bombing to join and ruining what youre trying to run by yourself... I cant get any money in he game, and Im disgusted with myself that Im still trying. Becasue one of the few things I want to do... I cant because the only reson people get on this game anymore is to grieve.I have had the worst expirience ever with this game. Eve online is friendlier than this....
