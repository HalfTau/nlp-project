With the return of OpenIV, this marks a great step for mods and user content from here on out.Let this stand as a lesson as to the power that the consumer has, because without us, companies like Take Two are powerless. They have power over Rockstar, but we have power over them.Thank you Rockstar, for taking the effort and making things right. The game is a good game, and deserves praise, so long as the consumers are respected as they should be.The fact that this happened at all is honestly an enigma of its own. How stupid do you have to be to try to ban modding? Thats like burning money, because mods draw in customers.Whatever the case, Rockstar has repaired its relationship with me at least. They took the right steps and handled the situation well.And before anyone argues that Rockstar should have taken a stand before the incident ever occured, I have a counterargument. First, we dont know that Take Two spoke with Rockstar at all before sending the cease and desist. Second, They have all the power over Rockstar that they could ever need. Rockstar cant exactly stand up for itself without cause. The backlash that resulted from the incident was their cause. It was the motivation to fix what had been broken.This was a victory for modding and consumer content, but it was also a victory for consumer input in the industry. Theyll think twice before trying anything stupid like that again.
