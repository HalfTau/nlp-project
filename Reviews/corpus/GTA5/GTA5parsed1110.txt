I love this game and all but i have to give it a bad review  . Why? BecauseYou cant do anything on a public session , there is total mayhemMicrotrasactions or you can grind 1 week for an APCAnd the worst of all you cant do nothing with your CEO,MC,ViP on private sessions only on pubilc sessions and we all know how there is one or two guys with 10000 lvl and jets who just wants to  you and everything you try to do for theyr funConclusionIts funLots of stuff to doA lot of customizationWorth the moneyJust use exploits to stay alone one public sessions
