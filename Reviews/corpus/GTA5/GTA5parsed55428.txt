All of the hours I have played this game is because of modding, almost 570 hours, one of my favorite games ever.. now take 2 has screwed it for us and I cant take myself to play this game any longer. ive bought the damn game 3 times and the 3rd time was to mod. IM SICK OF YOUR GREEDY GRUBBY LITTLE FINGERS TAKE TWO. you just lost almost the entire PC playerbase all because youre greedy. im done with my rant, if this isnt fixed say goodbye to a customer.
