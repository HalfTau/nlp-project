story mode is boring. incredibly fun with friends online minus the hackers and men that try to kill you when youre trying to shop for clothes. speaking of clothes, theyre ugly, and so are the haircuts, especially for women. the player models themselves are rather ugly too since its hard to look decent and you will look like youre in your mid30s no matter what. i dont understand why the NPCs get to look cute but we dont.
