with the removal of support for OPEN IV the game just isnt worth playing anymore, GTAV simply fails to support itself with money grab free content patches, that might i add force you to buy shark cards to enjoy properly. Not to mention the blaitant lack of support for single player DLC so rockstar and take 2 can fuell the online cash cow. At best this game has become a 4/10.EDIT after rockstars stepping in to moderate the Take 2 modding fiasco, well see what happens in the future, a good step in the right direction.
