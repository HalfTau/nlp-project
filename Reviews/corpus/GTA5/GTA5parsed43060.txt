Bought the game for mods... Played a couple of hours for a month.. Then they pull the plugg and kill modding..If you ever played the solo the game aint worth a rebuy all the best features and car are hiding in onlinewas unlockable with mods until they pulled the plug.. Online is bad you either witness the pointless mayhem in freemode or wait 1h30 to launch some kind of activity... The fact alone that they attack modding for profit is enough for me to tell you to stay away from the game, but honestly if you already know about Trevor and had played the game even though you didnt complete it the game aint worth your money or time
