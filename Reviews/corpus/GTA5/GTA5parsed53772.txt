Cease  Desist Has finally ended my fun for playing this game and now even for GTA 4. I no longer consider playing this game if you are well into playing the nice communities content with their creativness for making this blasted game and its fun.I dont play the multiplayer enough here for it to warrant its 60 nor is repeatedly playing the singeplayer again and again the same way is going to last in the fun department.2Ks weak excuse It was being used to breach security or allowed hackers isnt but the weakest argument Ive ever heard. So now this cuts the community in half and I will take my leave on this.Im currently in the process now of getting a refund. I cant help but feel like Ive been cheated here. But to now see the experience go south, Im definitely going to miss it....Back to playing Gmod I go then P
