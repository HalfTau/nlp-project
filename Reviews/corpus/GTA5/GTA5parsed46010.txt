Ive put a fair few hours into this game and enjoyed most of them, aside from when during online play hackers are making a mess of things and nothing every happens to them, but god forbid you accidentally receive some money from one of them, because thats cutting into the real business, the shark cards. Similarly with the companys latest idiotic but understandably greedy decision, theyve essentially banned single player modding in a short sighted attempt to get people to stop improving the 4 year old SP game and move onto the not that great anymore multiplayer where they make the real money. Ive never bought a single shark card and I certainly dont intend to now.
