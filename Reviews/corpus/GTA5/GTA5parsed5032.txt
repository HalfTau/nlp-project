So, I bought this game for the Xbox One a while ago and really enjoyed it. With all of the things I had accumulated throughout my time on Xbox, I thought I should switch to PC Gta as id be able to transfer my account and have a better experience. Upon finding out you cant transfer accounts, I was angry. You used to be able to, and now that ive bought another copy of Gta V, I feel cheated of my money. Until they allow transfer again, this review will stay negative. As of now I am contemplating a refund.
