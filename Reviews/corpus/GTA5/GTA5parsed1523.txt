Honestly one of my favorite games to date. I only have 160ish hours on steam currently but I have played since the game was released on Xbox 360. And I have been in love ever since. If you enjoy Singleplayer, or Multiplayer you can have fun on this game due to the endless modding and storyline in Singleplayer, or even the long lasting Multiplayer free roam experience. I wont lie though Online tends to be full of modders these days so expect to run into them. And in order to purchase cars, or housing online you will have to do tons of grinding. But if youre able to look passed those two things then I would highly recommend Grand Theft Auto V.
