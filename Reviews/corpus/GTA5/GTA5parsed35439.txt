Ive always loved gta for feature of modding, adapting it for myself. Thats why I bought it, and all versions before. Freedom of choice, a lot of fun and memories. Thanks to mods. And now they make the main thing that keeps the game alive ilegal.Thank you very much, ing money hungry developers. Thanks for ruining a great game.Im not going to buy the next one. Thats for sure.On behalf of the OpenIV team,  you.
