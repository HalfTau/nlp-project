Single player portion of this game is alright not really replayable since i got bored after trying to replay it again but its okay for what it is. Graphics are pretty but mods make it all look way better. Online...well thats the  part cause so many negatives have been stated by many and also its obvious that the online portion just wants to milk you of money. Personally, i played the online for an hour then got bored because you literally start with nothing and it becomes nothing but a grindfest but also its fun trying to fight off level 5000 players with a freaking peashooter lol. San Andreas and Vice City are way better than this game. 7/10 and watch out you could just be banned for no reason even if you arent a cheater .
