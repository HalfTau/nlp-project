Support OpenIV! It is disgusting how this company is treating its community! 95 of my playtime with ALL GTA games is basically spent playing with mods and other fun additions made by the COMMUNITY. This franchise wouldnt be anywhere near as successful if it wasnt for the community. Leave them be Rockstar/Take Two!
