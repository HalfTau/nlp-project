Dear T2 Without a supporting fanbase, you have no business interests. Take notes from Bethesda and embrace the mods.EDITNow that the modding fiasco is over, Rockstar should probably fix the microtransaction thing next  those Shark Cards are bloody ridiculous for the price, and simply grinding for the cash makes the game very boring quickly. Or how about those single player DLC that were promised years ago?I love GTA, but I feel like were getting the short end of the stick here.
