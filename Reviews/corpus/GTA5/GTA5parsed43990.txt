Rockstar has to make everything hard a large majority of modding goes into giving yourself items such as the Rockstar Dev Tshirt and the space ranger helmet but if Rockstar would make it easier for people by making things like that a feature in game and accessed without glitching or modding there wouldnt be a reason to. I cant even play Gta 5 PC I would go into and kids would be begging modders for money and then recieve the money and I would ask them if I could bank and they would tell me NOOO dont bank it you could get banned!!! What what the point of asking for the money if you cant bank it/use it. The community is also extremely toxic you cant go into a session without some random idiot killing you for no reason it is very annoying. The reason modders spawn in money for themselves so often becasue each time there is a good mission to farm and or play for money the find a way to ruin it such as adding another objective and or enemies. I am permanetly banned from online but at this point I dont care I am on another account anyway. Take Two and Rockstar need to step back and come to terms with their mistakes and get this stuff solved and also stop messing with things that doesnt need messed with.
