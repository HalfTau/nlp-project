Modding is the only reason I play GTAV on PC these days, mostly. Online is a haven for cheaters, so singleplayer is the experience for players who want frustrationfree fun. OpenIV was vital to that fun in many cases and Take Two Interactive have decided to kill/shut down OpenIV, because theyre not happy that theyre only the 4th Best Selling Game of All Time.Take Two are only interested in you as a player for as long as you PURCHASE ingame currency. They are anticonsumer and antiPC Gaming.IT IS FIXED! But... TakeTwo is still some MOTHER S! Just saying....
