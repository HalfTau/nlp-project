I get that there is a complete no modding ban for official multiplayer. I encourage it. When I play on an official server, the last thing I want are modders ruining my game. But to BAN SINGLEPLAYER MODS?!?! Thats just ridiculous and such a show of greed on your part. Shame on you Take Two and Rockstar for ing the community so badly since you launched GTA Online with your absolutely ridiculous prices on all your in game content. Then you have the nerve to block people from enjoying the MULTIPLAYER ONLY content you release by use of mods in SINGLEPLAYER ONLY so they have to spend real money on your t for online play only!! What happened to just making a good, quality game that people enjoy enough and not have deal with micro transaction t? I will never buy another Take Two or Rockstar product as long as I live. I hope you go bankrupt and lose it all.
