This game was too violent for me. I was walking around, and saw two guys playing darts. I couldnt believe my eyes. That sight scarred me for life. I guess Ill just go back to playing GTA 6 where the dart playing is at a minimum. My poor virgin eyes. This games graphics also look like doodoo ss b!tch And I want to kill myself after being exposed to the horror of dart throwing. 911/420  IGN
