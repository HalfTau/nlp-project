EDIT Checking closely how the situation with Open IV is going, for now Ill keep the thumbs down, but might change back, as I said I would.I grew up playing Rockstars games, I love them and the company.But sorry, youll have a negative review from me until you sort the modding situation.Also, you risk losing a really loyal consumer if this isnt fixed. Ive bought many rockstar and take2 games over the years, some of them multiple times, but wont buy a single one more if the situation persists. Ive done it before with other publishers, and I have no problem also doing it with you. I hope more people will do the same.Love,Me
