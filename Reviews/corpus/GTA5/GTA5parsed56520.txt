Bought GTA V for xbox 360 100 itBought it again on PC solely for single player modding as I did with skyrim, mass effect 1, 2,3 and 4, borderlands 1, 2 and 3, etcThey have now basically banned modding, even in single player.Basically now you pay 60 to get a videogame that has constant multiplayer content added to it, accessible mostly trough weeks of grinding or micro transactions, filled withplayers who love to grief you and hack.
