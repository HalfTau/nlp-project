I never leave reviews but this one was just asking for one. I have bought this game  collectors edition on 360, regular on PS4 and PC, and fell in love with it. It was an amazing game, but in truth, has always been lacking a bit of replayability in single player. Instead of giving the player what he/she wants and releasing some DLC, or letting players introduce some fun and new content for the game, they come in and take it all away just because of a few bad players. Protect the online, let single player be creative. Until then, I cannot recommend this game at all. Save your money and buy something else.
