I used to be really into GTA Online. Then they went crazy. The CEO and MC stuff is fun, except for the fact that it can only be done in pubs, which are infested with hackers and s, making it damn near impossible to actually earn the money to unlock all the stuff they added in, forcing you to have to buy those damned shark cards which Im embarassed to say I bought a couple of.Then they went and decided toon modding. So much for longevity.Not only am I done sinking money into GTA Online, but Im not going to buy any future game from Rockstar or Take Two. Dont support fee to pay online games.
