Campaing modePros Awesome storyline, able to try out every aspect of the game.Cons Nothing in particular.Online ModePros Free DLC, you dont have to pay for anything to try out the DLCs. Lots of different mission, races, heist, business to try out till you drop. Heist is the best overall, especially when you have a bunch of friends that can communicate through voice channel.Cons Although the DLCs are free, you will need to earn ingame money to be able to try it out. Earning for a DLC takes ages. Doing Heists with random players is a big NONO, you run the risk of language barrier, sudden disconnet and etc.Verdict If you are here for the Single Player, I would recommend it. If you are here for the heist and you have a bunch of friends who could play with you everytime, then I would recommend it as well. If you have no friends to play with you, I wouldnt really recommend it.
