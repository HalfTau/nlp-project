Get stuck in tutorial forever and ended up having to make a new character 5 hours later.Make a new charcter, get stuck in an endless loop of the same phone calls over and over every 5 seconds no many how many times I listen to them all the way through. Cant even steal a car because when the phone rings it overrides everything and cancels what youre doing, but does it every 3 5 seconds, with Lamarr, Lester, Agent 14 etc..This is a friggin joke. Im a PC master race type, but even I say dont bother, just play it on console. Its capped FPS but other than that flawless on console. At least for online.I bought it for online though, will be getting it refunded for the same reason. Games broken.Single player seems fine.
