Grand Theft Auto has taken an intense downfall due to Take Two Interactions for the cease and desist of OpenIV. OpenIV has been used by majority of Rockstar players on the PC and it is mainly used for fun and creativity. Mods are mainly used in single player and any player that uses any mods in the multiplayer should be delt with individually versus having everyone suffer. The maker of OpenIV should limit mods to where they are restricted to single player only and no player can transfer any modifications to GTA Online. If this cease and desist should continue, Grand Theft Auto PC will definitely lose substantial amount of its players.
