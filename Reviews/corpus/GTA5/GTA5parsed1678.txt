Hello! I like gta v , its a pretty good game , good graphics , beautiful cars and good characters.Even if i do like it , every game has it mistakes . You now have to find a hacker or a glitch to make money or just farm the old fashioned way. I bought it on xbox 360 , ps4 and now pc so 120 euros gonefor pc i got a sale and i have some exeprience with the game.Excluding the session bugs and the infinite loading screens its a pretty good game , but i recommend if you have a low end pc make an upgrade , i found that the hard way... Still its a pretty good game and i recommend it!
