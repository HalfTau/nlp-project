Simple reason why I dont like the game anymore yes I used to like the game, now I only play it to drift around in my drift tampa is because of the unfair banning spree you idiots went on.I personally am not banned because the bs reason you were in a lobby with a modder that gave you money every second.Yes I have been in a lobby with one of those guys, but immediately spend every single dollar that prick gave me to prevent myself from getting banned for incorrect bank balance.Some suggestions for the people that end up with a modder, just spend all your money at once so its gone and rockstar wont see your incorrect bank balance and the very last thing you should do is put in on your bank account in game.Most of the time the money goes to your wallet, keep it there and spend it all at once, whatever it may be, just make sure its gone or youll probably lose all your progress.Whats even sadder besides the overpriced shark cards is that there are some high quality cheats free for people to use to get insane amounts of money, unlock literally every car mod, clothing, tatoo, etc.... and you guys DONT EVEN NOTICE.a friend of mine used that, he had over 1.000.000.000 not exagerrating and had over 50 cars, fully modified and was armed like as if he was going to win a world war by himself. he eventually got banned for getting 50K xp per kill on a player and reaching a high level in a short amount of time.get yourtogether and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
