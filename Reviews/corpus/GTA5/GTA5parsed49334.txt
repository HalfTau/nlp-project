Am I posting this because of the OpenIV thing? Why yes, yes I am. It isnt the only reason. While the game does have a good story and such the online component is honestly full of microtransaction garbage and now TakeTwo has pulled the crap they pulled with OpenIV. Give it a pass. Get Saints Row 3 or 4 and remember when this kind of game was fun.
