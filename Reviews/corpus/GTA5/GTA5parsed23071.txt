Though I did not play the preivous GTA games, GTA V is in my top 10 favorite games of all time. I almost always play GTA Online, and was not invested in the single player campaign. That aside, the game boasts incredible attention to detail, fun but simple flying/driving, smooth third person shooting, enjoyable missions, and much more. Its a great game to kick back and play when you want to relax.
