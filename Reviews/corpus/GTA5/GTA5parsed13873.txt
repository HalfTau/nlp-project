Best to be play with friends in online and story in offline is very good. BUT the only thing that make me write here is hackers and modders that are spreading widely and ruining my good experience in game so far. You can actually see a modders in almost every session, bombing everyone at the foot, spawn cage on top of players, explosive guns, immortal, etc. Reporting cant do anything, all you can do is finding a new session and meet another modders. Theres even a modders youtube channel uploading them using mods in online and dont even got banned. Rockstar please, do something. I used to have good time playing this game.
