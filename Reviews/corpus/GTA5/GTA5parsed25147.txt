While I dont agree with the mod shutdown, and that was stupid on their part they have suffered, learned, and recalled what they have done.We nailed them enough and hopefully they have learned their lesson.If we continue to bombard them with poor reviews after they have taken action to go back on what they did what are we teaching them? That they cant ever come back from a bad mistake and our gaming community are irretrevable s?You fck up once and youre done?GTAV/O is a great game, for just about anyone. Yes it is expensive to have all the nice toys in the game or a hellbent grind it is still a good and fun game, and only gets better the more friends you add to your experience.TT screwed up, theyve heard us, we destroyed the reps of their games, they undid what they did due to all the backlash the backlash has to stop be the bigger person in this argument guys. You wouldnt keep abusing someone in an argument after they apologise and admit they were wrong so why do it here?
