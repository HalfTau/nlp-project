Rockstar refuses to publish any form of exiting content for this game, its the samein every update, just different coating. Prices are going higher and higher. Its like prices are appealing to those who cheat and not for the fair players. On top of this, TakeTwo is now going after modders, who added enjoyable content to the game. GG, thats how you lose your players and their trust.
