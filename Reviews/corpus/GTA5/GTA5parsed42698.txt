I bought this game based on Twitch Streams I saw of moded RP Servers .. I decided to to buy this game for the PC so I could play on some modded servers.  I thought GTA and Rockstar and Take Two cared about the community. Then they pull thisand shut down a OpenIV.  The community that spent countless hours creating content and keeping GTAV alive, that has undoubtable driven massive extra sales as people like me bought 1 copy for console and then fell in love again and bought another copy for PC.Well lucky for me I delayed long enough and the stupid decision happened when I could still get a refund.Transaction ID xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxPayment Method PayPalRefunded Jun 15, 2017  216amGrand Theft Auto V  65.03Subtotal59.99Tax5.04Total65.03
