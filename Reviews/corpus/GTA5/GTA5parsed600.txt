As a technical implementation the game is excellent. Lovely graphics, a beautifully rendered city, lots of excellent car designs to steal and admire.But the story is.. well, it feels like it was written by 12 year olds. Its pathetic. Terrible writing, poor voice acting, its frankly just annoying having to play through such horribly written scenes.That was before I got to Trevor. The writing for Trevor is even worse. 12 year olds would feel ashamed of putting this together. Its as though the writers had never learned naughty words before, had never encountered plot and were just engaging in a contest to see who could get told off by their mother the most.For this reason I just cant recommend this game. The content isnt appropriate to preteens and theyre the only people that could appreciate the writing.
