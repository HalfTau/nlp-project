Rockstar and TakeTwos business practices have been absolutely despicable and have seemed purely in the intent to build revenue. This also ruins the overall experience of the average player, making them dread the horrific grind of the GTA Online career and the even more horrific waits for more interesting singleplayer experiences. The player turns to their community to build mods and create experiences to improve the lifespan of these Grand Theft Auto games. I believe that if people are going to expect great experiences from Rockstar or TakeTwos games, they should brace themselves for an overwhelming amount of both dissapointment and selfhatred, for purchasing fifteen copies of every game on every console and for buying any of the ingame credit expansions.One of the worst business practices from a major game creating and licensing companies I have ever seen.
