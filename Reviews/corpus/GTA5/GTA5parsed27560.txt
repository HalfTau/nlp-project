Full disclosure Ive played GTA V since 2013, on console and PC.This game is an absolute triumph the overworld is beautifully detailed. The campaign is great. The amount of cars you can own, legally, is also astounding. Credit needs to be given to Rockstar for really going allin on the social commentary as well. On PC, the game is even better. It is astonishingly well optimised.Recently, TakeTwo Interactive filed a ceaseanddesist against OIpen IV, a modding tool for the Single Player campaign. Rockstar very recently convinced TakeTwo to retract this ceaseanddesist source. I am really glad this is the case. I am not much of a modder, but I will always endorse the freedom consumers have to mess with game code for their own personal use.As a result Im giving this a positive review.GTA Online, on the other hand, is still loaded with cheaters, and is skewed very heavily toward users who buy Shark Cards. Cant blame Rockstar either, as they made like 700 million USD last year. Very cool.But, yeah, buy this game. Its absolutely worth the money for the singleplayer alone.
