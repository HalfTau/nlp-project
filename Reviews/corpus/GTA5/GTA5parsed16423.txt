Been playing this to join in with a friend and honestly cant recommend getting it unless you only play single player. I remember playing GTA Online on console and having a great time, but here every session is filled with hackers and griefers. You cant go two minutes without getting blown up with no recourse.This, added to the connection issues and glitches Ive been having are just making the whole experience pretty terrible.Too many people with instant access to high end combat vehicles. As a new player its impossible to play in free roam.
