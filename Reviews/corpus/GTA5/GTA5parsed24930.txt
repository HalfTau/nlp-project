I loved playing this game on the Xbox, but always wanted to play it on the PC so I can play with mods and make the game just a bit more fun.Im not big on playing games online A bit old school I guess. But when I did play online, for a total of 10 hours, I gave up, because there is no place for broke people like myself, that just want to have fun playing a game but dont have cash to waist on digital currency. So, after 10 hours of online play, I have the following opinions1 The amount of money you earn online is so little that it is a pointless waist of your time to play legitimately. Buying in game cash is not an option for me and will never happen, so this breaks the game for me.2 During my time online, I was unnecessarily targeted over and over and over again for the amusement of a bully, again breaking the game for me. This happened nearly every time I chose to participate online, so I found myself playing most of the time in passive mode, making the whole online thing a nullified and useless endeavor.3 The only reason I chose to play online was so I could play with the content that is ONLY available when playing online. Which is not achievable unless you buy the in game currency because everything online is 24x the price of the exact same thing in single player mode, which being as I cant afford that, will never happen. So, again, useless.4 And for the final nail in the coffin. When I am playing the single player mode, I like to mod so I can enjoy the entire game when I do actually choose to play. Since RockStar has banned the use of these modding tools, it has broken the game and will no longer let me play while I have modified files in the game folder, the entire reason for me even getting this game on my PC, has been destroyed.No more fun for those of us that could care less for the unfair, online gameplay.Over all, I think my biggest disappointment has to be that I will never be able to play with any of the awesome online content because I cant afford to play ball with RockStar, and I really dont like playing with people because they ruin everything.So, big waste of time and money, but at least I get better graphics, so thats a plus I guess.
