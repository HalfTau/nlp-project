To RockstarIf you want to supply a good online experience, take the route Blizzard took on Diablo III for instance. The reason you get hackers is of course because you do things client side not because of single player modders, whose fault you recently made it out to be, and by that you opted to be in denial and pass blame. You guys have no one to blame but yourselves. Court bullying innocent peope does not defeat hacking, hosting servers does. You really have no clue? Who to blame next? Mexico?I have already refrained from buying three Ubisoft games since their moments of hubris. Et tu Taketwo/Rockstar? You are next then. Court bullying is ugly AND it will cost you profit for a long time. What a sad affair.RIP Liksang. You were awesome.
