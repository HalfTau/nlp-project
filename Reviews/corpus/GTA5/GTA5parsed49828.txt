Ownership is a simple concept... the owner of a product should be able to do whatever they want with their property, as long as they are not harming anyone else. Rockstar/Take Two have every right to ban certain mods from multiplayer servers that they own, but no company should have the right to control what their customers do in single player games or any games hosted on customer machines.
