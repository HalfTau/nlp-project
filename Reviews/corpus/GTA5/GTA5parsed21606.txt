As someone who doesnt really care about the openiv fiasco, or having gta4s map in gta5, ill just go ahead and leave a positive review here.  Even in 2017, GTA5 still feels pretty fresh, and the online is still very fun in a lot of ways with the exception of rampant hacking/modding/whateveryouwantocallit, and scumbags begging said people for free money in chat.  If I had any complaints, its that rockstar didnt do nearly enough to secure the online portion of this game before release, leading to the rampant cheating most players are seeing.  However, if you can see past that, youll have a very entertaining single player game, and an online game that can provide countless hours of enjoyment.
