Okay, heres my review for the single player part of this game.Pros Nice addition to gameplay Nice storyline Nice vehiclesCons IMO, The storyline kinda short for a GTA game.review for the multiplayer part  I dont play it that much. It needs a stable connection which I dont have.Conclusion Recommended to buy when its on sale.
