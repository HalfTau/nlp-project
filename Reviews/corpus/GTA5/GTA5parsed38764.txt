filled with hackers that keep kicking me back to single player and crashing my game. your business model sucks but not being able to even play the game is ridiculous rockstar.also as I creep closer to 1000 hours im still not even close to owning all of the stuff Im after. I guess everyone grinding money bumps up those player numbers though...
