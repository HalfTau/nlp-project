I really like this game because it is free roaming, you do not have to do missions all the time and can just do random stuff. I hate the fact that the game has a few keyboard and mouse lag issues. I fixed them already. If you want to play this game make sure you have a good CPU and a dedicated GPU. the game is really intensive on the CPU. Elsewise the game is really good.
