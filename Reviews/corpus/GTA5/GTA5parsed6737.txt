I honestly love this game. Its a great game. People complaining about everything being too expensive are just whiners. Its how gta makes money with free dlc, get over it. You just have to grind to get the money. The one thing I ing hate about this game are the players. I am coming from console, and I havent gotten the chance to play the heists, but oh my ing God is it a miserable experience trying to get a heist going. It takes a long time to find players, and they are impatient s so they leave without letting others join. If they dont leave, you will get complete  who dont know how to do heists or are there just to ing troll you. Also with the new doomsday heist how you have to do preps in free mode, who the  thought of that?! My friend and I make it to an area, only to get ing bombed by an orbital strike which by the way costs half a million dollars. So just us trying to mind our business to do a heist, gets bombed by a kid who uses his daddys credit card. I love the game, but I hate the players. They are more toxic then Call of Duty kids.
