The game is fun, its GTA you know what it is and how it plays its just a shame this game has Take 2 for a Publisher.Pulling nonsense like last years summer sale and having elements of FeeToPay in GTA Online. Now theyve decided banning mods for even single player games is a fantastic idea that will garner absolutely no fan backlash.Because I guess they just werent done being absolute Dinguses.
