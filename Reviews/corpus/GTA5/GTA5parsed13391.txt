This game is a mess.You will get griefed over and over by losers with nothing else to do that have tanks and cars that shoot missiles and oneshot you. Even if you manage to eventually kill them, you will have to pay for the missiles and other ammo you used, while they can just respawn their vehicles for free. Even if you are a clean player, you get matched with genocidal maniacs that will kill you on sight. Most missions are disabled if you try to play in a friendsonly sessions, seemingly only so you have no choice but to get griefed.Your games will get relentlessly ruined by hackers that either repeatedly kill everyone on the server, crash your game, troll you in person while invincible, or even spawn cash on you, which you CAN get banned for if you dont make a report on the most unfriendly support site in the world. Rockstar does not seem to care at all about hackers, it is nearly impossible to kick them and reports dont seem to do anything.Everything in the game is so pricey that you have to play for hours on end while enduring the above just to buy even 1 viable car.Everything seems to be designed to frustrate you into buying cash card.Do not buy this game.
