So, if you are like me, that has bought GTA 5 on almost every platform, then you should feel to have the right to be able to mod your game once youve played the game for months. If you add up how much money you have spent of the amount of times you bought GTA 5 then threw it away, that is like this. Not being able to mod the game just because rockstar wants more people to use online so they can get more money is wrong. If rockstar had a actual problem with it, they wouldve stopped it 10 years ago. Dont get me wrong, I love the game, but I dont know if Ill be able to play it in a few months. Next thing you know they remove story mode or something. Do not buy this game on any console/pc until it is more stable.
