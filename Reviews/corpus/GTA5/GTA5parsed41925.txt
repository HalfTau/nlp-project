This review is bad not because the game itself is bad but its for the business practice that they use. Its because I love the GTA franchise, I love R that I decided to give the game a bad review. Like a parent who reprimands their children when they did something wrong, so must we, the consumers do so when our beloved developer makes mistakes. I didnt reprimand them out of spite, but it is out of love so that they will be able to rectify the errors in their ways.I will no longer be suporting buying your games until this issue is resolved and I believe a lot more people share the same sentiments as me. Red Dead Redemption 2 wont save you. It is up to you guys to redeem yourselves now.To all future buyers who is browsing through reviews in order to buy this game or not, my advice is no, dont buy it..at least not right now. If you really want to play, get it through other means. I bid you good day T2
