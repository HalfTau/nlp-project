This is a great game rly single player is fantastic, and multiplayer aka online is rly superb too yes there is all thoose who is modding and maybe destroy the game a lillte but only beacause they cant stop with just take free moneys no they want to have explotions and a lot more things just to destroy others life completly, but well it is a great game and the openworld works rly good and it is rly easy to get money free fx be hired as a bodyguard and get moneys for your work and then when u did that for a time then buy something u rly want like a super car or something, what i mean is why cheat i just dont get it WHY CHEAT.
