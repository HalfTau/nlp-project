although i have been an avid GTA player since 2013 I am appauled by Take Twos decision to ban modding, it is core to the games longevity and is great fun, also we bought the game so we should be able to do what we wish with the singleplayer part of the game, but i would highly recommend the game itself, but untill then i cannot support the direction Take Two is taking the series and the game in
