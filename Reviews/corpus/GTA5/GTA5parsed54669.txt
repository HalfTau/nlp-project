It seems the good guys won this round. OpenIV is back up and working with Rockstar toward a resolution. Once Im sure Take Two doesnt pull a fast one, Ill change the review. Good job all!Fck you very much, Take Two Interactive. You greedy, out of touch twts. Sorry you are paired with these fckwits, Rockstar. Because of Take Twos unbelieveable greed and short sightedness, I cant recommend this game.
