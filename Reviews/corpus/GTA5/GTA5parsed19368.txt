I wont even play online because of the price of everything.. 100 real world dollers will get you 8 million in game but most of the good stuff cost about a couple million anyways. So your going to spend 100 on 1 or 2 items which is crazy. I used to respect R but now since they went online they are nothing but crooks trying to scam their players in to spending money on their stupid shark cards.
