Take Two have only brought this apon themselves, as a modder and a programmer I have always actively supported the modding scene, I have watched it grow and develop as a community within a community, I have been banned many times, but my dedication to this situation will not diminish. You cant just sue something as big as this. Screw Take Two.This is a message to all modders and players looking to get into modding, keep on making menus and creating awesome mods for both online mode and single player.I will not be recommending this game as I want to show Take Two that their actions have results, and it is our job to show them what they have done to us.
