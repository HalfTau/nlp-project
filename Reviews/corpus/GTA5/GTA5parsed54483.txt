 TakeTwo, and these greedy corporate jackasses that cease and desisted OpenIV, the biggest modding tool for GTA IV  V. Selling 80 million copies across five platforms isnt enough? You ers have to euthanize your modding scene to promote your  microtransactions in GTA Online?I know Rockstar Games is caught in this crossfire because of TakeTwo their publisher, but for me, at least, Ill never ever buy another TakeTwo published game. Anyone that enjoys PC games and mods should too.
