Game has a great single player story, but of course all anyone cares about anymore is GTA Online. If you have some friends to play with then its definitely worth getting on sale. If you dont like GTA Online you can get something called FiveM, which is essentially unofficial online servers for things like sandbox mode or roleplaying. All in all, I recommend getting this if youre a fan of GTA.
