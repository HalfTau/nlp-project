Can i  fly a hydra over the city and do tricks? No. Can i buy very expensive cars every 1h? No. Can i kill other people with my friends then escape the police and never go to jail? No.Well in GTA V i can do that. Fun game if you make a custom game with your friends and have fun. Of course if you dont mind dying by crazy players with miniguns,tanks,armored vehicles etc.Dont get me wrong,you have plenty of things in this game Bunkers,Apartaments,Nice weapons,Exopensive cars,MC clubs,Bussines...good content. Too bad you have to farm them by races or doing heists.PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS!!!
