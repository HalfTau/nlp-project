I was recently banned in the online portion for using a SINGLEPLAYER mod menu. seriously,  you Take2. Maybe modding wouldnt be an issue if it were actually possible to afford anything in the multiplayer. You can barely make any money, and they constantly add extremely expensive new garbage to the game to try and entice people into buying those god forsaken shark cards. If you want to buy the game for a good community and general respect of the consumer from the publisher, look elswhere.
