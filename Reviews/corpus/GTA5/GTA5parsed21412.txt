GTA V, man its been some years since I remember playing GTA Vice City. Then San Andreas, still the greatest GTA in the series in my opinon. GTA IV then comes along and man I loved it as much as I did San Andreas. SinglePlayer was really fun, but the multiplayer is where I had the most fun. GTA IV then came out with its expansion packs with new stories and new gameplay mechanics, and of course memoriable multiplayer.But Im not here to talk about GTA IV or San Andreas.Im here to talk about GTA V and its huge ing problem. Let me begin.The Singleplayer experience was, in my opinion, a little bit of a blur. Im not going into the story, but I finished it sooner than I thought I would, compared to GTA SA or IV. Rockstar apparently promised expansions to the singleplayer story. Well GTA V Online happened. And that ultimately is the biggest problem here. Let me go into further detail.Now I enjoy online, to some extent. I enjoy simply playing with friends and crew members. Sometimes I play with randoms in Pubs and shoot theout of scrubs. The social aspect is a diminishing reason why I would still play this. This doesnt mean that online is still a huge ing problemThis game was fun, in the beginning, and I wouldve given a 8/10. However right now and the direction its going in, plus all these stupid decisions happening/ are going to happen in the future I give this4/10I ask of you reader, to NOT buy shark cards. Dont change your reviews to positives even after the whole modding controversy. There are many other problems present that NEED to be addressed.
