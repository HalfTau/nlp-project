After many hours of gameplay i have to not reccomend this title to new purchasers. the content is great but the implementation is pathetic. you spend hours on load screens even with a cutting edge pc. but more importantly and solely why i wont reccomend this game is the hackers. i literally just has all money from a shipment vanish from my account because rockstar forces pub play to do these missions while knowning they have a tainted playerbase. if you must buy this game get it on a console where there are less hacking issues. that being said Rockstar has not optimized this game either in years. A typical experience is to crash on loading out of a heist, then reload into the game, and because the game wont let you pick which friends lobby to load into, you then have to load into a buds lobby. that works out to about 1215 minutes of loading. if you have limited time especially for this kind of functionality nonsense avoid at all costs.
