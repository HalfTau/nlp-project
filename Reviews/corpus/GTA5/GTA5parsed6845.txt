I really like this game, especially with friends in Grand Theft Auto V Online. The singleplayer is really enjoyable aswell. The story is solid and the opportunities what to do is basically endless. Grand Theft Auto V Online also gets frequent updates what makes the replayability even better. If you have the money to buy, try it out. You probably wont regret your decision, if you like chaos.
