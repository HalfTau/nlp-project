after these puny hours i have on pc and prob 1500 hours on console the game is trash now basically everybody mods and there is no longer such a thing as grinding its either modding or buying shark cards the choice is obvious, the smugglers run  dlc is basically exactly the same as ceo warehouse but with planes just as i predicted, ridiculous missions and you get barely any money for hard work rockstar are obviously running out of ideas or are just lazy if they are just now basically copying the same dlcs and putting in new vehicles and new characters this dlc by far has been the worst piece ofi have seen
