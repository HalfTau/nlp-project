They failed our freedom.They failed our community.They failed our trust in them.They failed our fun.We no longer deserve to play a video game that such an action would even be bothered to be worth mentioning. Take Twos actions are now limiting our creativity, enjoyment, and our fun. This is, in no way, allowed for all of these people who want to enjoy these amazing games.

But of course, this action has to be taken, as now these beautiful games are now at a standstill.
