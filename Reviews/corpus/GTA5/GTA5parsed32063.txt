So just saw all the bad reviews about this game ever since the recent Gunrunning update, personally i understand why everyones mad, sure slow down the hackers and such to make the game better but the policy seems to be directed as a threat towards ONLY the modders who spawn money, vehicles, weapons even, and not even hackers have been put in much danger.Also making a threat to a modding group doing mods and such for singleplayer and maybe multiplayer?biiiiiiiig mistake guys, if you dont fix this stuff soon GTA 5 will most likely not be on the steam store page.This games fun, but please just focus on the guys that hack for personal gain and not hunt down the modders who just want people to ENJOY your new content thats over 8 mil down the drain to get started.
