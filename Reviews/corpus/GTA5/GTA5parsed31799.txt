Rockstar and Take Two have become greedy, unhelpful and hostile to the fanbase. Banning singleplayer modding as they want more people in online buying shark cards! Terrible automated ban system. Although the game in itself is generally very good, the game has now become a mess! DO NOT BUY!Hey and also were gonna gradually increase the price of ingame items until they are too expensive to not buy ingame currency 3 here is the clothing with lights update, customise your clothes with friends. However, first you need to buy a clothing company for 10 million, complete 20 missions taking over 200 hours in time and wait 2 hours inbetween each mission! Dont worry though, you can skip these waits for a cheap price of 2 million a time! Have fun!
