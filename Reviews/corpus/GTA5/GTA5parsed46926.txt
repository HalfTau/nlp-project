Great game, modders have some problems with each other. It does not change the fact that the game is evaluated after that. And its great over the years. Great graphics, a storyline, a world full of freedom, I do not even go through a mission for fun. Modders. Modifying the game is not the right, but the good will of the creators. Game is great. And good credit gets from me. Playing VR is even better, playing the game wonderfully, I will definitely do the series on your YouTube channel with GTA 5 in VR. Tasty and beautiful, great optimization, world full of life. Despite the time worth buying.
