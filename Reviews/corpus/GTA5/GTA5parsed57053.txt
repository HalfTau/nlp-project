A great bloody game. One of the best ever. Yet I give it a negative review. Why? They broke it. First, GTAO got a bunch of lazy updates. Then, recently, they OpenIV, a FREE MODDING TOOL, was given a CEASE AND DESIST LETTER. Now unavailible to download, mods for GTA5 will stop being made. YOU TAKE2 INTERACTIVE.wuv u rockster tho .
