Take two interactive have fcked up this time. They have declared that modding is illegal HAHAHAH XD and emailed a cease and desist letter to the OpenIV team which means for the community no more mods forcing you to play online and pay for shark cards to play the new dlc, because the payouts for everything in online are horrible. Take Two Interactive have become money hungry little btches. Sooooo basically another Activision. Take Two Interactive you taking the reputation that Rockstar worked so hard on and are plummeting it to the floor. We will not stop protesting and boycotting every single thing game you publish until you give the community back what they deserve. We already paid 60 for the game and we should be able to do whatever the fck we want with it. Without mods this game feels like an average cash grab that doesnt have any value to me. So you might want to listen to the community before your stock plummets like your reputation .This is a link to a petition to save OpenIVWAIT!! THATS NOT ALL!! !It is rumored that Take Two also sent a cease and desist letter to the creator of Script Hook V and that they are also planning on taking down the gta 5 mods website and reborn V. This is BIG news! These developers are the foundation of GTA V modding and without them GTA V is ruined!Check out this video to see what I mean in more depth
