The game is a lot of fun...Or so it used to be at release.Then the developers started introducing vehicles which were more expensive, nevertheless they then introcuded, ships, planes, towers, warehouses and bunkers which are so expensive that grinding takes so long you get to the point that you start giving names to all the spiders in your vincinity.I already bought most of the stuff, but retired due to the many hackers in the game. I came back after the Gunrunning DLC was released and at that very moment, I knew I fked up.I came back to the game with 2 million left on my character, but that was just a fraction of the money that is needed to fully enjoy any of the new DLCs they release. Which means you will have to start grinding the same missions over and over.Note. The missions arent scaled to the new prices and therefore what you earn in these missions were intended for items which costs at most 1 million. Now however, when things cost 5 million and up, missions are kind of weak and you will be doing missions for a lifetime.During my mission grinding, I already named 6 spiders. Jenny, Timmy, Bobby, Hailey, Ivy and Sammy. By the time I earned enough to unlock half the content the new dlc offers, Jenny, Timmy, Ivy and Sammy are long dead.However, I am still here grinding this hit with Bobby and Hailey. The mosquitoes unfortuantely are too much for the two and they started sucking me dry. I dont think I will ever get enough money.PS Sharkcards are a scam, the developers are milking ever single player. Watch out!
