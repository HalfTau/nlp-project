Open IV is back, our work here is done.So I am now changing my review back to positive.GTA V is an Rrated episode of The ATeamEven without mods the game is fantastic both single and multiplayer are great and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a open world game with tons to do and see.Has both first and third person modes, the world is gorgeous, the gameplay is fun and the action is addictive.A sandbox of extraordinary scope created with a masterful attention to detail.9/10
