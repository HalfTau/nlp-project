Take2 can shove it. Never buying another one of their games again after screwing over modders. The entire reason I bought this game and built a gaming pc was to play with single player mods. Online mode sucks and always has, this is a pathetic move by Take2 to try to force players online and sell more of their Shark Cards. I dont think they realize that without mods being available people are going to stop playing this game and their sales are going WAY down.
