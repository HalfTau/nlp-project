Hi guys so if some of you dont know, rockstar did a new update wish when i try to connect to the game i need to upgrade my social club... but im lazy to do it but im not here to talk about that, some day ago take two post something that mods should be down... I know theres alot of modders online like offline but the thing that catch me is the offline...I know that they must be shutting down mods online because this is unplayable... but... why you want to shutting down mods offline theres is no need to do that exept to get you guys reputation down.Every game that we can found theres mods but the creator dont care... this is good for him to see if some people are playing there game and complimate with the mods that the fans can do.Now rockstar and idk if it will happen but there are probably shutting down mods because they need monney...So yeah im a fan of mods that i can see all around the internet like drift mod or thing like that... but really if they do that, the most people will uninstall the game and play something else that can be modded for fun...Nice try rockstar but i recommend you to get back offline modding...
