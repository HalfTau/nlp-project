In all reality, the game is great. I like the community and the ability to do so much within the game world. Its fun, but you will spend a lot of time grinding.8.5/10Reason I loved the previous GTA gamesExcluding Chinatown wars. Vice city will always be my favorite next to Liberty City and San Andreas. This game is an attempt to capture the story telling like those games, but adds the online ability which makes GTA feel real. Great game.
