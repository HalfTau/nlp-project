The story was great and the game is very entertaining but the greedyness of TakeTwo is destroying the game. They are screwing up single player modding, trying to stop the online modders just because they are losing profits thanks to the modders that give money away, they havent fixed most of the griefing tools that the modders use to troll and harm people online. And even yet, they arent going to be able to stop the modders since they rely on p2p instead of actual dedicated servers cheaters in gtaonline wont stop soon unless they get a GOOD anti cheat system the actual one is a joke and patch every single exploit that the game has.I could rant a lot about the online aspect of this game, but basically is this If you dont spend money, waste A LOT of hours into stupid and not enjoyable grinding Ive played MH for over 1500 hours combined along the games and trust me, this games grinding is awful and doesnt feels rewarding at all or cheat youll get screwed over by everyone because with money and a bit of time you can buy the most unfair things explosive bullets in the new update, OP vehicles... and destroy every person if you are somewhat skilled at playing the game.Also you wont get banned for being with a cheater in a lobby or receiveing money from a hacker unwillingly, that comes from people that probably cheated and got caught.I cant recommend this game unless you are buying it just for the singleplayer aspect, and even then you are losing your ability to modify the game to your liking. Now if you have plans to buy the game for modding youll have to pirate it so you can use old versions that support modding. Im not encouraging people to pirate the game, its just a warning to people that want to buy the game for the modding aspect of it.
