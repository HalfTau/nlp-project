This was a good game once. The single player was well crafted, story was decent, and mods were abundant, creating lots of new stuff to do, keeping me from being bored with this game as you can see from the 400 hours on record. However, I never really enjoyed GTA online, and now TakeTwo have taken actions that make mods impossible for single player, using multiplayer cheats as an excuse, despite the fact that the mod tool actively prohibits this. It is undoubtably really because of the microtransactions Shark Cards that allow you to purchase online mode currency, and the fact that you could get previously multiplayeronly vehicles in single player through mods. However, they took a heavyhanded approach and effectively prohibited all modding outright. I will never play this game without mods, and if that means I never play it again, so be it. I am currently investigating offline modes to bypass the recent updates so my installed mods still work.Make your money without disrupting modding TakeTwo.If you care about modding AT ALL, do not buy this game.
