The cucks over at TakeTwo, have not only Taken away mod support, and been s to the OpenIV team, despite preventing mods from going online, But have also turned GTA Online into a cash grab.You need to continuously grind for 700 Hours just to get the 40,000,000 for all thein Gunrunning. 700. ing. Hours.Ill still play, But Im never going to support TakeTwo until they bring back OpenIV, and even then, I most likely will not buy another game from them again.EDIT TakeTwo allowed modding but decided to make it so they could do whatever they wanted when they could to modding.
