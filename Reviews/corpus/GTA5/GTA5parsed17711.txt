Single player is good but multiplayer has become more of a grind than some f2p games. Every update they add more stuff thats fun and really OP stuff aswell but all of it is behind a massive paywall. so massive in fact that their most valuable shark card wont even get you a decent chunk of whats in the game. They basicly encourage their players to hack money into the game because its etheir that or do ludicrious ammounts of grinding or pay for it. to give an example of how bad the grinding is. it took me 100 hours while doing tons of high paying jobs which you need atleast couple mil just to unlock to make roughly 1 mil. even with the best jobs the grinding is still insane. its sad to see this great game get destoried by P2W items. online is nothing but a f2p style game on a game that is still 60 where they use psychological warfare to make everything seem out of reach to make you give up and buy their shark cards.
