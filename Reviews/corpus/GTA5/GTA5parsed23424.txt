TakeTwo sent a ceaseanddesist to OpenIV in an attempt to get more people online and therefore, more people buying microtransations to fill their bottomless wallets. Instead, they brought GTA down to a current rating of 17 Ive seen it as low as 11 for the duration of the Summer Sale where the majority of customers lie.Good job TakeTwo, I hope you got what you wanted out of this.
