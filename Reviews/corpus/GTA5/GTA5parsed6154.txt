This game, in a word is microtransactions.Let me explain.I think if people are buying this game this far after release youre buying it for GTA Online. If youre buying this for the story mode DONT! DO NOT BUY IT! Family share or torrent it. It is not worth its price if you want to play storymode. This game once used to be fun and ive picked it up recently after I was told by my friends that it will be fun to play if we all got on together. WRONG. This game is NOT FUN UNLESS YOU LIKE TO GRIND. This game has become nothing but a sad depressing excuse for cash grab. Rockstar and TakeTwo WANT YOU TO BUY SHARK CARDS. For a new player you will find it beyond diffcult to get started with the multiplayer, its pathetic that not only do they sell this game for 80 USD EVEN TO THIS DAY! WTF?!?! they pressure you to buy shark cards once youre in game.For example if youre a new player Lester will CONSTANTLY BUG YOU TO BUY A PROPERTY FROM FORECLOSURES. EVERY. TIME. YOU. BOOT. UP. ONLINE. They make new items particularly hard to purchase through grinding the game! It can take more than 30 HOURS TO BUY A BUNKER THAT ALLOWS YOU TO DO THE DOOMSDAY HEIST PLUS ALSO ON TOP OF THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE MONEY TO START A HEIST. ing t Rockstar. Take Two and Rockstar are changing, they are no longer the good guys of the gaming industry, rather they are turning into EA a evil ing company who HAS ALREADY TURNED THIS GAME INTO A SERVICE, IT IS NO LONGER A GAME. IT IS NOT FUN.STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME, AND IF YOU MUST BUY IT THEN STAY AWAY FROM SHARK CARDS DO NOT GIVE THESE GREEDY S YOUR MONEY.
