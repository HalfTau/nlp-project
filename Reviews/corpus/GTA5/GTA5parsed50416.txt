Becasue of the policies against OpenIV, which is designed to force you into the garbage online so you may spend money, I cannot recommend this game. The best part of this game on PC is the modding community, and the worst part is the multiplayer. WIthout mods, you are better off continuing to play on a next gen console if you already have it there.
