The single player is a very good game.Welcome Back to Los Santos. Where everyone wants to be rich.Play as 3 protagonist it is sure a very good idea and an interesting mode.Love the story mode especially the Deathwish mission.But it is too bad rockstar aint gonna make any dlc single player like TBoGT or TLaD .Imagine if they released a story after michael faked up his death..how trevor got stuck in shady shore.Franklin gansta life.It would be a ing interesting dlc!Too bad rockstar is so greedy and only care about the loading simulator.Talking about this stupid loading simulator especially coop mission and heist.Why rockstar aint giving us a chance to recruit a NPC? not some dumb randos who cant even read the mission goal?This idiot get killed because of their stupidity.And the loading its too faking slow...it almost took 15 minutes for loading even tho i had a decent pc and connection.. Whathe fak man....there are only few people in the session.Buy this game if you have at least 3 friends so you can play heist mission without relying on stupid randosBuy this game if you want to be a single playerdont buy it if you just wanna play it online.
