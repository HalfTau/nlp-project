As of 6/23/17 OpenIV has been restored! Good Job everyone the community did it! If you want to mod you can once again!This game was fantastic. It took years after the release on PC and a ton of work from people who had a vision to make GTA V on PC amazing. It wasnt Rockstar games or TakeTwo, It was the modders an amazing group of people who made their visons come true. Understand this Rockstar and more importantly TakeTwo your boost in sales in the last couple of months arent becuase of SHARKCARDS or DLC its because of mods. People see amazing things on Youtube or Twitch and buy the game because they want to experience those amazing things too. Seeing mods played on Youtube brought me to PC almost 10 years ago, and this has helped me find my passion for Computers. That discovery for future generations is now gone since modding has been declared illegal and against the rules. I hope TakeTwo Interactive and Rockstar take note that the PC community will not take anticonsumer acts like this one kindly. I know a single consumer means nothing to a company like TakeTwo but maybe these reviews will change the tide.
