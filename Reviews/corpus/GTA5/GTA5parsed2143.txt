As a gamer this game makes me want to break S all the fing time.  From unresponsive controls to unresponsive game mechanics, terrible UI and menus.  Fun if you want to try and grind for money die to bs npcs shooting through walls or instantly hitting you with their first blind fire shots from across the map.  The magic spawns of enemies that pop up right behind you or spawn right in front of you instantly firing the second they spawn.  Most frustrating part, a lot of game breaking mechanics seem implemented just to make grinding money more annoying and frustrating.  But hey buy some shark cards that are totally overpriced and all your problems go away.  I can understand why people enjoy this game, when Im not fighting one of the games annoying broken mechanics, or being constantly spammed with cell phone about buying the new content, the game still has the spirit of GTA.  I just cannot dumb my mind down enough to ignore all the other garbage that comes along with this game.
