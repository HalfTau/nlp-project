Main reason to play Gta singleplayer really for most of the community is modding. Without that, There is no community. Thats all I got to say for that. Plus the game has slowly made its way into a paytowin style game other than a fun time with all your friends getting things easily and fast without weeks of jobs for just one apartment and barely enough for any car over 100K.Only good to get for the mods Aha oh wait And the enjoyment of exploring the open world with missions and story.Dont get it.
