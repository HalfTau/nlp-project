Its great game and to date the only online game I ever cheated on, and I feel no guilt because I never bothered another individual or made them have a unfair experience against me I just merely gave myself and my friends money, and clearly thats not okay, I have 3 accounts permed, but seriously buy this game if you can get around the fact you wont get to enjoy the bulk of the content in the muliplayer until you sink at least 300 hours into the game, its a shame really. I do not endorse any form of online cheating and think it is a rightous reason to get banned if you are ruining another players experience I know what I did and I know I deserved my bans for breaking Rockstars terms of service, I just wish they werent the way they were.
