After recent updates this game is a must buy. I reset my account and started over and im slowly making my way up the criminal market DThe story is probably one of the best video game storylines out in THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY.Now i will of course not focus only on the positive. If you are new and dont have much money many rich people will mess with  you. It is frustrating but thankfully you can just join a private session and make money there. Honestly that is the only major flaw i can think of, wait a second... that cant be right! HACKERS! now rockstar has recently been striking hard against hackers but some people will still make it trough to ruin your experience. Now that is the only two major flaws i can think off.It is fun when you are having an epic car chase. It is fun when you are transporting a prison bus and people come after you only to get blown up by one of your sticky bombs and you see them rage in the chat. It is just so epic whenever you have a dogfight with someone on high altitude and you get to show of those awesome moves you have been practicing in singleplayer.Despite the high price you should buy the game. And if you after this review are still feeling unsure wait for a sale to buy it.
