For the singleplayer its a pretty good game. Lots of missions, lot to explore, its a rich experience.The multiplayer experience is the worst Ive ever had. The missions are great, but other than those everything else sucks. Its a pay to have fun or you have to grind a lot. You would think that in an open world game you can do whatever you want. Thats a hard no. You cannot really steal stuff like you would in singleplayer, you will occasionally find good vehicles but good luck finding an airplane or a helicopter.People are usually toxic and aggressive. Unless you are playing in passive mode dont expect to survive for long near other players.
