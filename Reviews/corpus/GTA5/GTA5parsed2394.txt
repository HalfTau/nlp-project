I think this game is great! and very fun with friends.I havent got much to say other than... great game, but it of course has some flaws! Fun with friends! So much content! Many updates / bug fixes! Heists are great! Alot of challenges that you can do! Stunning graphics! Great optimization / performance! So much clothes which means more variation! Alot of cars! Longest loading screens... Toxic community... High level players target the new players... So many modders / hackers... The game is very expensive... and you should buy it when there is a sale!Worth all the money, and if you havent tried it! then buy it when there is some steam sale...
