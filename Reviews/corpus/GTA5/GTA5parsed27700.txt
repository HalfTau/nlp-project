I am an avid SinglePlayer mod user primarily LSPDFR and for TakeTwo/Rockstar to blame Open IV which does not let you play online while activated for multiplayer cheats is an absolute insult to the GTA V modding community and to Open IVI have changed my review to positive because of Rockstars support in the matter of allowing Open IV to resume its course.
