I purchased this game a while ago and only played single player.   I thought it was a great game.  I will not be playing multiplayer until microtransactions are removed completely.  I believe that anyone should not play any game the has microtransactions and just boycott them all.  There are still a few good games left that do not have them.Just dont support them and they will go away.  They will have no choice.Do not buy this game if you have not yet.
