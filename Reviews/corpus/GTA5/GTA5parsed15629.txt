I mean, GTA has had modders before but since 2 days they are in every single session.I snipe someone and next thing u know I get instantly blown up while Im on a roof by someone at the other side of the island. People turn godmode on and just drive around. They spawn batmobile cars in public, they teleport all over the place while everyone can clearly see it.And then Rockstar removes millions of money from legit players watch the steam reviews.What the hell has happened to this oncesoawesome game? It is finally destroyed. To anyone wondering if you should buy this, dont. Unless youre in for single player or ONLY play with friends.
