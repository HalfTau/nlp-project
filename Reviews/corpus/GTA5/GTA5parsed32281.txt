In short to everyone who is hating on take two as of late.1. Do the jobs to make moeny.2. Get over the loss of mods, it was a needed sacrifice.3. If you dont like shark cards, dont buy them.4. Stop begging for money when you see a modder in a lobby.5. Just because they removed mods does not mean the game is bad.6. DO THE JOBS TO MAKE MOENY.7. Enjoy them game as you always have when online.8. Get over yourselves.I do regret the loss of single player mods, I have never personally has any installed but I have played some before and enjoyed them. Rockstar and Take Two are trying to make the online community fair and cheat free. People will beg for money then cry when they are banned. Get over it, this happened and it is likly it will never be reverted.Other than that, this is an excelent game with many options on how to play. The money is easy to make after becoming a CEO, the grind there is a little unplesant. But all in all 10/10, keep up the good work take two team.
