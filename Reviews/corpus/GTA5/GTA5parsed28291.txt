I enjoyed this game for a while then i even loved it more when mods started to come for single player, and then when i come back to it after taking a break I see all the mods are gone and not aloud, so i stoped playing and now really dont have much fun anymore, such a disapointment to rockstar, should of just left this alone and let the people have fun
