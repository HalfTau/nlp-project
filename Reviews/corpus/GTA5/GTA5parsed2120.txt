This is a great game I enjoy it even more then I did on console. People complain about hackers and stuff on this game but I havent ran into any of those problems. I cant wait for the next gta to come out but until then Im going to enjoy the hell out of this one. If your looking to have some fun this is the game for you. Dont listen to the people that complain about it sure when you start out its tough but its worth it. And dont listen to the hacker storys it all bull sure there might be a few but who cares.
