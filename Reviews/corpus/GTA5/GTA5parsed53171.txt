If youre considering buying this game, dont. This game has become a prime example of late stage capitalism in its finest. With the game being split into its two halves, one being the singleplayer campaign and the other the ing atrocious GTA Online microtransaction hell hole, GTA V has fallen into a horrific pit of comapnies trying to take advantage of their fanbase and users. If youve somehow not heard of the recent OpenIV news about TakeTwo bull attack on the entire PC modding community, then I highly reccomend watching this explanation by Daniel Hardcastle on Youtube down below...If you still want to enjoy the singleplayer experience regardless of this attack then just pick the game up second hand. Do NOT buy through any other game provider that gives money to these awful companies. Disgusting.
