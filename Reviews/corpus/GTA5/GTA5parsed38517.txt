Ive played this game for the last few years, starting on xbox 360 all the way to here now. Ill keep this short. Rockstar and Take Two seem to have a fetish for making the fake in game economy as un fun as possible to translate as much as the fake money they can into real money, in the process throwing a temper tantrum when it doesnt go how they planned and people dont want to play along with their Now, with take two murdering the major part of creative wonderful modding for the game in the wonderful modding community by shoving a cease and desist to the biggest single player modding tool, no matter how much i love this game its going to take a hell of an apology to change my mind on that, s. Go to hell.amazing wonderful game,owners and all ruined by an ungodly amount of necissary grinding to do anything. my only hope is when the contract with take two renews, rockstar runs like hell, then in my eyes theyre forgiven. however, if they decide to stay, well,  off all of you.
