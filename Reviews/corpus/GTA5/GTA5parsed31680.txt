What the hell is going on!Take Two has strictly banned modding for this game, which was a huge part of GTA in general. I for myself have played at least 250 hrs in GTA V with Mods and I am hating Take Two for their actions in the past days. Thats also why I am giving a bad review on this game.The modding community is big and this hatewave will have a huge inpact on Rockstar Games and Take Two.This is not over yet...
