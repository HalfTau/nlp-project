What in gods name is the point of taking the censorship of online chat to such an absurd degree as to restrict the use of the word eggplant which I didnt even know was a slur until this game told me as such in a game where you murder people, rob banks, deal drugs, and huff gasoline to pass the time?This is almost as silly as it is frustratingly pointless.
