Love the game  WHEN IT WORKS!!  Get to play for 1020 minutes before it inevitably starts to freeze up and crash.  I have literally tried everything to fix it.  What I have discovered is that this is an issue thats been around for years and that RockStar is not only well aware of, but has has done nothing material to resolve.  Im running a new, top notch gaming laptop Alienware 17 R4, GTX1080, 32MB Ram, so its not due to my setup.  I cannot recomend this game to PC users.  Dont waste your time or money!
