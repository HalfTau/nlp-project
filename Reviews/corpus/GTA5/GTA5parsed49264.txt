I used to like GTA V, i have bought and played absolutely every single GTA game that has been released. I liked GTA V Single Player a lot, but the online mode.... is absolute t. I find it so ing disgusting how hackers do not get banned, and people who play fairly do get banned. I got banned 3 weeks ago after spending 150 on shark cards. Ive tried to contact rockstar in so many ways. Creating tickets on their web, emailing them, and even calling them. and i get absolutely noresponse at all. They even hang up on me when i call them and start to explain my situation, which is absolutely ing rude. Im done with Rockstar and Take Two. Youve ruined Grand Theft Auto. Im refunding this game and never buying anything from you ever again. Your greed will be the end of your company.
