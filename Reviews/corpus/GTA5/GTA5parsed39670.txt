Disappointing.  Loved single player, as I have all versions since the original.  Never messed with online.  The few mods that I used made playing in single player very enjoyable and relaxing after beating the game.  Unfortunatly all of a sudden that is not possible because of the lastest update which does not add anything to single player.  Its a shame really..
