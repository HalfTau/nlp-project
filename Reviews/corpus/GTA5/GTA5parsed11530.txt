TLDR This game is really good.GTA V has exceeded my expectations in every way, the characters in single player are believable, the world feels big enough to explore and enjoy without being overly massive, the Online component is awesome fun with friends, I could go on, but that would take too long.My one major complaint is the propensity of hackers. I dont care if someone wants to hack themselves in an infinite ammount of money and every vehicle in the game, that wrecks their fun, not mine, but the most common occurence is hackers screwing with your camera, autoejecting you from any vehicle you enter, and adding massive, invisible blocks all over the map just to screw with you.That being said, roughly 50 of the lobbies I enter have some sort of hacker, and roughly 10 have the jerkwad variety.if you switch lobbies whenever you get a jerkwad, you spend 5 minutes in a loading screen for a much better experience.If I could change one thing it would be the lack of anticheat, but since I cannot Ill just give this game the rating I would if it had no cheaters 9/10 Never stop playing.
