Singleplayer and Multiplayer is like day and night. I have nothing against singleplayer but I absolutely despise the way multiplayer is treated. They woke up after 2 years of people modding, cheating and getting yachts for free. Suddenly, you guys are annoyed by that fact, that people cheat. Where were you when people were being harassed in online games? As long as were buying shark cards you guys are all nice and dandy. I honestly regret buying those 2 or 3 200.000 shark cards. I would even say that I regret buying this game but I was gifted it and I feel like it was the biggest curse ever.I wish I would spend those 70 hours on doing something more productive.Rockstar, think about how you treat people. Youre no better than EA, Ubisoft and newly even Valve.Shame on you, I once really adored your games.
