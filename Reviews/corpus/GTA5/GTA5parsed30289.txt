GTA is a very fun game to play, and love playing online with my friends as well as single player.However, after the horrible update where you are no longer allowed to use mods, even when playing with no one but YOURSELF. Your account will be banned, to  me this is unfair and a horrible, horrible step made by the owner.I am giving this game a negative review solely because of this incredibly awful step.
