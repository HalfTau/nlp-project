Little Disclaimer  I probably have around 900 hours in the game when you count the time I had in the Xbox One version of the game so if you think my small amount of playtime on the pc version nullifies my complaintsMultiplayer is fun if you are willing to either spend hundreds of hours grinding for 1 thing or fork up hundreds of dollars in microtransactions this is a game where hackers are actually quite nice sometimes as they can drop you money and save you many hours or hundreds of dollars. Plagued with extremely long waiting times that happen quite often. Friends are also highly reccomendedSingleplayer is very fun and requires no microtransactions. Only annoying thing about it is that you dont really get any meaningful amounts of money until the very last level little tip, dont do the stock market quests until you beat the game or youll be screwing yourself, except of course the one that you have to do thats part of the main story, also look up a guide on themFinal Thoughts Game is very fun just isnt worth the full 60 or even the full 30 if on sale do to the almost need to spend money to do much of anything in multiplayer in any of the new dlc the new dlc seems like a lot of fun but is too expensive to be able to anything in
