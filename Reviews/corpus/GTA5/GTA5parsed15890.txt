Have played this game and enjoyed it throughout the years buying it on release date on PS3, PS4 and PC. However, now I find myself in a situation where Rockstar are siphoning legitimately acquired funds from my account each update and responding with generic responses and threatening to ban me from GTA Online whenever I query it on Rockstar Support.They can shove this game where the sun doesnt shine as far as Im concerned. Im done, I cant progress. The support is beyond terrible.
