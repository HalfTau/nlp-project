Pretty good. Extremely hard to get money without grinding the  out of the game and its online heists doesnt include Story Mode lol but its damn fun with A TON to do. Sometimes youll theres too much to do and youll feel overwhelmed by how much there is to do and will probably end up cruising around, but this game is worth it, aside from the STUPIDMICROTRANSACTIONS.
