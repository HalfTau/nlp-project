Grand theft auto used to be one of the great franchises, ive played damn near every single one in the 3d era, even the DS ones, but now? Its a cashgrab series, T2 not only doesnt care about their community, but they actively go out of their way to  them over.From removing legitimately obtained money from players in GTA Online to very literally making modding their game illegal, they have pushed the community to a point where I dont feel they can recover.I loved rockstar, I loved Red Dead Redemption, I loved GTA IV and V, I loved San andreas, and I loved the universe they built, but I cannot find it in me to support them any longer.I will not be buying anything published by T2 again, and if you stand for freedom of expression, you shouldnt either.
