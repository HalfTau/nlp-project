I have over 1700 hours logged on GTA V not including the previous versions. I always thought highly of the devs for allowing the modding community to thrive and become such an important part of gamers lives. I learned to value the importance of coding and the time and skills that goes into it. I met amazing people who gave countless hours of their time to help expand the possibilities of an already great game so that other gamers could enjoy a game that continuously generates profit while aging.Take 2 seems disconnected from the reality of what gaming is all about. Expanding the possibilities of what your current reality allows. Breaking the rules. For s sake... you made a game that is 100 about breaking laws...GTA helped spawn a community of friends, future coders and creators, teachers,  knowledge that reached far beyond the initial intent. Instead of killing the evergrowing swarm of future customers, why dont they embrace the modders?LISTEN to what the community wants in a game. Work with the people who are TRULY pioneering the direction of gaming. Dont squash it. If this isnt resolved, youll lose me as a customer for all future products. Ive been buying since GTA III, and even though Im just one, theres many like me.
