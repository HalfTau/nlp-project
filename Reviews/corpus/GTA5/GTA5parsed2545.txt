Dont get me wrong I love playing this, but all the current owners of this game just care about money. It is quite ironic that the game they made has bad guys who perfectly represent the devs. Now the game is fun, but I hope the entire development team can get some sense because we all hate you and really honestly whish all the money you earned from utterly scamming people out of the fun they could be having burns with you. Also Devs checkout those figures on playtimes over the last few years.
