My huge issue with GTA V is that you cant make a party with your friends an play together and do things together that persists through lobbies. This is something they had in Red Dead Redemption so the fact they dont have it in this game is ridiculous and lazy. This game is good the multiplayer and gameplay are fun but this is something that people want to do with their friends, its GTA with friends but the lack of multiplayer compatibility and having to make a crew on their website is embarrassing for a company like Rockstar.
