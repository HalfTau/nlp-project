GTA V is a fun game with lots to do. Story mode alone should keep you playing for a while. Although some things feel way too expensive while playing GTA Online and money is a big part of the game, so thats only one thing that I think should change a bit, or an easier way to make money. Because Im bad at this game...But overall, this game is really fun and even better when you get some friends to join you in a heist, race or just do whatever you want in the world.
