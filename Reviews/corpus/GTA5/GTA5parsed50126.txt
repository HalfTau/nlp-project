ProsA lot of freedomA lot of things to doConsSocial Club is garbageGTA Online is full of hackersGTA Online is full of bugs tooGTA Online sending you to GTA V if your connection is lost instead of to homescreen.Overall, fun game but terribly executed. Rockstar should fix a lot of stuff before releasing more.
