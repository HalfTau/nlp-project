I already have GTA 5 for my consoles, I only bought it for PC for the modding.So on behalf of OpenIV, screw you.If people want to give their modding away for free, let them. OpenIV has said a number of times that they dont condone the use of modding for online, and that they only want their mods to be used in single player. If Rockstar and Take 2 have found that people are using it for online play, then let OpenIV know about it so they can fix it.
