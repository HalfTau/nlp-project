Okay, after 400 hours of real hard grind what can i sayCheaters are gods, can make anything to you and everybody on the session. If a session has more than 10 concurrent players there IS a hacker in the middle of them for sure, they hardly get banned and makes the game unbeareable. Sometimes they up your game so much you need to restart it to get rid of flying around dying and such things.The game CLEARLY induces the player to lose money for the most ridiculous reasons and is really hard to make monkey actually playing the game only to induce the sell of sharkcards. Disgusting.Rockstar Servers are unstable, desyncronized and makes loading screens take 3 times longer than the slowest loading game ever.Rockstar Support dont solve your tickets properly and dosent care.Final veredict Do not buy this game.
