ive played about 50 hours now and i have met so many modders that just ruin the game for us that want to play legit. and then one time it was a bug in online when the albany hermes was free, it said free so i bought it and then rockstar took 535k out of my earned money i got really sad cause i had grinded so hard for that money, so i emailed rockstar and got a ticket, couple days later i still had not got my money back so i emailed again, and that was like 2 weeks ago and i still havent got my 535k back. so im in a love/hate relationship with this game right now, and one more thing in the start when the game came out the prices where reasonable but after time things just got more and more expensive so thats why i dont recommend online that much, but dont get me wrong its still a great experience but it was better before.for story mode i have nothing to complain about its a fantastic story.and i like that you can choose who to kill in the end, i like opportunities.and i wanna note that i bought it on the winter sale 2017 for 24
