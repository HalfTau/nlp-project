GTA and R have a great game that is drowning under endless grinds, hordes of cheaters and a system for fixing these problems that is so ponderous and antiquated that you will never see any resolution to a problem by submitting a ticket. Also NO you are not going to get that money back regardless of wheither or not you cheated to get it. The system doesnt differentiate between modded money and legit money, in fact, the system has no clue which is which and its money removal function is used to garnish ppls wages at an ever increasing rate while simultaneously prices for new cars/guns/planes/ect goes every upwards.
