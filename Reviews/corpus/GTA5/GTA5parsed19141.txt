you think free to play MMOs are all about grinding ? try GTA5 online, you grind for day to buy some weapons and an armoured car. You use that car and weapons to grind for even more days to get and office, register as CEO, and grind for days and days to finaly get the stuff you want.Its not always that bad, if you dont wanna grind you can simply buy the shark cards that give you in game money, 8 million  in game for only 100 real money. You think 8M is all you need to get what you want ? nah, you buy 3 or 4 cars and mod them and 4M is already gone. yup totally worth 50 over the already fully priced game at 60... im not even gonna bother to continue, get this game on sale if you wanna play story mode, and pass if you dont wanna deal with the absolute garbage money grabbing piece of junk online.
