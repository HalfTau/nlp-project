I bought this game to play with friends.GTA Online takes 20 minutes for me to load into with a new SSD, and then in 2 minutes I might get forcelogged out playing the game driving around, not idling at all, game might crash, subprocess might crash.As of writing this review I have 13 hours in GTA5, steam says, and Im 100 sure, not even 30 of that was actually playing the game. I tried refunding at 7 hours I probably had 2 hours of actual gametime by that, but they did not let me. I absolutely wasted my money on this garbage.
