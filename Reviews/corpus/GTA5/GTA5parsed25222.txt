Pro This game is incredble.Con The developer banning any form of modding, including singleplayer modding, and not supporting the community that supports their game.Buy for the experience if youve never played this game and want a AAA cinemative story telling experience.But know the developers are actively limitting any form of singleplayer or multiplayer modification, of any kind, even banning you from the online community. Had to leave this review as a message to creators and the fans.
