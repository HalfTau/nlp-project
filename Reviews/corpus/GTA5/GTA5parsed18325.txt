Its just one of the best games in the world. I am a big fan of the whole GTA series. GTA Online is amazing. The biggest minus for me is the god damn loading screens. The are everywhere and they are so slow. My record is 10 minutes of loading after mission in GTA online. I have fast internet and my PC runs GTA on 60fps
