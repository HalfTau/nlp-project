This was a decent game at first, until you realise the only updates you will ever receive are for the online play where they try to coax you into spending even more money on ingame gimmicks and microtransaction bullsh!ttery. Since when did the devs decide Tron existed in the GTA universe? Perhaps they were under the influence of all the drugs found in this game at the time of development. Oh, and  Rockstar and Take Two for trying to compete with Nintendo for the Most DMCA Takedown Notices Sent Award. You stupid idiots realise that once the mods go on the Internet, there is nothing you can do to prevent their redistribution through other sites? Plenty of people have archived those mods, and as you take one down, two will arise in its place. Congrats on alienating your fans.
