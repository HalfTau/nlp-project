The CD Take 2 issued to the OpenIV team shows that they are willing to stomp out modding for potential profit. Shutting down OpenIV is paving their way for future paid DLC. They have said in the past that GTA online is going to be service. They are planning to nickle and dime their playerbase. Removing our ability to mod will leave us no choice but to purchase their future DLC. This is corporate greed at its peak.
