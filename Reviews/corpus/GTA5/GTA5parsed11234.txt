this is the only game Ive bought of GTA V series,Ive enjoyed the story mod so much,its amazing and everything about it,but I have to say ROCKSTAR Failed 100 in the online,cheater hackers everywhere!!! and many players as one of them got punished cause of those hackers,ROCKSTAR showed how their support is working,well its not actually,no one never gave answers,or did anything,after all this time Ive never felt Ive been misleaded by paying 60 for game that worth trash at the online,this experience let me know not to buy rockstar games ever again,0 support for costumers and caring for the online experience.Thank you and for your sake not worth buying it.
