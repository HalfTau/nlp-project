GTA V has a greatly told story and its characters are put in the limelight in an impressive way. The story itself however is kinda sexist against both men  women which is tried to be eased a little bit by a cynical but at times very rude humour. This game is really misanthropic. Womens are portraied to be shallow, only wanting to be famous and kinda wanting to get laid for this goal. Men are shown as badcholerical brutes or total loosers.Aside from the story theres a hell of a lot to do  so if youre really bored, GTA V may be your thing. However those sidequests are kinda generic and dont add anything to the main story. In a way, GTA continous to be the evil root that is copied by so many open world rpgs.The multiplayer GTA Online contains a bad character costumization, a chaotic inventory and store management with overprised goods, a ridicolous ingame store, the worst lobbymaking ever and a drastically downgraded and kinda empty World Los Santos and tons of time consuming sidequests again for bored people. Thinking of those deers in the wild, flying planes and people having a walk with their dogs all features in the singleplayer? Nope, not in GTA Online aside from other players you only see standard pedestrians with no special activities whatsoever.Oh and did I mention the graphics? The graphics are the most overrated feature in GTA V ever. In nearly every corner you can see pixely textures and bad 3d models even with Ultra settings. What GTA V does good is lightening and view distance. Ive seen a lot of better looking games though that require far less power from your pc.So, in my opinion, GTA V is one of the most overrated games out there. If ya want a nice gangstaopen world action game, play Saints Row instead.
