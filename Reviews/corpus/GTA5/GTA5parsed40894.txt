Game has great potential but it is intentionally hobbled by companies that care more about making money than providing a great game  experience. Im sure other reviewers go into great detail but one thing is for sure Rockstar and Take Two dont give a damn about the people playing the game, they only care about squeezing as much money out of you as possible by making the cost of new content so high that you either have to play the game for hours on end for days at a time or spend 30 on Shark cards just so you can afford one new DLC item. Thats to say nothing about the tons of bugs, the incredibly high latency and dropped lobbies in MP and the intentionally broken SP garage system and complete lack of content.These companies intentionally ignore any customer input and they only look at their bottom line, so speak out and dont buy their Pirate their games and mod them to high hell.  Rockstar  Take Two.
