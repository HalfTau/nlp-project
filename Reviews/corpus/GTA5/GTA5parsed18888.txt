Honestly, I would recomend this game if you have a group of 36 friends who also play GTA. Mainly because the community as a whole is Aids. You can just be walking around and a fetus with a fighterjet kills you and says troled  Also making money isnt as bad as people say it is. Heists can give you a metric  ton of money. I cant say anything about the singleplayer because I justaround in jets and make all my cars magenta and yellow.Overall If you have a group of friends who have or want this game get it. If not stay far far away
