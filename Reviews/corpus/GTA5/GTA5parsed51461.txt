Take Two are either idiots or liars, as pointed out by NerdCubed, as they are actively destroying the modding scene when there are alternative routes to eliminate hackers in GTA Online. This cannot be accepted as it will only lead to other companies to follow suit.On behalf of the OpenIV team, from this day foward, for an indefinite period, I will boycott all Take Two games, and I urge others to do the same.
