GTA online, whilst once an interesting and fun new idea... Is now an unambiguously cynical pile of rubbish.A griefers paradise, where the rich/lifeless pay/grind their way to the biggest and best toys and proceed to ruin any fun anyone else might be having. Make no mistake, this is a toxic community, and it makes perfect sense why it would be when R are so happy to sell the tools to make it so.The updates have long since ceased enriching the experience. New content is incredibly lazily produced and is basically designed to sell you shark cards. People like to argue that you can easily ignore this new content, but if you dont buy it you get spammed with messages and phonecalls from ingame characters reminding you that you havent ponied up for it yet. Almost makes you miss the days where they were just pestering you to play a bowling minigame and go see big American s.This is a great way to crash a plane/die in a gunfight too since your controls get hijacked until youve dealt with the phonecall in one way or another.The glory days were when the heists were just out, but theres only a handful of those and they do get old cool as they are....The singleplayer is pretty good, but you probably knew that. This is GTA 5 were talking about afterall... Its bigger than Jesus at this point. I only really write this to communicate the frustration. GTA online was a pretty good thing with a lot of promise, and its been thoroughly, thoroughly... thoroughly buggered senseless by the forces of unashamed greed.They killed the magic. It turns out when you do that it makes it far more obvious what the shortcomings are in the driving, the shooting and the godawful community.If you have a time machine and can go back a couple of years this is recommendable. Right now Id stay clear unless youre buying at a heavily discounted price to do the singleplayer content.
