Ive got more hours into this game than i care to say... and with every update, the cash grab becomes more apparent.A few years ago, a car that cost 1 million monies was ridiculous, frivolous, and only the silly would have it. With the newest update... there is a motorcycle that costs 3.5 million... and to fully unlock that vehicles weapons etc... costs even more.I get that all of these games have a grind factor. But at a certain point, when you have to grind for hours on end, doing and redoing the same shiz, just because it pays the most also doing these things in a private or friends only server, not because of hackers, but because the online community has become the absolute most toxic pile of Kunts you can imagineIt just stops being fun.now, ill also address the recent and tremendous backlash against them because of OpenIV. Yes, there were hackers. Yes, some of them were jerks, that ruined servers. But lets all be honest, they shut them down because the hackers modders could give you the money that meant you either a. didnt have to grind for days on end or... the real reason, spend 50 real monies to get that motorcycle i mentioned. Yes, they want 50 dollars real money for a motorcycle.
