Like all GTA games, this one is great as an openworld game. The physics are ok, and the vehicle and weapons selection is quite nice. The customization is great too. Story is different than the other GTA games, but is just as good because of the action featured in the game. Would suggest having a mid to highend PC to enjoy the full experience.
