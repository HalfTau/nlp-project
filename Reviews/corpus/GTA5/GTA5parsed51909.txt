Single Player mods are now apparently illegal. Yep. Not the ones that completely ruin online games by making people invincible, have infinite money, or whatever  single player mods are what Take Two deems to be the issue. That is the type of people you will be supporting if you purchase this game. People who are so contemptuous of their customers that they will make moves counterproductive to their own business motives just to spite you.
