How unfortunate the decisions made by those in board rooms with no attachment to the products and services can be...Rockstar... remember when you released Grand Theft Auto San Andreas? Remember when a group of devs created SAMP and allowed the community to begin interacting with your amazing engine and create anything from race servers to Roleplay?What did you try to do to them Rockstar? Cease and Desist.Fortunately, back then, your attempts failed and SAMP persisted, and because they persisted, there are still 50,000 players using GTASA, a game that is over a decade old.So on behalf of those who have enjoyed their time on Rockstar games even more thanks to independent modders This decision proves you care about money alone as your motivation for your games, therefor, the next grand theft auto game that enters my program files will come in the form of a torrent.Good day.
