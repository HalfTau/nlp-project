Its one of the most addictive games Ive ever played. I couldnt stop playing. Its a great game with one of the best stories in single player. Online is great too but there need to be some fixes. Modders and griefers are common and its too much of a grind. Loading screens are very annoying too. With that said, I still enjoy the online gamemode and will continue playing. Id give this game a perfect 10/10.
