the story mode is the best thing about this game, i feel as if it has more replayability than the online mode apart from the races, because theyre never the same thing twice. its a solid game but it isnt worth 60 bucks, at launch it was worth it, but now now. id say 20 or 25 now. im only recommending the game because of the fantastic story mode, online is ok but very boring after a while.
