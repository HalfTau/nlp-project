Decent SinglePlayer story, characters, missions and gameplay, with an online mode full of cheaters and hackers compounded with excessive greed for microtransacions.No SinglePlayer content has been released since launch and now that modding has been banned, no need to play the game after finishing it.I dont recommend this at all, especially at anything other than a really heavy discount which never happens.edit They reversed their decision, but the game is still not worth the fullprice for what you get.
