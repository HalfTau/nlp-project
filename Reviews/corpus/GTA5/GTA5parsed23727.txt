Ok look, the bad reviews are from people complaining that take two and rockstar ruined modding, rockstar didnt do that first of all. Second of all the game and story are both good and the pc port is not bad, also openiv can be used and reinstalled again so modding will continue. I say buy it on sale right now for a great price or in the future. Either way its a great game for its price, and who doesnt love GTA?
