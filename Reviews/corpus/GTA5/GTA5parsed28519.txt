I spent a fair amount of time playing the game, and playing online, which was fun, I enjoyed it a lot. However, since I really loved modding previous GTA games, I wanted to try modding GTA V too, which has now become basically illegal. Also, the reasoning behind the takedown of OpenIV is ridiculous, since the game doesnt let you log into GTA Online anyway, if you modify the game files.Being taken away half of the fun, I cant recommend buying this game to anyone, and not only because of the modding, but because of having to painfully grind for stuff in Online, which yet again takes away half of the remaining fun, unless youre willing to pay for Shark Cards.
