Singleplayer  Story is short and bad compared to previous GTA titles, after that it becomes boring and repetitive.Online  Cashgrab mode where R almost forces you to buy as many Shark Cards as your wallet can afford. Repetitive missions, full of cheaters and hackers shame for such 60 AAA title, boring missions, they just keep recycling old content.TakeTwo Interactive also tried to kill singleplayer modding in this game which was the only reason I and many other players are still playing this game, but thanks to the modding community, theyve failed.
