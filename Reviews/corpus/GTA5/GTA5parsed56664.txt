How to stunt the lifespan of a videogame in two steps!1 Threaten all modders with legal actions for creating free content for your game.2 only create updates for your online mode, and not giving the singleplayer any new content, so when the online servers eventually shut down and trust me, they WILL shut down, all online games inevitably shut down. all of the content you created for online are lost to time.The only way to access the content provided in updates is er  was to use mods. Now that you cant use mods, you cant access the items that are in multiplayer.Why ban modding? simple reason for the money. you see, every item that is added in GTA online is ludicrously expensive, costing tens of millions of dollars, and the only way to make money in game is to play the same game modes and missions over and over and over and over again, earning miniscule amounts of money with each game. Eventually, you get bored, and will want to purchase in game money with real, hard earned money. want that new million dollar car? well, pony up 20 dollars.With modding, you could access the vehichles easily in single player, and you could drive around any car you wanted without having to waste hours and hours of your life. But the big suits see people accessing content that was locked behind a paywall for free, and they loose their minds, and their armada of lawyers are unleashed onto their playerbase.This move to ban modding is going to put a date on this games lifespan. Games like The Elder Scrolls series, the Fallout series, ARMA, Minecraft, and earlier entries in the GTA series have had their expiration dates set back indefinetley due to the constant life support offered by dedicated fans. Its a damn shame to see rockstar and taketwo crackdown on their own community, especially the most passionate members of any community, the modders.
