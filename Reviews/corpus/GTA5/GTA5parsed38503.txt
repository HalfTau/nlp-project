Rockstar banning people randomly including entertainers playing group only on a live stage in orlandoCompletely destroying modding supportonline servers dropping players randomlybug fixes arent happening just new content now and ill admit, the new content is fun and welcomednew content costs so much in game currency youre forced to spend 100s of hours farming or just purchase currencyno way to integrate new players into whats been happening for so long so they feel overwhelmed, under prepared, and leave.i never write reviews. but rockstar has moved my hand to action since i CONSTANTLY keep getting banned or the server doesnt accept my online id and wont open to the point of even playing single player. dont get it till they sort out their problemsEDIT 1/3/2018many issues have been fixed such as the banning without prejudice and also the bug fixes have been coming much faster now. rockstar has fixed a numerous amount of issues in their online play now.the costs are still extremely high but as you progress the rewards on cash have bee upped so they are a bit more attainable with a CONSIDERABLE less amount of hours spent farming. and with the new server stability its much more enjoyable to play, i can happily say that i can change my reccomendation to thumbs up now after their fixes D
