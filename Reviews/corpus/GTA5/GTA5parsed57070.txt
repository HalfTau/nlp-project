Rockstar and Take Two have managed to ostracize themselves from a willing fanbase, all by sending a cease and dessist to OpenIV, something that is beloved and vital to the modding community of their games. If they want to increase their fanbase, as well as their revenue, then encouraging and nurturing modders, by providing them a better, more open platform to work with, such as workshop integration, is key, not by trying to hide this grey zone away and making people buy up their waste of money shark cards.
