Its obvious I still love the game after my hours, which you can see, but after rockstar took 1 mil from my friend who earned it all legitimately, mind you we never join lobbies full of players because most of them havein them Im rating down just so people who read this can know, its not Rockstar who is the corrupted ones here. They want us to have fun. Its their parent company, Take Two, that is the greedy, malevolent bad guy here. However I will still play and love this game, I cant recommend it unless you have a group of friends to play it with. Otherwise, it is just grind after grind with no fun whatsoever.
