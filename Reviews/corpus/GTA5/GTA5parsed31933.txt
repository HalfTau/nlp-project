As of now, modding in GTA 5 singeplayer is illegal! OpenIV has been taken down, and for you guys that dosent know what OpenIV is. Its a modding tool used to manipulate the cars and other things in GTA. For example if you wanted to install a Nissan GTR, you had to open OpenIV and add the vehicle in. But Take Two descided to take down OpenIV and declare GTA 5 singleplayer modding illegal! We all know that modding in Multiplayer is not okay but cmon Take 2, let us have some fun in GTA 5 singeplayer at least! But if you dont care about modding and just want to play with your friends in Multiplayer or play the normal Singleplayer i recommend the game strongly!Sign this
