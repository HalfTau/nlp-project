In all honesty, its an amazingly fun game at its core, but its PLAGUED by horrible players. 90 of the games you will join are either filled to the brim with modders, or its completely filled with people who pitch massive hissy fits because people had the AUDACITY to do as the game says and kill them in the PVP mode that THEY activated.I have been vote kicked from at least six games for simply going after people doing smuggler runs because the game flat out invites you to do so for money. But no, people would rather game the system by vote kicking anyone who opposes them. Everyone else is just modding and the most Rockstar seems to want to do about that is remove features and money from the game and add more and more cheat detection software that doesnt seem to work because theres still tens of thousands of them, and slow down the servers even more.The conclusion is if you really like open world sandbox multiplayer games and are willing to look past a hugely toxic community, then this is the game for you, otherwise move on to pastures new.
