I would recommend this game for its single player experience. For its online experience? Not in a million years. Ridden with cheaters, exploiters, modders and people who go out of their way to make your experience as unfun as possible. Many of those who are not in the aforementioned categories end up being those who request ingame money and items from said people. ItsAs if thats not enough, you also cant disable the text chat. So when you request others to kick obvious cheaters, you are inevitably met with lel? were just having fun level of retorts. Yeah  right off with that attitude.
