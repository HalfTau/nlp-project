While I like the GTA series, I refuse to support a publisher that aggressively threatens legitimate modders with legal action, even if they create game modifications that arent intended to harm the multiplayer experience.Thats right, Take Two Interactive have been responsible for killing singleplayer modding for GTAIV, GTAV and Max Payne 3. Several days ago, they issue a cease and desist letter to OpenIV and closing down one of the games most popular modding toolsThanks for treating legitimate customers like criminals, Take Two. I dont plan to buy another one of your games.
