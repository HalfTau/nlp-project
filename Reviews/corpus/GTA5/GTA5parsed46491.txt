Rockstar made a fantastic game, then turned it into a microtransactional sinkhole. Single player DLC was promised at release, but four years later all they have added to the game is a chain of cosmetic gimmicks designed to squeeze every penny possible from their fanbase. With this games success, Rockstar has morphed from a game developer to slumlord, meting out underwhelming content in paid, piecemeal installments. Worse still, they are currently trying to kneecap the vibrant modding community which offers fresh, exciting, and open content, in stark contrast to their official and insipid leavings. Modders enliven games and energize thier fans, and embody the spirit of what made the internet such a vibrant community before startups became titans. Dont let it just be a commodity. Dont support this model.
