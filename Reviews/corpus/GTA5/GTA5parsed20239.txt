Fantastic game if you want to grind for hours to get enough money access to low end features and vehicles from all the updates.Brilliant game if you like paying 100 dollars of actual, real life money, to get a pathetic 8 million ingame cashBest game ever made if you enjoy getting your vehicles blown up, and getting gunned down as soon as you spawn simply for existing and showing no threat to those players.All those little jokes aside, if you can find like 3 or 4 friends who also want to play, it can be enjoyable but past playing with friends the community is pretty toxic, you have to grind for hours to get enough money to actually get anything cool if you dont have the money to buy hundreds of dollars not an exaggeration worth of shark cards, and rockstar is blatantly trying to rip everyone off with the shark card nonsense.
