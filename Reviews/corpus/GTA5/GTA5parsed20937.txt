GTAOnline is garbage and is full of cheaters whos only goal is to make you angry. The only way to get money is to grind for hours and then spend it all on a single car, or buy shark cards, which is what they want. Single player is horrifically boring once you 100 it, which doesnt take long. Where is the singleplayer DLC that has been rumored and teased over the years? Its not going to happen. And even if it did happen itd be just a big old money grab, SEga does it with the total war series, so id be surprised if they released DLC for 60 Bucks ontop of  GTAO. GTAOnline is Take Twos cash cow. They wont release SP DLC because then people will stop playing online, which will stop shark card purchases. Mods are the reason I still play this game. Playing LSPDFR is the most fun Ive ever had in this. Playing in my world is what I enjoy, not playing in a microtransaction filled  fest.GooDNTS has not released a statement about OpenIV so far other than the initial one when this happened, but OpenIV was updated recently to remove the Uninstall Later message. It has also been put up again on the official site, which can be found hereTHough i do love the game i do not approve of what theyre doing  or were trying to do. Modding communitys are what makes games great. with acts like this to try and make it so they can fill their pockets fatter. they will only gain enemies and their fan support base will only turn against them, which si pretty much already happening.
