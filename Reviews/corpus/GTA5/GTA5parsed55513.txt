First time I have reviewed a game. And the first time I have felt the need to say something disparaging about the maker of these games. In an industry that makes me feel like an ATM while I am playing a complete game, I always looked to Rockstar to being that company that was on the gamers side. Sadly, with this new modding policy, I have no choice but to begin boycotting your games no matter how good they are.I have literally been playing video games for over 30 years and now have something to be more disappointed in then Spore and ShaqFu.
