Solid game with varying different styles of gameplay, all of course absolutely bonkers. Can find myself going from just chilling out driving around on the Freeway, to shooting it up and stealing supplies for my criminal empire. This is a great sandbox with hours and hours of gameplay.Drawbacks  A lot of the Free DLC is very heavy on cost with ingame currency so microtranactions are very popular. That said, youll find that Rockstar run plenty of Double XP/RP weekends for spotlight events. So youll always find it quite easy to grind out the cash. Most of the time it doesnt even feel like grinding because your having a blast.Community can sometimes be a little weak with you struggling to fill a lobby if running quick jobs and youll get the occasional hacker griefing but they are getting rarer and rarer with Rockstar constantly adapting to fight cheaters.
