Oh so you want to try out all the brand new DLC added to the game? No problem, I see that you want to buy the new MotorBike Plane Hybrid... That will be 800,000 but first you will also need to buy a bunker which is another 2,200,000 and you also need to buy the Gun Running trailer which is another 1,000,000 giving you a grand total of  you. Your options are grind for 1 month straight, or simply purchase one of our SharkCards for the small charge on your parents credit/ debit card. Dont forget to keep an eye out for our future  You DLC where we add nothing of actual importance, it will be just another way for us here at Rockstar to grow our pile of cash. Once again,  you and thank you for your money.RockStar CEO, Mr  Mcgee
