The single player campaignPersonally, i thought it was slightly above average. The characters have great voice acting, dialogues, however some missions near the end didnt feel personal, its a lesser experience compared to GTA IV.The multiplayerI wonder why many play this, its awful. There is a cluster F of game modes, which might sound good, but it is quite difficult to find people playing the average deathmatch maybe it was just me, and when you find, youll always play in player made maps, which generally sucks with silly rules like a race with melee weapons and flying containers. Never got to play Heist, because there are silly level requirements to host them, which force you to play game modes that you dont like to level up, or just play with a friend... BUT, i just couldnt find other people to play in my friends hosted lobby.GTA O really feels like garrys mod in some aspects, and i personally dont like it. And again, going back to GTA IV, the multiplayer was simple, and lots of fun.In general, i actually had technical issues with the game. When i first bought it, i couldnt play thanks to the annoying micro stuttering i had, and it didnt matter what graphical settings i had, the game was unplayable still. Few months later, the problem was minor, and i was able to finnish the campaign and play online.And after the CD against Open IV, theres even less reasons to buy, save your money.PS In the multiplayer section, as mentioned earlier, there are silly level requirements for things like kevlar and weapons, vehicles and apartments in the other hand have no such thing, but are quite expensive, forcing you to grind or just give them money through microtransactions.
