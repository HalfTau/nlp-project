I have a LOT of hours in this game. Most of it has been fun. The single player version of this game is fantastic. Sadly, Rockstar has turned into a largely money hungry company and ruined the online play. Everything is pay to win now. Every update they release tons of new content, which is awesome. The new content would cost you over 1000 dollars of REAL MONEY to get all the items. I was lucky enough to have a lot of spare cash from previous events and such to get SOME of the new items, but it would take you a very very long time to get enough money to buy any of the items legit.I do wish rockstar would focus on adding some more single player content. I also wish they would stop harassing the modding community and let them have their fun. The reason this game is still popular on steam is from the modding commnunity.
