Ive owned this game for years and have hardly logged more than a few hours playing. These games are just completely boring without proper multiplayer and Take 2/Rockstar have animosity towards anyone attemtping to fix their stale gameplay with modding. Also the gaming industry at large cant for the life of them just sell you a game and let you own it, this game requires some crappy Social Club program to waste disk space and uses very aggressive DRM to protect the poor multimillion dollar company from being deprived precious dollars if a naughty hacker or a legitimate customer do something.
