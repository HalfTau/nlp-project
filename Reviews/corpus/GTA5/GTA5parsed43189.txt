Previously being one of the most fun games I have ever played. Now with several extremely boring and moneywasting DLCs, this game has turned into one of the most timeconsuming antirelaxing games in my Steam library. Gunrunning DLC has totally ruined the free roam, and that is the reason I quit GTA Online. Lastly, the main focus of this game should not be deliberately adding obstacles in order to sell Shark Cash Cards.
