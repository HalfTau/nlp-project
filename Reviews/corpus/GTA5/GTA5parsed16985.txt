I WISH I COULD REFUND THIS GAMEAfter watching youtubers play this game it relights the urge of playing however, after redownloading to give it another chance it doesnt hesitate in reminding me how horrid the game is, which is swiftly followed with a uninstall and put into my toilet category on my steam library.This game is a master of nothing but you cant even call it a jack of all trades since pretty much every aspect of the game is badly done, racing, shooting, heist missions and all the other missions.The missions and new updates like becoming a CEO seems like it would be well planned and balanced to go through completing missions and reaping the rewards of better vehicles and maybe housing however, the missions require millions in investments to purchase an office, warehouses and garages which are needed to grind their unrewarding missions dozens of times in order to get one of the cheapest vehicles from the update which also cost millions not to mention the chance of losing everything over a small mistake or other players online deciding they want to use the vehicles from the new updates which they have already acquired to stop you.The motorcycle club update is even worse, purchase a club and businesses for millions, upgrade them for millions, grind out some of the horrible missions over the week to find your reward of barely any money.At this point the only way to enjoy this game is messing about with friends, creating your own goals to grind out the updates and gain vehicles / purchase a megalodon shark card every update / randomly come to a very large sum of ingame money and I doubt this will change for any future updates.
