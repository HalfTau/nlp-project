Multiplayer reviewInsane power creep. It used to be feasible to start playing online and only buy a 200,000. Rockstars greed grew. To start the new heist, Doomsday, right now, without playing any multiplayer, it costs 8 million 100 shark card OR the new Criminal Enterprise starter pack. I loved this game. Beautiful environment, fast cars, but theres nothing to do if you dont pay up.The new vehicles are pure upgrades. Theyre better, faster, more weapons, etc than the basics. They dont fit the theme even, and this game looks more and more like Saints Row, which is a fine game, but I already own that one.
