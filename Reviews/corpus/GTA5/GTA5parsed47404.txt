I would recommend this game, if I had reviewed it earlier. It was great fun in Single and Multiplayer, the story is at times hilarious, sad, infuriating but always exciting.HoweverIm stealing a part of another review hereRockstar Games, and their publisher TakeTwo Interactive sent a cease and desist to the developers of OpenIV, a tool made for modding GTA and allowing the games to thrive years after release. So much time and effort put into the tool so that people could make the game their own and its all gone due to the greed of Rockstar and TakeTwo.GTA without the modding community is less than half what its used to be. Its a shame that publishers decide to screw over their playerbase, the same people that would have bought GTA 6 instantly.Now, however, this has changed. Please dont support this business practice!
