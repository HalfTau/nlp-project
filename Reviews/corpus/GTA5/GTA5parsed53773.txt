Worst load times of any game I have played in the past ten years. Even with an SSD its possible to literally spend more time in loading screens than actually playing this game.Join lobby? Better load nothing for 2 minutes.Host left lobby? More loading please. Rince and repeat an average of 4 times to get into a lobby and start a heist/race/match, within ten seconds of starting which requires an additional load screen you realise that your entire team is made up of  6 year olds. Better leave early so you can get a head start on the next 15 minutes of loading screens.There is a good game under there, buried behind the load screens.
