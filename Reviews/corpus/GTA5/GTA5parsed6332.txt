Just finished the singleplayer. By far one of the best games Ive ever played. It has everything. The story was an 8/10 with some weak points, but a satisfying ending. Cant speak for the multiplayer. Logged on once, got sticky bombed by 2 guys in a sports car immediately and then quit. Get it on sale while you can, youll regret it if you dont.
