Mods made Grand Theft Auto stand out in the gaming community. To see Taketwo rejecting the dedicated high quality mod creators and not embracing one of the main points why people have bought this game is simple to say.  Amove.Enjoyed the game in its first stages on console. PC version was bought for the reason of having improved graphics and also the availability to use mods allowing either further graphics enhancements or to make the game more fun.GTA Online gets old after a while until they release new content for the game. Main campaign is solid and well made. Would reccommend this part of the game. I just hope that this mess Taketwo has gotten Rockstar into will be scrubbed clean making this community shine once again.
