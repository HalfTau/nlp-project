Ive enjoyed this game for hundreds of hours, played this first on the PS3 and loved it so much I preordered it for the PC.Launch was great, we got 60fps easy and the port was the most polished thing on earth for PC gamers.We got promise and potential for online when heists were introduced. Nowadays its all races and PvP, not so much in the coop content any more...A year ago I would have recommended this game, but today? Avoid this game.The game just suddenly decides I can no longer play the thing, and when one of the solutions is to keep uninstalling/downloading the game until it works this just shows how far from a polished port the game has become.Dont even bother emailing rockstar support, all youll get is some guy on the other end hitting up that copy/paste response list that basically sums up to reinstall until it works.Fix your game rockstar, glad you already enjoyed my money and thanks for leaving me with a 60 digital paperweight in my library.
