Listen,This whole thing that happened aboout disabling MOD for single player to make multiplayer mod and hacker free, was a move that only sucked to everyone that only play single player which in my case didnt matter. I play this game in multiplayer with friends and it is a tone of fun. I will always recomend it to anyone. There is nothing wrong with single player, its actually really fun and the story is very immersive if you never played it. The whole mod thing was making the game life time extended since you can do whatever you want in single player like any other games that supports mods.By the way, a developer doesnt and shouldnt need to add mod support  to thier games just because you want it. If they see the need or possible bad thing it could do to their games in the near future, they get to decide what to do and what they think is best for THEIR GAME and players. This move was done to prevent and stop something that is rampant in multiplayer and toxic to the game and players trying to enjoy the game they paid full price for, but people butt cried so much that they had to push back in that decision.
