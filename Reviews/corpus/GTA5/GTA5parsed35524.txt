Take Two bit a HUGE chunk out of the many many hands that feed them. I purchased two copies of this game as well as a very nice gamming rig soley for having the ultimate single player experience using OpenIV that ROCKSTAR GAMES have promoted for TEN YEARS. Once you beat single player might as well throw thisin the trash because TAKE TWO has had OpenIV removed by an order of cease and desist.With that being said, I STRONGLY urge ANYONE looking to buy this game to spend their money elsewhere and not support the companies who have made THREE BILLION DOLLARS off of this game all to just turn around andon its largest fan base.bringbackOpenIV
