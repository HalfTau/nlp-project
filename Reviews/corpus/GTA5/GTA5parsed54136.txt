I have put a alot of fun hours into this game, and enjoyed all of them. but after recent events i cant help but not recommend this game.Why? because take two has literally destroyed the last of its story mode community because they were too greedy.Mods were the only thing that kept players playing story mode, and it has been a big thing since GTA 3, but Two Take decided to ban modding and deem it as illegal activity. Instead of dealing with all the online modders runing the game, they decided to remove something that wasnt even a problem. Singler player mods have been a big thing for a while and its the only reason me and thousands of other people still play. Untill this gets resolved I, cant recommend it.
