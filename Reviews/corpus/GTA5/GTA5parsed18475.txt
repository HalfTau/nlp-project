As you can probably tell by the fact that Ive sunk 500 hours into this game, I enjoy it a lot. But the fact that Rockstar is failing to resolve simple customer support problems, all while continually making money harder to make, and letting modders run rampant, means that I can not recommend this game to anyone unless they only plan on playing the singleplayer.Maybe when Rockstar realises that the practices theyre using to sell Shark Cards are the reason modding in the game is such a problem, then Ill change my review.
