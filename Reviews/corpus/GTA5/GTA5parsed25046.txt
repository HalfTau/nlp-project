This game is the ultimate adult sandbox shooter.  There is something for the selfish player, the group player, the leader, the follower, the money mongering fiends, the car loving players, people who want to senselessly go about slaughtering everything in sight yup, this game is for you too.in spite of all the carnage this game allows, it has an outstanding amount of detail and beauty that even nonPvPers can appreciate just driving,walking,running,flying,peddling around Los Santos, you can literally lose yourself doing random things for hours.  If you have friends, bring them along too, the fun just gets that much better the more creative you and your friends are.single player is a completely different experience than multiplayer and I recommend newcomers to GTA put some hours into single player to get familiar with this virtual world prior to exposure with the crazy in GTA online.GTA online is best played with friends.  I say this because although there are ways to play alone someone at some point will give you a hard time for the sake of it so share the misery with your friends and shoot that  causing you grief
