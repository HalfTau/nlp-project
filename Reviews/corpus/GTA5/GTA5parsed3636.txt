Easily the best single player campaign story I have ever played in a game, and that is saying a lot. Absolutely compelling characters from beginning to end, perfect pacing, and missions that are an absolute blast. Its like participating in the best crimeaction thriller ever made.The Online mode on the other hand is a different story. While its definitely got great ideas, building your own criminal empire in a massive territory, going about your business whichever way you please, there just isnt a way to play by yourself. PVP is not only involuntary, it is also unrewarding as the reward for killing another player is minimal, while the losses to yourself can be extraordinary. Extremely frustrating when youre about to jump into a plane to sell a shipment of weed when some  comes along in a fighter jet, kills you, and destroys the product that took 4 in game hours to grow and be developed. It will feel like a lot of wasted time.That being said, the game is worth the price for the single player alone, as it will be a gaming experience that you will never forget, and sets the tone for all single player stories to follow it.
