I really have enjoyed my time so far in gta, to be honest l havent done much of the campaign because l hoped straight onto online. Onlone is fun and exciting with many things to do but rockstar have made this game into a grind for cash which is not enjoyable, new heist would nice to be added. So in the end l give this game 6/10 but dont recommend getting it of you dont  have time to grind heist, import/export etc.
