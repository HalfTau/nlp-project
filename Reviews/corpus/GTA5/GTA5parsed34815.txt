The gameplay and storyline have been very well done, dont get me wrong but i simply cannot recommend a game that has a company with such a clear disdain for the community that made it at the helm.Take Twos community policy, mods... the things that made GTA one of the best selling videogame franchises are being shot down simply and clearly because their microtransactions arent producing the profit that they are used to, they werent content with having the second best selling videogame of all time, Oh no, they need to milk as much profit as they can.Their only explanation they have given is that these singleplayer mods were encroaching on their players multiplayer experience.... yea right...
