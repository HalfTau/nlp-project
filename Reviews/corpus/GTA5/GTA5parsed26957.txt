I own and haven beaten this game on PS4, but decided to buy it specifically for single player modding on Steam. Ive had it for less than a month and, thanks to T2, have wasted 60. I dont recommend this game, or any other Rockstar game. Eat a butt.EditThanks to Rockstar T2 still sucks, OpenIV is back up. Changed rating back to positive.
