I have bought every gta since San Andreas, I bought GTA V for every console from 360 to ps3 Xbox one PS4 and the PC version. And I loved the pc version so much that I went and got a new pc to run it better. Then I wake up today to hear that your getting rid of mods? Cutting away the best modding tool that is basically essential if you want good mods? Just so you get more players on multiplayer and more money... Its discusting.
