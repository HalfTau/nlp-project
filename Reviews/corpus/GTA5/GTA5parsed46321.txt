Take two and Rockstar really digged their own grave with this action.I never modded GTA 5 Cuz I feared my online progress would all be for nothingThough I did use Open IV often to mod GTA IV which was ofcourse a lot of fun.To make it clear, I dont dislike the game that much.But this drastic and completely useless actionfrom Take Two and Rockstar proves that they flipped us all off.And I dont even wanna start on about how many machinima creatorsnow have to cancel their work because of this crap.PS. I suggest they rename this game to Unmoddable Loading Simulator 2017 The Screw You Edition
