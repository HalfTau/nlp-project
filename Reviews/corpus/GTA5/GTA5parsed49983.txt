Lacking any actual decent gameplay, they push online like crazy but the single player is the only decent bit, online is full ofand to actually play with any of the fancy cars or do well in gangs or CEO missions you need to find an empty server at the equivalant of 2am US time. with the death of the modding scene for this game id say save your pennies and get something decent. the online is also hacked to sht, and rockstar aint doing anything about it except blaming people it believes are eating into its profit margins. game had promise when it came down hill, delivered on some of it, but the delays and the lack of caring about the player base just proves how out of touch the company is and how much it just wants peoples money
