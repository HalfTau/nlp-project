This game requires an exceptional amount of grinding to get anywhere, and even after all that grind, you can just bet youll lose your hardearned money next update.  I dont play much on PC but my xbox had 10m removed from it before smugglers run came out. I was left with 2m and could buy the lowesttier hangar mind you they are all the exact sameIts absolutely disgusting what Rockstar is doing here, they have no idea how to run anticheat and instead are just flat out stealing hard earned money in a poor attempt to fix their game. The days of grinding all spent just to get a swift kick in the nuts and a  you from rockstar as they pickpocket what it is me and friends worked hard to earn. And all this just to get players to buy their shark cards so they can make more money.How about this? If you want people to buy shark cards, reduce their ing prices. Wow, so difficult, I know.Id sooner spend 200 on ing Robux than buy two megaladons. What would that get me even? a high end yacht which is basically just an overpriced house and one upgraded supercar. That is insane. Please just hire someone else to fix your AntiCheat, and stop with the automated money removal.Overall I wouldnt buy this game unless you have serious money to burn.
