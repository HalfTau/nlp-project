Good game, with extra content for online being added throughout the years.Putting review on negative at the moment because of TakeTwos action toward the modding community.This happened due to the current state of GTAOnline in which there has been several users using cheats to exploit the game. The publisher of the game took action in giving a legal note classified as Cease  Desist to the OpenIV dev team, in which, has nothing to do with the mod menus that are being used in, GTAOnline.I dont even blame Rockstar Studios, since theyve encouraged modding in the past, like in Max Payne 2s modding contest a while back.Once, if, everything is back to normal, review will go as positive, as the game itself its fine, but not its publisher actions.Edit its all good again
