i do not appreciate what gta online has become. It is now more overthetop than Saints Row 3. Everyone is flying around on goddamn jet bikes and rocketproof flying vehicles, batmobiles and all that other I however like the cars with turrets and stuff  that are less OP. Everything is so expensive the only way to get all that stuff is from modded drops, which in my opinion are still insanely frequent. If you play for a day you will definitely encounter a modder. If you do not wish to get modded money and want to do biker/business stuff which is the best way to play the game, it will be you with your regular cars and weapons against an array of goddamn instakill missileproof tanks and armored choppers. basically making you get blown up anytime you try to do anything.I wish they stayed more simple and did not put all that crazybecause with the modders, its just you against a bunch of cheating OP s.Story mode is still golden and amazing, Gta Online is now kinda cancer.would still recommend . wish i could review online seperately because it went to i used to be able to pull up on people and kill the entire lobby with my submachine gun
