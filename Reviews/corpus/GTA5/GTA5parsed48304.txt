No updates for single player, they only update the GTA Online, because of more .Weve payed for the whole game, why cut us out?Also, no modding allowed.So basically GTA 5 is like this no updates for single player, no new stuff available with mods and 50 of people are cheating in multiplayer.Dont buy thisanymore. Red dead redemption 2 would have the same money milking update only online model. Cheaters in online, No updates for offline and no mods for offline aswell.
