I really thought that I would only play the story mode and not play much online, but I was wrong. Sometimes the online community can get annoying, but you can always just join another session if someone is trolling you. You will never lack for something new to do online, its a continuously rewarding experience that allows you to do almost anything you can imagine. The story mode is pretty good, but it is clear that the focus in developing this game was for the online portion. If you love the GTA series, then you must play this one.
