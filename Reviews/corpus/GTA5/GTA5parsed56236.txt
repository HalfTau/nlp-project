Ive been installing mods on PC for two decades now and as much as I liked this game I have to stand firm again this recent attack on mods by the triple AAA industry. From take two to bethesda publishers are trying to find a way to stop or monitize mods and we must abhor and punish this behavior otherwise it will run rampent across the industry. I dont honestly believe that any of this will make a difference publishers have show time and time again from gross preorder culture to bogus DLC content that they dont have any interest in what gamers want and are only interested in protecting their own profits to the detriment of anything else. However, I couldnt sleep at night if I didnt at least try to make a difference for the good of the hobby that I hold dear. If we ban together we might be able to make a impact, or at least slow it down some. Plus honestly GTA Online is kinda a mess.
