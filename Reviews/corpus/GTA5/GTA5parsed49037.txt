Singleplayer A very good experience.Multiplayer grind simulator. Expect hackers, tryhards, grinding for money, begging hackers for money and really high prices for the new DLC. GTA Online has involved into a grind simulator. They just want you to buy their Shark Cards. Good luck getting anything you want.
