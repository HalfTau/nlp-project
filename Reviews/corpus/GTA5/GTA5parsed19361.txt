I mean, Like ehhhh. Its kinda fun, Though once you progress, It kinda gets boring after a while. Though, Fun. Its really action filled, Online is a place, Where there are full of people that you can team up and meet, And friend, Though, There ARE Modders, That can screw up your day in a day of GTAVO.I guess you COULD say, That I reccomend you this game, Its fun with a bit of not fun. Your choice, My head kinda leads to the more positive side, So I reccomend it!
