I hate having to post a negative review, as the actual GTA V portion of the game is quite fun.  It expands on the open world formulat that the series has used since the third game in the franchise.  The game looks nice graphically, and telling the story using three protagonists is a unique twist.Unfortunately, the owners of the game have shown they are more interested in pure greed than supporting the games community.  GTA Online is microtransaction after microtransaction in order to purchase anything in the game, unless you plan on playing it for 8 hours a day.  Also, they have gone after community modders with DMCA takedowns, literally attacking fans of the game that attempt to add to it.  Until they can back the community that loves their games, I cannot back them.
