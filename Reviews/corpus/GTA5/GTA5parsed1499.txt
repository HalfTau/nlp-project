GTA5 has  both advantages and disadvantage . If u use a handle ,its hard to complete a series of actions of aiming a enemy behind u  ,and if u use a sniper rifle, u will cost much time to magnify a  picture which will lost the opportunity to win .On the other hand ,its an enjoyable experience of  driving  a car with a handle.Maybe  its a long way to go,im looking forward to the new checkpoint.
