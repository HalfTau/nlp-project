I mean at this point, you probably know GTA V is good??? like you musta played it on someones xbox or ps3 or something. the online mode tho??? mint and included all free. they are releasing DLC too at regular intervals, and its free with the purchase of the game. the singleplayer mode is worth it I say, if you wanna experience the badass ness of being a crook.
