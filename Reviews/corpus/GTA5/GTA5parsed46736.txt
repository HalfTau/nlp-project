Take Two is actively acting against the modding community, a really bad move on their side.Roleplaying, which is only possible due to mods, not only brought me and tons of other players back into gta, but also catapulted the game on twitch to the top 10 games being streamed for the last weeks/months and created moments of gaming I will never forget due to incredible funny roleplaying and scenarios that will never happen in the integrated kill on sight mode aka gta online.And besides that they also want to get rid of offline singleplayer modding. So once through the somewhat short story no more cars with jetpacks, dragons that cause chaos or hulks that fight against said dragons.Well done Take Two, on destroying the best part of your commmunity.
