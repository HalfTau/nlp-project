Best city controlled game ever played. You can almost do anything,Great game to play even after 5 years,There are stil 1/5 modders/hackers per session thats bad,The world his loading system is kinda slow somtimes like a minecraft map,Some people work hard for there money, others get free money from hackers/modders,
