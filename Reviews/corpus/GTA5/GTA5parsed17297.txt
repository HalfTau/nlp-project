If your considering buying the game for online then avoid the PC version at all costs. Not only will you encounter lobbys full of hackers messing with your the company that you bought the game from will rob you blind.They will take your hard earned ingame money with the occasional money sweep wether you earned it legitimately or not. And for the love of god please dont purchase a Shark Card as they will also take that money off you as well.My respect for Rockstar Games has slowly diminished since the release of GTA V in 2013 to the point that I shall never buy one of their games ever again.
