The single player is wonderful an you will easily get your money out of it, however Take Two Interactive removed modding and dont update the sinlgeplayer anymore. Multiplayer is filled with hackers and ingame purchases. Some serious consumer thought is needed by all producing parties involved to make the game I payed money for a continuing enjoyable experience.
