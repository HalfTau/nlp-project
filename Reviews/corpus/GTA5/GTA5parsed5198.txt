Love this game so much. Big grand theft auto fan. Always have been ever since the very first birds eye view grand theft auto back all those years ago on the PS1 Console. I have GTA5 on both Xbox360, Xbox1 and PS4. Including my Gaming PC. Just cant get enough of this game.But in my opinion its such a fun and awesome game. Cant wait for the making/release of GTA6.
