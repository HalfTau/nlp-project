Modders plague this game at every turn. I have a long history of Rockstar taking away money and cars ive obtained the correct way by grinding and the occasional shark card, but Ive just sucked it up and TRIED to start again. This happened two times going all the way back to the Xbox release once then the PC years later after I transfered my account. Im not trying to bash Rockstar for the wipes as im sure they were trying to catch modders in the first place and it is virtual money, but the fact remains each time I get on GTA Online the moding gets worse. I cant even join a sesh and do anything long enough to get any headway toward actual money collecting. In short modding has gotten so out of control you cant live long enough to do the missions you need to be in PUBLIC lobbys for.
