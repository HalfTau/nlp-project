Jesus Ive never been so torn when writing a steam review for a game, I really wish there was an option for a neutral review.The single player campaign is great, one of the best Ive played in a long time.Compelling characters, interesting side missions, an open world that feels incredably real  lived in, and a truly engaging main story.GTA Online, however, is total garbage.A frustrating and temperamental peertopeer system that leads to ridiculously long loading screens that frequently turn into infinite ones, as well as having no language/reigional settings as you would with a server based game, meaning youll spend most of your time in a game with people who dont even speak your language Which is really quite pathetic considering the focus on teamwork in a lot of the online missionsOverpriced vehicles, properties etc presumably to try and encourage you to buy the microtransactions.And perhaps worst of all, an anticheat system thatll flag you for playing with texture mods, but somehow fail totally at blocking the type of modding/cheating/hacking that actually matters. Its literally been less than 24 hours since I started playing the Online mode and have already had three sessions ruined by cheaters, first with someone repeatedly teleporting everybody on the map to a location where hed rigged bombs so he could loot the cash we drop, then by an unkillable god mode character just simply killing everything in sight for the fun of it, then with a guy running around somehow spawning campfires in people which will kill you repeatedly until you close the game.I think Im going to have to make this review a negative because Rockstar have made a lot of money from their online mode and despite this, nearly 3 years on, theyve yet to fix the vast majority of its issues.However Im mostly doing so in the likely vain hopes theyll realize how badly the flaws in online mode has affected the reviews here and make improvements if they ever make a GTA VI.So if you have no interest in GTA Online and only intend to play the single player campaign, then that is something I can whole heartedly recommend.
