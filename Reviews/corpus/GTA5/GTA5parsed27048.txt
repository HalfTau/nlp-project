I never used mods for this game, which I think is why I do not have a problem with the devs removing modders. Most of my friends stopped playing online because of all the modders hacking money and griefing players. Since the last wide ban and money/rp cleanup I have noticed less hackers and I am happy with the game more than I have been. I also purchased a shark card from the devs and had no problem with this. I think most people are mad they lost the money they didnt work for and the cant harrass other people when they get shot Hackers often chased me down if I shot another player and griefed me til I left. I love the game and would recommend it to others!
