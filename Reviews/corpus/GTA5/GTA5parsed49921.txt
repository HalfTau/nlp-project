Ok, lets us be real. GTA V is a good single player game but multiplayer has come up short of expectations. Now with Take Two squaring up to take on EA as the worst gaming company I can no longer give this game a positive review after Take Two assault on mods. Modding, RP and the like give the game free promotion which helps sell the base game and the very least gets the game views on streaming platforms. It is clear the new shift within the gaming culture towards mods is not one the end user agrees with. If a mod helps sell a copy of your game but makes a few bucks in the process it is a win all around, the community continues to grow, that community exposes others to the game and a few buy it. Now that they want to ban mods for no real reason it seems this is another power play for some paid mod cash grab.
