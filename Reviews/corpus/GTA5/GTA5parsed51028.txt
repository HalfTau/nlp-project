I buy GTA on pc mainly to play LSPDFR with custom cars using ELS but after TakeTwo issued a cease and desist letter to the developers of a moding tool Open IV that is responsible for  adding custom cars, weapons, and player models cant be add in to the game. I wouldnt be supporting TakeTwo or Rockstar until single player mods are restoredRockstars statement TakeTwos actions were not specifically targeting single player mods. Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody. We are working to figure out how we can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players.
