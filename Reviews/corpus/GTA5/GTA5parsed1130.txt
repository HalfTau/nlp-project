At first I feel like voting as not recommended because of how fast you go through the storyline but then I realized this game left me wanting more. Specially more heists and more storyworld interaction.I remember playing the older GTAs and GTAs jewel of the crown has always been its interaction and relation between the world and the storyline. In this case the story feels like its in a completely different universe than the side quests and characters. I mean, for example, why bother adding the possibility to hang out with characters if it doesnt make any difference. And thats the thing. Although the story is rich with a lame ending choice, side characters and the universe around it seems pretty badly explored in my opinion  leaving you with just a couple of side missions and the online mode to explore after you finish the game...Id like to say I loved the game. But this one seemed a bit detached from GTAs all time premisse of a storyline perfectly blended in a highly chaotic world you cannot escape from.
