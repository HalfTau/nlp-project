GTA Online is not worth playing anymore, unless you have tons of money burning a hole in your pocket.Here are a few pointsPrices for DLC items are ludacriosly high. With the recent Gunrunning update Rockstar have introduced a ton of new items and feature, such as armored vehicles, gun upgrades, bunkers, awesome right? Untill you look at the prices, with even the smallest scope for an SMG costing over 50k of ingame money, or over 3 million for a bike that can fly for a little while.Theres no GOOD way to earn a lot of money. With the new update and its bunkers they made a new way to make money... By waiting for literal HOURS for a payout of at least 100k. The only good way i can think of is completing heists, but even then it takes hours and you will be turning a profit only if you crank up the cut  for yourself.Cheaters, goddamn cheaters. With both of the points above  people will look for ways to earn a lot of money really quickly, and the simplest solution is to download a cheat. And with that comes a healthy bonus of tools to make any gta player suffer. Capturing you in a cage, exploding a blimp on your head, drowning you in the ocean, stealing your weapons, or just running around in god mode killing anybody that comes close are no big deal to pull off. With cheaters being able to spawn infinete amounts of money appear a lot of beggars that spam the chat with requesting moneythat might not be a big deal for someone but it personally annoys me. Some cheaters think that everybody wants money and end up getting innocent player banned for no reason.The OpenIV drama. Take Two interactive decided that they are not making enough money from GTA Online, so they deleted the only good tool for people to have fun in singleplayer so players will have to play Online and pay for SharkCards. This is a bad move. Enough said.And that not covering the many bugs, rude and racist players and etc.
