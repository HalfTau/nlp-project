F Take2!F Rockstar!I enjoyed this game, but let me tell you a Story.I got this game first when it released for PC, I went to Gamestop and got that fing huge box with I think 7 DVDs inside.After really enjoying the game from start to finish I stopped playing and uninstalled it to get some space on my hard drive.A few months later I wanted to play the game again and one DVD was scrached, so the game couldnt install, which with 99.9 of other games wouldnt be a big deal, but for some strange reason you can not download GTA V if you bought the retail version.After asking the support to give me some sort of download code, or just to send me a new copy of the ONE scrached DVD and even sending them pictures of the whole box, the reciept and the broken DVD, the told me to go to gamestop, who of corse also said no, as this game is DRM protected.So in a steam sale about half a year ago I rebought the game, effectively owning it twice, and boom, now they made modding illegal, or at least super hard to do.I spend 90 on two versions of the same game just because of Rockstars fckery and now they take away what keept the game going for me.Unless they fix this whole bullst quick, I will never buy any Rockstar or Take2 game ever again, no matter how good it may be.
