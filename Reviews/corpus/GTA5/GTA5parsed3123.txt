I love the game, but I dont like the direction that Online is heading. Instead of adding business DLCs where you have to collect supplies and sell them over and over again, I think that Rockstar should add more details on the map. It would be super fun if they extended the map, added bars and restaurants, or created new mechanics such as fishing.
