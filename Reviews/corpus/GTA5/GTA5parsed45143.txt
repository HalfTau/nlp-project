The developers, for some reason, decided that one of the bestselling video games of all times wasnt making enough money, and are now actively removing modding capabilities. No single player mods means that they can squeeze in more microtransactions for extra content that were before possible with mods.It wont just mean you have to pay for more, but mods that add content that you cant even buy are also being removed, which means no more creative mods that dealt new cards to the table.This is just a multimillion dollar company, with the 4th bestselling game of all time, attempting to milk their golden cow more than thought possible.
