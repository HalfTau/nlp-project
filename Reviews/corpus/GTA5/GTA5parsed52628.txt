Yeah! Lets take down this SINGLEPLAYER mod manager because it affects people from playing GTA Online! haha  you!GTA Online is boring anyway without Money  Grinding is boring, money cards are stupidly expensive and there are stupid things in the game that ruin the experience long loading screens, cooldowns for calling your vehicles, cars STILL get impounded, no way to reorganise your vehicles in garages without getting individual vehicle and moving them.Finding a game with a hacker is actually fun because they can spawn vehicles and give you money no idea why everyone hates them so much. I mean if you dont like a hacker then just change lobbies.GTA V singleplayer is incredible but gets boring quick after completing it couple times already. Modding added Replayability but doesnt seem like I will play singleplayer any time soon Thanks TakeTwo.
