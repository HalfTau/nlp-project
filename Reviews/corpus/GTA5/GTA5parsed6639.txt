I have gone through hell with this game. I had to spend 2 months with rockstar support to try and activate the ing game and then they deactivate my code, wasting my money on a menu screen. So now i want to buy the game again to try and get another key but then i see that if i buy the game again after deleting it from my library, it would give me the same key. I have never had such a nightmare trying to get a game that has been out for years
