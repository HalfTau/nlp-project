DUMBASS TakeTwo KILLED Open IV because theyre a bunch of corporate s. BOYCOTT this game until they allow it to be used again. Open IV is a tool for SINGLE PLAYER modding, and actually the only reason why I even still play this game. I dont care about GTA Online and all your stupid, overpriced DLC content that can only be adquired throught intense grinding or microtransactions.Its bad enough that we dont get singleplayer DLC because of the multiplayer expansions that are free. But killing mods? Killing MODS for a GTA GAME?Idiots.
