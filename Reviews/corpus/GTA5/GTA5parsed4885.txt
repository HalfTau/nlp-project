I would of enjoyed playing this game if only they would let me transfer my account from xbox 1. Apparently, because of hackers I am not able to transfer my account. Rockstar has disabled the option to transfer accounts from other systems which I believe is really unfair to the people who played the game without hacking and simply wanted to start playing the game on their pc. Rockstar has big gay.
