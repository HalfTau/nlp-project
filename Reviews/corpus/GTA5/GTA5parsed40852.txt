GTA V was good until Take two took a dump on its community. loved GTA until now.... srly let the community create what ever the Fck they want! If your intrested in buying GTA now1 where have you been for the past 3 years!2 At this point in time RockStar are basically piing off there fans and basically dont care about them any more TBH there just in it for your money like everyother company so they dont really care about how the fans feel3 JUST DONT GET IT, watch dogs 2 is better that this, overall GTA V eats your money like a fire to a patch of dry grass
