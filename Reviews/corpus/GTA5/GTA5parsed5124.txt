Single player is GREAT, multiplayer is also extremely fun but has a few issues. Youll find that most negative reviews are due to players experiencing hackers in the online game. This is what lead to the developers taking aggressive banning action, and some players were falsely banned even though they were not allegedly cheating.Despite these mistakes, the devs are clearly making an active effort to improve the game state. However, for multiplayer to work effectively, there are many clientside actions which are performed which makes cheating incredibly hard to spot with an automated system hopefully not impossbile though. Despite what some say, most online sessions you will join, at least in EU, will not contain a blatant hacker. This is not to say that hackers are a particularly rare occurence, but its not hard to quickly join a new session.The main reason I am writing this review is because of how positively astounded I was by the newDLC. I first saw it advertised in the cinema and just couldnt believe it was available free. The new heists are challenging yet rewarding, and the new vehicles are great fun. I highly encoruage you to grab a few mates and play through all three new heists together its a great laugh.Overall then, this game is a steal for the current sale price and I have no doubts that the developers will continue to support the game for free until a newer GTA comes out.
