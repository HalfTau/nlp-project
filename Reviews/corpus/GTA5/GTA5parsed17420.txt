ONLINE Most players are extremely hostile, cheaters and modders and common, and Rockstar doesnt give aabout you, or anyone in the community. They only care about your money.Game by itself is fairly fun, but quite grindy, and friends are definetely required for the online.As of the recent years development and behavior of Rockstar, I cannot recommend this game. You will end up dissappointed and frustrated.
