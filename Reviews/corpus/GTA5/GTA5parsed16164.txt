I got one big tip for you, dont buy this cheap piece offor 60 euros. , not even for 20.Its all just a big grind, and you will getby the comunity. Then all the glitches, bugs and other t that Rockstar could have worked on, but no! Lets push out some more overpriced t like new cars for ing 2 million per car ...The support is also a giant joke, a cheater gets banned, then he calls the support and he gets his account back. But the normal players who like the game and work for their well, they take their money for no good reason. And after almost 800 hours I threw this piece ofof my pc. I just wanted to warn you about this piece of called game or as I like to call it fest ofquot!
