A bit overpriced, but its exactly what Id want from a GTA game. Great story, characters, the conflict between those characters, subtle humorous social commentary and a fun map to play with. Buy it when its on sale.Word of advice.. NEVER play online. Online is HOT.... GARBAGE...Online is like what youd get if you got a 13 year old GTA fanboy, who the only other game hes played is Call of Duty, and paired him alongside a greedy businessman whos only inspiration is the money he makes and then told them both to develop a game. Abhorent ammount of microtransactions Basically just club penguin with guns Hardly any campaign whatsoever Punishes you for starting rampages which is what you SHOULD be doing in a GTA game A simple denim pair of pants will cost you 50,000 dollars Promotes stupid trendy social media culture, the same culture that is mocked occasionally in singleplayer Hardly any missions to keep you entertained Despite how frequently updated it is, theres basically zero content No punishment for the eunterage of cheaters that plague almost every server Hilariously bad character customizationIts just a complete basturdization of any substance that GTA offers you. The beauty of the GTA series to me is how it appears to be senseless violence with no consequences on the surface, but each game has a deep underlying message that isnt forced into your face, wrapped nicely in wellthought out stories.But Online doesnt have that. Once again I reiterate, the base singleplayer is no masterpiece, but its definitely worth appreciation.
