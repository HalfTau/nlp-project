UPDATE Even though Rockstar has convinced TakeTwo to step down from their initial intent of stopping modding for Grand Theft Auto V, I will not remove this negative review. There is nothing from stopping either company from trying this again. They have made it clear that they do not want people meddling with their games at all, but because of the public backlash from the community, they have reevaluated thier position on this situation.There is nothing worse than a company not caring about the community they created with their game and just placing their focus on finding more ways to encourage people to pay them even more money.
