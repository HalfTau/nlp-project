To many Random bans for no reason. i was playing with my fried and a modder was in our lobby we leave and get off. the next day we get up start the game and we have a ban for modding?We didnt even do anything the modder kept killing us and now we have a ban for doing nothing. luckily it was a temp ban then out of nowhere i was playing with my friend can and he gets banned right in fromt of me and me and him were doing missions to get our ranks and money back.
