Honestly GTA V used to be fun, however with the recent updates it has become a real shtshow they are free though, so i guess thats a plus. The game has become broken, with long waiting times to join sesions, and connectivity issues. You have to either buy their dumb sharkcardsin order to buy the stuff that comes with the updates.. Or you can grind for 3 days to buy an airplane that is fun for 3 hours. The fun to grind ratio is way off which makes playing the game feel like a chore. Also the whole modding thing kind of sucked you can look it up.So generally is GTA V worth buying? No.Can it be fun? Yes sometimes, but not enough.
