You Either Die A Hero, Or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain. What used to be hands down the best action PC game due to its endless stream of new online content and one of the best single player experiences of the last decade, has become a cash grab, which is nothing but a mindless grind which you can only avoid by either paying hundreds of Dollars or not buying this game at all. I recommend the latter. Now as an added bonus, this game doesnt even support modding anymore, which was its final nail in the coffin. Take it from a player, who has played hundreds of hours of this game and spent hundreds of Euros on it. Its not worth your time anymore. Dont support greedy publishers like Take 2.
