The single player is fine, typical GTA gameplay but with 3 characters.  IMO the best GTA game so far.  The multiplayer is a different story however.  A painfully abismal experience that proves that TakeTwo are soley in it for money.  Luckily enough because TakeTwo forces Rockstar to hastily post new patches frequently there are plenty of exploits and mods that make getting money easy enough.  But be wary that Rockstar has been banning people for doing such things.  In short.  Good single player.  But the multiplayer will make you want to abandon the developer and publisher all together.
