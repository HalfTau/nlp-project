Bought the pc version of GTA V just for the mods, already owned it on ps4 and now Rockstar shuts down OpenIV, nice. Besides that, no new singleplayer content, atrocious grinding in GTA Online, real money for ingame cash and so on. Btw, just tried to start the game after the update had finished, doesnt work anymore. you Take2!
