Good game... some of the missions in the single player are Really pointless though. The open world sets 2014 standards. but now in 2017 zelda outdoes it. Its a good purchase if you have the minimum requirements. things will glitch out if you have barely lower. People complain about the loading speed but as long as the game is on an ssd its fine.
