 you Rockstar/Take 2 Interactive. You ruined singleplayer modding for GTA V. My favorite part of GTA V. Dont buy this game, these devs and producers dont deserve the money. This tells you how they will be with RDR 2, a reason not to buy that game either. Not to mention they really only screwed over the good players, as the hackers are still going to ruin multiplayer for this game. All these devs and publishers care about is money, the CEO of Take Two himself doesnt even play games. Its why everything in GTA 5 online is overpriced these days. Cause they only care about the micro transactions.
