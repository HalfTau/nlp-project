LET OPENIV DO WHAT THEY HAVE LEGALLY BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR 10 YEARSI have played more than enough hours to slam this game with a negative review for take twos t.GTA O Has been a disgusting, , wallet soaking joke for years. Everything about is is terrible and cynical.I dont like rockstar anymore just because of GTA O in the first place.This on the other hand has taken it to a new level.  Take Two and  Rockstar.They have lost their way and my support.GTA V Is a massive dissappointment. Years were spent making a beautiful world just to put astory in. And nothing else, ever.  This isnt a game.  Its a veichle for the garbage multiplayer mode.GTA V is an easy 6/10 but removing mods makes it an easy 5/10GTA V Is absolutely mediocre. Dont expect anything more from it than harsh banality. It a struggle to play through its incredible broken and feeble story with about 7 plotlines and only 1 going anywhere and it wasnt anywhere fun.DO NOT BUY
