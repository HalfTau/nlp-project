Overwhelmingly Negative. Thats the response to a recent CD sent out to one of the biggest GTA Modding supports out there. A antimodding statement like that alone is worth all the negativity it deserves. The game already had a bland singleplayer story riddled with ancient tropes that were only excused by a obvious cliche power fantasy, and a online multiplayer with no balance or real reason behind its design to be worth your time investing into.Before the CD people excused and praised GTA because of its high budget game engine, open world, and its willingness to allow mods. Which the developers have stated they support, but issued the CD.Support modding and follow the outcry to punish developers for handicapping their games needlessly for the sake of pathetic profit lines. Theres no other reason to prevent the modding community from prospering and any claims that this will reduce cheating are entirely false as cheating will always be in a game without any major firewall.
