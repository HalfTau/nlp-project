Take two just wants to see the world burn... i mean seriouslythey just went up and banned modding and then didnt even caredafterwards about peoples revolt to reopen Open IV. If they dontcare what people think about the game then what purpose does itdeliver? you should probably UNDO your major mistakes and justkeep it like that otherwise all of your games will only get to a computerthrough piracy and no one will but they ripoff of a game if youdont do what the people say. in this world, the people is more importantthan your stupid policy. Its just like you guys being presidents andyou just fooking declared marshall law, people started a revolution.
