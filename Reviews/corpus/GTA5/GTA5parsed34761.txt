Fantastic game, in every sense of the word.But removing modding support? Killing a community that has brought you nothing but popularity and creavity over the years its grown... I ask why? After all this time, youve had so much potential to keep this title going in the future as something worth revisiting and messing around with. Instead, you do this?Nah. I wont support a title that refuses to support its own community, full stop.
