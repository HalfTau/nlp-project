Amazing game absolutely love it but this is the third time ive had to reinstall it. when i come off the game sometimes the screen goes black and doesnt do anythign. cant ctrlaltdel or anything and so i leave it for about 10 mins and still nothing, so i turn off my pc to later discover my gta is uninstalled. Plz fix!
