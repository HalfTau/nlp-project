This is the worst game Ive ever wasted money on, even at 30 when it was 50 off. Ive  not used any mods or been rude toward any players, but still got an email today saying my account has been permanently banned and Rockstar states on their sites that all bans are finaly and cannot be appealed. This poor excuse for a company is charging players for a game then revoking access to the game and basically stealing from their customers. I cant believe we have to deal with a pathetic company like this in 2017, and I will not be buying any rockstar games or titles that have anything to do with Rockstar in the future.
