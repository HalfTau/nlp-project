After all this mods fiasco Id return the game if I could, I hate supporting this kind of studios. Although I understand them for not wanting mods, and theyve designed it specifically for not having mods, but I dont agree with it.Mods are one of the reasons all GTA games have replayability, if it wasnt for them youd play the game only a few times and thats all.I know that right now Take2 are whiping their tears with the money weve gave them up to this point, but in the future theyre not seeing a dime from my pocket until they dont change these practices.
