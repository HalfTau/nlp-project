Ya blew it lad. Enjoyable but not great singleplayer, abysmal online system with issues that havent been fixed for TWO YEARS now, an online model that looks more like a free to play Korean MMO where you either grind for months to get decent stuff or pay exorbitant amounts of money just to barely afford some of the things. All this  despite the game being a highproduction AAA 60 video game from the second most profitable franchise of all time behind Mario,Greedy, dull, bythenumbers sequel that I wouldnt recommend to anyone for more than 20 bucks at the most, especially in light of Take Two  on the modding community by killing OpenIV despite the fact that hacks for GTA Online DO NOT USE OpenIV.
