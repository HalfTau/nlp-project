Pros Very open world anything from yoga, to golf, swimming, tennis, bike rides, diving, etc Very diverse world Beautiful graphics Storymode is fun and packs great characters with all different personalities The ability to replay a missionCons Multiplayer has plenty of hackers/griefers Multiplayer can take forever to load Mutiplayer servers arent the best at detecting hackers Random bans on multiplayer even if you dont hack Shark cards are a complete rip offConclusion GTA V is extremely beautiful, very open world and has a nonlinear singleplayer experience. Multiplayer is iffy.Get GTA V if you mostly player singleplayer, otherwise find a better game suited for multiplayer.
