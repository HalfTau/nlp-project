Theres no other game Id play to relax as much as I do in this one.The graphics are stunning and theres a high variety of music for all tastes.Although the online community is a bit polluted by cheaters and such, you can always choose to go in an online session by yourself.My opinion might be biased due to the fact that I grew up playing GTA games, but I strongly recommend this one and i hope the next one will be just as good or even better.
