I recommend the single player so far. Believe Im at 67 and its quite enjoyable.Played a little bit of the multiplayer and didnt like how Im forced to group up with people to complete missions. Kind of wanted to level up solo and then play with others. Especially since there was only one person around your level, perhaps a second for a random mission.
