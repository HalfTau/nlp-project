A oncefun Online experience RUINED by the sheer amount of idiotic players who dont know basic respect and insist on high payouts in heists despite their sheer incompetance.Examples include Gunners who cannot shoot worth a damn, Pilots who spam the Cannons on Hydras, yet are unable to fly or land both jets and helicoters BIG Problem with this one properly or execute simple flight patterns to evade missiles, and people who think that just because they wear a snazzy outfit and look tough, that they are somehow bulletproof Mr AI NPC begs to differ.Hackers and griefers also come after you in Public sessions, necessitating the near consistant usage of Passive Mode.When you do manage to kill them, they insult you, which begs the question of what is a smarter tactic. Is it spamming automatic fire, or actually WORKING AS A TEAM WITH TACTICS to kill these annoying idiots.Also, many players, ESPECIALLY the mainland chinese tend to use the public voice chat as their own personal chatroom, spoiling the experience for others.
