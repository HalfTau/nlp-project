UPDATE TakeTwo backtracked  I am happy.Short and simple I bought this game on three platforms  most recently, PC. I bought it on PC with the intention to mod it to my hearts content. Because of TakeTwos decision to shut down the popular modding tool, OpenIV, I can no longer mod the game. Until this issue is rectified, I will not be purchasing any products put out by TakeTwo.
