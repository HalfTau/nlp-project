Have been hacking for pretty much the entire life of the game on console  pc. Reading comments of people who have never hacked getting money reset and baned. Still awaiting my first ban. Also the game is grindy and basically reskins of other dlcs every couple of months as they charge 99 for 8 million in game currency on a game that was released in september 2013 that they still charge 60 for. Its a joke. I see more begging for money in a 60 4 year old game then on a free game from the google play store...
