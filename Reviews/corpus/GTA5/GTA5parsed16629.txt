its hard to recomend this game to anyone right now the game itself isnt bad but what take 2 has done with the online is atrocious they make it to where you have to spend all day and night every day for a week to build up enough money to do anything they seriously need to up the payout ammounts for things to make online even plausable especially for a new player or new to online back befor this update they had it to where exporting cars was worth youre time via the 200000 dollar payout that was sweet but then they put out new dlc which is literally just the same dumb crate missions polished up with the samepayout they need to up the reward for spending millions on a wearhouse or hanger seriously 500,000 for 50 crates is not worth it you have to have other players help you to make it fast enough to payout well but why would other players want to help you they get even ier pay for helping you this games needs a serious ballancing of the online either they need to make payouts higher or things cost less but they wont becuase they just want to sell shark cards hand over fist bad business practises from such a respected company like rockstar maybe you guys should get more involved in online and take it back from take 2 who are making you look seriously bad
