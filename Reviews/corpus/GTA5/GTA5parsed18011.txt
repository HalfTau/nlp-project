Single Player is great, having the right equipment makes your game look amazing. Online however is another story.In my hours of gameplay it seems as if every other online lobby you join has some sort of modder who teleports you anywhere and does whatever he wants in the game. Getting banned or reported doesnt deter them either. Controls for this game on keyboard i guess it takes on getting used to but i prefer a gamepad. I wish i had not bought this version and instead ported my character from ps3 to xbox one but saddly you can only port it once to pc. I wouldnt recommend getting this game on PC and suggest console. The only positive thing about this PC version is in the online you can type to communicate with players where you cant do that well or fast on console.
