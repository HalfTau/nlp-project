the game developers end Character Tansfer and for this they deserve so much hate. I am a perfect example of why this is such a bad thing. IVE SPENT HOURS grinding gta on xbox 360 then on ps4 and i just made a pc and i got gta during the summer sale happy to continue............. BUT there is no more character transfer.... and im sure as hell not gonna replay back to level 100 somthing. I had to grind roof top rumble probably for like over a few eternites when the game came out, I SPENT SO LONG TO GET WHAT I HAD just for it to be ended as al my friends migrated to pc before me and played gta. now im here with a TERRIBLE character while all my friends are rich and have the high life. and i cant go back to my ps4 ever because all my friends accounts are on pc and none want to play on such an inferior method of gaming. so i have to start over and never have actual nice things in the game because of how everything in this game now is way to expensive of in game currency to even have any of the cool content . which makes people spend money on shark cards to get in game content. whoever is behind the marketing of gta is overly greedy to the point it ruins the product to many that use it. and whoever is behind some of the GTA decions like character transfer may be trying to eliminate hackers and what not but it RUINS the game for others. if i would known that before my purchase i would have never of considered giving Rockstar Games TM a third purchase of this game. I really hope they keep acting dumb like the modding insident because the pc community can destroy companies if angered, wouldnt it be a shame if the community tried flexing on Rockstar Games TM, I dont think many things could withstand the hatred of the PC community. PC Masterace! power to the player! bye Losers!..
