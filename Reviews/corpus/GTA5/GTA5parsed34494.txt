This game is very fun game. Ive played this game for along time on many platforms. Ive been seeing alot of cry babies complaining that they cant mod anymore well thats too bad because the game was made like it is for a reason so play it how it was ment to be played. So dont mass downvote a good game because you cant mod anymore most people play online because single player is boring and most people have FRIENDS to play with online. Bottom line its a good game and you cant rely on the reviews
