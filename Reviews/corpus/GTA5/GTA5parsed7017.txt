This game is an amazing collection of dreams and ideas brought to life through the storytelling only an award winning author could tell, but if that story was yanked off the pages of the book and formatted into an interactive movie. With a series of events told from three different perspectives that are both challenging and entertaining for the player. And if youre here for online, try to ignore the negative reviews and just play. If theres a modder or hacker in your lobby, just leave it. If you cant find a good lobby, just play with friends. If you dont have friends that play GTA then join a private lobby or do a job. There usually arent many modders in jobs as there are in free mode. Simple solutions to otherwise simple problems.
