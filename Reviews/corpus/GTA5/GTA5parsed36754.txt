Im leaving a negative review because TakeTwo sent a Cease and Desist to the OpenIV team. OpenIV is a modding software that helps enables a MASSIVE ammount of mods for Gta V and Gta IV. Basically modding is illegal so I am leaving this negative review. The game is okay, but this No Modding Policy is ridiculous and I will not stand for it.
