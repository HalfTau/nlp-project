Taketwos mod policy has taken away any reason i had left to play this game, deffinitly not worth the 30 dollars for the summer sale. wait for it to be 15 dollars, or get it on probably the last rockstar game i ever purchase, like ea, they have decided harming the customer for money is more important than keeping people.  The only regret i have is i cant get  my money back
