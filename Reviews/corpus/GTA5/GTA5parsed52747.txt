Well all in all the single player game is great loved it a lot.But sadly modding now is illigal for this platform so if your looking for a game where you can mod proberly not a game for you.Overall game is good but a thumbs down for ZERO modding support.Edit...Decided to change my rateing as it appears Rockstar has decided to step in and geet take2 to back down on single player mods and the developers are takeing to the open four guys to tighten this thing up so a temtative thumbs up.
