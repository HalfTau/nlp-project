So not only was I permantly banned from online twice for no reason whatsoever basically Im permanently banned for literally playing online and not buying sharkcards, whatever I figured because I still enjoy the single player in the grand theft auto series, I would try modding single player this was my first game to ever try mods. That was to this day the best decision I have ever made in terms of gaming. Of course, money hungry take 2 and r, they figured it would be a genius idea to remove mods from single player... well, take a look at the recent reviews... yeah, no. They ruined this game for me, making it unplayable. I used to enjoy these games, but I feel I can no longer support r nor take 2.
