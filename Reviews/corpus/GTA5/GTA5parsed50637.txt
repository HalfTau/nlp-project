Mods were negative experience to the game, they really hindered my immersion into the world of GTA as honestly i find that some of the mods created by these devils were unrealistic and downright satanic. Overall i hate the game anyway but i have always found mods to be an overall negative and infidelic experience for me personally. Take two are my personnel saviours.
