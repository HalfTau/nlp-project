Where to begin? Its GTA. An awesome game in both Multiplayer and Singleplayer. However, due to the last developments envolving those f A in Take Two Interactive, the modding community was damaged and severly impaired. RIP OPEN IV, you guys made gaming even more fun! Hope the A at Take Two realize how bad they F up... Sorry for the language, but this realy pisses me off...
