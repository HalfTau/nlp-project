If you are buying this for singleplayer, go for it. No cons. If you are buying for online I can no longer recommend this game. I think its great that Rockstar keeps putting out great new content, weapons, and vehicles but they make everything so hard to get. You barely earn any money for job and even heists proportionate to the costs of all the things they add. Before it wasnt much of a problem because modders could drop money and you didnt have to grind for days. But now with the new anticheat no one is modding. They also cracked down really hard on money glitches which is also pretty annoying. Overall the game itself is one of my favorite games I ever played, but it feels like you cant play a lot of the things you want because you cant buy them if that makes any sense.
