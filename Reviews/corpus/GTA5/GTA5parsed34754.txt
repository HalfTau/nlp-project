Take2 and Rockstar Games have turned their backs on their most important customers, the modding community.  Their ham fisted approach banning all modding wont protect their online community from hackers.  It will only serve to remove the joy that tens of thousands of people gain from using GTA V as a platform for their creativity.  There is an obvious solution to fighting hackers ruining the online economy of GTA, remove the online economy.  Make the game a sandbox and free for all and let this game run its course.  Or pinch your last penny from a truly alienated fan base whom will no longer stand for your exploitation.
