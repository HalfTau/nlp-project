I think this game worths every penny, incredibly fun storyline, great and funny characters and of course the freedom of GTA. Havent tried the multiplayer yet, but honestly Im not that much interested in it anyways, I just think of it as an added bonus if I ever get bored of the single player campaign, that I doubt haha.
