This is the 3rd time I bought this game, and I mainly bought it to mess around with mods in Single Player, as GTA Online is a cesspool of pain and misery. Seriously, if you want to have fun in Online you should have played two years ago, because otherwise those days are gone with just the endless grind to get anything of substance. Besides, you can get all Online only content in SP with mods so you arent missing much on terms of content asides from missions, and the modding community has you covered on that as well. However, you better have some serious hardware available if you want to run it properly,  as this game is highly CPU intensive and will often push the limits of what your rig can do. However, if you can run the game, get it, the story is an amazingly polished and enjoyable single player experience that really can only be found from a Rockstar Games title.
