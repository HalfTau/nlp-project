Not a bad game...I spent hour playing this game only in multiplayer since I had done story on xbox 360 when it was released.I spent 3 entire days grinding and only had half a million dollars and bought the armored kuruma.After I got it I was bored.Kept playing.Cheated in some money.Bought cars.got banned.Kept cars.Sold car.Bought company.Got more cheats.Cheated in tons of money.Never got banned.Had fun.Now Im bored.After you get tons of money from grinding Its boring.The only goal of multiplayer is to grind untill there is nothing left to buy and then become bored.Never spent a penny on microtransactions. Good advice.If you bought a shark card I am sorry for you.Waste of money.If you got as much money as Walter White did in breaking bad from selling 40lbs of meth, this game would be better, but since you have to grind for weeks to earn 1 million dollars and a fun part of the game The Opressor is three times that amount there is no fun. only pain.Long Story short, dont buy this game if you havent already.I dont know why content gets added that most people will never get to see or use.
