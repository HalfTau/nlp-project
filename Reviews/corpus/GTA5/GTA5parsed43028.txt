I wasnt going to follow in the trend of leaving a negative review on behalf of OpenIV. In fact, but Ive found more reason to dislike TakeTwo. This began when TakeTwo announced that they thought GTA 5 was undermonetised. Anyone who has visited the store page can tell this is false, and anyone who has played knows this is outrageous. It pisses me off more than it should because the existing and extreme monetisation is for GTA Online, which is why I havent seen story mode updates that Ive been wishing for since Day 1. On top of this, the game is four years old and is still generating income from the current monetisation, which is of course orchestrated with their outrageous pricing and constant introduction of even more expensive content. To declare this undermonetisation is ridiculous. Skyrim is only two years older than GTA 5. I guarantee TakeTwo has received more money from the current monetisation than Bethesda has seen from the Special Edition, or any sales in a while for that matter. Now, is this the result of greed or just a stupid person in a position to make decisions? I got my answer when TakeTwo attacked OpenIV. There is no possible way an intelligent person would make such an advance on the very community that generates the constant flow of income. And so, maybe when TakeTwo notices the drop in sales, they will realise that this will not just blow over. But, even when that happens, Im not going to forgive TakeTwo.
