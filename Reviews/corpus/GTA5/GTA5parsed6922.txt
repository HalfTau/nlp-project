First of all, gta online is updated once every two or three weeks. In order to play gta5 on steam, I have to update gta online because its the same game. Today there was a 2.8gb update to gta online. With my potato internet, thats 4 hours of downloading... and i cant even play gta online because of my slow internet... big bs waste of time. i like gta5 but half the time i cannot play it.good game though. i dont use mods so rockstars recent moneygrab doesnt affect me, this review is just informative to people with really slow internet.
