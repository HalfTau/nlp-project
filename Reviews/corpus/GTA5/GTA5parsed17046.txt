I have never had so much fun in a single player campaign before..Sure, Online Mode can be the mainly focused part of this game and many people might be complaining about it since there are alotta chaotic cheaters there but if you just get friends and go to passive mode doing many activities such asexploring strangers yachtstrying to climb mount chiliad with bad carsstuntsfinding UFOsraces and comunity made modesetc.can be found very fun to do!and just beacause there are alot of cheaters in multiplayer and how the online anti cheat system doesent quite do its job properly doesent mean you gota complain about the ENTIRE game! This is probably RockStars first attempt on making an ONLINE mode with many many players on the same map of course something will go wrong give them a chance Im sure theyll mke it better next time if red dead redemtion 2 gets an online mode too!
