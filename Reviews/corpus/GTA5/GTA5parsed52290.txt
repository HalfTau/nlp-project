EDIT  Take two have finally revoked their statement about modding, for this reason i am changing this from a negative review to positive.  Take this as a warning not to  with your fanbase you takeTwo fukkers.48 hours ago i would have recomended this to any and everyone.  But due to recent... developments from take two i know say avoid this game and anything that they own like the plauge. This is comming from someone that has almost a week of play time in GTA and loves the xcom series which is also made by a company that take two owns.  This is not a decent and proper way to support your fanbase.So i think i can safely say  TAKE TWO
