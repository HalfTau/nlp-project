It is truly shocking that, even now, game developers can be so stupid. Theres being dumb, and then theres seeing your own fanbase as a competitor. Anything we get for free is something you arent charging us for, I suppose  thats why you cut essentially all mod support, right?With the recent blast of mod controversy with companies like Bethesda, for Rockstar and TakeTwo to pull such a stupid move really shows what kind of people are in charge.
