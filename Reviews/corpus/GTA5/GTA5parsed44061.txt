The story is fine but quite dull and uninteresting, the online aspect is just awful, very repetitive boring missions, online is basically Grind for hours and buy a new weapon while avoiding cheaters and greifers unless of course you want to skip the grinding by paying for some shark cards. I even find GTA IVs primitive online mode much more fun than GTA Vs.Mods were the only thing that made this game fun which sadly Take Two has decided to screw up. This game as it stands is okay but not that special, and not worth the price, at least I will have 70 GB after I uninstall for a better game to occupy.
