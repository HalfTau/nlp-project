I spent 64 hours palying mainly heists or other sources to make money. Then I get probaly about 3 mil in hacker mony whcih is the only way I was able to buy even the most basic The new gunrunning stuff comes out and I buy my barracsk wasting the 2 million I had saved up. THE ONLY WAY I CAN TRANSFER MY GUNS IS IF I SPENT MORE MONEY WHICH I DONT FEEL LIKE GRINDING ANOTHER 60 HOURS FOR. In conclusion Take Two expects their fans to spend more moeny on their game to have any actual fun. Oh and campaing dlc never came
