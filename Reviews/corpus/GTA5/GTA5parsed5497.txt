Grand Theft Auto 5 is a hellhole made by greedy s who cant imagine themselves letting any amount of money slip through their grasp. The singleplayer is fine, decent playthrough, but lacking sorely in entertainment and expedition. The multiplayer, where they put all their money into, is designed to be difficult to get anywhere without buying yourself through it. It is disappointing I was hoping for a fun, satisfying game to drive tanks and run over innocent civilians. Instead I got a place where the rich but all of their vehicles and guns with realworld money, and those who want to have a good time are shoved out of the way at 200 miles per hour in a desperate attempt at whatever job may be happening. This game is not only frustrating, disappointing, and angering, but it is also made by selfish, greedy jerks who cant give themselves, by tricking others into their scheme, anything less than the best their possibly is. I had faith after the early GTAs this has put an end to that expectation.
