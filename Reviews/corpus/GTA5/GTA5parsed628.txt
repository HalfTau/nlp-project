The game is currently riddled with hackers. Every server you go on theres a 90 change there will be someone currently using mods in that server. The game has a lot of interest aspects and eastereggs amoung other things. But the hackers ruin it for everyone. I encounter four hackers today alone, most from China. Im giving this game a 3/10 with hackers. If Rockstar would get off their asses, I would give it a 9/10.
