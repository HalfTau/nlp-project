Take Two shutting down OpenIV is detrimental to the Grand Theft Auto community on PC.Rockstar and Take Two have stripped one of the best features of this game that previously allowed for extensive customization and creativity that led to countless new gameplay experiences in the world of Los Santos, that reached far beyond the scope of the original game. Instead of taking the route of Bethesda and embracing the modding community, they have decided to shun it entirely, and in doing so they have destroyed what used to make Grand Theft Auto IV and Grand Theft Auto V some of my favorite games.I can no longer recommend this game due to the moneygrab it and particularly GTA Online has become. Had I known Rockstar was willing to take such a hostile approach to modding, I wouldnt have bothered buying this game for a third time for PC after already owning a copy for Xbox 360 and Xbox One.I am greatly disappointed with Rockstar and Take Two they used to be the best.
