Single Player is just one another awsome story you see in this franchies, while the online gets me frustrating sometimes.Speak from my feelings in my heart, this online mode is a place where its full of hackers and modders. And the balance dues to those powerful vehicles and equipments for a person like me, who didnt spent much time in it is just seems a little off. U really have to spent some real time to get those, which to me so far theres not a chance to even touch them. More problem been I was often stuck at the loading screen when I finished a job or joining a new session, waited for like 7 or 8 minutes only to find theres some sort of problem since it usually take a long time too, only somewhat shorter to know that somethings not right.Overall I DO RECOMMAND this game lol, but for the reasons above and yes, they are all, or partially rockstars fault, I have go with thumbs down, just to let them know something in their game arent really making some of us happy.
