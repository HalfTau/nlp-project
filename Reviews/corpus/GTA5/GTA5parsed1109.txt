The only thing i hate  about this game when i buy it. The Social Club, i mean its not that bad when i first sign in but the next time and some time i play GTA V it doesnt let me sign in, or doesnt even let me do anything on social club, i cant click anything or do anything. Then how the ! would you even play if you cant sign in!!! But that just sometime, maybe it doesnt happen to you. That doesnt mean i hate GTA V, the games had a great mechanic and great story, its just the WTF Social Club thing.
