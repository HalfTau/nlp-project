This is one of the greatest games ever made, ruined by the desire for profits. People used mods because the base game play is so grindy that it feels like it was designed with the sole purpose of making you purchase a shark card. I wouldnt mind this so much if shark cards werent so overpriced. 20 dollars for 1.25 million dollars? Are you  me? Thats about half of some of the high end cars in the game, an even smaller fraction of a modified car or many of the other toys you can buy. The grind for money isnt fun, neither is paying real money for paltry amounts of online cash especially when things like musical horns for cars are 25000 and mines are 5000 a pop.Either drastically increase the payouts, give way more money for shark cards, alla 1m/1 to start or better yet get rid of them altogether.Or allow mods.I have never modded V myself. did mod IVP.s. remember when we petitioned to get GTA on the pc platform at all? Irony.Edit I was gonna change this review to positive after the whole OpenIV problem was resolved, but just did a full half hour mission and the game took my supplies, but gave me no cash. This has happened more than once. smh.
