I have spent hundreds of hours on PC and hundreds of hours on XBox consoles and overall it is an amazing game but just know, you as a player are not special to Rockstar, only your wallet it.Recently there was a massive douvle money and RP event for Gunrunning and I spent around 12 hours a day, every single day of the event and earned nearly 14 million dollars from this and yesterday all but around 300,000 was removed from my account. This was 100 legitimately earned income that Rockstar provided a way to earn and they come in like I see you spentloads of time playing our game and really like it....well  you for earning money instead of buying shark cards.This is not the only occurance. Before Gunrunning came out I grinded around 20 million dollars with the CEO special vehicle cargo and special cargo missions and day 1 of Gunrunning they removed all but 20,000.Youd think it would be a small mix up and the provision of proof to Rockstar Support would solve the issue.Nope.After submiting a support ticket to Rockstar, I was given the robot generated blanket response that they use for people asking for their money back, real or not.Hello Insert Player Name,Thank you for contacting Rockstar support. Your shared bank account in GTA Online was adjusted to remove illegitimately gained ingame money. For more information please see.Best regards,Randomly picked Rockstar Support Agent.That link? It just sends you to a  you page saying that they are aware that modders are handing out illegitimate money and are trying to create a fail playing envioronment. Its great that they are doing this but them falsly taking innocent peoples money and having a robot say uck you when providing the game data they ask for, plus screenshots of my money and its subsequent removal, links to live streams and videos proving the money I earned was real and leaving me with nothing to do but hate my life for wasting so much time with such a  company.TLDRVery fun game and make for many many hours of fun but you could randomly be crippled by Rockstar for not buying enough shark cards.
