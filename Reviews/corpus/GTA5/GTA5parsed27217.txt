Due to legal action by Take Two, the most popular modding tool for this game has been taken down. As a result, the majority of mods no longer function. This sort of corperate greed is something that we as a community can not support, reguardless of the quality of the games. Until this decision is reversed I will not purchase any games published by Take Two, and I encourage evedyone else to do the same.
