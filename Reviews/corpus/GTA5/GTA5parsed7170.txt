Hey. Most likely you are viewing this wonderful text before purchsing the actual game. I just wanna say thatnks to Rockstar Games for releasing such a wonderful game, with good atmosphere, a big goal to reach, which makes you wanna play more and more. You get such satisfaction when you complete your goal, buya bunker or a car. Im talking about online now. When it comes to story mode, its good, not brilliant though, but very fun when you complete it and have 30 mil to spend.Should you get it?If you have a 25 hours to spare, than steal your moms money and BUY IT NOW. If not, you will enjoy it, but you need to spend more time ingame to get the full experience.
