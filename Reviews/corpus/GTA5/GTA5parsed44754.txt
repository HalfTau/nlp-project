Ive been a mega fan of the GTA series since GTA3 released, Ive never missed one installment to this franchise and am very saddened to see how corporate its become. I think its time The company reconsiders the name Rockstar because now it composes itself a bit more like Overbearing MotherThe  what the censors say attitude has slowly died from this companys creative driving force and Rockstar has now become just like the rest, a giant corporate money printer that used to be fun and a bit off color at timesthank god they took away the mods so I cant load them into the server and make things chaotic, can you imagine if I were able to get armored cars with guns mounted on them or some sort of mobile command unit that allows me to kill people from across the map sight unseen? That would make GTA so much less fun...
