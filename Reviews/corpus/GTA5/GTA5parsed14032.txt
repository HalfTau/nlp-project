I will not be purchasing another R product because they allow cheater/modders/hackers to run havock on every public server.  Trapping players in cages and raining items on them until their game crashes. Getting a guitar shoved up myand shot into outer space.  Being turned into a christmas tree.  Frozen in place and abused.R failed to pick a side between their legitamate cutomer base playing fair and a bunch or cringy modders who roleplay in order to escape the pathetic sweaty reality.  R tried to appease both bases of consumers and will crumble from within because of this choice.  Many like me will let gta5 be the last R product they ever purchase because R is just another greedy video game company gutted from the inside by corparatists trying to devalue the integrity of their product and sell en mass.Just wait until you see LOOT BOXES in all future R products.  Buy SHARK CARDS to purchase loot boxes.All this aside after writing this review I will be tirelessly trying to get back on a public server on GTA V Online that isnt full of cancerous greifing modders, because IT IS ING FUN!!!MODDERS ARE RUINING THIS GAME THOUGH  I broke a monitor because I raged so hard!!!please put a trigger warning on all your future games R
