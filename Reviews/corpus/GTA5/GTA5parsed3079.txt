Had a lot of fun in Singleplayer and doing the handful of heists with friends over and over again in a private lobby.Tried public lobbies for a bit and legit had a hacker in every other lobby I connected to.Can only recommend if it goes on a good sale and you have no intention of playing in public lobbies, otherwise its not worth your money.
