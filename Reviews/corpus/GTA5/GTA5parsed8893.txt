Definitely not for those without a good computer. The game is actually pretty easy to finish the main story fairly quickly which is a bit upsetting, and then overall the offline gameplay can get repetitive. But overall it is fairly enjoyable. Just needs more entertaining offline content. And it would be nice to earn money offline in more ways as well.
