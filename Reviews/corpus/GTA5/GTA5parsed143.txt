after 600h i am ready for thisSO the game itself is wonderful. Open world where you can do almost anything.So why is this a negative review then?One word. ROCKSTARRockstar ruins this game with shark cards and banning people for no reason.Also if a modder gives you money you get banned pretty easily.If you get a moneydrop the only thing you can do is to leave session and pray for your account.Also getting money is hard and new updates require more and more money all the time.Dont get me wrong i love the game. I jsut dont appreciate Rockstar much.Peace  Dampe
