Edit As promised, I have edited my review as Rockstar have joined talks with OpenIV and allow development to continue while they target other sources of cheats and mods for Online only. I do recommend the game but we wary it can get dull fast if you dont have some friends to tag along with Online.The Online section is a hellhole where each update is painstakingly designed to be overpriced and encourage the overpriced sales of their Sharkcards to actually get anything without an excessive amount of grinding to earn enough money to set up a business to earn some money back.The single player is really enjoyable however. Its really well paced and will keep you going for a long time.Forget it, returning to negative review. yet another Online update for masses of vehicles and planes which require further things such as hangars in order to buy in the first place. I can let it slide if it were cheap but its not. At this point I cant be bothered with even more grinding to get something new without paying for a shark card
