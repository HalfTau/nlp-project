The game used to be good. Now they add content that costs so much, its almost impossible to buy half of it. Also, they forced OpenIV to stop development on its modding tool that only affected single player. Im never going to buy a game from Take2 again. Complete waste of money.Update New DLC. Waste of money. Everything costs a bunch, up to the point where the only way to buy anything is to use Shark Cards. The Devs of this game should be ashamed of themselves for running such a cancerous system for a game.
