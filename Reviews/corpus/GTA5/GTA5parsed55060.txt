the game puts you in a situation purposely where you cant afford all the fun stuff unless you pay for shark cards. basically pay 2 win in gta online. story is good, but online is what people mainly want the game for. also, you cant transfer your character anymore cause they want you to start at the bottom to pay real money for in game money. also the rich get the good stuff to kill you with and you have no chance against people with more money cause they have better stuff.
