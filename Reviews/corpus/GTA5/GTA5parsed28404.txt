I have bought gta5 4 times for most consoles as well as pc. I have had many enjoyable hours playing the game350 on pc alone and well over 1000 if you include the 2 years I played the game on console but take 2 screwed up. I still enjoy the game but they cannot take the right to mod the game away from players. Its unacceptable.
