An incredible game, unfortunately, the most important part of the game, in my opinion, Online, is ruined! Unbelievable prices, shark cards and modding restrictions made a perfect game a complete failure! Rockstar, you already made billions with this game! Do not extort your fans! I already paid for the game, I refuse to pay for Shark Cards! This is not a Mobile Game!AT THIS POINT, I ONLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR THE SINGLE PLAYER!
