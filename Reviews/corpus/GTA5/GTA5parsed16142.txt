I would assume this game is a great method of getting good with mods and hacking, seeing as theres absolutely zero prevention or monitoring of such occurances. Unless, of course, rockstar deems youve aquired more money than they deem acceptable. Which isnt much...Until Rockstar gets its head out of its I wouldnt reccomend this game.
