Rockstar and TakeTwo did a fantastic job on this masterpiece, though there are some slight downsides, it still should go down as one of the greatest games ever made. Easy 10/10For online, Id give it a 9/10 when it was in its first year or 2 of being out. That was GTA 5s prime in my opinion. The reason why I cant give it a ten, is that everything is overpowered now. Otherwise, its great. I have about a month playtime on this, and it was well worth it.
