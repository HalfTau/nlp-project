Ive been playing Grand Theft Auto V for ver 4 years now, originally on Xbox 360, and then PC. The fascinating thing about this game is that even after 4 years of playing, its still a fun and interesting experience. The world of GTA Online has held up so well, and although i may not play as much as i did orginally, i still have a good time when i do. Im excited to see where GTA goes in the future, and if R will take the dynamic of GTAO to a new level.
