The online mode is fun, but the new heists are blocked by microtransaction paywalls. The servers are also horrible, you drop out every 5 minutes or so if it even works.The campaign is great, but they had so much potential wasted with online mode.Dont get me wrong, online is fun if it works, but most of the content is blocked.I cannot recommend the game until these problems are fixed.
