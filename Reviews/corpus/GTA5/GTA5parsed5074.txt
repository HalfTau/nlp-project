I will write an honest review about this game since i have played it for over 1000 hours.If you buy this game for the single player only i have only good things to say.The single player has a good story and gameplay.However when i take a look at online im very dissapointed!Rockstar decided not to make any proper anticheat system but ban randomly, And yes sadly legit players will get ed more by it then modders.Example you are taking a doozy in the toilet so ur afk ingame, A modder joins in drops you a  of money you come back and u dont know what to do.... after a few months Rockstar still didnt delete your money so you decide to spend it.Then suddenly you get a ban  your character gets wiped while the modder that give you the money is still playing and ing legit players.NOT MY STORY BUT READING THE DISCUSSIONS  ROCKSTAR SUPPORT FORUMS EXAMPLEThe online mode is very fun  entertaining if there are no modders with godmode ect there arent many bugs ect so its good.I can recommend this game for everybody but beware and play with caution!Lets hope rockstar did learn from this game and doesnt  up with GTA 6
