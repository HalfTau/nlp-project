Ive been playing this game for years, first on the Xbox 360 and then on steam. I was not a big fan of the multiplayer on either platform so opted to mod my single player. Now since THE main mod script used for single player mods OpenIV has been shut down by Rockstar, I cannot play my save the way I want. I admit I didnt play it all too much on PC but it was a good goto time waster. Rockstar has become so rich they suck now, I mean come on microtransactions, putting updates off for years......not to mention the ridiculous price for a game from 2013.
