Since they gave up on the ridiculous single player mod ban Im recomending the game.The game does deserve it, its great!I only played single player yet as I dont normally enjoy multiplayer games but it is very good as a single player game. From what Ive heard multiplayer is great too if you enjoy it, I hope they can limit hacking without attacking legit mods. Ironically havent used mods on this game yet but its a overwhelming plus on PC games.
