Neutering the modding community really is just the cherry on top of this scat sundae. Other ingredients include Massively inflated prices for items necessary to participate in end game content. Spending millions of dollars just to be ALLOWED to spend millions more on the vehicles you want is pure robbery. Now, you could spend money on Shark Cards, buuuut... Shark Cards give you no value you for your money. 100 for 8.5 million sounds great until you really do the math. If you go the shark card, be prepared to drop 30 for ONE high end super car, or 100 for a Yacht with no clear use. Single player is dead. Its been dead for years, with the now disbanded modding scene being the only thing keeping it relevant. Single player expansions slated for 2014 have yet to ever be mentioned again. Not even a polite lol nah.I genuinely fear for Read Dead Redemption 2 if this is the philosophy going forward.
