There are many aspects of this game to consider, so I will break it down into two obvious catagories, pros and consPROS1. Extremely entertaining2. Massive community3. Tons of content4. Large, but static map5. Very complex6. Very diverseCONS1. By no means is this game PG142. Heavily a PaytoPlay game, or a lot of grinding3. Many modders to screw up your day4. A bug here and there that resets your entire account5. Faulty cheatdetectionsystem6. Normal difficulty is quite difficultAllinall, with the five years it took Rockstar to make the game, it is very professional. It has quite literally THOUSANDS of hours of content while keeping the controls and UI simple. Great leveling system, minus the matchmaking system. In my opinion, the game is worth the full 60, and even more at that, but the game goes on sale frequently. So if you are wanting this game, just wait a couple of weeks and buy it on sale. Also, do a little looking on what the best way to get money is, because it is a definite grind!
