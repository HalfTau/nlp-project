I bought this game when it first came out, only to mod it and play LSPDFR. I had the game on ps4 and loved until the greed of Rockstar started showing. Items being so expensive the only way to buy the best, you need to grind for years or buy there sharkcardsthe reason they make everything so expensive Now no openIV?  Listen to the fanbase or lose the fanbase. YOU rockstar need us more the we need you. Be ashamed!
