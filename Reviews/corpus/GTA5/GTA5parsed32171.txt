I love how people think that a negative review is going to change things. Rockstar and Take Two dont care  50K less sales is like a spoonful of water from a pool as far as financial loss is concerned.They will still make a ton off RDR2They will still sell copies of GTA V and VI when it happens.They dont care if you stop playing in protest. They already have your money.
