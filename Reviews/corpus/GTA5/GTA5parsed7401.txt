Thank you Take2 Interactive for realizing the benifit of allowing mods in single player! GTA V is well worth the price. You can one minute mess around and fly at the speed of sound in a turbo charged toilet, and the next minute you can go online for competetive gaming. Ultimate freedom. The ultimate sandbox game, this will last decades!!
