If your reading this and dont understand why there are 20,000 recent mostly negitive reviews for GTA V, i will try and explain.TakeTwo GTA Vs Publisher has threated legal action against OpenIVA mod that enables almost all other mods for GTA, beacuse they claim that OpenIV allow third parties to defeat security features of its software and modify that software in violation TakeTwos rights and yes that is the exact quote from a legal document... Anyway if you need help translating the legal bit, it basically means that TakeTwo considers mods to be a violation of their rights and there for illegal.This of course is complete t, mods have been a part of pc gaming since pc gaming started, not even to get into the fact that Open IV has been around for a decade without a problem. However this is part of the problem, beacuse mods have just been accepted in pc gaming since it started, the american law has never caught up on this issue. If OpenIV and TakeTwo go to court they could either restore the status quo of moding if OpenIV wins, or modding could become completly illegal if TakeTwo wins, depending on how technically litterate the court is and how good each sides lawyers are. Obviously this is a risk that OpenIVs developer does not wish to take and I do not blame them for that.So what does this all mean together? It means that as of right now 60 of all mods for GTA V have ceased to work and that all mods are in jeopardy of dying off, which is why I and 20,000 other people are doing the only thing they can and telling TakeTwo that we hate this decsion, will not buy their games and vote the ones that we already bought down until they get the message that declaring mods illegal is not a smooth business move.
