I love this game! It really embraces the term PC master race I was very bored of this game after playing to level 200 on ps4 but playing on PC is such a refreshing taste of Grand Theft Auto V.This is a very social game and you can play it however you want, you can just play to get money and try out all the new awesome stuff rockstar adds like a flying bike! or play with your friends to have alot of banter!I highly recommend this game.
