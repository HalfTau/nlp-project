The single player story is great and everyone should enjoy it.But the online component of the game is 98 of the content, and unless youre willing to shell out literall hundreds of dollars on shark cards, the grind in this game is terrible. There is no joy in the grind, the missions avalible are a chore, every thing you do outside of a mission or race is draining money like youd never belive. Just loitering in free roam will cost you some amount of cash every ingame day depending not how many and how big each of your garages or houses are. You can not sell a house you no longer use, you can only replace it with a smaller one, which will drain less money over time. I only play for the online racing, and that is a chore as well, unless you shell out a few million every time they add a new car, you will not stand a chance. Thats not to meantion all the trolls and hackers who will ram and intterupt the race just for the lulz. The online community is pure toxic hate, you cant go for a bicycle ride without being gunned down by some pay to win kiddo in a super tank thing. The lovely world the original devs have created have been completely ignored with the commedically over powered weaponiezed everything with everyone with rocket launchers and explosive round guns.This game is a toxic mess.If you have to have it, buy it on sale, Rockstar does not deserve any money off of this penny pinching greedy fingired companys money vaccume.
