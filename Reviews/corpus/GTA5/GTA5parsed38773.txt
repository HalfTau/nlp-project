Let me get this straight, TakeTwo...The PC port is a couple years old. GTAV Online is the current milk cow on all platforms making you a metricton of money ON ITS OWN. You see people mod the SINGLEPLAYER mode, so you hit OpenIV with a CD because youre worried it might somehow affect Onlines revenue?It will, but not in the way you think. You see, these days people are going to buy the PC port of GTAV because they heard of all the awesome ways you can mod the singleplayer mode, and those very same people will make you money in online mode too at some point. So, yeah, banning singleplayer mods is a GREAT way to impact Onlines sales... NEGATIVELY. Not to mention marginalize the userbase of one of the major platforms GTAV has been released on, who will potentially never buy anythin else you publish ever again.
