It took me 6 days and nights of nonstop downloading to get this, being a 70something G bloody game, of which almost all of that is just graphics, which is why I usually dont bother with Modern games. After all that waiting It wouldnt even get off the launcher, and after a lot of swearing and raging and playing around with the thing and I actually got into the game, I get 5 or 6 FPS again just because of graphics. I already have the game on my Xbox, and I didnt really like it that much, but I wanted to be able to mod it so I could get LSPDFR search for it if you dont know what that is, so I got it on PC just for that. Dont bother with it. Its way too expensive and a huge waste of time and patience, dont bother with it and maybe try GTA 4 instead.
