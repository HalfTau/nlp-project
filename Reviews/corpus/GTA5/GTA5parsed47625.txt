This was once a great game. In some ways, it still is. Its not a game I can recommend with a good conscience though. TakeTwo, who publish the game not Rockstar, who made the game and love and even promote mods have attempted to take a HUGE anticonsumer step by telling us mods are illegal. No exaggeration. They literally sent a legal letter to a prominent modding team telling them that modding is illegal and if they dont stop therell be legal ramifications. Modding has existed as long as gaming on home computres has existed. This is so far beyond acceptable, its like they came out and stated they legally owned the copyright on controllers, or the term video games. An utter joke.Beyond everything else, their target? A singleplayeronly mod. Theres no defence to say its stopping hackers in multiplayer who are costing them money in lost DLCcash sales or ruining the game for others. Not in the slightest.Its fully acknowledged that TakeTwo dont have a legal leg to stand on in this, but theyre so huge that theyd be able to drag out any lawsuit to the point that people trying to fight them would end up running out of money far sooner. AKA the rich jerkoff bullying the poor technique.Go to hell, TakeTwo.
