What the hell happened to GTA? it became a free to play game on mobile, where everything costs a billion dollars and if you want more money, buy a shark card, which go up to 100! if you want this for the single player mods, i think its banned or something. If you want the online, dont even bother. Do not give Rockstar or Take Two a single penny for this game!
