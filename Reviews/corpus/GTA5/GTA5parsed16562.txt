At first, before all these dlcs kept coming out, the game was relatively fun. People were usually either friendly or violent and not just a hacker. Then over time, More of these little updates came out, introducing more content each costing millions more than the last. If you want a good experience playing this game online, its not possible anymore unless you purchase the in game currency for big bucks  million in game for 100 bucks irl Which doesnt last long anymore due to the fact rockstar is a money sucking company that only cares about the money they make.If youre looking for single player modding, thats one of the only things that is actually bearable in this game now.
