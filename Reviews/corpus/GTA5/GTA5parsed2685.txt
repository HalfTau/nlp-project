Recently gta 5 had a mix reviews between good and bad.This is because most poeple now play gta online witch has the most toxic players you will find such as harasser,cheaters and hackers if not those there are curtain mission that you want to do witch will require 4 players that is call heist/setup wicth is a very rewarding mission you will find in online and if any players fail to do there job or die to much depans on difficulty the host chooses you all will lose regardless if your doing great.thats is were I find most poeple were so angry about due to there random partners are hard to listen what your saying or ingoring you during a heist.I personally have encounter these type of players so MANY times and i even lost my temper.The wrost that they can do is to LEAVE during playing heist/setup resulting a complete watse of time because you gain no reward after all those time you been trying with those players over and over again.Aside from the online,gta 5 story mode still give you great time play and give you great story with 3 different charaters on there criminal life.So here i what think about the game.The story mode curtainly will worth your money and time and add additions with mods the community create for the game will give more fun if your only here for singleplayerThe Online will depand.If you dont mind getting bad partners or poeple bothering you or getting ram over with a tank etc most of the time.Then i say these you if worth your money. if you do mind getting bother or dont like working with terrible players most of the time but you still want to play the online i recommand you find a friend who owns gta 5 to play with you or try make friend in the game im actually not so sure about the second recommendation to be honest
