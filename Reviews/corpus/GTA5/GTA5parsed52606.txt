Great work from Rockstar as always, but the 2k publishers just ruined the party for everyone, making mods basically illegal, so whats the point of having this game on pc now? Im sure hackers will be still around, so I really dont see the point in this, as it affects the singleplayer mods. Its really a shame, I cant recommend the game as it is right now.
