Youve probably paid for this game when it came out on PS3/xbox360, then paid for it again when it released on PS4/XB1. Dont get it again for PC because the main draw for this game on PC was online play and the mods. Online completly sucks, the connections are horrible, everything takes forever to connect and being able to connect and play with friends is near impossible. Its a terrible system that is designed only to get you to pay for their microtransactions called shark cards. Check out the prices of the Shark Cards and see if you really want to pay that kind of money to play online, after you have probably already bought this game two times across two different platforms. If you havent heard, they want to get rid of modding in SINGLE PLAYER and be able to control it and monetize it. Everything this company has become is garbage, and is a sad, new reality for what gaming has become. Microtransactions, unfinished games and terrible customer support are the norms now, and if we keep giving these jackass companies our money things will never change. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
