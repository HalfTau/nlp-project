This was such a good, good game.But as its life went on, It seemed the price of it just kept growing and growing.The Game itself is far from cheap, and yet with each new update to GTA Online more and more content is out of reach to the average player without grinding away at repetetive gameplay for hours on end.Or, for the more financially capable, taking a short few minutes to buy a couple of Shark Cards and tipping the scales where a game that is already PaytoPlay becomes PaytoWin.And recent actions, with OpenIV and Wild Bans with no means for contesting that permanently remove access to the content paid for through purchasing the game and/or shark cards have just made Rockstars opinions on Player experience, the Modding community and the general player populice clearThey do not care about the Player.They care about the Players wallet.So to anyone reading this I implore you. Take your hard earned dollars elsewhere.Buy from a company that will use your money to produce good games, for the Communities.You will not find that here.
