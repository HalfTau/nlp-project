After the abysmal way the single player modding community has been treated, the insane delay between console release and PC release, and the disguting monetization of shark cards in the GTA Online mode I can no longer support or play this game or the developer. They will reearn my business when they treat the community correctly. I have uninstalled and I am glad to now have the space for a game made by a better company.
