Do not listen to the positive reviews, Gta V WAS a fun game at first but with the micro transaction and horrible grinding that the game makes you do just to have any fun is NOT worth it. Not only have they destroyed the very fun of this gamemods they also try to make use buy Shark cards just to buy anything in game. The grind takes way too long and even if you have 1 mil, it wont get you anything thats worth it. I repeat DO NOT get this game even if its on sale.
