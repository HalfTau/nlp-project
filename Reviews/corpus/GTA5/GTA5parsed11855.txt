One of my favorite games! The story is fun. The online has even more content. After being out for a few years, Online mode has recieved multiple updates that have added aircraft hangers, new jobs, new cars, buisnesses, and more! The biggest issue is that Online mode used to have far too many hackers, and theyll probably rise again someday. 11/10, but not IGN.
