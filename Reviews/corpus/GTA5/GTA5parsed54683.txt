Online was and always will be the worst aspect of this game. T2 taking down OpenIVs mod tools was the worst way they could go about fighting against the hackers that plague the online portion of the game.At the same time, people dont need to be such entitled dweebs for thinking that theyre paying for a games ability to be modded instead of paying for the base game the devs created.That being said, Modding games on the PC is a major aspect that most developers are smart enough to encourage.If you want mods, theres still plenty of better games out there.
