Ever played a free to play game where you could grind extremely hard to unlock everything? Well this game costs 60 dollars, and no matter how much you grind youll be broke forever because you make no money and everything is absurdly priced. You are forced to buy Shark Cards if you have any hope of getting toptier stuff while still maintaining your real life. On top of that, the modding community and all its amazing work has just been thrown out the window. This is not okay, and if Red Dead 2 turns out like this i will never buy another Rockstar game. Also if were just talking the singleplayer story, go play GTA IV.
