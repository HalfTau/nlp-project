I will not support a game company that does this to its player base. This is my first game review for any game I have but I thought I needed to say this because this must not be aloud to any game that has had such a large modding community as this game has. They need to get their act together and not pull something like this in the future on any of their other games because if they do I will not buy anymore games from them even if they are great. Looking at Red Dead Redemption 2 and it better not have this happen to it or you can forget me buying anything from RockStar ever again!
