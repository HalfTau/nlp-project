Great campaign worth 50hrs, Very fun online,twice as fun with friends. Lots of gamemodes in online , online has additional missions with people from the campaign. Sometimes you can encounter hackers which can be very annoying.The game is very well optimized, playing in 30fps doesnt feel like a complete wreck like other fps games.Online keeps being updated to this day bringing new gamemodes,cars,weapons,missions..If youre really bored playing online or singleplayer, you can always download mods to keep up the fun.Be pickle Rick or have a time travelling car, most of the mods you could think of can be downloaded. mods dont work for online, only singleplayer. And if you have a beast pc you can download better graphics as a mod.For the money this game is worth it.
