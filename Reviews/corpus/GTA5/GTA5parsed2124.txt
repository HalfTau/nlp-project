this game is balls online. no commuication on missions so you just keep starting the missions over and over. no uses headset anymore. mission failed loading screen 5 mins then start it all over again. if you are going to play this online make sure you do it with a squad that knows what they are doing unless you like loading screen simulators. one player is good. but yet again micro transations. onlt 99999999
