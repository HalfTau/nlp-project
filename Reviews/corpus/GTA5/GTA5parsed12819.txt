Grand Theft Auto 5 as well as Grand Theft Auto online are both excellent games however RockStar/RockStar Support is completely useless. After being permanently banned on Christmas day for no reason what so ever had no mods/hacks installed RockStar Support are unwilling to unban my account. I am able to submit a ticket appealing however all I get back is an automated response. This is very  on rockstars part as many people have been banned for unknown/no reason and they are unwilling to respond to anyones requests. For a game people pay a lot of money for and then continue to spend money on overprised shark cards Myself must have spent hundreds of pounds in total you would think that the customer support would be better. Grand Theft Autos Accurate cheat/hack detection is a load ofif it is unable to pick up actual modders and instead bans those playing the game as it was made to be played. As much as I like this game and many others by rockstar I am now unwilling to purchase the game again not because I dont want to pay again but because I feel that it is wrong to give money to a company who is treating its customers with no respect and provides  service. To me these random bans, automated responses saying that all bans are final and forcing people to spend hard earned money on a game they have already payed for once or sometimes more, all sounds like a way for rockstar to earn more money. if 20 of people who have already purchased the game once and have to do so again due to a ban, whether it be a legit ban or a load of rubbish thats going to be one big pay cheque for rockstar. you RockStar
