This game is amazing, and although it does have some problems like hackers, microtransactions and the Take Two situation its still a great game. The singleplayer mode is very funny, exciting and I like how theres multiple characters and they each have their own story. Los Santos is also beautiful, it didnt feel empty or repetitive, its filled with different neighbourhoods, buildings, regions and acitivites, but it couldve been a bit bigger, because it does feel pretty tiny at times. The online part of it is fun as well. I have encountered a few cheaters one of them even gave us a bunch of money, which was kinda annoying since I wanted to work my way up but its just as fun as singleplayer. Theres a lot more activites and races you can do, and theres many ways to earn money and RP points. Something that I also liked was Rockstar Editor and the Director Mode, its a little restrictive but you can still have a lot of fun making movies and editing them and making them look like an actual production. There is some minor flaws with this game but its still fun to play even today.
