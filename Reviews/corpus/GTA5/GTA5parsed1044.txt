i have played this game quite a bit. I would definently say this game comes onto the catorgory of classic. by the fact that the story mode regards of age is a well devoloped adventure with every thing a good story need good charactors, high stakes, good enviroment etc. You really get to do what ever you want. Once you get to th end game you own multimillion dolars companys and have the fate of everyone in your hands.GTA online is a completly differnt story. It may be made on the same engine by the same people and you get with the game but it is notr the same. It is one of the games that when watching youtubers play gta online you get this urge to go buy it and play it. then once youve downloaded the game and finnished the hour long loading screen you gtet dumped into a  huge universe with other people flying around in there attack chopper blowing you up as you try to steal a hatchback car so you can get your first job. after this happens for countless hours you start to get drwan to buy shark cards. This is the problem you nned shark cards. I happend to start off with 1.250.000 becuase of the version i bought. But even that amount was not enough to actually get me started. you need to spen another 404 on shark card once you bought the game just to afford a busness so you can really start making money.so to sum up this GTA online is fun but it is very exspensive fun
