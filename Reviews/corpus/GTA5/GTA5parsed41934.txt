I can understand TakeTwo attacking online hackers and taking down the developers of mod menus that has caused so much hassle in the online community, but for them to cease all modding on the game is just absolutely stupid and something only a moron with too much power throwing a tantrum would do. Clearly TakeTwo have underestimated how much an effect modding has on GTA, going after the online hackers was a sensible move but going after singleplayer modders was probably the stupidest thing you have ever done.P.S Suck a wet fart out myAlso, for those of you saying that Rockstar had nothing to do with this. Im afraid that they did, because they released a statement to PCGamer condoning the actions of TakeTwo and basically agreeing with them. You could argue that TakeTwo told them to release this statement however, but I believe Rockstar just dont give a crap about the community.
