Beautiful world with just SOOO much to do. Story is quite good but going on murdering sprees is more fun. Multiplayer has quite a bit of depth but is riddled with hackers so stick to closed friend sessions.Pros Incredibly realistic fun world. Good characters and story. Great multiplayer. other than hackers The inclusion of Minigames in Multiplayer. Shooting is fantastic. Psychics are hilarious.Cons Story drags a bit. No continued support against hackers. Just terrible, outdated controls. Movement is floaty as hell and cover hardly works because im snapping to 12 different things. Walking around in a tight room or climbing things is a nightmare.Incredible game really, its cons are just really heavy.8.5/10
