Single player of the game is highly recommended and is a lot of fun.Online bit on the other hand is not recommended. It has three major issues.Issue 1 GTA online has turned into a massive grind. If that wasnt enough, the things you buy after the grind require you to grind even more to be useful. EffortReward relationship is completely messed up.Issue 2 Half the time youll spend online will be spent watching loading screens, especially if you are playing missions or doing heists. Joining friends lobby takes forever, entering their houses takes forever, setting up a heist takes forever...Issue 3 If you arent doing missions, you are in a free roam lobby which is relatively free of loading screens... and instead full of modders of one type or another. Cars can randomly blow up, cash may rain, you may be teleported around, start burning and or just die for one reason or another caused by mods. Its just a giant waste of time to join a free roam public lobby which is where you need to be to complete a lot of the new missions brought in by the updates...Game itself is fun but getting to actually play it properly with decent equipment takes ages online. It rarely ever feels rewarding.Leaving this as Not Recommended as many who get GTAV now are getting it for the online bit. Youll spend a lot of time on it like me and end up with stuff that require you to spend even more time to be slightly useful.If you are here for the single player, by all means buy it. The issues Ive mentioned dont really apply there. Its a pretty fun experience.
