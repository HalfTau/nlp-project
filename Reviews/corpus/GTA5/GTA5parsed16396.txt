its a good game when playing single player but with the modders and everything thats ben going on with rock star i would not recoment it, you will literally spend hours grinding and doing heist just to get into a lobby with a modder then you get banned and account gets reset witch is stupid, the modder will literally freeze your character, dump millions onto your character then instead of rockstar banning the modder they just ban you....
