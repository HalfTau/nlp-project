Offline is only fun if you get modded money to afford all of the fun stuff. Otherwise, your experience will go a little something like this Spend 200k on an apartment for heists, do heists to get 3 million or so, buy a ceo office  vehicle warehouse to make 300k an hour at best, do the same missions over and over again for potentially hundreds of hours just to afford 34 good vehiclesgiven that you arent doing these missions 24/7 in gta because that would make you bored FAST, be forced to buy a property worth 12 million just to be given access to a building that gives you permission to buy vehicles worth 35 million. Playing the game legitimately is fun until after about a week of doing vehicle warehouse work and then it becomes a grind fest to get anything worthwhile. I would just get a modded account, get money drops, or stop playing after you finish heists.
