GTA V is an unrefined in terms of gameplay. This means that its boring.Want to get in trouble? Have fun losing hordes of supercops who will most of the time kill you unless you use a cheat code or get lucky with an alley. Sometimes I need to wait for long periods of time in an alley before the cops arent on alert, and then they become alerted again as soon as I leave it.So, what do you end up doing most of the time? Trying not tooff the cops.Want to get into a gunfight? The mechanics arent refined, and as such have enough annoying bits that should have been worked out that its not fun after a couple of them.Between the shooter and the cop dynamics being poor, most missions and gamaeplay arent worth it.All of the bad boy NPC interaction stuff, which is vanilla by todays standards, isnt worth the time.I like the vehicle variety. I find that the cars handle differently enough to make driving fun. If you like open world driving, this game is good for that. Other than that aspect of the game, I cant recommend it.
