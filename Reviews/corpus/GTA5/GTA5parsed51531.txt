The more I play the single player campaign, the more I realize its just the illusion of choice wrapped up in forced social commentary. Pretty much every mission plays out the same with forgettable side characters and a few often relatively dated quips about society. Having been a long time fan of Rockstar games, it just feels so soulless compared to their older behemoth titles like San Andreas or Red Dead. Add that to their controversies with modders and hackers, and its really tough to recommend this game.That said, the single player campaign isnt so bland its unplayable, and online can be fun if you have people to play with. But between being an almost three yearold game, and having a strong emphasis on online and microtransactions, Id say its worth at most 30.
