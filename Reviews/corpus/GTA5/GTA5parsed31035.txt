Want to be the developers money  ? Look no further than GTA Online! Where everything is obscenely more expensive than singleplayer and shark cards are your pimps way of getting you Dennys at 2 in the morning. But wait, you say, rather than spend all my shekels on this t, why dont I just go onto singleplayer and mod for my own entertainment rather than spend my weeks pay to get a borderline ok experience online? Well  you Rebecca, because now our benevolent overlords have be rid us of such sinful tools. Now, you can only play a singleplayer that has been stagnant versus the amount of attention given to online. Thanks take two, because now I get to waste my hard earned money not on food, or toiletries, or any of those other useless necessities but instead on the worthy investment that is shark cards.
