June 14th, 2017Take Two vs. ModdingPosted by GooDNTS in .black, English, Grand Theft Auto IV, Grand Theft Auto V, Liberty City, Max Payne 3, OpenIV, Resources, This blogWe feared that this day would come And now its here.The day, when GTA modding was declared illegal.GTA modding had long and glorious history.Since GTA III, people have created lots of different mods from simple texture replacements to impressive full conversions.And the modding always was a gray zone  a battlefield between lawyers and PRFor almost ten years of OpenIV development, we had tried to play as nice as possible and even moreStrictly following of Civil Code of Russia only reverse engineering for interoperability.Only cleanroom reverse engineering.No distribution of original data and code.And absolutely no messing with OnlineOn June 5th, 2017, we had received an official CeaseandDesist letter.It clearly says, that with OpenIV we allow third parties to defeat security features of its software and modify that software in violation TakeTwos rights.Yes, this letter is illiterate both technically and grammatically really, they dont even bothered with proofreading the text.Yes, we can go to court and yet again prove that modding is fair use and our actions are legal.Yes, we could. But we decided not to.Going to court will take at least few months of our time and huge amount of efforts, and, at best, well get absolutely nothing.Spending time just to restore status quo is really unproductive, and all the money in the world cant compensate the loss of time.So, we decided to agree with their claims and were stopping distribution of OpenIV.It was a hard decision, but when any modding activity has been declared illegal, we cant see any possibilities to continue this process, unless top management of TakeTwo company makes an official statement about modding, which can be used in court.Discuss on GTAForumsWith many thanks for all modding community for all your fantastic creations,OpenIV team.So long, and thanks for all the fish. And on behalf of everyone  everything you stand for. You have just ed everyone both that play the singleplayer just to try to get more ing money. Sorry to say that it is too bad that all of the rest of taketwos games are going to bomb. I for one will never buy another and I am sure I am not the only one. So congradulations and  you over and over again.
