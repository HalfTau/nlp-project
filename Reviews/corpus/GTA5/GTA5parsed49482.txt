Before the start now this game isnt bad its  a masterpiece.But if you read the news TakeTwo has just banned the single player modding community.Which means kill creativity.And no its not Rockstar fault I highly respect them as one the most best game dev.I myself rarely use mods now but I enjoy times when you can mod freely at single player and I think its not a badidea and it add more life to the game.Might take the negative review if the ban has been lifted though.
