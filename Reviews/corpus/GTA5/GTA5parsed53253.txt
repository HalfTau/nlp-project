Take Two is taking extreme measures to ban OpenIV, a modding platform for GTAV. This is an extreme scumbag move, especially after their Cease  Desist letter which was confirmed to be legit. Take Two. Honestly, Modding is what keeps games alive even years after their EoL. I will never support anything TakeTwo has their hands on.
