I have played this game scince it came out on xbox 360.Endured the cheaters.Joined the cheaters to be able to defend myself from them.Made a modded account on 360 with 5 billion, modded outfits, and my legit rank and transfered to P.C.They patched most of my modded outfits. 30 mins later i had new modded outfits.Had no problems until one day they took my money. Fair enough I said, 30 mins later i had 60 million again.Never got on my account with a 3rd party program for more than 20 mins to do outfits or money.One day i seen one of my friends with a Juggernaut outfit with Tron clothes underneath, had to have it.Bought GTA FORCE ELITE and made the outfit on story mode on a seperate account.Got on my main account and loaded online and put the outfit on and saved it and logged off immediatly.Next week a ban wave hits and i get suspended after all that.I am in no way upset because i knew i broke their EULA.But the fact that we cant get all of the cool clothes without modding or doing glitches is rediculus.They put a cool tactical vest with magazines in it in online for CEO stuff and we cant even buy it WHY?????? ?I get the Juggernaut outfit isnt suppost to be a normal outfit but the vest and all the joggers and stuff like that?ALSO the fact that we cant put bennys rims on all vehicles is really annoying and to justify it i have to save cars with them from modders.My Thoughts On The Gunrunning DLCIt is all great and all but the explosive sniper bullets ruin the PVP it takes absoloutly no skill to use them and it ruins the game for the original players that actually got really good at sniping with normal ammo or flying jetsAND THE TAKE TWO INTERACTIVE VS OPEN IV THING IS THE TOPPING ON THE CAKE!! !Rockstar  Take Two Interactive You are doing nothing to help your game by doing that infact Open IV has nothing to do with the methods of online modding atleast to my knowledgein fact i have alot of modder friends and they have been on their accounts for weeksMODDERS ARE RUINING THIS GAME!I have seen first hand what they can do it is too much and something needs to be done.i am completly fine with a modder here and there just chilling and playing around but all they really do is crash your game when you kill their friend, or blow up the whole lobby, or teleport everyone to them over and over until everyone leaves.To combat them my group has a few modders that will try to crash the malicious modder.I understad that they will find a way to do it again after rockstar fixes all the exploits but something has to be done.From the sources I read Rockstar was suppost to come out with a new ANTI CHEAT with the Gunrunner DLC,After The Gun Runner DLC was released GTA FORCE 2.2 was fine to use still with no reported bansWHAT HAPPENED TO THAT??????? ?Overall it is a great well made game other than a few things that are overlooked and i will continue to play it, but i feel like the devs / company makes some poor decisions.I am leaving this game a negetive review because whoever is in charge of the decisions doesnt seem to know what is going on, they may or may not be only be doing everything for the money without worrying about their customer base in the first place, and they seemingly have lost the war on modders scince 360.
