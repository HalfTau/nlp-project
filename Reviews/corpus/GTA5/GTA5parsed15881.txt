GTA has a special place in my heart.done. But to be honest, the servers sometime become really i guess I can understand cuz its the first time rockstar is making a gta game that has an online feature but honestly after 4 years or so, it should be fixed by now. However, one of the biggest problem i think there is in the game is the sharkcards. There are many major updates with a lot of newbut theyre ing expensive and making money in this game requires a ton of grinding. They should seriously reduce the cost of the new DLC features. Everything costs at least 1 million. By the time i make enough money to buy half of the BOOM, new update, even moreis now available thats crazy expensive. I love this game, but cmon rockstar, drop the price tag on these new stuff. Its not fair for us that spend so much time grinding to make money to see a lvl1 with no experience owns all the new expensivethrough shark cards.Pros  Graphics, Gamepaly, Nearly everything is awesome in this game.Cons Loading time is ridiculously long. Sometimes it fails to connect me to my friends sessions which is really annoying.Shark cards are ruining this game
