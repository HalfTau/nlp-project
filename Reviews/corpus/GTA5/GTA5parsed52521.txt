Take 2 is actively trying to kill the SINGLE PLAYER modding of this game. Single player doesnt affect them, other players, etc. It literally means theyre trying to stop people from using the game that they purchased with their own money the way they want.Garbage.Do not give a garbage company that chooses to punish gamers for playing their own games the way they want more money. Do not buy this game or buy microtransactions.
