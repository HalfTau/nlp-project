We brought the game. We should be allowed to use whatever we want to enjoy the game more. Very poor, game companies need to take a step back and realise that they cannot control everything after game is sold to us, customers. All they done is hurt their brand and the GTAs brand, in this case. Suppot to all the modders not just OpenVI who are getting screwed by idiots with small brains.
