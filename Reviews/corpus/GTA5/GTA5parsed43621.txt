You like Shark Cards? You like not being able to mod in Singleplayer??? Buy this game!This game was pretty good when it came out. But then Rockstart start shifting WAY too much towards the online portion. The amount of opportunities that Rockstar had for making a good Singleplayer expansion is gone now. The mystery behind the alienin singleplayer? Itll never get solved. Why make a good expansion for the game when you can just float by on people buying into the microtransactions in 60 game.The amount of grinding you have to do to get anything good in the online portion of the game is insane.
