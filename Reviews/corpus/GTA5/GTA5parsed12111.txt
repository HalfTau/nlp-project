Ive bought this game on 2 platforms, Xbox 360 and PC, and I regret my decision deeply. Beat the single player on Xbox so when I got it on PC I attempted to continue the Multiplayer character I had also created, after much difficulty I got the character transferred over, but sweet Jesus did I just send him into hell. Hackers, tanks, jets galore, its less like Los Santos and more like Baghdad, and to make things worse it doesnt even have the decency to be Pay to Win, Its Pay to Have Fun. If you really want this game buy it for the single player, dont bother with the multiplayer because unless youve got the hacks to spawn the stacks, youre just going to end up wasting your time and feeling frustrated.
