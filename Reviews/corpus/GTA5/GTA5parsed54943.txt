The company that owns Grand Theft Auto V, Take Two is the most SELFISH company ever known to gamers. Banning mods in GTA5 is the biggest mistake ever taken by GTAV or even Take Two. When people are done and complete single player mode of GTA5, the only thing that keeps them interested in playing GTA5 is the offline/singleplayer mods of which makes the game better for playing entertainment. Take Two has taken this action, one of which is the biggest mistake that they have ever done and probably will ever do, in order to create more money proit off of the game and to think the 3BILLION DOLLARS  that they have made alone by gamers buying the game was not enough. Take Two only wants people to leave their fun in singleplayer and join online/multiplayer vesion of GTA5 in order to increase their money profits of the game, which obviously is proving to be the MOST DUMBEST MISTAKE ever to be taken by any gaming franchise. This game is HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED because of the PURE SELFISH, GREEDY, UNCARING attitude that Take Two has for selling games, as they only was them as a source of billions upon billions of dollars and dont care what so ever about the customers of wich purchase their products.
