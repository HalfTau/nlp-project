GTA V is a masterpiece. It has great tech, visuals for 2013 and story. It is a musthave action game.But GTA Online is absolutely different. It is the same open world but much less interactive, its empty and boring, and full of all kinds of cheaters and greafers. Almost every session has a cheater or two. Game community is one of the worst Ive ever seen. Theres no balance at all. This game is not even supposed to be balanced in any way. Its all about dominating by number and better gear bought for real bucks. Skills are almost irrelevant. Dont get me wrong I have a positive KDR, much more than 1, but I dont have fun playing skirmishes in free roam because fighting mechanics are not designed for competitive play, so I mostly fight to protect my cargo from griefers. GTA gets free updates that is good, in theory, but in reality their implementation breaks the game even further. Stabilty is also not the strongest side of GTA.OSo, the bottomline
