Okay so this is really ing annoying and RockStar needs to get theirtogether, dont get me wrong this is a great game and I love it but the modders are getting out of hand. Playing online is a pain in thebecause of the modders. I joined a random session and I tried to leave because I was quickly put in a cage  and I got a 5,000 bounty on me. I cant join my friends or join a new session. I made a new charater and I was able to escape like that but when I went back to my old character I was still in the same modded server. I then looked up everyones name on Social Club and blocked everyone thinking I would be put in a new server. NOPE, it just put me in a similar server with different people. What is weird too is that I spawn in the same place when I leave or swap charater. This just ruined the fun for the whole online expirence. Rockstar needs to start listening to the community.
