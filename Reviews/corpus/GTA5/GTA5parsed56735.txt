I fell in love with this game and bought it on all platforms when it was released. Ive also purchased shark cards to support Rockstar with the free updates theyve released and had alot of fun. When Im not on and playing with my friends I hop onto singleplayer and play LSPDFR and have a great time and mod the game out. Unfortunalty 2K and Rockstar feel threatened by the mods thinking theyll lose money due to it which I doubt but since they banned modding and closed Openiv they for sure have made a finacial error, just look at their stocks, reviews, and petitions so we will see how far this goes. After the money I spent on this company and yet they feel like we need to give them more money to line their fat wallets. Honsetly Id never expected it to go this far with you Rockstar even though how supportive you were with mods long ago and now yours and 2Ks fear of losing some money drove you to do this. Now you will truly feel the consequences for this. Good luck to you as youve lost a loyal fan to your company and will no longer be recieving a penny from me.
