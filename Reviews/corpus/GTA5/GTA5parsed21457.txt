The game is fun, and is a great dont get me wrong. But the owners not Rockstar are all about money and they dont care about the PC gaming community at all because there isnt as much money in it. They banned the use of modding because it affected the ability to buy their in game cash cards, A.K.A. Shark Cards. As if they needed the money lol This is disgusting for the PC gaming community at large and takes away a HUGE part of the game. Mods were one of my favorite parts about the game.
