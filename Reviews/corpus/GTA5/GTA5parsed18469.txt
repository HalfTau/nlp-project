very stupid multiplayer. you have to either pray for a hacker or sell your house in real life to get a virtual vehicle. when you sourced vehicles and had your friend help, he would make the money too... now you cant do anything other than heists to actually get money to have fun with the game. paying 60 for the singleplayer is not worth it. rockstar is just a group of greedy pigs that just want money!
