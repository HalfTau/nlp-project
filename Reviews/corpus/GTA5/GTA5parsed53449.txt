I do not condone Take Two Interactives recent actions against the OpenIV team.That being said I have never once bought GTA Online money, and likely never will following recent events.While some multiplayer modders can be problematic, banning modding in its entirety is one way to kill a game fast. Not to mention others will find other ways to modify the game anyway.Mods are ways fans can show appreciation for the base game by building upon it, and often do it soley out of love for the game. By taking this action against the OpenIV team, Take Two have clearly disregarded the playerbase of one of the biggest multiplayer games on Steam today, and thats some feat.So I leave Take Two Interactive with thisgolfclapGnight
