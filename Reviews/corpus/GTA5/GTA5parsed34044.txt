TakeTwo, you dun goofed.The only thing you had going for your  game was mods and you ed that over. Granted it was fun for a while when it first came out, but the only thing keeping it alive for the past couple years was mods.Mods are the lifeblood of any PC game. People want to play the game the way they want to play it, not be told you cant do this or that when it doesnt affect anyone else.Look at Skyrim for example. The only reason massive amounts of people are still playing that game is because of mods. Without mod support that game would be dust in the wind by now.Trying to explain this away as preventing malicious online mods is just plain sick, and you guys know it. You dont give two  about the player you just care about getting money from people who have nothing better to spend their money on.If you nimrods had any sense, you would undo this, but I know you wont you greedy s.
