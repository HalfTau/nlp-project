I have so many laughs on this game, the missions are really fun. I enjoyed the story a lot as well. I do recommend this but the only down side is that you have to go online for most vehicles and it takes forever to earn quite a bit of money. I dont have money to spend 60 for 8 mil that I will spend in 2 seconds. Great game it just annoys me how you have to spend so much time and money to get decent stuff.
