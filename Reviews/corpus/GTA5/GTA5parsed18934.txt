 NOTE I am only suggesting this for single player.Great single player with a good story with fun and interesting characters. But GTA online has changed dramatically in the last year. The online theme goes against the GTA theme. Everything is expensive AF and shark cards a waste of money in my opinion. Fortunately we have some form of modding back.
