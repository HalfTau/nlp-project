At first, this game was kinda cool and some of the singleplayer was fun, a bit formulaic, though if youve played other GTAs its just more of the same. If you could spend 20 on the singleplayer only, it would be worth it.However, Rockstar basically abandoned the singeplayer aspect on release to focus exclusively online and the whole buy ingame money thing.Online sucks. Its no fun, you just spend your time getting massacred by others. Unless you have friends you already know playing, youll feel completely, utterly alone in the online world. Theres no camaraderie, just a bunch of idiots yelling on mic and omg, the squeakers.I feel like my money has been wasted and will probably not purchase another rockstar game in the future, as you know their focus is going to be almost exclusively on online play which brings in the big bucks from kids who spend their parents money.The fact that this game is the same price as it was on release is absurd.Do. Not. Buy.
