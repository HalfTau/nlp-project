Thanks Take Two. My hard drive was running low on space, but now that you have banned modding of the single player, I have absolutely no reason to let this game take up 70GB of hard drive space since I never much liked the Online since it is full of toxic players and trolls who will do everything they can to ensure you dont have a good time if you are trying to play missions and heists.Not to mention the blatant cash grab that is shark cards since they are the only way to get any money ingame apart from heists and CEO activities which dont work very well see above statement regarding trolls.The only reason I picked this up on PC in the first place was to mess around with mods and wreak havoc in single player with mods ,if I want to fly around in a star destroyer and blare The Imperial March while haveing an army of dogs running through the city while wearing an Iron Man suit, who are you to say otherwise? I paid for your game, what right do you have to tell me what to do with my property so long as it doesnt affect multiplayer?Not like you care about that anyway now do you? What with all the hackers running around.
