Game makes it nearly impossable to do anything but free roam with a friend in GTA online.  Want to do a mission witha  friend? Well tough luck you have to jump in and out of lobbies untill you are the host, then after you have done that. Now you have to close match making. Go invite your friend, and if it requires more people then friends you like then you have to turn matchmaking back on and hope someone joins. This is one of the worst ports to PC I have ever seen. You cant beat the Yoga mission in single player because you need joy sticks. The airplane controls are W to throttle up S to throttle down and Numpad 8,4,5, and 6 for control. With these key bindings both your hands are caught up in just flying the damn plane let alone shooting or looking around.I have gamecube games that load faster than this, You have to wait a solid 34 minutes to load in to story mode, then 23 minutes to join a online match.310 such a waste of 30 bucks!!!!!
