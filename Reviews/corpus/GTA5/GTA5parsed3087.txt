Is very fun to play online, can just f aroud in. but somtimes there is modders that abuise thier powers against other players but besides that a great game. 9/10For the single player, I dont have a rating because I have not completed it due to a mission im stuck on for now my current rating would be 8/10 but look forward to this changing in the future as i progress further and complete the campain. Thx for reading and I hope you found this review helpful. D
