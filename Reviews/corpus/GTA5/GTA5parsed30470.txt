Down Here Salt Is A Way Of Life.I Dont normally Mod my games but people should have the option to if they want to.Take 2 is doing this because they dont want people hacking in currency for online, they want you to buy shark cards and they are more than willing to shut down Mods if it means getting more of that sweet, sweet green.If you want to do something about it then stop buying microtransactions in games you already have to buy.something i have been saying for years but a warning that falls on deaf ears.
