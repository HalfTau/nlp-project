So because paying for this game multiple times wasnt enough money for them, they decided to take away my mods. IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE! This is simply an attempt to push us into multiplayer mode where they actually bothered to add stuff unlike single player where it is basicly built around micro transactions. My favorite quote for the online game, Microtransation laden hell hole  N3.
