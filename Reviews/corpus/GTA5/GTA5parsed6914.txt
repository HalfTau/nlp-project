the single player is nice, not the best out of all the gtas but at least its something fun to play. in the other hand we have gta online... the multiplayer is tedious and not fun at all. too much grinding to even call it fair. unlike other games where grinding feels more like an acomplishment, this game makes it feel like a job. the game is still full priced even after 6 years with a few sales here and there. the game rewards you if you drop real money on shark cards, and even then the highest amount you pay for gives you  all to buy anything
