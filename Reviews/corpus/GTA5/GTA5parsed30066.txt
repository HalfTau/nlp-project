now i honestly dont use the mods ,but i watch alot of youtube vids on people doing crazywith mods and thats really annoying that rockstar just stops the moders from playing with mods is a bit like taking franklin out of the story mode and just realeasing the unfinished version of  that story mode in gta.i would want to recomend it but the modding thing is  a bit anoying.
