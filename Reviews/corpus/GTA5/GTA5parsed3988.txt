Its a good game with one of the worst communitys Ive ever seen. I bought this game the 3rd time now after having it on PS3 and PS4 so Im not really an unexperience player but most of the time you get killed by some level 8000 guys or you get kicked out of lobbys just because your level is too low in their eyes. Furthermore the loading screens are awful  I expected the loading screens to be much shorter on the PC version but no its as least as long as on the console version which is stupid.
