wow ok so you take away modding in single player which has nothing to do after you play the last mission i only play single player because the mods and thats why i have 180 hours in the game becuase of single player modability i mean really you cant play online lets be real from hackers dropping millions of dollars on you then you get the ban to not being able to play becuase of trolls on missions purposely making you fail said missions to hackers and the rich players chasing you around and just killing you then the spawn kill you since you respawn us within 500 feet of our killer then everything is too expensive at the rate i was going online it might have taken me years it seemed to get good stuff and then the horrible lag and also i couldnt find a report button to even report the hackers so stop trying to turn gta into an online only game becuase its not worth playing online based on said facts alone and im sure people have many more! I know what youre trying to do which is subtley push us into online which is pay to play because everything is so expensive you would have to buy a shak card just to make it tolerable if that to playATTENION ROCKSTAR AND T2 IF YOU REALLY WANNA MAKE MONEY MAKE YOUR OWN LEGIT MODS AND MAKE A POLICE EXPANSION PACK FOR SINGLE PLAYER ATLEAST TO BE ABLE TO PLAY A COP! INSTEAD OF BANNING MODS WHY NOT HIRE THE MODDERS TO MAKE YOU A LEGIT VERSION OF THE MOST POPULAR MODS AND MAKE THEM OFFICAL? thats the way you would make a lot of money but hey what do i know right ?REALISTICALLY IT SEEMS MODDING IS THE ONLY THING KEEPING GTA V ALIVE AT THIS POINT besides you forcing people to buy shark cards or spend multiple hours grinding to make money to buy a decent vehicle which the people blow up oh and you cant really mod your vehicles until level 100 or sop.s sorry for any bad spelling keyboard is acting up.
