Enjoying the missions, once again very, very well written and I love the character switching for the most part its a bit confusing at first Not alot you can fault the GTA series on in single player mode at least It more of the same from GTA4 and thats no bad thing.Only 2 real critisisms is that the world, as mind blowingly pretty and well designed as it is, still could use a bit more interaction as mkst of it is just static. a few more enteralble buildings would be nice. a shopping mall would have been nice. So would a proper subway system. But yeah you often get that impluse what would happen if i punched/rammed/shot that. and about 65 of the time nothing happens. would be nice if they got that  abit higher.Other biggest issue is the auto locking melee combat system, its fine for a linier games like batman AA, but its not so good for a GTA sandbox. you want to kick that garbage can over? well be careful because you might punch the guy behind you in the face instead. e.g you have little to no control over it. You can spend 10 minutes trying to break a window, continuously hitting just below it. very, very annoying. Fine have a Batman combat system Rockstar, but for god sake, give us manual aim with melee attacks and weapons too, this is basic stuff. And why did they remove the ability to pick up and throw objects from GTA V, that was a fun and pretty basic stuff for a sandbox. its so wrong that this feature has been removed, ridiculous when you think the mechanics is already there for throwing grenades anyway Developers always forget games are most fun/ funny when you find ways to do things that werent intended by design, but the design allows for it bu not restricting the player too muchBut those frustrations aside, another great GTA game and worth every penny.
