This game is the definition of a Grind to win game. I spent 4 years since day 1 and even preordered on Xbox 360 and have been playing since, until 3 months ago when I finally bought this game on PC when my Xbox One stopped working. I entered a lobby and behold a Modder was modding the server. Guess what? Rockstar banned my account for a month, and also reset all my data years of hard work and earning money, also buying money with real money.Now theyre trying to also destroy single player modding as well, Ive hardly ever modded Singleplayer, but to destroy the fun of other people is unacceptable. Rockstar only cares about profit. I will not be buying another GTA in the future. Go  yourself Rockstar, and TakeTwo.Do not spend your hard earned money or a parents hard earned currency.
