GTA V was probably one of the first games I ever LIKED because it is just my kinda game, open world, cars, fighting, customization, etc. I would completly recommend it to everyone who even partially like anything about this game. The price of 60 may seem like a lot of money but compared to other games that cost 60 or around it many have DLCs like GTA but the difference is DLCs are always free Currently The Only DLC that is paid is essentially a Jumpstart for the game and gives no extra content. which is an important thing in games. Also I would suggest  not purchasing shark cards but doing hiests because of the current prices They could change to be more realistic but at the moment they are not worth it. If I were to genuinly rate this game I would give it a 9/10.
