Story mode is GREAT, but the ONLINE mode..........Online mode is sooooooooo f frustrating. You will be spending more time on loading screens and waiting for players. MOST of the time youll encounter HACKERS which ruins everything. You end up switching to another lobby which again takes forever to load. On top of that, good luck finding players that can understand ENGLISH. Fix the damn servers R. Its a shame that you are STILL milking money from a game that was released 2 years ago and it still runs like GARBAGE.
