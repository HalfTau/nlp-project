Where do I start, this review is more for the GTA online side of things. HACKERS IN FREE MODE HACKERS IN DEATHMATCHES HACKERS IN ING RACES they blow me up randomly just cause im beating their sorry asses legit PASSIVE MODE  LOADING TIMES I have 16 GB ram a solid state drive and an intel core i7 overclocked to 4.5 GHz UNDERPOWERED AIRCRAFT THAT ARE SHOT DOWN BY ANYONE WHO HAS AN RPG WHICH ARE CHEAP LITTLE BOYS PLAYING WITH SQUEAKY VOICESok so bullets over this game is actually really good in singleplayer, im actually really annoyed that they are banning people for using mods in the singleplayer aspect of the game, I have not done any modding and as such I am not banned.What I really hate about online is the fact that passive mode is like benefits in britain, its abused like hell, lets say theres this guy who kills you... fair enough you drive over to him to get revenge, he spots you and runs away, your in the middle of gunning him down then POP hes in passive mode, then he honks the sad trombone horn just to really rub it in!Hackers are now a big problem and for now ive completely stopped playing online I knew I hit rock bottom when I was in a pre race lobby with someone who was using a playermodel of a cat not a cat face mask an actual cat! The moment we started racing, I took the lead then BAM he does his hacker magic on me and blows me up Im like WHAT THE !! !I respawn only for him to blow me up again, and again, and again!!! !Where is the punk buster in this game there is no anti cheat in this game, rockstar mustve been like mergh the hackers wont be able to doin our game cus we incrypted all de files herpy derp! but no that wasnt enough you idiots at rockstar!Most expensive game ever produced in the history of earth mankind, and it doesnt have any defence against hackers, apart from encrypted game files.What a load of  this game is...BUT HEY! OFFLINE IS STILL GOOD!Offline 9 out of 10Online 1 out of 10
