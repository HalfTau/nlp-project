glad i bought it with with rockstar being covetouskeeping a 4 year old game at a strong 60.the single player is good tbh and i enjoyed it, but i havent touched it since i beat it, which you can do in a reasonable 5 days or so.online is absolutely horrid. only reason i play it is because i have friends who do. everyone is abecause its enforced and rewarded, effectively making trying to do anything major impossible while youre in a session with 20 people. people will kill you at whatever cost because cheaters are handled so poorly in the game, they have literally trillions of dollars to take from. more of a pain in thethan anything
