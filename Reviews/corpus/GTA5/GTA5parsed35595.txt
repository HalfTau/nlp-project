This game is all you can expect fromis great with many activities to participate in, receiving XP and cash for almost anything you have fun doing. Levelling is fairly easy and theres a tonne of content with regular DLCs, 2x events and sales on various items within the game.If you find yourself having trouble with other players in a lobby, the solution is a mereFind New Session away with also having the option to make invite only, crew and solo sessions.800 hrs of gameplay so far and much much more to come. I never find myself bored.i do recommend finding a good crew to join as it makes a few things in game easier to complete.
