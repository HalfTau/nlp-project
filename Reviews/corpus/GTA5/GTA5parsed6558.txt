I enjoy this game tremendously. However, I cannot recommend it. Rockstar, while a company that needs to turn a profit, have failed to support and expand this game in a manner which expresses good faith to their player base. The have failed to create any meaningful singleplayer DLC, to police their servers, or to provide for a complete player experience. Theyve engaged in price gouging for ingame good to push their sharkcard horse And theyve progressively locked the playing experience behind paytoplay, given the amount of time investment it would require to access ingame content, which is futher inhibited by the fact that many content items give those willing to spend the money an measurable advantage. I bought the game at full price, I expect the full product. Rockstar have failed to deliver that.
