well done Rockstar and T2, screwing over your customers . shame on you . modding cannot nor should not be banned. ..ever!   its that community that help drive sales and kepp players returning and inspiring others to buy the game . so what if some are building cheats... its not real life its a fricken game...!!!!! youve already made millions on this game and micro transactions and still charging full price... youve got some neck on you to try pulling this stunt.
