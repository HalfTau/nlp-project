terrible customer service, if u have any issues dont expect them to help in any way. thay have also been know to just hang up on you. i think it may be company policy to hang up on customers, and dont expect to paly any of these new mission unless you buy thier shark cards. in order to play with any of the advertised dlc expect to buy 3 to 4 hundred dollars of real money to play with the new viechiels. and i bought this game twice once for ps3 and once on pc. these micro transactions are very expensive there is nothing micro about them.
