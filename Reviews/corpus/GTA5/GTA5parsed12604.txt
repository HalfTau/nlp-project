Trevor is awesome and the story is interesting BUT youd be better off playing san andreas, IV or something. Its hard to believe, not even one radio station has motorhead on it. Forget that  self radio! And whats with all the dogg i mean pound, support? Had the same issue with SA and Dre songs. E had way better songs than Dre.
