This game has been ruined by TakeTwo, I dont care that they now allow single player mods because they still dont care about the player, theyre only cracking down on mods so you buy more shark cards and give them more money after releasing the same game 3 different times. This crackdown has only made the dreadful servers even worse and created new glitches that arent brilliant. This is just another dlc riddled waste of a game, dont give these people your money.
