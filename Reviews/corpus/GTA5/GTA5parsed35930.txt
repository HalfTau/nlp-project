ruined mod support, ruined single player fun, after the storymode singleplayer isnt really fun without use of mods to add more to it, its rather bland as a base, not much to do after finishing missions, multiplayer you either buy shark cards or f off because your not getting anything, youll just get a bunch of poor matchfinding missions or doing interactive missions in the online when you just get stopped by hackers, getting rid of openIV doesnt stop hackers, you need to take better action and precaution rather than ruining everyones singleplayer experience
