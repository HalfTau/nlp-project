Ive never really written reviews on steam games because the rating stuff never mattered to me. A good game is a good game.BUT, a  publisher is a  publisher. TakeTwo can go jump off a cliff for all I care. Shove your bs up yourself. Stop being so greedy that it is clear you are trying to force people online and into microtransactions for more profits.I will change this review if you change your crap.
