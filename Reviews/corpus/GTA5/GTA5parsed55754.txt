MP is repetetive and grindy as all hell.SP is neglected.Modding OpenIV has now been shut down, meaning that the little fun you could create for yourself in SP and SP only since O4 doesnt allow the game to launch online with modified RPFs is now completely gone. So now youre stuck with the boring grinding and constant spawnkilling in Online or the boring repetetive experience of an unmodified SP with literally none of the MP cars, weapons, or features.
