Modders have control of your game Rockstar. I hope you know either you dont care because the game is too old or you are ignorant to the fact. If you want to play this game with the missions or sell cars etc. you cannot do this without having your interface of the game messed with by a modder. They are either manipulating the system dropping cars on your or just right out kicking you out of your game. Rockstar if you are unaware of this fact then do something about it if not then this game truly is dead.All this aside I love driving on this game the cars feel realistic enough to be simple and each car is different in itself which is a nice touch. So I hope I can continue to buy and sell cars without modders smashing the car I am delivering into a wall like I am just his plaything, in a game suppose to be moderated by Rockstar.Hope this finds well. I do sincerely hope that Rockstar will do something.
