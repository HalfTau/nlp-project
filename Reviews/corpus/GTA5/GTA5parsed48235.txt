I have 167 hours in this game on this platform and like 150 in gta 4. The only reason I would ever play this game again is modding. After playing the game with mods I frankly dont think its a very good game without them and the thought of not having mod support makes the game completely undesirable.The way Rockstar and take 2 handle modding is inept, as if they had never heard of the concept. If they keep this up they can join EA and Ubisoft for the running of most illwill recieved from gamers.
