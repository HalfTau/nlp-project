First I must say that I did enjoy the singleplayer, but multiplayer is just horrible. If you plan on spending time in the multiplayer please be careful. There are hackers, microtransactions in a game that if you want to keep up with the new content you must grind for ingame cash or purchase it with real money, and there is a chance that Rockstar may ban you or confiscate ingame currency with out giving you a valid reason just because of other players actions.
