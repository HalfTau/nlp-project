Take Two is suing over a mod for this game. We need to show publishers that we support modding and will not tolerate corporate bullies. Modding should be encouraged, and pvp pay to win should be discouraged. Microtransactions have ruined the online part of this game, and now Take Two aims to ruin  singleplayer part of this game by preventing mods.
