now the free expansions are nice, but banning mods first for online and now for singleplayer is mad. they just try to squeeze as much money out of players by making the already expensive game hard to grind in online, forcing people to buy shark cards.and now they force people to play more online by basically making the singleplayer boring after completing the story mode.they probably did not expect this backlash.
