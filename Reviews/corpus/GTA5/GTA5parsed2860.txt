This game is lit. Biggest change of a video game. From 16 gb or something GTA4 to 72.3 gb GTA5BUT ITS WORTH IT!I played it without lag on an old AMD gpu but GTA 4 doesnt work for so I am very glad that they fixed it.GTA Online is really good. Theres alot of games you can play there.But, I really want the old SLASHERS on my old account. But I really give this 99.9/100 Old Slashers
