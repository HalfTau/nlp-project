 Rockstar. This crap came out Sept 2013 for theconsoles. I watched and wondered why they would release it onsystems when the new batch ofconsoles was coming out soon. Oh, so they could double dip on the  that would buy the sameon multiple systems. BUT WAIT MORONS. ITS 2014! WE PUT NEW STUFFS AND IS PRETTIER ON CURRENT OVERPRICEDSYSTEMS, no discount if you already owned the ier version because  you pay me. My personal favorite is when they finally brought the game to PC in 2015 for the low low price of  you pay full price for our oldgame. Lets add shark cards wherever and whenever we can to pretend fake currency adds any value to the game. I got the game on sale for 30 USD, the price it should have been after 2 years of console ing before they moved to PC. NOT WORTH FULL PRICE OR SPENDING REAL ING MONEY ON SHARK CARDS. Better games exist from better companies.
