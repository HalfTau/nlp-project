Ive been a Grand Theft Auto fan since the days of the top down game. GTA 3? GTA VC? GTA San Andreas? All games that hold fond, nostalgic memories. HEck, San Andreas is a game I STILL go back to play now and then. Then came GTAV. So happy was I. So full of hope and enjoyment. Then they trashed all Single Player content to milk the cash cow that is the cash cards in the multiplayer. Now theyre doing this.Please, dont be a fool like me. Step back, say NO SIR to Take Two. Do not let them destroy modding just because greed is the name of the game now.Grand Theft Auto was once the benchmark for open world games. GTA San Andreas? GTA 4? Games we still play. Even GTA4 with its nitty grittyness was still a pretty enjoyable, excellent game. Yet GTAV has such the potentional to knock San Andreas out of the water.. and theyve not touched it since the online component took off. If I had known when I originally bought the PC version After waiting so long and quite impaitently since I cant quite afford first generation console systems, that they would completely dump the single player and modding.. I wouldnt have bought it. Heck, at this point Id accept a refund if that option was available.
