Game itself is pretty damn amazing.Dont know about the music content and the online connection, meaning what will happen in the future if a deal with the recording company is changed. Will we still have Phil Collins coming out the ingame radio?Just to name one great artist, the list is much longer.The whole influence of Rockstar in it is pretty evident overall, but as i said, the game itself is incredible to me.I love the immersion, the details.And it runs like a charm on my older computer, which i did not fully expect.I bought it on a discount and only after getting a new harddrive because i never had the space for it.
