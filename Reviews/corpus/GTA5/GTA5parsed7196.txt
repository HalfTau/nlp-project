IMPORTANT My positive opinion concerns single play and story only. Online sucks payballs.Well... GTA V is a most interesting, big and detailed open world game Ive ever played. Just tons of fun, dynamic and badss plot, different and memorable characters, complex and extraordinary story missions, tons of really random twisted events/peds, animals, nature and exploration. World of GTA V is so alive and have a lot of realistic things. It also includes detailed ingame social networks and great OST mixed with manymany radio songs. Try it and youre not gonna regret.Online part is the worst evil here.There are four options of progress here1. Paywall2. Grinding3. Cheaters4. Shtload of highlevel friends, etc.I really like a lot of content cut from single experience and also a character creation, but GTA Online is just ing boring. I dont know whats really interesting in heists. At single game they were nice, online turned them into tedious mess.Also, most of the random players are dumb fcknuggets.
