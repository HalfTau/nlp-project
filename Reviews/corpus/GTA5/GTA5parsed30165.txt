Its been a long time since I playes GTAV and to me I was impressed....and thats it really. I say I didnt get sucked into it as much as previous GTA titles. Maybe its an age thing or I just simply prefer the classics. GTAIII all the way.I never got into the online side of GTA V knowing there would be microtransactions. Something I will NOT get sucked into it, especially with online DLC and Shark Cards. No way in hell am I burning my money when paying for the game itself should be enough in Rockstars point of view.After hearing about the modding community I am severly disgusted in Rockstar as they have never had a problem with modding so long as it never affected online matches which is understandable. But to outright ban modding completely you are taking away something that most gamers want. Creativity and sharing. Look how long games like Skyrim, Oblivion, Witcher, Mass Effect has survived due to the modding community. Mods are amazing especially when done by the right people.All I can say is people will NOT forget this, Rockstar/TakeTwo. Even if you lift the ban, this will not go away.Good luck with GTAVI because people will NOT fall for the same trick twice. You are on notice.Goodbye Rockstar
