The game itself is fine, that is if your fine with grind fests. Free content comes out, but it is a grind fest. Enjoy grinding.And now as of 7/1314/17 Rockstar is making everyone who tries to play the game a Bad Sport as of me editing this review, Rockstar has been sending out crash packets to anyone who even dares to play a mission. Try for a x2 /RP mission crash, Lamar Mission Crash, Heist Crash. PLAYING A SINGLE PLAYER MISSION CRASH. Thats right Rockstar doesnt even want you to play single player. The only way to play the game without it crashing is to either just mess around is Los Santos and not bother with missions, or play all the way offline in single player.
