Even though I was too late to transfer my data from ps3 to pc and have to do all the grinding again, I wouldnt mind to start a new. Both online and offline gameplay are enjoyable and timekilling. Furthermore, beautiful graphics and good optimization. On the other hand, hackers and modders in online sections are giving great risks of getting banned for normal players  the nonstop grinding if you dont wanna buy sharks card. Overall, this is a great game and I would recommend you to buy it.
