GTAV singleplayer is good in itself but online started out as a ambitious multiplayer experience and it makes me sad to see that with every new dlc comes more stuff you cant afford. Only thing you can do is play the same s bank job over and over and over and over again until you get money. Gameplay value on the multiplayer is zero.Also when hackers get free stuff where i get charged, why should i pay for anything, not to mention the most vile shark cards, which ruined the multiplayer for this.Thank you Rockstar for ruining GTAOnline and i cant wait for you to ruin Red Dead Redemption 2
