good story, money hungery publisher, bad consumer practices, no respect for the creative fan base that surrounds their game. buy if you want a good single player story, dont buy for a pay once no major microtransactions multiplayer, dont buy if you plan to mod or want to dabble in singleplayer mods Rockstar and take two are against all mods now, dont buy if you plan to upload or create any kind of content unless you feel that mods should not be allowed in single player and want to/support  spending real cash on fake in game cash and fully understand Rockstar and Take Two dont give aabout you or anybody else that gives attention to this game.good story though.
