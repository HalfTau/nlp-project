I personally enjoy the GTA franchise , i played GTA on ps3 befoe moving to pc and hacking and modding wasnt much of deal back then . Now GTA isnt really well GTA anymore , yes the new DLCs are pretty cool and they add more featues to the game , but its become more of a grind and the amount of griefing is insane .
