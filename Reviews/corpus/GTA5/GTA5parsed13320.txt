Gta 5... where to start. the singleplayer is fun and enjoyable, but that is all. Never Play Online.You will spend months of your time playing this trying to but cool and new things then you WILL get banned out of nowhere and get all yourremoved for playing the game like me and my friends. i got banned after puting only 114 hours into the game. Got banned for killing my friends in a worl pvp fight. there customer support was a flaming pile of dog. i asked them why i was banned there only responce was that i got banned. like i allready knew that. if you are buying this for the single player then it is a good buy, but never play online
