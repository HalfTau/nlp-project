This game is so absolutely amazing, its just mind blowing. I had lowered my expectations, despite all the amazing things ive been hearing about this game because, well. Ive heard a lot of terrible things about this game as well. But i pushed all that aside and decided that i should review the game on my experience, and my experience alone. Grand Theft Auto V has beautiful storytelling that got me hooked at the very start, and the way characters interact with each other can be touching at times, and absolutely hilarious at times. It puts you at the very bottom, making you work your way up to be an insane killer. The story game is great, but now lets talk about the online...At first, it was good. People worked together, did heists, made money. It was fun. Then, rockstar released a dlc, and another, and another. And people said Rockstar, we cant pay for all these dlcs! Lower the prices! Rockstar gave the ultimate middle finger and released microtransactions and said Here you go, problem solved!Gta 5 online is fun, but to get to the fun stuff you need a lot of money, and a certain level. But you cant make a lot of money today, because rockstar has become right greedy little , and exploit the players for their money, and money alone.Also, they ban all the modders that make the game hilariously fun at times. Modders can give us all tons and tons of money, which is good today since making money is an impossiblity at times. But rockstar arent banning the cheaters because they cheat, no, theyre banning them so they cant give players money, and either force them to play the game fair and square, or use microtransactions. Plain and simple. So overall, id give it a 9/10 on story, 5/10 on online.
