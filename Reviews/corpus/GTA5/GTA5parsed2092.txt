Been playing the game sense it came out, they keeped making it harder and harder on the ones who dont cheat, then they seem to reward the cheaters.Sure all the dlc was free but prices on everything in game is a joke they try to force you to buy a shark card. I wont spend real money on fake money.......Iv always loved rockstar games but after seeing how they handled this will be the last. Red dead 2 will probably be a joke also but i wont spend my cash on it unless its free or maybe like 3.
