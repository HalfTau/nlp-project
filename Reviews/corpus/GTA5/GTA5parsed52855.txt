As much as I love GTA V and Rockstar Games, Take Two really screwed this one up. I understand that if the mods are voilating any online rules or legal stuff, you should be able to take those ones down, but SINGLE PLAYER MODS AS WELL? Single player mods are doing absolutely no harm whatsoever to your game I think that these modders are making GTA V a much better game, because the truth is, I dont really enjoy story mode so much so single player is just boring without mods. The world you created in Los Santos is so detailed and so well made that I think it should be explored more, but without mods, it just gets really damn boring. Im sorry, but thats the truth. Bring mods back. Thats all I have to say.
