I used to love this game but now I hate myself for buying it.Its just one long loading screen nowEven if you can get into a game you get kicked out at random, you end up in lobbies on your own, the community is toxic as hell, its just one big sham.It used to be fun, it used to be the best game ever now its torture.Dont but this game, dont buy any shark cards, avoid Rockstar products like the plague.It breaks my heart to write this
