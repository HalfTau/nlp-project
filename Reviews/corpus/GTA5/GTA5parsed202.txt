game is great yeah its pretty fun but guess what this game is design by rockstar to force people buy sharcards , dlc content are just getting unreasonble expansive make it literally impossible to actaully make money from the game it self doing missions whatever... and guess what thats excatly what rockstar wanted, they want you to giving up making money and just buy their sharkcards what agrind but hey not everybody are stupid instead people will stick their middle finger to Rockstars face by take advantages of modders and get pretty much unlimited amount of money and they dont have to spend a dime because why not? why spending money when you can get it free and its also easy to get away with as well. If youre the kind of gamer who hates greedy game developers and turn games into a grind this is not for you.
