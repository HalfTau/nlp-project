Sadly this game became a caricature of itself.The storymode GTA V itself is still a brilliant standalone game with a dense, vibraint open world. Though it is quite overpriced for being released in 2013 consoles, respectively 2015 PC.As a multiplayer game though, it is a completely different experience. Especially with the Gunrunning DLC, which lead me to write this review and NOT recommending this game.GTA Online was never good with actual content. Its missions are repetive and, with the exception of heists, lack any storytelling whatsoever.Also the recent additions of more and more overpowered military vehicles destroyed GTAs very own DNA of a openworld gangster game and mutated it into a falloutstyle PvP paytowin combat zone and playground for griefers.If you werent into PvP combat, GTA still offered quite some fun with its quite active racing scene and its suprisingly realistic car physics. Sadly the recent changes of the physics system now ruined some of the most expensive racecars, defacto destroying your investment of time, and/or reallife money to obtain them. Guess you have to buy a new one then. Luckily there are some new ones coming out very soon pSo, if you ask me the game is broken. Deliberately broken to maximise Rockstar Games money intake on the expense of the people playing it.
