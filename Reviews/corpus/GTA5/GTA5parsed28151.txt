Dont let the negative reviews of potential cheaters and gamebreakers fool you, this is an excellent game. Everything about it is smooth, immersive, and engaging. Theres more content than you can shake a stick at and hundreds and hundreds of hours worth of gameplay to enjoy, whether in story mode or playing online. People are upset because the game developers want people to play the game as intended instead of changing it drastically for entertainment purposes. Look at what OpenIV has done, they changed the game SO much that now there are hundreds of people badmouthing the game simply because they cant modify the game to their liking anymore. If OpenIV hadnt come along and tarnished an otherwise flawless product, GTA V would still be a gleaming example of what a game should be. Instead, it is losing players and the reputation of GTA V is being damaged beyond repair. Heres a big  You to OpenIV for causing this.Sincerely,A True Gamer
