Let me just say I used to enjoy this game. Dont get me wrong it is probably one of the best open world games out there but there is so much wrong with it now from GTA Online and to its singleplayer. First off the story and gameplay is fantasic there is no denying it but the car and weapons are getting boring and bland. The singleplayer hasnt got a new vehicle since 2015 and that was 2 years ago. How hard is it to implement a vehicle from online into the singleplayer? Secondly, now that Rockstar has banned mods there isnt really a whole lot to do once you 100 the story missions, yeah you can go do activities but that doesnt expand on the story of Michael, Franklin and Trevor. I wish that Rockstar had created a dlc even if a lot of people dont like them, I would have paid for it. Forget about the shark card microtransactions for online, you will make more money with the dlc you could have brought out. Online is now broken, everything is expensive and not worth that much money, shark cards are horendous and modders ruining everyones experience. I really used to enjoy the game but that spark has gone now. I would rate this game at its current state a 5/10 due to online being broken and the singleplayer not having enough added. This game used to only be singleplayer but now it is only multiplayer.
