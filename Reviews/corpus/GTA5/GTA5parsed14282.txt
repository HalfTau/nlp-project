Welp, this game has only best campaign but very  Online. and by online isI mean its all the cars, planes, boats u want to buy is all in overpriced cause it takes you goddamn weeks to get one at least. Campaign is only the great part of the game, then Rockstar got so greedy they added Shark card etc. and who is gonna buy this honestly. Some of the players will hack tbh because how greedy developers are.
