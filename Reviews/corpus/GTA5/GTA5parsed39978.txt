I love gta online. I love gta story missions. I love the gta modded community. Just because they dont make any money on the story mode and mods doesnt mean you should stop making them. I bought gta largly for the story missions. I have spent countless hours playing modded gta aswell. Honestly this is just sad Rockstar.
