I dont normally write reviews but this is a one off because of the circumstances surrounding the kerfuffle with take two going after the modding community like its some witch hunt, because take two doesnt like the fact that more people play single player with mods as thats more fun than idiots killing you left right and centre when youre trying to complete stuff and not playing online buying their lets be honest overpriced dlc and before those of you who say it took me 2 hours doing missions and i earned enough money well Id rather not spend two hours grinding away at missions which give you very little in the way of rewards, and no I would never buy shark cards as thats just encouriging microtransactions which is whats killing a good multiplayer experience, anyway I dont play the single player with mods but I believe that mods makes the single player more fun and gives you lots more to do and have fun and if take two wants to take that fun away from the gaming community then our voices must be heard.
