Really? The game is still 60/80cad. For a 4 year old game?One of the best modern single player games. Game runs well even though its a port.The archaic architecture of GTA online shows that it was made for consoles from 2006, and not for the kind of things they are doing with it.2k is taking action against the makers of single player mods. and apparentally turning a blind eye to the multitude of hackers onlineIf you are interested in the single player pick it up if its at least 60 off. Otherwise stay far away.
