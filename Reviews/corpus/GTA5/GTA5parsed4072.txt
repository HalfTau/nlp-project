Its a good game, Minus the modders and scripters. The community is very toxic on multiplayer servers and the staff team at rockstar will ban you if a modder or scripter gives you money. There isnt anything you can do about it and the staff will automatically assume you spawned it in. Apart from that the game is very well made.
