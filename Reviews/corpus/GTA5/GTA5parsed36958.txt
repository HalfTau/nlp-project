T2 has killed the potential longevity of this game, Im sorry T2 but I cant see myself being forced to waste my time grinding on GTAO to get even at least the most basic decent items and equipment to use in the first place since theres nothing else better to do in single player since youve killed that too since the only reason to keep playing that after you finished that before is with mods, but dont forget how youve also been including those with custom dedicated servers who cant beto deal with your garbage when people actually want to have fun for once and not deal with the constant flooding of immature players killing civil players for no good reason while not punishing them either.Unless you change this T2, and let the people who bought your product in the first place do want they want to do such as playing on custom servers and not the abomination that is GTAO, you will not be seeing the end of this.
