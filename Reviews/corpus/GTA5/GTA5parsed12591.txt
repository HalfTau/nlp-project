The GoodExcellent story modeSeemless swap between first and thirdpersonOnline has its moments seeing a big payday, playing with a decent teamThe BadInflated prices online for everythingUnbalanced online playLong loading timesThe UglyPaytowin microtransactionsFaulty anticheat system and incompetent supportCD orders for mod makers, no singleplayer modsThere are two parts to this game, GTAV, and GTAOnline. GTAV consists of the singleplayer story with Franklin, Michel, and Trevor with their adventures in Los Santos and Blane County, and is an excellent game. It works, if you want a openworld crime sandbox, this is a great choice. I can ONLY recommend the game if you just want the singleplayer.HOWEVER, the biggest problem with this product is the part Rockstar have been devoting all their time to, GTAOnline, an interesting idea, that almost works, but the developers have utterly ruined.Firstoff, the economy is weighted in favor of purchacing Shark Cards, the microtransactions, everything is overly expencive. Add on that most things can be purchaced regardless of level, if you can affoard the Shark Cards, you can start with jetbikes, tanks, supercars, and the best properties around, its paytowin at its worst.Next, Rockstar forces players to depend on their anticheat, which on one hand fails to get rid of cheaters, and on the other bans innocent players whom these cheaters have screwed with. Rockstar also fails to give any form of appeals system, or any chance to recover your account once banned, once you get the boot, you could only buy the game again.And lastly, Rockstar, and their parent company, TakeTwo Interactive have entirely shut down the modding scene for GTA, as in all of them, declairing GTA modding illegal. This includes singleplayer GTAV, which would be a very sketchy move in the best of times, right now, it shows how greedy they are. As far as I understand the matter anyway, it seems they being Rockstar and TakeTwo, know how lucrative the Shark Cards are, and they dont want anything infringing on that. To them, any player having fun with mods on their own is a player who isnt spending money on cards. There is also talk about how TakeTwo want to have microtransactions in all of their future games, but I cant cite this, rather, Im too lazy right now.Ether way, this paints a very bleak picture for the future of the gaming industry, but that isnt relevent to this review. At the end of it, get it for the singleplayer, and dont touch the online. If Rockstar and TakeTwos caustic business practices dont turn you off, then the mostly caustic players will. It is kinda to be expected, GTA games have always been about toying with the helpless NPCs, so given the chance to do so to actual people, the expected result of course happened. But if you have some friends, then it may be fun, but I wouldnt get invested.I do suggest you take a look in to all the controversy Rockstar and TakeTwo are stiring up regardless of if you decide to get the game or not, you know what they say about trainwrecks.TL,DR Read the points at the top you nancy, thats what theyre for!
