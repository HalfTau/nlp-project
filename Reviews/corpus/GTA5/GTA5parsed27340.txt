GTA V, a game from 2013, its has a good singleplayer story but a paytowin online...This game has an awesome story, Franklin Michael and Trevor do some of the craziest things in the world and always get away with it. Very detailed and very beautifulFirst few DLCs were awesome, 700k for a super car was mind blowing back then, but now 3mil for a super car? thats CRAZY this game kinda became a pay to win online. Yeah i like the heists and some adversary modes are cool but you really have to grind to get everything in online.Take2 basically shot themself in the foot by making modding illegal stopping the distribution of OpenIV was a bad dessicion of them. The reason why i have almost 150hrs on GTA IS because of mods, if it wasnt for the mods i think this game would have died already. readarticleIts a good game with a great story but a paytowin online, do i recomend it? For story mode its a big YES. Online? nah
