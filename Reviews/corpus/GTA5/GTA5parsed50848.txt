Take 2 youre a bunch of s. Fist your CEO says its not making enough money from GTA Online refering to their players as wood to be cut and then you ban a modding tool that makes singleplayer mods. And Rockstar I realise Take 2 are your publisher but taking a step back is the last thing you should do. Stand up and help your games community by fighting with them or better yet deal with all the problems with hackers in your ing game so the innocent modding community doesnt get punished.
