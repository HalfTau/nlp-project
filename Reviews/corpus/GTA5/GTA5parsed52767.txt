Dont buy this game! In addition to attrocious loading times when joining Online you can go make yourself a cup of coffee and I dont mean that instant crap and the fact that everything takes decades to load even when you do join a game, now TakeTwo made mods ILLEGAL! Dont support scumbag companies that continue to make hundreds of millions of dollars even years after the games first release and that claim that mods ruin their business.
