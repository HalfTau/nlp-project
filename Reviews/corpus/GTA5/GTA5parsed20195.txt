Easily one of the best games Ive ever played. This game is fun, exiting, a good story teller, and always has something to do. You never run out of activities, the communithy is great, and there is veruyu complex and itteresting characters with their own story and mindset. If there is something something wrong with this game, is that when youre done, you want more, and more!10/10StoryCharactersDialogueCommunityMonthly DLC not always amazing, but they do care for their gamePS Im reviewing this gmae based on its vanilla structure, not how Taketwo treated it in the past.
