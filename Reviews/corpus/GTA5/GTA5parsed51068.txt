Take Two has really shot themselves in the knee here with the whole Open IV situation. This... this is not okay! As much as it pains me to give this game a negative review we can not just sit around and let them destroy single player modding.I encourage you all to do the same, protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this!
