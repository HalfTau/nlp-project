Its a pretty good Single Player experience, but Online play is an utter disappointment, and the primary reason I wont be buying RDR2. The microtransactions are virtually mandatory unless youre willing to hack or grind for hundreds of hours. Finding a solid group to do heists with is virtually impossible. The PVP is the biggest joke Ive ever seen, I dont know anyone who has ever had an enjoyable experience playing it. The racing is KINDA fun, but its often ruined by lag and connection issues.Rockstar really just went full moneygrub on this one, they realized they could charge for ingame currency so they took advantage of it as much as possible.The amount of money required to buy ingame vehicles is comical. For a regular person, not willing to spend money on this dumb garbage, Id honestly recommend just hacking. Youre probably not going to get caught unless youre blatant, and youll save yourself hundreds of hours of grinding. In exchange youll probably only have fun for about 1020 hours with your newfound wealth, which just shows you how it wasnt worth it at all.
