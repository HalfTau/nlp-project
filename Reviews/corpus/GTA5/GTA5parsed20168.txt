Invisible hackers and speed hackers are everywhere, in every session. They have limitless power, infinite teleportation and of course unending money sources. And they literally humiliating innocent players.They do not even care if you threaten. Because they are very sure that they will not be punished. Thanks to developers of the game and for sure Steam, for letting them mocking with us, to legalize hacking and making insult with us. Ive reported many players who used the hack in every game but Im not sure what did they got as a punishment. No feedback at all. Moreover, it makes you feel guilty because you dont have any proof and you dont know how goes to ban process. Obviously, noone gives aabout to ban them. There is no any authorized bot to test session. Proud with your flawless VAC. Yeah, be sure it works. Appreciated that.
