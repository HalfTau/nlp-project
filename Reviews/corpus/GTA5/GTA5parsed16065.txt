ing every loading screen is 5 minutes long.Every lobby has a hacker.ROCKSTAR WILL NEVER FIX.They took their money from their 555 million doller success aka shark cards and dipped.Literally they just make dlc for more money they give no  about the cummunity at all.The game gets very boring and you end up farming the same job or gamemode over again and over again.Uh everything is overpriced, one hat can be upwards of TEN THOUSAND DOLLERS, and the community is dead.Literally if you dry to find a race or anything you must make your own lobby and wait thirty minutes for a full lobby.Gamemodes that arent made by rockstar give you NO MONEY AT ALL and medium rp.Rockstar created gamemodes give you alot of money and little higher than medium rp.If a modder spawns money on you leave immediatly or youll get banned.If a modder turns you into anything other than the character that you are playing LEAVE IMMEDIATLY.Or you will get banned for hacking, example being a lamppost or flowerpot. peace this game is trash.
