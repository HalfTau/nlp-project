Gave up with this game. If its not crashing its freezing up and jamming my whole PC. In addition, trying to get it to run smoothly despite my PC being more than capable, is a real chore. Tried every fix suggested and none have worked.Typical PC game from Rockstar  an unplayable mess.The last time Ill buy a Rockstar title on PC. Theyre all the same. Get it on console instead otherwise youre wasting your money.
