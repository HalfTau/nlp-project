They learned not to kill mods for singleplayer mode, good for them. Its not a bad game. I had about as much fun in singleplayer as the previous games, but the online shows just how lazy and greedy the producers of the game really are which sucks because they could have really made something great.Online content is for the most part They create things only for the sole purpose of selling Shark cards for real money. The new expensive as  vehicles and homes look great, but the sorry excuses for alternative game modes are on the surface extremely bland and look like they took 5 minutes to come up with.GTA Online needs more short missions and heists. Something like the missions youd play in singleplayer. Just anything fun to do with your friends or strangers besides racing, which I guess Ill say is one of the highlights of the added online content, but I didnt buy this game to race all the ing time. The UI for GTA Online is also extremely confusing and unintuitive.Its a shame that online went in this direction because it has a really good base. When I first opened up the game with a friend I saw so much potential. They can definitely turn it around, but it might be too late and it might have to wait for GTA VI.
