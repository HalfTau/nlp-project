Although the singleplayer is amazing, GTA Online is the opposite. It has its moments, but for the most part its grinding for hours to buy a semigreat car. Its also ridden with cheaters and players out to make your experience as bad as possible. It s quite frequently updated, to experience new features youd need to buy shark cards, which is my opinion is a  business  practice for a game which retail price is 60 and came out more than two years ago.On top of all this, Take two essentially banned mods for no apparent valid reason, which is a really anticonsumer move, and as a consumer I would not want to support a company that does this to their fans.TLDR Good singleplayer,multiplayer, not worth money and/or supporting this company.
