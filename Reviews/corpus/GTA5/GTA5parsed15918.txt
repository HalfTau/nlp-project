Single player is ok, I wish you had as much opportunities you have on multiplayer like buying cars and keeping them.Multiplayer is fun but to get to the fun you either have to just farm all week just so you can afford businesses to make more money, or waste your money on microtransactions because everything in this game is ing expensive. Which doesnt justify since I paid full price for this...
