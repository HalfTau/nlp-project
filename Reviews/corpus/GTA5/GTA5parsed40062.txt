UPDATE Apparently it worked! OpenIV is back up and modding can continue. I love that the community came together and fixed this BS. GTA V is back to being great.I have to give it a thumbs down as long as Take Two thinks its better to ban all modding. They are just being lazy. Take the time to give people the tools they need to ban cheaters in GTA Online, and stop ruining the game for everyone else, especially people like me and my son who have never cheated in any game, ever.Why are we paying for what these cheaters are doing? If we could handle these cheaters ourselves we would, but you havent given people the tools to do it.
