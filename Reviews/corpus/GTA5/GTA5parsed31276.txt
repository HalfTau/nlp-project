I got GTA on a steam sale. I dont have enough money to buy the game at full price. I decided to get mods so i dont have to farm money or buy shark cards which are expensive. However, Take Two got rid of modding in GTA, even single player. Because of this i cant enjoy playing this game anymore and it is no longer a fun sandbox game. I guess its time to go back to playing Gmod
