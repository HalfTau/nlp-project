Such a great game with lasting potential ruined by greedy corporate talking heads that have no idea why the game was so successful and the series so long lived and long loved.OpenIV was a great tool to keep the game alive long after the devs moved on to make the next great thing, but now its gone and noone should bother wasting money on the next cashgrab.
