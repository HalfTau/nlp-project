Rockstar R is the best gaming developer in the modern day.After beating GTA V on ps3 with my brothers, we went to the online section.BOOM big problems with online, people losing money my brother included and whole save files.After a few weeks the developers seemed to fix all the problems with the online aspect and any reported bug in the single player.Once released on PC I jumped on once more and my goodness it looked awesome and ran great.I noticed that when I got back there had been updates, many updates. These updates were so large in content that I couldnt believe they werent charging for any of it.Its amazing to see that after 5 years the developers have still made amazing, game changing, updates for the game free of charge.If we had more developers like Rockstar R Games, the gaming world would be in a better place.Most complete game Ive ever bought10/10
