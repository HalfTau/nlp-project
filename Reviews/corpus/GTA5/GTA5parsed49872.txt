This is the third time Ive purchased GTAV. I paid 60 each time. The reason I decided to get the third copy of this game is because I wanted to play the game with some of the thousands of amazing mods that people have released for the PC version of the game. I paid 60 with the idea in mind that Rockstar and Take Two would not prevent me from installing mods on my game, as they havent done so in the last 10 years. With the recent takedown of OpenIV, they have done exactly that. At least half of the mods I use depend on OpenIV, so theres really no point in me owning this copy of the game. Do not give these people any money. They do not respect their customers, nor do they care for their game.
