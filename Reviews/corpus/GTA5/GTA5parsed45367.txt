The game used to be a fun grind to get cars yes I said fun grind. Now, its more of a job. These updates are making more material even more expensive, prompting modders to hop on, drop cash, teleport players, and destroy the servers.That was all pretty bad to me, but I  still recommend the game because it is a blast to play with friends.
