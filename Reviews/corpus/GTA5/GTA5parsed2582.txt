Grand Theft Auto V is great if you are planning to have a good time with some friends doing follies around town and playing missions, if you have the patience to wait several minutes for every loading screen and experience frequent server crashes that will result in more several minutes long loading screens.Other than this, the campaign story failed to impress me, and I wont judge it harshly for the simple reason that I couldnt be bothered enough to complete it, and the level of grinding for money and EXP required from the multiplayer is simply criminal.I dont play multiplayer games, but every time I do I found more reasons to keep myself away from them.
