Both Rockstar and Take Two have been actively hostile to the community.While theyve since done the bare minimum in the face of a massive backlash, its much easier to lose trust than it is to earn it. All they care about now is selling Shark Cards. They dont care about the game, they dont care about modding, all they care about is selling ingame currency for real world money. The two companies are utter scum in my eyes.
