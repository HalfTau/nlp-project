So first off, hackers are literally everywhere. You join any server there is a 99 chance someone is spawning tanks and just running rampant on the server killing everyone. There are nice hackers who give you money, which seems kinda nice at first, until you realize that Rockstar in their greed fueled mindset takes ALL of your money for even receiving a small portion of money from hackers. Take for instance, I was doing a heist and made 300kish dollars in game. I get into a public lobby and a hacker drops 2000 money bags which spawn ontop of you so it is almost impossible to avoid, and I pickup 20k dollars before I back out of the lobby. I decide to get offline as I wanted to play Starbound. I come back the next day and ALL my money is wiped from me. This happened another two times as I said before, hackers own the servers. So between the almost daily money resets by Rockstar which they do this so you will buy shark cards and the hackers rampage on every server its unplayable. I learned just today which is what caused me to request a refund that hackers can literally crash you out of the server or game. I have a fairly beefy PC so I know it is not hardware related. They just up and shut you down. And lastly, Rockstar made billions with a b on this game. They already have the money so they dont give aabout it anymore if ever. So the ONLY bug/mod/issue they fixed/enforce/do something about is the modded money people give you. They do this so you will get fed up and buy their hugely overpriced microtransactions. They dont care about hackers spawning tanks or shooting you with explosives from across the map or booting you out of the game. They only care about the money. I would avoid this game like the plague and also be wary of their new Red Dead Redemption coming out to see if they do the same thing as they did here my money is on they just copy/paste but make the microtransactions worse and the grind even longer from the get go.
