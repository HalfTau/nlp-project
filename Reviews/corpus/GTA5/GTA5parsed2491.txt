FIX THIS PIECE OFONLINE ONLYI didnt pay for a bunch of broken Loading  30 hours, bugs on every corner u gonna be stuck in walls, floor, falling down the planet and way, WAY moreDont even think about getting money, just spent 20 mins to get a ing 10 k and even that shipment I could sell later got stuck in the ing air and I couldnt do aabout it!U gotta love it when u get teleported by a modder or cheater or who the  are they and instakilled with all other players on the server....The only good way how to get money is selling cars, but there is a problem  players... not that type of players you think... On every single server u ve got these.... guys who are totaly not in a depression cuz of their  life and that means they gonna blow you up with Hydras, ing HALO stuff like flying cars / motorbikes or by the ing cheat....And if you finally get into that ing warehouse where u just stored that super good vehicle for which u gonna get 80 k of pure profit, u get an error  SAVING FAILED, WE ARE SORRY, BUT WE ARE ING  AND WE CANNOT MAKE A GOOD SERVER CONNECTION  so you need to wait like ing 30 minutes till thatis going well, and after that u gonna get probably blown / killed cuz others have more money than you, cuz modders like to drop money....That game is kinda good, but its ing worthless to play it untill it gets repaired... IF it gets repaired I meant....Probably gonna waste another 2 days of trying to get sum money for another useless business which product gets stuck in the air3/10 I am ingoff!
