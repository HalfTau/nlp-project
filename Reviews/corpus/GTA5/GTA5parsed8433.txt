This deserves the THE EVEN BETTER THAN I EXPECTED award is because this game has so many small little details you wouldnt aspect to be in this game but it is, its trying its best to make it a realistic game but still playable at a point, so i highly suggest GTA V if u really want to roleplay like its real life but all pixelated.
