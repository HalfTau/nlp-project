dnt buy this game...too many modders ruining lobbies plus this game has poorly optimized graphics and bad network..frame drops and frequent disconnection has a major problem on this game and not to mention the mod used by hackers which can see your ip address while in lobbies so its a no no so do some research before diving head first...remember modders and hackers are supreme in this game not the rockstar itself.
