The publisher of GTA 5 doesnt want mods, because its business model revolves around selling you shark cards. Every piece of content that has come out for GTA 5 has been associated with its online component. Would gun smuggling be amazing in single player? Absolutely, but that hurts their bottom line. Mods take you away from multiplayer, and the grind for more money. Do not let this stand, show Rockstar and Take Two that you are not going to tollerate their money grubbing practices.
