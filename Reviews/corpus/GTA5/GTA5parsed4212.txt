This game is whack. The story, a constant barrage of tasks, growing in complexity and challenge for the most part, fun to play, while the online version is... somewhere between narcissism modders can ruin anyones good time, absolute freedom, and mindnumbing monotony, with a heaping scoop of attentiondefecitdisorder added for flavor. Fun and boring in the same bag. A neverending chase for more cash, to get new stuff, to make more money, ad nasuem.
