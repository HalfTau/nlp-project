So, I got GTA5 pretty much on the start, when it was freshlyreleased on PC and on Steam...Was I happy about it? Yes.Did I play all night long, only taking breaks for natures calling? Yes.Did I feel that the game is being dragged through? No. Everything on the side was just like a cherry on top of a wellcrafted main story.Was the ending climactic? Oh, absolutely!And is online any good? Even a few years later? You bet yourit is.The game is charming in a lot of ways. During the first mission, you are being thrown in the center of the action. Shooting, alarms, explosions... Your typical action share. But it ends quickly and slows down, letting you take the role of Franklin. And let me tell you something... Maybe if you get rid of this yeeyeehaircut... You know what I am talking about. Franklin is nothing special. Just a guy who had rough upbringing and uses every opportunity to push through. And the story being built around it is awesome. Just as well as around Michael and Trevor who I dont know what people like for. Hes an  all the way through. Where was I going with this? I dont know. But heres something get the game and you will have a lot of fun time in Los Santos. Be it single or multiplayer. Peace!
