Well, where should I start?With the closure of OpenIV, I dont think I will be wanting to play GTA V anymore. This has ruined the modding side of things for a lot of people, due to people stupidity and incompitence of having to hack the online servers.Some people doesnt want to use American vehicles, they might want to use British vehicles for their specific aspect.
