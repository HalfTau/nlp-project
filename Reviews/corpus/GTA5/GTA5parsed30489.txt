If you were someone like me who literally just bought this game for the singleplayer mods, then you wasted your money because they completly ed it with the open IV situation. I think I played online on here once, and I soon went back to singleplayer because I could have alot more fun with mods, than some horrible online which basically forces you to buy shark cards to even get anywhere in the game. and if you dont do that, you have to grind and grind until your just doing this for one vehicle or house or something. If you are even thinking about buying this game right now which I hope you arent dont. You will waste your time playing online and play singleplayer and after awhile hate it because it gets boring without anything to change the game at all.
