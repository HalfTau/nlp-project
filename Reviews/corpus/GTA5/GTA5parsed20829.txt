Got banned a while back for modding, because I was starting to get a littlefor losing all of my money every single time I retaliated to some  in a supercar blowing myup, probably made it up to level 90 before i said f it, Im tired of grinding all day for Jack Its a fun game if you can manage to get lucky and find a modder who will give you extra cash, otherwise its close to impossible to get what you want in the online world. Used to be a good game, but now its just turned into rock stars cash cow. Ill change my review once there are noticable changes made to improve content.
