I dont see the problem with the mods shut down. The base game itself is amazing, the online, while it may have some toxic players can be really fun with friends. The amount of play time you get for it is insane, even with its high price. This is one of my favorate games of all time, and it does not deserve the negative reviews its getting for removing modding.
