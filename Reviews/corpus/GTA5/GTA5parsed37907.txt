jesus christ, ok people. Stop complaining that taketwo the parent company of rockstar took down mods. because gta 5 has alot of content even without mods. I had never cared for mods because i always want to experience the core game. now am i saying was it right? No I am not but that does not mean that the gaame is bad GTA 5 Is a great game. For those who said they banned mods but no hackers well taketwo took care of that and took down 3 of the biggest hacking tools for gta online. so stop complaining about no mods because rockstar actually enjoys mods its just taketwo who doesnt I give this game a good rating because its a good game so can you stop giving a negative review on a game that has plenty of content even without mods? Please because most of these negative reviews arent actually reviews jesus well this isnt much of a review either but its just that we all can live without mods and you could do mods for other stuff like skyrim
