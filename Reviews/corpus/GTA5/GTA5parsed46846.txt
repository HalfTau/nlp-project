Take Two Interactive are seriously the worst, doing their best to tear down a community that has supported them for a very long time.OpenIV did everything they could to stop their tool being used in multiplayer, but its cheaper to threaten them with legal action than it is to help them.Grand Theft Auto games are always fantastic, easily my favourite franchise, but not everyone including me is interested in playing with other people online. So while Rockstar puts all their efforts into creating cars with rockets and jet skis with wheels for those who do enjoy online, the single player guys get nothing. Its mods that keep me going back to the game, but it looks like that will stop soon!
