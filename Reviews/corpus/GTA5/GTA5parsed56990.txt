Cease and desist against singleplayer content? If they go after FiveM next, this game is completely dead. There is literally no reason  to wach, play, or buy this game. The GTAOnline is a POS that is not even affected by going after these modders. What the online hackers do is mess with the RAM access and the insecure P2P connection. For Take 2 going after these modders is ridiculous and leads to total ruin for PC Modding scene.
