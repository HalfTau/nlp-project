Rockstar has locked new Free DLC for the online game version behind huge pay walls in the form of requiring you to buy property in order to purchase vehicles.  Additionally they have neglected single player version of the game by not adding these new vehicles to it.  Normally this would be a problem because it would have been modded in later however now mods are banned.  My recommendation buy it only when it is on sale for at least 60 off.
