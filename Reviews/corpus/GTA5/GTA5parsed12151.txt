One of the best selling games to date and rightly so. Had a bumpy start with playing online and then recently the whole issue with modding the game which both were resolved fairly quickly. Besides those issues it has been a really good experience having played it on the Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC was worth playing through it on all platforms. I cant fault it whatsoever
