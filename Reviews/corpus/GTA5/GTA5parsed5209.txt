Great game. But F the cash grab.They expect us to farm for days just to get a car. They either have to triple the money we get or cut the costs of EVERYTHING in this game by at least 1/2 or maybe even 3/4.  They also need to give us back all the money we spent in total if they do that.Also, this socalled Albany Hermes, the free car on Christmas, I was charged 550k for it. It showed up as free. I was chargedF Rockstar
