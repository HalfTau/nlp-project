Great game until they decides to add Oppressor. A motor bike that goes completely against physics and realism of the game. All GTAs have annoying things to look more realistic, like taking forever to get into a car or an apartment or down the stairs. So I always thought Rockstart wants realism. Well I was wrong.The game turned into Saints Row with this stupid bike that can destroy helicopters, tanks and fighter jets. And since the game if FULL of cheaters, even that is hard to get this bike, everybody got one. Ruined the game for honest players.
