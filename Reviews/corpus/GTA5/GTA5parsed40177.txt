gta with a grind is not gta. you have completely lost everything that this series was all in the pursuit of money. making it so i cant garage cars unless i pay in game money for them is the exact opposite of every other GTA game in exsistance, i understand paying in game money for ammo although it still takes all my money and paying for upgrades on the cars also makes sense. but why do i need to spend millions of dollars to fill the cheapest garage with the basic t cars?. i wasnt a modder but now that you have removed modding from single player i imagine those people arent happy either.. rockstar you have offically killed your franchise. and they only way i will ever give you another dollar is if you make a new game that makes me feel like im playing gta again, stop adding unbalanced content that cant be accessed by everyone, and stop trying to suck real world money out of people that have just spent real world money on your game, greedy fat pigs
