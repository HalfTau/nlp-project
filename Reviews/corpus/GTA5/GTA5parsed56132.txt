Take Two is a scummy publisher that just wants to siphon as much money out of their players as possible, despite GTA5 already being 60. This is something I usually just ignore, since Im not one of the whales that these companies chase after, but this OpenIV thing pushed it over the edge. Whoevers responsible should honestly feel ashamed of trying to push such a consumerhostile practice.
