Great game, loved the story, love online, just grab a few friends or look for some on reddit or some other platform to interact with. The missions you have to do in a public session werent as bad as people are saying it is, even then you dont have to do THAT much in a public session, and its not insanely difficult to find a session with little people, people just overreact to the online modders and hackers in my opinion.
