Now, after almost 500 hours of playing this game i definitely realise that this game is not worth of buying and not just because of the such a high price. Anyway the singleplayer along with the storyline is still good.No, actually i realised that a long time ago, but i had some kind of hope back then and believed that there will be something from the devs like improving the anticheat system lots of honest players were banned instead of real cheaters, yep welcome to GTA online adding more robberies or something like that. BUT NO, If youre expecting the same  dont even think about it, because instead  they keep adding stupid skins, masks, clothers, new vehicles which is pointless and etc.This is ridicilous, and i guess most of the players are disappointed with that fact as well. Unless  theyre 11 years old kids who got the game as a Christmas present and who used to enjoy all that fancy stuff along with their classmates.
