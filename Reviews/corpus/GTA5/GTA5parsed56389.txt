We need to stop greedy publishers and developers from dictating our rights as consumers. We purchased the game. It is our property to do with as we please. Open IV never messed with GTA Online and Take 2 has no basis for doing this except out of a pursuit for absolute power and greed. Long lost are the times of valuing the consumer. We need to put and end to this type of asshattery.
