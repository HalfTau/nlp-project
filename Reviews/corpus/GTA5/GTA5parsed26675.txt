I am sorry to say that game developers need to learn a lesson. We are gamers and we are modders. Bethesda has the right idea when it comes to complete modding and overhaul, NintendoRockstarTake Two and Playstation need to move to the future. The day when developers are the sole creators of their IPs is coming to an end. We as players and vetran players need to usher developers into the future. No more giving them money for halfcreations. Games where we can tailor things to fit our needs is the future. Games that allow the player to play is the future. Learn from this fact. Accept it.
