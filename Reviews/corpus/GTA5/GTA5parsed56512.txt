The ability to mod games is the staple of what makes PC objectively superior to console. Tell me. How does modding SINGLEPLAYER hurt anyone in any shape or form? Is it seriously now illegal for me to go on a rampage as the Hulk in the center of Los Santos, or dress up as SpiderMan and attempt to save the city? What the actual ?And it doesnt stop there. No, Rockstar and Take Two have made it utterly impossible to afford anything without grinding endlessly or dishing out hundreds of dollars for imaginary money. that. Oh, and guess what? Multiplayer modders are still running rampant. I cant have my fun in Singleplayer, but some asshat can snipe me from on top of Maze Bank no matter where I am on the map.I have played GTA since GTA III, and was awakened to the amazing modding community for GTA IV. How do you stop the production of almost a decade of amazing content?Congratulations, Take Two. You have officially lost the respect of the PC community. If they are smart, they will not buy any further products with your name on it. GG Take Two.
