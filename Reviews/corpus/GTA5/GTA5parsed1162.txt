Have you ever had the experince in an online game, when you were like Whoa wtf... Oh thats what killed me sigh.?If you play this game online your gonna sitting there dieing over and over again to a bunch of ingin flying cars that shoot heat seeking rockets. so unless your planing on buying money for this game if your new, sitting in your apartment waiting for a mission to que up for, buy money so you can be come a rocket car or risk your car blowing up so many times. That you forget what you even left your apartment to do. So this is basically an ad saying by money to become a rocket car or just dont bother playing...I give this game a 7/9 i would partial recomend buying this game.
