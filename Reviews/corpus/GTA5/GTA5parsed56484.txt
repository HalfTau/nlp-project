With the CD issued against openIV, T2 has ruined the longevity of this game. If youve been living under a rock and havent played the story mode, go rent it and beat it in a day or two. GTA Online is garbage, its a cash grab that will still be full of cheaters until the day they shut the servers down. Dont support T2, dont support Rockstar until they pull their heads out of thier asses and tell their parent company that the gaming community wont stand for it.
