Story is boring and uninteresting. They went for a new style thats much different from GTA IV, including playing as 3 characters instead of one but in my opinion, this was a mistake. It doesnt allow you to connect with the people you play as or really feel that they are in any kind of danger. You dont have as much freedom as you did in GTA IV neither do you have similar mechanics and physics. The game plays more as a cartoon where as GTA IV felt realistic. Online is nothing but a mess and will be an awful experience to anyone just buying the game. The developers made Online more of a Pay2Win type where unless you drop hundreds of dollars on the game, youre gonna be working for a solid week grinding boring game modes to get a single thing you may have had your eye on and in the end, it wouldnt have been worth it. The developers are also attempting to remove all mod support for the game entirely so if you wanted this game for that, I would recommend taking your money elsewhere. You can easily find hundreds of games on Steam alone that are far better than this pile of garbage.
