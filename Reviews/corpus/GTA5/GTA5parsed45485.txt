I will definitely still play GTA V as Ive invested a lot of time into building up my character. I jumped in on 360 right after Online launched. However, the continued monotization of the game by Take Two has been incredibly frustrating as a Rockstar fan. I sincerely hope that they heed the calls of the community for less money grabbing, more community engagement just, for the love of all that is holy and destructable, give us the single player content youve teased for literally years and provide us the tools to mod the Single Player experience without interfereing with Online. Both aspects of the game are amazing sandboxes because they allow us to live out our own criminal fantasies better than any other game out there but it is only going to turn more people away the longer the community is ignored. Rockstar should look to how Bethesda handles the modding community for guidance. Embrace us and we will keep your game alive for years to come. Until this happens, I cannot recommend the game to new players. I sincerely hope I will be able to write a new review in the coming weeks talking about how Rockstar listened to us and engaged and didnt just give the shareholders everything. We are your business. Please listen. Rant end. Review negative overall.
