I am shocked and disappointed TakeTwo would shutter the modding community on this game. I am all for banning cheaters and multiplayer modders, but OpenIV explicity avoided messing with multiplayer files which should prevent script kiddies from messing with T2s money printing machine.Avoid this game unless you enjoy the idea of purchasing another phenomenal game overrun by microtransactions from an anticonsumer company.Also, for what its worth, the multiplayer which they seem to focus on exclusively is a complete chore  I gave up on it shortly after release after trying really hard to get into it because I was spending more time in lobbies  connect screens staring down at Los Santos than actually playing the darn game.The singleplayer is phenomenal, its a shame T2/RS never added to it.
