Great Job Rockstar you actually managed to Fck us once again with your TakeTwo Garbage. This game was always a joke and will continue to be. Every single update they force you to buy their overpriced shark cards, that get you absolutely nowhere in the game. Out of any of the games out on steam, this game by far needs modders because rockstar just keeps fckng everyone every update.
