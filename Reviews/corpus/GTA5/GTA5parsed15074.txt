The story is fantastic and it really thrives on pulling you into the characters and the emotions they display.  You can really relate to the characters and say to yourself hey I have a reletive thats just like Traver.  The graphics are wonderful and really have you take a moment to stop and take in the scenery.  If youve never played GTA V before then youre in for a treat.However, and this is the problem with returning players, if you already have played GTA Online on console and you want to transfer your character to PC then youre out of luck.  Rockstar Games has disabled character transfer.  So if you want to continue on with your GTA Online profile then youre stuck on either last gen consoles or current gen consoles.  Extremely bad news if youre stuck on last gen as you cannot continue on with all the cool and fun additions they released since they released hastes.So if you havent played GTA Online at all which would be doubtful unless youve never played GTA V and youre wanting to play, then definately get this game on PC.  If you already have played this for console and already have a GTA Online character then dont buy.  I, for one, am most likely gonna get a refund on this game.
