I had to get a refund, apparently i had a social account connected to steam that i havent used for years so when i tried to put the activation code in it gave me an error saying sign in with your social club account connected to steam so i couldnt play the game.Thanks rockstar, last game i buy from you, i am sick of all your DRM crap i should be able to use any social account to activate a game i have paid money for. My advice play this game on Xbox One and PS4
