worst game in history. to much bugs. in every lobby with over 10 people in there is atleast 1 modder thats going to  up your experience. they overprice everything. when u climb mount chilliad they spawn u in the middle of the mountain so u cant do if u kill urself u are just going to spawn at the same place again. But if they add real cars instead of these gay cars they have now i would be happy.
