The singleplayer is fantastic, recommend completing it first before venturing in the morass that is GTA online.While loaded with lots of great content and continous free updates, it is grindy and takes a lot of time investment to get some of the nicer vehicles or property. Also prepare to deal with the rampant cheating in almost every session you join, as it is absolutely everywhere in this game due to the client side P2P nature of its networking implementation.Hopefully they can rebuild the online portion from the ground up in GTA 6 in order to reduce the scale of this problem, if thats possible with this type of game.
