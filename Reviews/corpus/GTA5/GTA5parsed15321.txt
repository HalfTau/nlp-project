GTA Online started with really good intentions. But Rockstar couldnt keep the servers up. When they fixed that, people hacked it to oblivion. When they slowed that down the content jumped the shark. Lets pay over a million for a Hipster pinto. Then the hackers came back. The Comunity is ironicly toxic, and the developers are deaf to the pleas of anything but the most hard core 12 year old. If some one isnt hacking the game to steal your money, then they are hacking the game to autokill you, or they are hacking the game to buy nearly invurnable Rockstar made Vehicles that can be only killed by spending millions on other nearly invurnable Rockstar made vehicles. Saints Row jumped the shark first Saints Row 4 but GTA threw away their realism to sell more Million dollar ugly hyper cars and Missile launching tanks that can only be realisticly made with microtransactions.
