Well, I was apparently stupider than what I had previously thought. Bought the game to play online with friends for pc of course and have gotten on and off over the course of a couple years now. Recently, I began playing with the newfound addition of the doomsday heists and other content which has been added over the course of the past few months. Played the game heavy for approximatley two days, and on Christmas Day no less, I discovered, after having completed a heist setup mission that my online bank had been cleared of over half of my earnings over that two day period. About 40 hours of my life wasted in building up money on this godforsaken game just to loose it all in either some glitch or through the vigalantestyle assault that Rockstar is fighting against Modders. Whether a mistake, or Rockstar thinking Im a modder, Ive no idea, but Im rather disappointed in having funded this ludicrous buisness when they are so anxious to punish those that made them what they are.
