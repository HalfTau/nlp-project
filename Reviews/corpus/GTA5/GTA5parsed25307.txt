GTA 5 is a great open world RPG with good gameplay, and tons of whacky things that you can do in the game. The map is gigantic, and theres always random events or crazy side missions that you can do tons of single player content would recommend that.However, I have a lot of issues with this game.Firstly, the menus are grade A garbage fire, and they have unintuitive controls.Secondly, rockstars social club is trash, and makes the game take forever to load.Thirdly, after paying for a 60 game, rockstar decided it would be a good idea to put microtransactions into the online component. Yep, for buying a full priced triple A game, you get the pleasure of having the opportunity to pay for ingame currency. Which brings us to one of the big issues that are the mods. Rockstar recently decided to ban mods, not only in the multiplayer portion of the game, but the singleplayer portion as well. This takes away community made content which they supported in the past, simply because their bottom line wasnt big enough yet.4/10, wouldnt reccomend.
