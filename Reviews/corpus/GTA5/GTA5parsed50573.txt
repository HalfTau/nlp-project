The antimodding fiasco has been resolved at least for now thanks to the community, but I still cant recommend this game, dont get me wrong its a great game... but it could have been so much more.The map size was obviously held back by lastgen consoles, outside of los santos its basically a huge empty countryside with some roads around it, not to mention the lack of a singleplayer expansion we were promised since the game was released, and dont even get me started on the cash cow that is GTA ONLINE.OLD REVIEWI bet the corporate s at TakeTwo Interactive are happy for ruining over 10 years of IV/V modding by shuting down OpenIV. you TakeTwo, you greedy selfish s, I hope you choke on your precious pile of cash and sharkcards.PS OpenIV had NOTHING to do with GTA ONLINE hacking, it was used only for SinglePlayer mods, wich makes this situation even more stupid.
