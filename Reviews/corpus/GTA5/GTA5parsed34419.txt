this new update.. its so unorganized! theres barely any tutorial on what to do. i spent over a day trying to figure out how to upgrade the new bike, wasted tons of cash by buying the wrong rooms in the mobil command center, only to have to get rid of those rooms to finally be able to upgrade the new bike. after months of not playing, i came back to see hackers are still in full effect! one even doing a little countdown taunt in the chat before he crashes everyones game at the same time.  wonderful! around 9 months ago after returning to gta after a 4 month break, logged in to find my account was totally wiped out and i had to start over from scratch. i put over 3500 hours into that character, rank 487. never was fixed, rockstar support seems automated.
