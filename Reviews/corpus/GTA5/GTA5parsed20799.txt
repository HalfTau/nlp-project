Grand Theft Auto V is a decent game, with a superb singleplayer campaign and an outrageously fun multiplayer option. Youll notice everyone is complaining about mods not longer working or such, I myself never used mods because I didnt fancy them. I have no say in the matter I just dont agree that everyone should down vote the game based on those reasons. I also found it astonishingly moronic that they also down voted other games like L.A Noire simply because its a Rockstar title. The game includes a little bit of everything, I myself find flaws every playthrough, nothing too huge for me too list. Im going to have to give the game a 4/5. I could see a 5/5 if the following DLCs are interesting.Huge range of different weapons from Pistols to launchers.Allows you to build unique tank builds.All sorts of terrain with color options.fun and when learned a whole new gameOldie, gangster, psychopathRandom deaths, etc.Police immediately become hostile by just standing next to them?Too many horde mode type missions.The game adds rather interesting side quests that you can just completely ignore and miss out on.Huge range of different weapons from kitty bombs to guppiesAllows you to build unique tank builds.All sorts of terrain with color options.fun and when learned a whole new gameStripClub,24/7, carwash, gunstore, clothestore, and modshopThe game is either grind or Pay to win, people with 60 hours have incredible weapons compared to beginners. People with 60 have even heavier armories.
