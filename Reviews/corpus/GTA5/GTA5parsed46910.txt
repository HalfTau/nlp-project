I hate having to write what Im about to write, but its the truth.Take Two Interactive, the publishers of GTA V, and by extension Rockstar Games, the developer, have no respect for you as a consumer. They have no respect for their own product. They have no respect for the hard work anyones put into GTA V, and its been made abundantly clear.The one thing that kept the GTA series alive on PC after even Rockstar stopped making content for them was Open IV, and it was shut down. Whats worse than that is that neither Take Two nor Rockstar Games have the decency to be honest about why theyre doing it  blaming the ability to hack their online mode using it. Now, unfortunately, both TTI and RG forgot that everyone else also has a brain and can read words, since the one big thing about Open IV from the start has been that it does NOT  with online. This is a vain attempt to squeeze more money out of one of the best games of 2015, and one of the biggest dissappointments of the past 2 years.
