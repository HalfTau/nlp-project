The newest chapter of the Paper Mario story isnt just out of this world ... its out of this dimension. What at first glance appears to be a 2D sidescroller ripped straight from the pages of the Paper Mario universe soon turns into a 3D actionadventure that defies all video game logic. Fusing 2D and 3D perspectives, not to mention RPG and platformer elements, the game slips back and forth between dimensions. The action sprawls across eight worlds filled with traps, puzzles, bizarre mysteries and items that often draw themselves out of thin air. Oh, and just because Marios in the title doesnt mean hes the only star  players also get to play as Peach and Bowser.
