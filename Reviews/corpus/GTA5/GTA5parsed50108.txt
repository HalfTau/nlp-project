I dont really play nor care about singleplayer, but when i heard that T2 were banning singleplayer mods i just couldnt help but cringe. GTA V must have one of the most dedicated modding communities out there, its a shame watching it all burn, worts part is people want to boycott stuff like Shark cards and are even telling the community to not buy RDR2 once its released, but sadly i doubt that will work. All we can do now is wait, thats it.PS I dont think we should blame R for this, but in a way i still feel theyre responsable.
