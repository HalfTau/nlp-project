Modding has always been a huge  part of GTA on Pc, and with Take Two putting their slimey hands on OpenIv, 10 years of hard work of people all aroud the globe have now been made redundant. I hope that Take Two resolves this issue, and soon we will all be able to experience GTA V on Pc how it is meant to be played, WITH MODS. Open Iv was a primarily single player experience and it was desiegned in such a way that it didnt affect the game developers in any negative way. While hackers coninue to plauge GTA Online, the fans of modding are widely dissapointed with Take Twos sensless procedings. This situation is a sign that big gaming companies cannot be trusted and that Take Two thinks only about the money, and does not care about the people buying their products if you dont belive me read what their CEO recently said about microtransactions, and how they are not expoliting GTA online players enough. Tldr Boycot Take Two and their shady buissness practices.
