I enjoyed the singleplayer to the max, especially using HelixScripts and other hilarious mods.  Multiplayer sucks your real life money up just so you can pay for their purposely overpriced items simply so youll buy their cards instead of doing all the work.  Why so many hours logged for myself?  Because I do all the work instead.
