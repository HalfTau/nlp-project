Single player is a pretty solid experience.Online on the other hand? Paywall here, paywall there. I didnt buy this game twice to ing spend even more on microtransactions just to be able to enjoy this game. Everythings a stupid grind, and if you dont fork over your cash to Rockstar, better be prepared to waste your life just trying to get a garage.Rockstar doesnt care about the god mode guy raining nukes on the lobby, or that guy spawning UFOs, or that guy whose Minigun has explosive rounds. Oh no. They care once you illegitimately obtain a few hundred ingame dollars that you can use to buy some in cigarettes. Bless your business model and your  customer service. Maybe listen to players some more, you greedy corporate scumbags.
