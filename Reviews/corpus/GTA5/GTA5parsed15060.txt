Single player is a masterpiece, which shouldnt surprise you with a Rockstar Game.The online portion, what was supposed to give this game life after you beat the singleplayer story, is so riddled with hackers and microtransactions that it isnt worth playing.Couple their complete joke of a tech support system with the fact that this game is still going for full price more than two years after its port to PC and three years after its initial release, and I just cant reccomend it.If you have a modder give you money, even against your will they spawn money on top of you and it goes into your wallet as soon as it touches you you risk Rockstar taking that money away which they should while also taking your actual hardearned money which they should not.
