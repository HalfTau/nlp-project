GTA V is a great game. Ive had lots of fun playing it over the years... on the Xbox 360. I bought the game a second time on Steam purely to have fun with mods! Modded GTA V is an amazing, wild and unpredictable game.The reason I am only reviewing it now is because up until now the above statement has been my opinion on the game. However TakeTwo publisher for Rockstar Games have sent a CD letter to the developers of arguably the best GTA V and GTA IV mod Open IV. This was the mod that paved the way to most of the other mods developed for the games.Rockstar Games is not the enemy, but TakeTwo is treating this great game made by great people as a pure cashgrab. Mods were a great way for people to increase the longevity of a game they love. TakeTwo decided that we were having too much fun with mods. Do not support this company until they are held accountable for their actions. Do not support them until they can prove they actually care about the consumers that fill their swimming pool with money.
