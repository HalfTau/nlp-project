Single player This is one of the best games created. Minus the fact you cant get newly released vehicles in SP without a mod menu.OnlineThey broke this game a while ago with the amount of grinding you had to do.EDITThis game is very fun when you have money and the latest vehicles and weapons ECT.But alot of the new vehicles are very expensive and require alot of work and time for just one.Thats why I recommend getting this game and using a ONLINE MOD MENU, Infamous.It unlocks everything for you that is normally locked away behind a pay wall or hours upon hours of grinding. Dont get banned like me though  Use Infamous
