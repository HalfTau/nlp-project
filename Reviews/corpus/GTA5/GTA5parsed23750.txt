I used to love GTA. Modding single player experience made it a masterpiece.. Now its just trash. Not being able to play a game the way I want to is rediculous. I payed for the game, I should be able to experience it the way I want to. I understand that multiplayer need to be controlled but why the  is it their business how I play it in single player. They are money hungry s. Already made an inconcievalbe ammount of money and now they want to make even more at the expense of all the people that supported them.  these people. They have no respect for the community that made them successful. I will never buy another RockStar product again and I advise anyone reading this to do the same.
