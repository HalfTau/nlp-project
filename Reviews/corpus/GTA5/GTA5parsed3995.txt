Note I am not very deep in single player, nor in Online play, but i do have 7 hours of experience to say i know a bit or two.GTA 5 is a open world sandbox game, which has 2 very core components, Single player, and GTA online which is almost a seperate game. I will not be covering GTA 5s base game as its well done, but i havent done much. GTA Online is fun to an extent, but terrible in other extents. It is hard to make a decent amount of money without forming your own team, as randoms are random in skill, but more often than not, you get put in with the most downright awful people who cant do objectives worth a damn, resulting in a very very low payout, no RP as in repuation, like Levels, etc. meaning you basically earned enough to cover the cost of ammo and armor, but thats it. Now when you do complete a mission, you may make 30K or more, which is good enough, until you realise alot of the good stuff is over 100K. Its annoying. However, the gameplay is fun. I do not have an issue with it, and i got it on sale for 25 bucks, Do i think its worth your time? oh yes. its a well done game, but the Online has some issues with the playerbase being morons.
