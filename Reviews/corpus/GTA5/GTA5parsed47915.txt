Take Two ed over the OpenIV team, a mod team that helped create so many mods for a decade now by threatening legal action on them. If you are going to buy this game, dont, wait until they reverse this absolute t. Its ironic though, T2 allows a bunch of chuckle dickwads to run around their game hacking until the sun comes up and doesnt give two  but as soon as someone actually creates something really amazing it gets shutdown immediately. Absolute retardation
