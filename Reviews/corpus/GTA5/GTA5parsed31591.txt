A very bad game which has impacted the modding player community very negatively. This game is not RECOMMENDED for other players out there who have no experience on this game. This games community are just  and have been MONEY HUNGRY all the time. The community itself has Banned a tool for Moddin known as OpenIV which is a tool for Moddin only in SINGPLAYER. The community seems to be having a difficulty on understanding that OpenIV CANNOT BE USED in Multiplayers ACTIVITY. The ONLY THING WHICH CAN BE USED FOR MODDING IN MULITPLAYER ARE Trainers which give a negative impact to the players in ONLINE. If the community wanted to PROTECT the experience of Online they should have banned Players who use such risky programmes such Trainers, Scripts, And other Porgramme editing tools. Rockstar let me just point out one thing. YOU ARE MONEY HUNGRY AND I AM NEVER BUYING ANY DLC OR ANY GAME WHICH YOU RELEASE FROM NOW ON GOODBYE GTA AND YOUR god damn Community which only care about MONEY!
