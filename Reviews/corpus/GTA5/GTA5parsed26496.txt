Great Game. You get GTA V and GTA Online, whilst the storymode offline offers a long, interesting story and a lot of freeplay in the open World, Online realy only makes sense with friends, preferably 3 to be able to play heists, etc.Rockstars policy banning most modding tools and requiering you to BIND your game to one social Club account and the long loading times in online add a grain of Salt to the expirience, Still a recommendation when On sale to play with friends.EDIT There are a bunch of annoying hackers again.
