Rockstar sucks.  correcting my account with no explanation, over 1 million stupid rock dollars.  how about some credit for all the times after gunrunning it wont save because it cant connect to rockstar servers.  ive never modded, but been killed and harassed many times by modders, lost plenty of cargo and crates to people who somehow kill everyone in the lobby at once.  taking their poorly secured problems out on players that are just grinding for stupid cars is a really bad way to treat customers.
