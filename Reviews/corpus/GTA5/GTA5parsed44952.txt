I brought GTA V when it first came out on PC. Because I loved the Online on xBox 360.Now this game is wonderful. I dont play GTA V to play with mods, I play to go online.The fight that having between the modding community and Taketwo? That has nothing to do really with the game, that just people who want to change the way the game plays.I love GTA V and the way it handles.Aside form the hackers, not all of them play to ruin your fun. Some will even be so nice and give you money.So, think before you read the attacks on Taketwo, this game IS worth buying.But hey, thats what I think.
