Best single player experience in a game in a long time. After all, the game isnt PC. Hahahha. Never seen that pun before. hehe. Sorry.But I have to say no to this game unless it is dramaticly on sale. Because you dont want to buy the online part of the game. Micro transaction ruled existence. Grinding. No profit. Hackers left right and center ruining your grinding.So if it is 50 of grab it and play single play, but online is a boring unfriendly grindfest.The devs are trying to milk this game, especially online, and we have seen they will do anything to accomplish this.Severely overpricing things so you need to buy money. The money you buy is phenomenally overpriced in itself.Either way it is your decision. Good luck.Sory for bad speeling
