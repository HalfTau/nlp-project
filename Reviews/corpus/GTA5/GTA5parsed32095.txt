The OpenIV thing was honestly the last straw for me with this game.We are no longer allowed to modify our singleplayer game so its actually fun to play, while cheaters and modders are still rampant on the online servers. WTF?I now have a 60 game which is basically unplayable after completing the story, with broken multiplayer milked to death by Rockstar and not being able to mod my SP for  and giggles.
