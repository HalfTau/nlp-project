People write reviews for this game as if online is the only portion. It isnt. Infact GTA Online is a tacked on mode and isnt representative of the entire package. The Storymode campaign is the best Ive played in years. I bought the game for ps3, pc and the online isnt terrible. So sad the game has this many negative reviews because of shark cards on a tacked on online mode which you dont even have to use. This game easily gives you well over your moneys worth.
