After playing through the main story, mods is what kept me playing this and enjoying myself.Now that the mods are gone, theres nothing left to do. Thank you for ruining any sort of longevity this game had.Its like game publishers and developers are vehemently out of touch with the needs and wants of their customers. Probably wont purchase another one of their titles again.
