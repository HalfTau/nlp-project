This game is awesome, but be careful. I got false permbanned because I got cash dropped on, Hackers will do this to get ppl banned, my first ban I was banned for modding even though I wasnt, and my second ban To be honest I was modding, so I deserved the second ban. DO NOT GET THIS GAME, YOU WILL GET A FALSE BAN OR TWO, ITS NOT WORTH IT. This is a hackers prime time, there are so many mod menus being released, and Rockstar Games says They cant help you. Even though they probably can, thats just there excuse. You are paying 60 for a sack of drama and complete t.
