Played Grand Theft Auto V for quite a while as well as previous releases. I must admit that the multiplayer side of the game has been at first quite confusing but as the time moved forward, I have really enjoyed it. Im leaving a negative review for this game as I have started to come back to this game less often due to the lack of its excitement and the true meaning of GTA online, the development team has focused way too much on adding new content that honestly makes me even bored wanting to even check it out  Multiplayer is mainly about ruining the gameplay experience for other players and for the biggest part me as well as other players on steam community has left a negative review for this reason as well  the company focuses on new content to invite ingame purchases such as shark cards.If you are hoping to purchase this game mainly for its multiplayer feature, please find an other game, you will not experience a cooperative multiplayer experience, however it will only force you leave a negative review like this one.Best part of the game in Single Player campaign which has an interesting and immersive storyline with stunning graphics, however my overall experience of the game which includes MULTIPLAYER is poor.
