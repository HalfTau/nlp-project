Game was fun... But when the Dev team goes in and edits everyones bank accounts to barely anything it shows you that they really just want you to buy shark cards. Unfortunately now that Gunrunnung is out and the anticheat system is in placemore like attacking everything that makes GTA fun a huge population decrease and thats says a lot because Ive played this game all day everyday for the past week. Now Id like to let you know GTAO is about going in and doing whatever you want... Messing with other players, racing, challenges, killing people over and over, trying to run from a griefer... That is what makes the game fun. Youve Disappointed your fanbase ROCKSTAR. RIP GTAV/GTAO 4/2015  6/2017.P.S. 8,000,000 is not worth 100 USD Greedy s
