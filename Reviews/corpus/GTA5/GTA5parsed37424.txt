While GTA 5 is a great game, for Take 2 making the OpenIV team take down OpenIV, I leave this review. The same goes for the structure of the online game. The reason there are hackers in online is because of the ridiculous prices of all the online content, and the stupidly high priced shark cards. The online is just one big grind for nothing.
