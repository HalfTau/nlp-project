EDIT TakeTwo / Rockstar have reversed their decision and Open IV is back up.  As such, I felt it only fair I revert my review back to positive.GTAOnline is plagued with TakeTwo simply trying to get money.  What should be a 60 game with plenty of content is actually a 60 game with 500 worth of extra unlockable content by buying shark cards.  What makes matters worse is that there is also a plethora of hackers on GTAOnline, doing anything from spawning explosions all around you, griefing, spawning a cage around you, making themselves invincible and even draining your own hard work or bought money!  These hackers also have a habit of spawning themselves money, and occassionally you! But then TakeTwo getsand takes your money away.  So you have hackers taking your money and TakeTwo taking your money, both IG and IRL.So you play single player, but you can only do so much.  So maybe you mod it a bit.  Well, now thats not allowed.  TakeTwo has already ed over your online experience, and now theyre ing over single player.Moral of the story, dont buy this game.  Its not good anymore.
