Okay, its about time to make a review..With the recent OpenIV shut down, I dont see this game going anywhere good anytime soon.Overall, theyve ed their own game up when in the beginning it was literally perfect. How the  can you do that?? ?I loved OpenIV, being able to mess around with wacky vehicles and change peds into buzz lightyear, but now they seem to think that it ruined their perfect online experience...Online has been ruined too... Too many modders running around dropping millions onto unsuspecting players, that then gets that player banned, but the modder roams unscathed... Please T2, fix your ing game.. Its amazing to have fun with friends in online, but with all the new updates, like patching the ALTENTER solo pub glitch, and blocking online ports for solo pubs now having new ports assigned so we cant do it, shows how much you want to  us over and how little respect you have. It was the only way to consistently do the missions and play the dlc YOU made for US.If you dont fix this expect less than 2 of the current playerbase to EVER consider buying another product from you again.
