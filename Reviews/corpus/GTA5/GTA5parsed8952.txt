Was a good game at first. Eventually led to hackers in every lobby, infinte loading screen times for multiplayer, inability to play the game normally because you need TONS of money to be able to get anything That which helps you win. Every lobby for heists being filled with ragequiters/and/or foreign players. I am from the US, and I think it should be regionlocked. Also squeakers and children... Wouldnt recommend unless the previous is fixed.TLDRPros Fun to play in solo lobbies and friendsonlyCampaignCharacter OptionsCons Cheaters in every lobbySqueakersRageQuitersForeign players Not regionlockedLong online loading screensMicrotransactions around every cornerP2WNo Campaign DLCClothing options Hats and helmets/masks.
