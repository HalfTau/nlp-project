Omg how the hell are the reveiws mixed!!! Dont believe what people say I mean yes there are rude bits but if you avoid the strip club and skip one or two of the cut scenes and you dont care about swearing then youre in for a treat. the single player mode or story mode as they call it is pretty fun and if you get bored then use there app to learn the cheat code done by controller if you have one, which you probally should but it wont affect it really its just better with controller or by typing it in console commands. Then you have GTA V Online, AWESOME. yes there is the constant players killing you BUT you can always go on a invite only session so you are on your own Solo session diables some features the only two things I have noticed is it can be quite hard to get a lot of money if you dont know where to look and to register yourself as a vip or president you ahve to be on a public session but if you have a friend in an invite only session join that and it keeps your title.Oh and dont hack, they dont take it lightly.
