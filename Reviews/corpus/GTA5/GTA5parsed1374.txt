GTA V was on top of my the mustplay titles wishlists. The only reason i give negative review for this game is because i feel like i dont bought this game for GTA V, but i bought this game for GTA Online which is i dont play it so often.Im typical and more into single player gamer and dont like multiplayer elemets with microtransactions on it. The single player/story mode is pretty much abandoned by Rockstar since they are more focusing to Online.The gameplay and story are good overall, its a solid game on a single player perspective , but there are not many activities after you complete to main mission and it gets boring so quickly after i spend 50 hours only on single player.Buy this game if you are willing to spend your time on Online mode especually with your firends, it would be so much better, if youre more interested in Story mode get this only when sale.
