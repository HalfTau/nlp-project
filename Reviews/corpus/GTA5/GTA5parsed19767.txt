This game was fun at launch, and up until the heist DLC. Now, the explosive sniper and jet bike are just too OP, and I would know, I have both of them. Asides from weapons, the prices of the in game vehicles is absurd. Remeber the Zentorno? Remember the Turismo R? Why would I spend 2.7 mill for a car and need an extra 500k to upgrade it, when everyone else around me just modded their money in themselves? Im not bashing the modders, I have 2 VAC bans myself, one I deserved, and one Im not so sure about. But its almost like modding is encouraged in this game with the price of everything being so stupidly high. Why grind and while grinding get killed by a jet bike when you can just mod the money in yourself and buy it on the spot? I feel as if thats the atmosphere that this game is now creating, and its just not a fun atmosophere to play in anymore.
