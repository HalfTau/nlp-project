Game is horrid now, not bc of modders but bc of the fact that everything in game costs more than 20 IRL dollars to actually buy. for a ing bunker and some vehicles itll cost about 810 million with is just shy of 100, thats not to mention how much the cars are. when GTA Online first came out it was great with prices not being over a million but know things over a million is the norm. I mean 2 million for the new car? thats ridiculous, when the game first came out the fastest car was 800,000k and the cash payout for the jobs were more than it is today. I bought this game 3 times, PS3, Xbox One and PC. but now i cant have access to certain parts of online without paying more than 300 in shark cards because i dont want to grind it out, i just want to have fun and enjoy the game. thats ridiculous. more than 1500 hours in online across 3 platforms but now its ruined due to paywalls and greed. Thanks Rockstar
