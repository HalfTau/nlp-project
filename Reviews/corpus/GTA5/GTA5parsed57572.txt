The disallowing of mods in this game suggests that microtransactions in the single player are not far behind. As someone who got their start in game development as a modder, I find this behavior to be damaging to both the industry, community, fanbase, and customers. I would not suggest supporting a developer that conducts itself in this way, as the interests of their players are clearly the last thing on their mind.
