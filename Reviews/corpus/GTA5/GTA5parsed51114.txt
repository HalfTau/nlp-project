R and Take Two promised single player dlc like 3 years ago. That never happened. At least we can mod right? Well not anymore. They support GTA online but who cares, not everyone wants to play with a bunch of 12 year olds just wreaking havoc and failing heists. I wish I could get a refund due to empty promises. Its sad but R and take two are now on the do not buy list. And they should be on yours too.gameplay mehreplayability noneonline who cares
