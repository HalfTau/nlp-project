Listen to everyone, dont give R your money.Back in 2013, this was one of the best games of the 7th generation. Now? This game is just a dead horse that the devs are squeezing as much  out of as possible. I will say its worth getting on sale for the singleplayer and mods, but try to stay away from GTA Online.PROSR put much more effort into making sure the game functions on PC after the awful GTAIV portGreat performanceHuge map filled with lifeLengthy singleplayer campaignMultiple characters to play as with their own personalitiesMore universallyfriendly driving and shootingPlenty of modding potentialCONSMap can get boring after so much playtime a bit too many hills/desertsSingleplayer and Online story isnt written very well, regardless of how good missions can beThe 3 characters arent very good from a writing standpoint and their gameplay is basically the sameModding the game outside of singleplayer common in the previous game gets you banned from OnlineLack of promised singleplayer content new content from Online isnt even available for the campaignDevs focus solely on making money off of microtransactions instead of a solid experience with overpriced items and getting players to buy their way to getting them with Very inconsistent amounts of players online, leading to dead lobbies for any modes that arent the latestPlenty of players using mods to cheat, and getting away with itSeriously, dont bother paying full price, or buying Shark Cards. Play with friends if you want, otherwise just find a better game like Nicktoons Unite or Sonic 06.
