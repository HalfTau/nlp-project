Probably my favorite single player game in the GTA series.Crime man, black crime man, and angry crime man are very cool characters and the way the game has you play as all three working together is pretty coolGTA Online is fun for a while.Not much to keep you playing after you beat the single player game as there hasnt been any new content released.The grind on GTA Online is terrible. Its way too hard to earn enough cash to buy all the coolthey keep releasing leading to the next negative point.Shark cards are the devil. All the good new vehicles online are so costly that its almost as if theyve made the grind so awful that people will want to purchase their Shark Cash cards.TakeTwo/Rockstar seem to not be fans of singleplayer modding.In short, buy this game if you really want it, but dont waste your money on cash cards otherwise theyll continue to try to milk as much out of you as they can.
