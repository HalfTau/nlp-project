I will not put any more of my time into this games online mode. Truth of the matter is, yes i know its a pvp game but when the rewards for taking out somones cargo, crates, stolen cars and ammo runs, so small, it makes me realizr how toxic the world is. satisfaction from ruining someones fun out weighs anything else in this game.the online mode itself is really good. plenty of fun, decent money making ways, but there really is too much risk. I work 60 hours a week, when im home i want to enjoy gta, not be worried about some idio blowing my stuff up. So no, i will not be playing this game anymore, or at least until they allow solo sessions for freemode work. R.I.P Gta online
