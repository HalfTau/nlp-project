all the game does is crash and give bsod. it hogs all the memory if you dont turn on vsync, and i had to just stop playing because of how badly the game runs. i got this game so i could play online, but it crashes so often i run the risk of becoming a bad sport because i quit in the middle of a match when really i got a bsod. this game, i want back the 40 i had to pay for it.i lost my entire summer sale for a program that crashes your computer.
