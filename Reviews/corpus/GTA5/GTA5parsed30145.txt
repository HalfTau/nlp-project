I would have recommended this game to everyone of my friends to play it because the amount of mods for the game made it worth buying but as of late for some god unknown reason they decided it would be the stupidest business approach to attack the biggest mod completely removing the modding community. The modding community is how you keep a game alive far past its time. Look at Skyrim and how long its lasted. Look at why some people still play GTA 4. For the mods only. Not your stupid micro transaction bs. If I wanted money I would wait for a modded lobby and a modder to spawn in a couple billion. Absolute idiotic management.
