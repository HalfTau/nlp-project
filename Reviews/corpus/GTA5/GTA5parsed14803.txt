I seriously love this game and loath the online play which I dont think its the best way to play GTA which is why I avoid it. You got hackers and Rockstar killing the fun with all of the unnecessary bans and that includes the poisonous Microtransactions. The single player experience is where its at. But thats not why Im thumbing this down.IT HAS ONLINEDRM REQUIREMENT BY ROCKSTAR TO PLAY ITS OFFLINE MODE!!! This is exactly like Sonic Mania, only I didnt know but why is Rockstar locking down this version with a Social Club login to play its OFFLINE SINGLE PLAYER?! Are these big game companies seriously try to downplay and aggrevate PC gaming community with slimmy stunts like DRM, shotty ports, lacking support, delays and such? If so, then WTH am I doing here in Steam? This not what I expect nor what I want out of games and if this is for some dumb piracy countermeasures, let me spoil it for you IT DOESNT WORK NOR DETERANT THE PROBLEM! IT ENFORCES IT TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN!
