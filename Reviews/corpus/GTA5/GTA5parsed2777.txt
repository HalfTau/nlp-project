Liked this game until it got me to shoot down 4 helicopters with this new aqua car, by myself needing to drive to them and mount the turret on the back. doesnt sound bad until you find the aqua cars a fcking spastic piece of sht which when holding E to mount the back turret decides to go straight around the car into the passenger seat instead of the fcking back turret which youre bloody right next to. After several attempts it worked... only once. Then ititself the rest of the mission. Had to drive it into the water and shoot down the helicopters because they got off land, no worries driving it out. But exiting the vehichle and getting on the back didnt work. Leaving the car spawned me about 5 meters up in the air, i landed about the same distance from the car too. tried to get on the back and always spawned me inside the car or swam around the the passanger side like the cunt gta is. And to finish it off, the fcker started driving off without me in the ocean. Didnt ing stop. Lost the aqua car to a fcking ghost, lost the helicopters out at sea. Was stranded out at sea. and failed the stupid piece of shit mission. A great waste of 30 minutes. glad i caught the footage of it too.Have a nice night. xo
