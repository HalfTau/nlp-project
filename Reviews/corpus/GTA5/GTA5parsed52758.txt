Bought this game on PC for the ability to mod single player and now T2 have screwed that up with the cease and desist targeting the biggest SINGLE PLAYER ONLY mod. Also GTAO is a microtransaction laden grindfest when Ive already bought a full priced game and the publishers have decided they are under monetizeing the 4th most highest grossing video game in the history of video games. Screw greedy publishers out to make not just a buck but all the money, and at the expense of their players.Edit Take Two Interactive have backed down a bit and Rockstar is working with the mod creator, like they shouldve done in the first place. Changing review to reccommended.
