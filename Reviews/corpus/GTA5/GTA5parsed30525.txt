6 months or so before the PC version was released they nerfed the payouts from jobs. Then they removed some jobs that players identified as the easiest to make money by doing over and over. Not ideal gameplay but a means to an end. The instant that shark cards were introduced and began to make R money the game began its current slide. Actions speak louder than words, so the culmination of everything related to GTA online has been pigeon holed so that shark cards are the only real viable way to purchase things in a timely manner.Recently theyve showed ability in shutting down various hacking mods that players were using to cheat in online, yet for years now they were allowed to run rampant, causing untold numbers of players to have their accounts banned whether they were cheating or the victim of cheating. It is an attempt at saving face in the wake of the OpenIV shutdown and it is contemptable as it is an insult to their playerbases intelligence.R has displayed zero ability in maintaining an online IP and has done little to bolster confidence in their future online endeavors. They have displayed contempt for their customer base in the way they handle various situations. I can not in good concience recommend this game, let alone any of their future products.Its a real shame because their quality is second to none when it comes to designing a fun game to play, sadly quality and fun can not be the only determining factors when dealing with this studio and its handlers. For what its worth they will never see another penny from me.
