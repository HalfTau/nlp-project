I recommend this game, but it comes with some really terrible flaws! The Rockstar player support is bad. In addition to that, the singleplayer offline mode doesnt work properly! Rockstar keeps asking the user to connect to the internet for the damn game key activation, even if you have already activated it once when you bought it and you are automatically signedin. Its SINGLEplayer and OFFline, but youll need a connection for that.
