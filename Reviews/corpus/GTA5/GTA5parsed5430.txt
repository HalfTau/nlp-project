Nicest game I ever played in my entire life.Definitely worth the 59,99 or 23,99 during sale.Some people say that everything is pricy, but Rockstar                                                                                                                          fixed this by giving you fricking 100.000 for each 30 minutesyou play a job.Overall this game is super fun with and without friends.
