The single player is okish, just as what youd expect from any GTA game. But I bought the game for the online experience and so far it has been disapointing... To name a few of the issuessuper slow loading time, doesnt matter if you have a good PC or a superb internet connection. Loading time is consistently slow throughout any platforms Ive tried playing the game online.Pvp is imbalanced as  and all while griefing is severely tolerated, its even encouraged by the game itself when it announces to everyone in the entire session what you are up to so griefers can just blow all yourup.Recent updates to the games, punishes grinders and really baits out people to spend real money for shark cards. They just keep adding more expensive things, horrible systems and lowpaying missions, that takes forever to grind out, unless you have the patience to repeat a series of missions for hours and hours. Its just a giant paywall.For me the online mode of the game is only fun at the start when you begin to experience what the game offers for the first couple of times, then it just becomes an endless grind for pennies to buy stuff that arent even gonna help you progress further. The game can get really boring, really fast. Wouldnt recommend it to anyone who expects it to be an immersive game of being a criminal.
