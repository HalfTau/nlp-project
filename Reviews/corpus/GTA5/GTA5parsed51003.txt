I only played GTA V single player with the mod GTA V Redux, that is all. Never played Mutiplayer. Take Two, has ruined this. I will not ever support them or their products again unless the decision against OpenIV is reversed. Modding is what PC is all about, and lying about it to solve online cheating just makes me sick.
