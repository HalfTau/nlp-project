I Loved this game from the day it came out but when it came out the experiance got worse and worse. like I had GTA lonline and i got hacked and had millions of dolloars and got perm banned for something I didnt do. then I started useing the single player mods and that is now all gone. So I am not happy with buying this game and I just uninstalled it because It just pisses me off what Rockstar did to all of us and my online account.
