I bought this game on the Xbox 360, and on the Xbox One. I was one of the first people to connect to GTA Online on Xbox One, the moment it launched. I did enjoy the game very much on Xbox platforms.I recently purchased GTA V on PC Steam for 30, and I was very happy at first. The single player has better graphics and the framerate is smooth with my i5 4690k and 1050 ti, but THE ONLINE EXPERIENCE IS EXTREMELY FLAWED.The amount of hackers and modded accounts on GTA ONLINE STEAM is completely unacceptable, I have encountered a hacker or modded account on every day I have played for two weeks going. And today, Saturday September 2 I have encountered over 10 hacked accounts during my 2 1/2 hours of gameplay today.This is completely unnacceptable, I am a very good player but against a hacker with modded levels and weapons, it is not a fair fight. Although, I do find it quite enertaining that unless the hacker is using infinite health that I will usually still school them with my low level character, weapons, and vehicles.The report function is probablylike most games, abused to hell and against players that have not actually done anything wrong. I really hope that Rockstar gets it together, but I know its not going to happen.I sent Rockstar an email, requesting a full refund of 30 for the game with continued access to the game, not this t where Steam removes the game from my account. I still can play the singleplayer and have fun.
