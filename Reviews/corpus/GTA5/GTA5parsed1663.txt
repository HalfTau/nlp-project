I highly recommend this game it is fun to play and you earn money super easily. Ive had it for a year now and have 100hrs but am a CEO and own a bunker. It isnt that harrd to run compared to what people may say. It is worth the 40, even though I payed 20. This game will last a decade, so if your going to buy it its worth it D
