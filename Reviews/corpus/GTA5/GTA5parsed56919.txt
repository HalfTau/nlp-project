Pros You might like the singleplayer. Or not. Personally I found it really boring.Cons Cheaters since theres no updates for single player, Ill talk about GTA Online, longest loading screens in the world and pretty much boring online gameplay, unless you sink some real money in it...ehm...sorry, I meant shark cards.Additional cons Shtty way to treat the fanbase, e.g. closing RP servers that somehow managed to make this game a little bit fun havent played them, but saw plenty of really funny video content from them, banning modders I am not including those, who created ingame money. And, as I found out today, from an article, they are closing modding tool OpenIV, which exists for a game that is almost a decade old GTA IV. Why? Dollahdollah bill yall.As a bonus, heres the quote from TakeTwo CEO We are convinced that we are probably from an industry view undermonetizing on a peruser basis. There is wood to chop because I think we can do more, and we can do more without interfering with our strategy of being the most creative and our ethical approach, which is delighting consumers.Something to think about, yeah?
