There must be a lesson learned here. One of GTAs most crowning achievements, besides being an iconic franchise, is its ability to have endless community support in modding. There are few platforms that allow the level of freedom to be expressed that GTA can have. It is something desired by a great majority of players... Usually after a vanilla completion or five... This expectation exists in all games of an applicable genre. As a business, this must be accepted. A wise developer would embrace the community that feeds it. Personally, Im all for them cracking down on aspects that actually taint the atmosphere and market viability of their product. Weve all suffered at the hands of people who blatantly seek to ruin the experience... But the OpenIV fiasco weighs in far worse than any hacker troll toxic  ever could. I for one, have tolerated the blatant cashschemes by the developers, because of the amazing community, and the clear disconnect between modded and pure versions of the game. Ive even indulged in the scheme as a measure of good faith supporting the developers for the future. But if theyre going toon the community because of their inability to target the true violators, Ill no longer support the model. If you cannot find means to protect your interests without damning the community to labor intensive back channels, then to hell with you... It was fun while it lasted. There will be others.
