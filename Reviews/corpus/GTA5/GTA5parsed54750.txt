Edit  TakeTwo have decided that singleplayer mods are now to be allowed. Good on them, about time. Open IV is on its way back into developement and we can all go on playing a great game the way we want to.The whole reason I even bothered buying this game on PC was for the mods. TakeTwo decided that it hurts their cash cow that is GTA Online. However, the mods being targeted are guaranteed to be SinglePlayer only, with safeguards in place to insure there is no cheating in multiplayer. I personally, will not be buying another TakeTwo published game, until they reverse this decision and apologize for their stupidity.
