Dont start to just trample on my head yet, but heres what ive been seeing throughout these reviews.t that rockstar is bot service and treats everyone likeby stealing their hard earned moneyObviously the online is t, and especially since these recent updates have been screwing people overBeing the bored cuck that I am, i downloaded mods and contributed to the t, so im sorry for that, but aside that the game is fine, as long as its story mode.Overall the game is a piece offor being online, but the story is amazing, just get the game used at a game store instead of spending full price to shove up rockstars/.
