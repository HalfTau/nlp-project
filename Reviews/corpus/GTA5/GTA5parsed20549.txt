Amazingly good game, so much work mustve gone into creating it. But..and its a big but, but I like big buts and I cannot lie, the mp is full, i mean FULL of hackers. The devs have walked a path fraught with danger, on one hand theyve allowed mods  which is good, but it has caused mayhem in the online game to the point that you cant find a server without crazy modding going on. The SP is a masterpiece, such a rich world with great car handling, graphics and characters. Kifflom.
