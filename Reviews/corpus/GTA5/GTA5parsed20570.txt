By now I think most people know how GTA plays, so I wont go into that too much. What I will say is the online and offline play offers vastly different but excellent gameplay opportunities.The online multiplayer is one of the better sandboxes on the market that you can enjoy with friends. Freeroam around the entirety of the map and get up to all sorts of shenanigans with dozens of players. You also have the option of playing matchmade game modes like standard DM, TDM, races, and a whole slew of special game modes. Some of my favourites Stunt races where youre basically on hot wheels tracks, and hunting pack where you have one player playing as the driver of a car thatll explode if it goes too slowly, and others trying to either stop them or get them to their destination.The single player campaign still remains one of my favourite stories in a while, because it really makes you feel the fantasy of planning and pulling off major heists. Some scenes feel straight out of the Italian Job or Oceans 11. The characters are memorable, and not always for good reasons. Youll figure that out yourself pretty early. These are not nice people.Theres a reason why this game has sold so many copies. Give it a try the next time its on sale or youre drunk and want to spend money. Youll be glad you did.
