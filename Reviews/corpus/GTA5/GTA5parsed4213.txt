This game is the most frustrating game ever.For something that has been out for a good while, still alot of problems.The community is complete garbage. Im spending hours trying to find a suitable job to play. Thats without counting the endless loading screens. Completely unnacceptable.Along with that, the game keeps getting stuck on the loading screen. Bloody ridicoulas.The game keeps on going to windowed instead of fullscreen, everytime I leave and come back.Dont buy this pile of trash, unless you are completely bored.
