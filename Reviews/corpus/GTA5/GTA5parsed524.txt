Takeing out the modding while not effecting me was still a kinda  thing to do I love this game and had some gud times back when I played games but you should not go back on your word and get rid of mods that were not harmful the modding was fun and I saw no evil in it for those who only mod single player with that in mind I cant give the review I want    a postive one
