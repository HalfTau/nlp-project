Once you get past the many many glitches, this game is very fun. Ive had to reinstall this ing game numerous times because it breaks in one way or another. Its not worth getting considering all the glithes you will come accross and irritating modders on GTA online. Also everything on GTA online purposly sucks your money away forcing you to buy ingame money for real money.
