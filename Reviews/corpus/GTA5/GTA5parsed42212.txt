im not very focused on the openIV issue... if rockstar says that there are some break trough whit cheaters/hackers due to the OpenIV then it has to be dealt whit.The game in itself is very nice... graphics realy do test the graphics card limit which is quite neat.i have around... 100130 hours ingame and i can safely say that this game is recommended but not recommended due to the issues going around now about mods and stuff... i dont know much but it seems like the mods have been shut down?My rating on this... its 50 50 yes and no.
