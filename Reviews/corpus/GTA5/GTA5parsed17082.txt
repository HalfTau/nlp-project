Single Player is fun, I like the heist missions and havign three characters is kinda cool, but it has recieved absolutely no new content since release, other than a few cars and an OP gun.GTA Online is mess. Its basically a mobiel game at this point, with the devs trying everything they can to force you into buying their P2W cards to keep up with the new, hyperexpensive content. Considering Online is he supported, most expansive part of the game, and it has that kind of ripoff economy, I can no longer recommend GTA V.Full disclosure. I dont have a ton of playtime on here, but I have hundreds of hours on the Xbox 1.
