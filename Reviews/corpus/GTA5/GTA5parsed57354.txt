Ive been playing GTA V since release for PC and have watched as content quality declined and in game prices rose to ridiculous heights in an attempt to force people to pay for in game currency. To put it in perspective, in teh latest update there are multiple vehicles which cost upwards of 3  million dollars. Grinding missions all day can usually net you 200k to maybe 450K for heists,which by the way, theve never added a new hesit and they charge 99.99USD for 8mil in game currency. Do you see whats wrong with this picture? This AAA title is treated like a F2P money grab and its disgusting. With their new movement of banning modding in all forms they are effectively ruining what life was left in this game. This game isnt worth a dime anymore, spend your cash on a game whos created by a company that can actually give a  about their player base. Id reccommend Player Unkowns if you dont have it yet.
