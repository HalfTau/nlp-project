For the record, Im open to Single Player mods. But I detest players who use hacks and mods in Online, as they make the game a misery for everybody else. This is a genuine review.I was very late in getting around to playing it, but I am astounded by this game. Ive never enjoyed a GTA game this much since I discovered San Andreas for the first time. I wish the story mode was longer, but maybe I enjoyed it so much that the story mode just whizzed by. The choice of 3 different playable characters is groundbreaking. Meanwhile, Online is the most interactive and entertaining online game Ive ever seen. You can go solo harder but possible or roll with players worldwide at the click of a button.Its insanely good, and a musthave for any gamer.
