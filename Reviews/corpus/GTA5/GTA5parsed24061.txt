Great game. All the negitive reviews are from take two banning a mod that allowed cheating... Makes sense from there point of view but they should of consulted the community first. However the community showed its support via giving bad reviews etc.Take two did the right thing and backtracked working with the mod in question... However people seem to lazy to show their support and continue to leave their bad reviews up making it clear that steam reviews have little value that only cost companies even when they do the right thing and should be removed due to customers not using them as intended.
