This game, has the potential to be GREAT. The downside is, they just gave up on story. The characters get better the more you use them in heists, but there arent many heists you can do. Id of liked them to add more heists to the story mode of the game, or more end game content, rather than replaying the story mode over and over again.The online community is very obnoxious. Seems like some really unsavory people play this game.Also the game gets really repetitive in the online content. Because you have to grind up your rank and your stats. Id like for them to add more ways to level up your characters strength. Like a gym option like they had in GTASA
