Whilst undoubtedly a master piece of coding I cant reccomend GTAV. The publishers are extremely hostile to customers and really only want to milk you for all they can get.  As someone who has paid full price multiple times for each of the games in this series from 3 onwards that was in a large part due to the ability to mod the games.  Sadly Take Two are only interested in pushing online  threatening legal action against modders.I wont be purchasing any more GTA  games until this attitude changes.
