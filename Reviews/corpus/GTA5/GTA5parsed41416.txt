Story is good, online is fun, but far to expansive and expensive for a new player to get into without buying in game currency read pay2win online gameplay, and the modding community has been crippled, severely limiting replay value.Actions taken by Take Two interactive and by extension, Rockstar games have driven away players and negatively affected the gameplay experience in order to protect profits from ingame microtransactions.I would not and do not recommend purchasing this game, and the behavior of Take Two and Rockstar suggests that we should be even more wary of their products in the future. I would not recommend preordering RDR2 or purchasing before reviews are available.
