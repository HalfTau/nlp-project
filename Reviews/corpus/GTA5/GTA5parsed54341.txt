I always thought that modding was a great thing to do in single player.   Now that Rockstar has killed tools that allowed modding of Grand theft Auto 5 by threatening to sue the amkers, which advocated for single use only, I feel compelled to voice my disapproval.  Modding has always been a key feature of the PC and has allowed the games lifespan to be extended.  I want to add my voice against this practice even thouh I never installed mods.
