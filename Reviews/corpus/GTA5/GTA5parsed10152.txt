500 hours, over 2 years playing.  I still find myself drawn to the game for its open world chaos.  Play the missions, steal and sell cargo, fly fighters and bombers or just drive around like an idiot with your friends mowing down pedestrians and running from the cops.The expansions continue to come, new businesses, new cars, new planes, new everything.  No paid DLC, just lots of very expensive toys that try to entice you into buying Shark Cards.  Its tough to see others on their 3Million flying bike, or driving around in a fully modified and upgraded Mobile Operation Center and not want one for yourself.  If you grind at it, you can get it without Shark Cards but RockStar gives you lots of incentive to buy them.Hackers make the game frustrating.  Theyre unkillable, run faster than the fastest plane, create money from thin air and so have evry single thing in the game that can be used to murder you, they teleport, instakill, pull the entire server into one place and murder you over and over and over until you kill the game that you cant log out of.  Its the biggest downside to the game that Rockstar seems to do very little about.  The reporting process is crap You can only report on a player that is actively in your game.  Whats that, he left session after killing the entire server or you bailed out after your 5th death agaisnt an unkillalble monster?   Too bad, we dont care.At the end of the day, I keep coming back.  Get some friends together, start a team and go make some money.  Will you play it every day for months on end?  Maybe not but youll almost certainly get your moneys worth just from the single player campaign even if you never log into Online once.
