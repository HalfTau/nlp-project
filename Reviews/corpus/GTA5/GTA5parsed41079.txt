Single player was great, but multiplayer didnt work almost every time I tried it. It is paytowin and there are too many cheaters. Unfortunately Take Two is stopping legitimate modders from making the game more fun and interesting for those who already own it. They would rather make money for selling the stuff modders can do for free, and increase the communitys strength in doing so. Very sad considering that the single player game was excellent.
