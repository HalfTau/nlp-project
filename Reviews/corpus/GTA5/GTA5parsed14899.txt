Im diagnosed major depressive disorder, PTSD, and anxiety.As of today I was engaged to a beautiful woman moved to a new town and life was fantastic.Currently she is packing all her sh!t up and leaving. She went on a week long fishing trip and when she got back told me she met some guy and is moving out of state with him. At the moment Im at her girlfriends house alone shes at work because I have nowhere else to go. She wont give me any details other than Im not happy... Its me not you bull sh!t. Weve never fought, disagreements were civilly talked out. I thought we were in love. Now I just want to die. Ive tried suicide in the past, but Im not suicidal now, I simply dont want to be here anymore. I wouldnt do anything to hurt myself directly, I just wish death would come. I am so fcking despondent. Absolutely black. I dont know what to do. I know nobody in this new town, no car at a house in the middle of nowhere. Fck this game daaamn!!
