I mean I would have just left it and not given this game a review but those corporate fatcats over at Take Two decided to be even biggerthan Overkill/Starbreeze and try to kill off the modding community despite already being incredibly ing greedy  and putting in microtransactions instead of making proper single player DLC. you Take Two, I hope youring company goes under so a better publisher can have Rockstar.
