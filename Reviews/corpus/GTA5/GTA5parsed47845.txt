I purchased this game so I could have fun with my friends online. I never liked grand theft Auto games because of their open ended but empty feel with no real purpose but to shoot stuff, but I cannot deny the fun of this game and I cannot express enough how disgusted I am at take twos policies regarding it.geez, cant even mess with my own property
