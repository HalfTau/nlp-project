This was a great game until Rockstar made online gameplay very difficult to enjoy for those who are too broke to afford the new DLCs. Shark cards have become necessary unless you wanna grind your life away as if you dont have a real job to grind for as it is. This game would still be pretty good if the new DLCs were available in story mode so you dont have to worry about grinding as much with other players griefing you online. The new vehicles and weapon upgrades are just too OP and make it impossible for anyone without them to have any fun in a public lobby. Many of these vehicles are personal vehicles so it costs you money to destroy it and as if that wasnt bad enough they could just respawn it right next to them after you finally destroy it. What is ironic is that vehicles that pose less of threat such as the Phantom Wedge, Wastelander and Rocket Voltic have a ten minute cooldown period before being able to request again while the Oppressor, APC and Mobile Operations Center virtually have no cooldown period. If you wanna actually enjoy playing online, you should avoid public lobbies or play with a group of friends to hold your own without having to activate passive mode.
