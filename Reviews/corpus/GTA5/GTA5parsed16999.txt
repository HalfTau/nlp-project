I used to love this game but Rockstars new stance on online content has made this game completely unenjoyable. Even when you play in private, crew, and friend lobbies and earn money honestly through missions, heists, and various game modes Rockstar still removes ALL your money claiming you were cheating, hacking, or using money exploits. I contacted Rockstar support about them repeatedly taking my money when it was earned without breaking any TOS rules and got a templated response that shows no one even read my complaint. There is no point in playing this game anymore as its impossible to save money for all the new, expensive items they keep releasing.If this is a ploy to get people to buy Shark cards, it failed. Why on earth would I invest reallife money into game currency when Rockstar has already proven they will take away fairly earned game money?
