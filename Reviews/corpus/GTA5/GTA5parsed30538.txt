I must preface that this is not a review base upon the core gameplay of GTA V!My decision to not recommend this game is purely based upon the very poor business practices of Take Two Interactive. Take Twos Cease and Desist to the OpenIV modding team is completely anticonsumer and only worked to achieve the opposite affect of what was intended. I assure you that this move by Take Two has only made the online experience worse. It has created an F U attitude towards Take Two for good reason by pretty much all who still play the game online and because of this it has only served to increase the number of people who hack and cheat on the online servers. Not only does this negatively affect the online community, but it also affects those of us that looked to GTA Vs single player campaign as an openworld sandbox, with what could give you, at one time, almost unlimited possibilities.The sad thing is my review of this game would be fairly positive if it wasnt for this aspect. I would love to give this game positive reception, but as it stands I cannot support the actions of Take Two and I refuse to give this game my recommendation until further notice.
