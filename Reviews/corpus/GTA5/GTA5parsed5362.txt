I have this game on Social Club at greaterestdane.Story kind of makes sense, characters are loveable, and missions have a good amount of variety. There are a ton of side missions and the singleplayer is well worth the purchase of this game.But you didnt want to get GTAV for the singleplayer I bet...Online is a mixed bag, the newest updates are blatant cash grabs from Rockstar, and there are a lot of paywalls to get to the fun parts of the newer DLCs. In the Gunrunning update, you are able to purchase the Oppressor, a flying motorcycle that has the option to fit it with homing missiles. In order to obtain this upgrade, you must first purcahse the Oppressor for 2.65mil. You then need to purchase a Mobile Operations Center for 1.25mil. In order to get said MOC, you must get a bunker, starting at 1.1mil. Once you get your MOC, you need to purchase the Vehicle Workshop for 900k to upgrade your new Oppressor! But wait! You need tothe upgrade in order to fit the homing missiles on your Oppressor. Researching is, meaning you may go through hours upon hours of research to get this upgrade. Once you finally get this upgrade, you will have paid a whopping total ofto get your Oppressor with homing missiles! Its awful, and Rockstar does this knowing full well a lot of people will just pay money to get the Oppressor. The newest updates areand have so many overpowered weapons and vehicles that abuse players in freeroam.All older updates such as Heists and Lowriders are still great, and there are a lot of adversary modes to try out, granted you have the friends to fill a lobby with. These updates have hardly any overpriced vehicles, with the most expensive maybe being the Progen T20 for 2.2mil. It is possible to play the game completely ignoring the newer updates, as there are so many pay walls you have to hop to just get a vehicle or a weapon you really want.
