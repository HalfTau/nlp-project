And a large part of why you made so much income from GTAV. However it can be said that if you do not CEASE and DESIST from such innane stupidity then your sales will suffer I can promise you that. Mods are for the love of YOUR game. Unfortunately if all you have for your community, you know, the one that enjoys the game or product as you would call it, is hate then you can be sure it will be disbanded. You are fools. Take Two and Rockstar the collective you can both go suck a .
