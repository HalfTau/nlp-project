Broken game, full of bugs that steal yoiur hardwork from you, delivery trucks get stuck on thin air and you lose your load. Modders are rampant with no assistance from R on the matter. The game is unkempt, and jsut a quick money grab from a greedy company. The game is unstable, takes ages to load, and the community is toxic asf. Will NEVER buy another R game as long as Im alive.
