After Rockstar decided to clean out all the modded money, I was desperate for money so I could buy things like ammo and new DLCs. Seeing as how all the nonhiest jobs pay dirt and the hiests require a 4 man team, I decided to sell two of my best cars about 5,000,000 worth with the upgrades, for which I was given a petty 2,300,000 which is under half of what I paid. I sucked it up and went back to playing. I signed on today less than a week later to a notification saying Rockstar Game Services have corrected my GTA Dollars by 2252009 which is a solid 95 of the money I got from the cars. This is insane.TL/DR Rockstar stole my fairly earned 2.3 million so Id be forced to buy one of their shark cards.
