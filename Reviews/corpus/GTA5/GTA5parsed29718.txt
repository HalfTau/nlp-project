Greed Greed GreedR basically said were making so much money with sharkcards were not making singleplayer dlc. The community started to make single player mods due to lack of content over the past two years for single player and now R bans modding single player games.To even play all the current updates for a lvl 1 character you will need around 15 mill which takes forever to get. They want you to buy sharkcards which would cost you 127.76 60 discount for summer sale or normal price of 319.96. This is absolutly outrageous. I understand have the best cars and best weapons behind level and slight paywalls but the most current content!? !Good luck if you want to do gunrunning...because you wont be able toAlso R never fixed GTA online so its filled with cheaters that will RPG everyone on the map every time you spawn over and over until you die.1/10 you got your money bring back the fun
