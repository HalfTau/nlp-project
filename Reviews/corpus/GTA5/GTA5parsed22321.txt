I got permanently banned from online within the first few weeks of buying GTA 5 for no reason.Other than this, it is a good game, but repetitive at times.for example I got stuck on multiple mission unable to continue for some time.As for the multiplayer, i cannot say as i played little of itmostly waiting for my friend and a few days aftter creating my account i got banned for 2 or so weeks then the day I got unbanned, i played, exited by accident, went back on the day after, and I was banned permanetly.
