At first sight, GTA V is the result of years of Rockstar innovation and quality for open world games, all tacking place in the same unverse criticizing brilliantly our society in a fun and absurd way. And like the previous opus, it contains 2 modes the online and the story mod.The story mod is awesome nice story/characters, the switching of the lather characters being integrated perfectly. The rest is very similar to other gta games missions like go there, steal the insert vehicle etc.About the online version, this is less appealing. Shortly, they turned GTA 5 into a mobile/freetoplaypayforanything game like WOT or War thunder. BUT WE BOUGHT THIS GAME 60 FCKING EUROS!!! Its a shame to take the players for fools like this.To sum up, Rockstar has nothing to prove. The GTA serie is a classic. But the recent decisions about turning the multiplayer into a cash cow is questionnable. And made me leave the game. Gg wp.
