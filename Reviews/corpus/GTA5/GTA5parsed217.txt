With over 2.5k hours on the game, I must say the game is great. I like both singleplayer and multiplayer modes, but the modders/hackers make life a living hell on multiplayer. I had most fun playing the game with a group of friends who helped each other in heists and stock sales. Making money can be a labour intensive, but the patience does ultimately pay off. But then again the whole idea is to force players to buy Shark Cards. The load time on this game is ridiculously long and I am surprised the game isnt officially called Loading Simulator. Overall, it is a very good game and probably should play it and suggest it to your friends. Highly Recommended.
