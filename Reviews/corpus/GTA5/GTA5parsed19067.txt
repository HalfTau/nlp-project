i have about  500 hours in the game  now today i got banned not gonna lie i cheated   i  dropped my self money  in  my crew session  thats it not getting into a online session and killing  everyone in online session or droping them moneyto get them banned  there were those types in online sessions  but im not one of those  type of  pepole  any way some of you can say i deserve it you are a cheater but  i dont know if you notice but the only way to  enjoy to the fullest each dlc  you need to buy  those  expensive  shark cards wich  is  totally  ed up  i have atleast 460470 hours without cheats and i couldentbuy any thing atleast for two dlcs  any way my point here is that rockstar is thinking only about money  they dont listen to the  community either  each session has  1 or 2 cheaters atleast  and they ban me beacuse i dont pay for those sharkcards  and do not ban other cheaters that  Destroying  each session  nice rockstar  i hope that one day the community will stop buying those sharkcards and that rockstar will learn their lesson again like with   modding  and   that rockstar will  deliver true free dlc and not pay to  win other then that the game is great
