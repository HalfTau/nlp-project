Honestly , I havent played much multiplayer , as I didnt like it all that much.But the story.One of the best ive seen in a video game.If you only play the campaign , the hours you spend will outweigh the cost of the game itself.Story takes around 40 hours to complete,  and there are a TON of side missions that are both intruiging and worth your time.Graphics are really beautiful on max , and Los Santos is an extremely varied and detailed open world to explore.The three protagonists are quirky , and I found myself relating to Michael quite a bit maybe too much but whatever.Franklin is overally pretty chill and a cool character to play as.Trevor is a dck but can also be funny.There are a lot of characters , and I think the ending of the game tied things together well , which seems to be lacking in certain games ive played recently.The campaign may be boring at first , but after the characters are introduced things get a lot more interesting.One of the best open world games , I implore you to get it for the campaign only as I have no buyers remorse at all.8.5/10.
