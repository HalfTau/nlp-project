Its my reward for Rockstar opening their eyes and bringing mods back to life!If OpenIV didnt come back, I would NOT buy this game and possibly others from the publisher of GTA 5. But since I played this game on other plantforms and totalled 500 hours with this game I can say for sure this is one of the greatest games of the franchise and its extremelly fun for any casual or serious gamer. Online still has a fair share of bad apples that use ONLINE MODS that need to be stopped, but so far I havent face any issue online.Once again, from all the modding community, thank you Rockstar for the toughtful decision.
