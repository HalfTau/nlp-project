GTA V has become my favorite offline game for my steam account, mostly because the online is almost impossible to play but, never a reason for me to dislike such a great game because of poor connection/server problems. Offline is really fun, great experience, I used to own GTA V on my old PS3 and I love that the steam version has next gen features in it, really had fun with those features during the story mode! 9/10!
