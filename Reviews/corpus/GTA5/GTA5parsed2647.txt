The game is fun, especially the Storyline, however, the multiplayer is a tad annoying mainly because a lot of the things in game are extremely expensive, more than real life, and it makes it so that you either have to pay lots of real money to get things in game, or grind and spend tons of time trying to get the things, even though the missions are very repetitive when grinding. Other than that, the game is fun.
