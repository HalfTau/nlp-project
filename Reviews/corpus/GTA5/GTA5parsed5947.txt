If you are just getting the game for single player and modding that, go for it, tons of fun. But DO NOT PURCHASE any sharkcards or the Starter Pack. Rockstar and Take Two have turned GTA Online into a disgusting cash grab that really makes me both sad and angry to see what it has become. GTA Online used to be a very fun experience, and if you need proof, just go look at the old gen console versions. The PS3 stopped getting updates before lowriders, so they dont have to deal with the flying rocket bikes with homing missiles, the assortment of jets that only people with sharkcards and modded accounts can afford unless you want to spend a huge amount of time in game to afford that and make your money back from all the pay walls you have to buy into, unless you want to just do races or other jobs, which still would take hours to make a decent amount of money, and now with the release of this DLC, the Orbital Cannon. A lock on one hit kill costs 750k to use, while manual aim costs 500k. Its like they are giving hackers a tool on a golden platter to mess with anyone who would want to play the game as Rockstar intended.I put a total of 60 real life days in game time played on PS3, PS4 and PC combined, and near the end I really was regretting that. I have been a long time  supporter of Rockstar since GTA III, but their focus on Recurrent consumer spending rather than new single player or well polished content has forced me to withdraw my support, until they fix theirIf they drop the focus on micro transactions which is not likely to happen, I will recommend this game for Online provided they fix that too, but until then I cannot recommend getting this game for its multiplayer.
