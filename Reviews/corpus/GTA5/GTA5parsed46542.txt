After a few moths i try for 1 hours Grand theft auto online and what i see its incredible.This game doesnt change from start.Yes,we have so much updates but the originaly of online is exactly like on release.Hackers on every mission i want to play.If you want to buy something you need to buy a shark card because,with farming money you will stay like an eternity.This game is 100 PTBPay to buy.I dont recommend if you dont hahve some friends to play with you.Thats my opinion.
