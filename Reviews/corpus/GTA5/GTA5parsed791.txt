Why a buyer of GTA V should pay real world money in GTA V Online mode you ask, the answer is developers greed. This new trend in video games where after you have already bought 60 game you should pay extra for any additional features in the game is wrong and should be abolished! The video game business is a very proftable business and it is more profitable with every day that goes by, therefore this business should be heavily regulated.
