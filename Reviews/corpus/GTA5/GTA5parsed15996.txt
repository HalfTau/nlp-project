I spent 270 hours playing this game, basically binging it, and was almost level 100. but for the past about 30 hours of playtime I was using a mod so I could have god mode and not be bullied by other people moding against me and also so I could teleport. I am guilty of modding and I thought it was acceptable to recieve a 1 month ban. But after that month I came back to play expecting that my money would be decreased and some of my recent purchases would be revoked instead my charachter was full blown deleted.... So I guess it was fun while it lasted but im not about to restart to get back where I left off now that Im in college and will probably just get baned again regardless if I use the mods. Game is good but the people who are managing the moding problem are doing a terriable job just read more comments.
