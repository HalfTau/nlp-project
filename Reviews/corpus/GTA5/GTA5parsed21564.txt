At the moment I would not recommend GTA V Certainly dont buy for full priceI have enjoyed GTA online I cant help feel it is a bit of a grind fest at times in order to own the businesses and arsenal id like to. I dont have lots of time to invest into this game in order to gain the money id like. I understand rockstar needs to sell shark cards but please dont tell me the online DLC is free when its only available to those who get deep vein thrombosis because theyve sat on their a for too long playing GTA..Players will seek to destroy your fun online and it can be hard to play on an open online server without someone trying to destroy you and your fun with one of the many ridiculous vehicles available. Then again they have been made available. I have had fun but mainly in closed friends only servers but then you cant interact with the MC clubs ETCThere is a lot of fun to be had, I have had a lot of fun but lately it feels a grindfest and feels so much harder to get on a open server where you can complete MC missions without being trolled and feeling disappointed by the outcomes of the missions
