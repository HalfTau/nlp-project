This game, is good. However I will not recomend it for you. There is usually two reasons people buy their games onPC it is your main platform and/or you like modding. Rockstar, or TakeTwo has quite litteraly broken modding on PC, which makes the PC version viable only if you have not played the game before. Seing GTA V sold 80 000 000 copies, there is a big chance you got a copy of the game on some console, be it PS3, PS4 or any of the Xboxes. Hence there is no point to buying the game for PC.I really hope Rockstar can see that modders are not the same as hackers, and unban OpevIV. I hope Rockstar gets scared, and supports mods in a better way in the future. Maybe they will allow Online moding, not the kind that gives you infinite ranks and money, but the kind that gives you a different experience.
