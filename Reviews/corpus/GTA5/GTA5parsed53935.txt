Im not so sure if I could ever play this game again.The amount of Greed that Rockstar and especially TakeTwo is showing with banning mods WHILE I MIGHT ADD BANS PLAYERS ONLINE FOR PEOPLE HACKING INTO THEIR ACCOUNTS AND ARE THUS INNOCENT is an absolute travesty.I bought GTA V on PC for the modding Community. i saw in GTA IV how fun the mods were and how amazing they seemed and hoped that in this new Gen itd be better.TakeTwos greed has now been known. Being forced to play a broken online thats only fun when you use MicroTransactions and modes that equally suck.I will not support TakeTwo or Rockstar ever again. In fact I encourge those to stand up and protest against this form of tyranny.Lets fight woth our wallets an never again support these fatcats who hold no regard for us gamers.Pirate their games, uninstall them from our harddrives.Let us abandon their games once and for all.EA, Ubisoft, Bethesda and now Rockstar are game companies I can no longer trust for limitless fun.
