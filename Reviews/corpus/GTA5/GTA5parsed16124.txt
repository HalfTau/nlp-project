Rockstar has made it clear they do not support their players. With the massive pay walls separating you from any of the premium game content, unless you are willing to shell out tons of real money, you are not going to be able to experience it.Hackers were in almost every lobby distributing wealth to players, however Rockstar has begun to ban hackers in addition to the players who receieved the money from the hackers. If the hacker spawns money on top of you and you are forced to pick it up, you are out of luck. Easy ban.Thanks Rockstar for hurting your players, modding community, and turning yourself into the type of company that everyone has always despised.
