GTA5 was a good game, I thought R hit it off when I started playing, I write this review months later after arguing with support over my account with 400 hours on it was banned for playing the game whilist a hacker was in the server at the time nobody knew and they banned all of us for getting money, he made it rain money. Litterly, we had no choice. We were all banned. I will NEVER reccomend this game to anyone, not even for 5, if they suck so ing bad as to just blame US the players who spent 60 on the game, they they can go suck a horse
