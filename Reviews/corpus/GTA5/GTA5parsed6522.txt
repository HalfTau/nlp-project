cleary ported over and poorly done so, driving and swimming are ridiculously awkward for no reason. If you enjoy paying 400game moneys to clear the cops to join a server, to be told its full, to be reset on GTA offline, this is for you. if you like abominations on que systems, a community that cant get a heist done, and waiting forever to get in a game or waiting forever for it to figur eout the server or group is full then this is for you. if you like your time wasted, buy this game.
