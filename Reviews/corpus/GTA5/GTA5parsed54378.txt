Dont buy this, Take two interactive is screwing it over with the online gameplay and anti modding policys. Rockstar can protect its IP from other corperations or profit based opportunists. It should however never hurt the community that supports it by telling them they cant MOD it. This is pathetic and I do not recommend it under any circumstance. Until this decision is revered I will not support the company or play the game again. Youve made enough money off of this game.
