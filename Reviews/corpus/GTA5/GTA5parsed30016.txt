I get where everyone is coming from. Its their right to let someone mod their game or not. But withhow this is going down I dont think it really comes from we want to better the community As far as I know this only hurts the modders who want to have fun. Im sure you can still get nefarious mods and be an Ahole. I stand on the modders side. Its singleplayer. Thats for us and us alone to enjoy. But you guys need to know. This isnt JUST Take2. Rockstar is behind their publisher. So Take your frustration out on both of them.
