Wouldnt recomend buying or downloading to play online at the moment, it takes insanely long to make money. On top of that there are almost as many hackers/modders as players, so it gets hard/impossible to get stuff done when they decide to interupt. Which is often, you will loose out on a lot of money. Offline is great.
