GTA5 is a great time, but the main reason I was willing to spend full price to buy the game on PC after I had already purchaced it on console was because of the fun of modding the game. Take2 is now trying to make modding impossible for this game, defeating the entire purpose of purchacing it on PC. Since I just bought this a few days ago Im going to do everything I can to get a refune from Steam for this.
