Take Two and Rockstar could have handled this situation differently. Take the time and put in a little effort to combat hackers. Other companies can manage this, why cant Rockstar? You dont just kill a 10 years running, giant portion of the player base that strictly mods on singleplayer for the chance to maybe cut down on some hackers online. If that is the real reason at all, and not just a disguise for their efforts to set themselves up for more cash grabs. Online overinflation and Shark Cards anyone?
