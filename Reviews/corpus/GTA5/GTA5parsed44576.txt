How the hell are you basically going to send a ceaseanddesist to a community that supported your game for 10 years? I dont get it Take Two. Not only that but you sent it because of recent malicious mods. Why not notify the devs of Open IV that this was happening and allow them to block it? Youve removed probably 75 of the modding community from your game. Theyre not even the problem, you are for allowing hackers inside of GTA Online long before Open IV according to you allowed malicious mods. Money hackers are everywhere in almost every session online. Why not fix that instead of penalizing the whole modding community? Thats an odd take on whats really happening. I sincerely hope you come to your senses and reverse the damage youve already done as its going to soon become irreversible. Youre losing alot of money that you never thought you had.
