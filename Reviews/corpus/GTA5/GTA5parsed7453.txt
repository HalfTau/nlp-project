Its GTA...a world where you can be who yo want to be.. and do what you want to do. After playing for awhile you will notice the game becomes a goal of just getting money to get what you want, then once you get what you wanted, you will start getting boiring. I did enjoy it with the time i put into it, its a fun game.EnjoyPS Dont let the hackers get to you, and try to change servers if you find one, you can get banned if you stay around them to long.
