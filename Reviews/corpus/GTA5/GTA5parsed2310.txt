Im mostly playing offline to finish the story and ill tell you one thing its sure a great game, and i love GTA 5. The other 7 hours that i have now are from playing online, and i can tell you, its modders blowing stuff up, the grind is too hard, things cost too much any activity that you can do online gives way too less money.So if you buy it for the storyline go for it, playing online is just a loading simulator and if you find a lobby youll get bored soon .
