Sorry but this has gotten out of hand. The forceful and overbearing monetisation is just out of control, and downright twatful. I disliked it, but it was a understandable reality of a shark card payed buisness.However, now that they are going after SINGLEPLAYER modding, an area they have avoided making content for is just stupifying. I know its just buisness, but come on, at some point you have to draw a line and say Yep, although our aim is to make stupid amounts of money that no single human would be able to spend, could we try NOT to bein the process?
