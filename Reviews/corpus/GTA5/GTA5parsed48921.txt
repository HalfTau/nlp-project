I do not support taketwos decision to end single player modding. No content has been added for the single player while the online community has had a lot added. For those who do not enjoy online, this is just a slap in the face. Until they reverse this decision, this will be a negative review. Listen to your community, taketwo.Edit Rockstar jumped in and reversed the decision to stop single playing modding! To all of the people that said leaving a negative review wouldnt do anything,  you.
