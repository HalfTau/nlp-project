They banned mods for single player and multiplayer. Terrible idea! I can understand banning mods for online with the normal game, but if people want to mod and have mods for an entirely different version of the game there shouldnt be a problem there. Combine this with the way Rockstar has changed and skewed the amount of money you earn for missions, and I cant recommend it. When I first bought this game for PS3 it was pretty quick and easy to earn some fat cash. BUT over the years Rockstar kept changing the payouts, so now you have to invest much more time to earn money. Combine that with the outrageous prices for vehicles, weapons, and outfits, and its pretty easy to see that this is all done to push the consumer to buying their Shark Cards. The game does run nicely, but the banning of mods for single player is a deal breaker for me.
