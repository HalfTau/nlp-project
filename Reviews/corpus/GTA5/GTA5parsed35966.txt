Down voted for banning OpenIV and modding. This takes quite a lot of fun out of the whole series and is now a lot less enjoyable thanks to your  greedy business practices. Take Two apparently thinks we dont own the game after paying 60 dollars for it but theyre wrong. Without your customers you are nothing and youll deffinetly be regretting the decision. PC gamers dont forget stuff like this and we will ultimately win in the end whether you reverse it or until we find a way around it.
