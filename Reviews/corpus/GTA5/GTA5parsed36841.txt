I know a lot of people are angry about the recent mod things. I wanted to try and give an overview review despite the mods being shut down. Its a fun game for the most part but ultimately rockstar doesnt actually let you have fun unless you have 24/7 to grind away or you are a hacker.1. The servers are still riddled with hackers/modders2. There are currently no viable ways at any level of the game to make good money3. If youre in a crew, usually only the CEO will actually make any money. Other players will make 1020k but thats essentially it.4. There arent even lower end things that you can enjoy. Everything is about 1m, except the absolute minimal excitement stuff which, at that point, dont even bother playing the game.5. The game is riddles with glitches that Rockstar support does not appear to care about only fixes money glitches or anything that interferes with their bottom line6. They arent really expanding the world or anything. Its the same things over and over with a different look, and 10x as expensive.7. Just dont bother, its more trouble than its worth and there are way better options out there that wont bleed you dry and still leave you unsatified.Hope this saves some people some money and headache. Rockstar has fallen off since imo San Andreas and they dont seem to have any care on returning to the player driven gameplay.
