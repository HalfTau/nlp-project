I dont need to buy this game to review it. Seen videos and played a few hours on anothers pc. Have to agree with the public on this one. Take Two you faiked up. you faiked up big. You did just what Sega and Nintendo did. You are attempting to stop modders talking about the campain modders and such, not online modders from doing there thing. Both Sega and Nintendo are out of business now because of this exact reason. The reason why GTA is so popular is because of the mods that could be used on this game. Your audience will decline, as well as your funds. Eventually you will be left behind if u keep this up. Look at what Sony has done. Look to them for guidence to success. They supported modders and hire hackers. Their games and ALL other products are booming.Man the faikup is big here. Take Two you need to back off. Im being serious here.
