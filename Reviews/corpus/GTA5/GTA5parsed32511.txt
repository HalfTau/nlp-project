Great single player, however in my opinion the multi player is t that reallyyou to spend real money on it, unless you dont mind hourless grinding to get all the cool items. Still waiting for single player DLC as promised. Turned their back on the mod community on numerous occasions, only being saved by the vocal and angry community. Very poor anti cheat. Fun game, worth a buy for single player alone, but I cant personally recommend this game based off these rationales.
