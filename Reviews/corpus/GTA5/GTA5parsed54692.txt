The game is good, but GTA Online has turned into a cash cow for Take Two publishers of GTA V so rather then focusing on freedom in gta online and allowing players to do what they want we get crappy missions to farm for weeks to afford a nice car that is basically useless. The one thing that has kept GTA at the top of the charts is the modding community. All the way back to GTA San Andreas there has been mods for the games. Take Two has decided to send a cease and desist to OpenIV, the main program that allows modding of the game for years. Take Two has decided to say the final  you to the community and players that have been loyal to the GTA series. Take Two is throwing away the modding community and support from the modding community to force shark cards and GTA Online down our throats. I do not support online mods, the modding community as a majority dont support or work on online mods, so Take Twos actions on OpenIV had a direct and major impact on the single player harmless mods.  For people like me and the millions of others who bought GTA V just for mods, this goes to show what the publishers of the game really have in their priorities, and I do not plan on purchasing anymore GTA series games if this is how the publishers want to shape the GTA games.
