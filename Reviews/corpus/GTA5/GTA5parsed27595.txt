GTAV is still a very fun game, online is great fun as well minus the absurdly priced shark cards.Although the singleplayer hasnt been updated, its still fun to play to this day.Online has lots of fun activities to participate with friends. Especially witht the new Gunrunning update, theres much more chaos to be made.
