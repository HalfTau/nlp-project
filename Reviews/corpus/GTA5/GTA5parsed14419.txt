The single player campaign was pretty good. I prefer creating my own character in these kind of games and didnt really care for the three main character thing. I dont blame them for trying though. There was a lot of love and hard work put into this game and it shows.As for the multiplayer. Unless you grind for months through missions you wont be able to buy 1/4 of the cool stuff available cars, planes, property, etc. I still mess around online with friends, but it would be great if you could earn money without buying shark cards or paying a hacker.
