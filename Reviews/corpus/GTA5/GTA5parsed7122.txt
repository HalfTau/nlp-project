Dont get me wrong. GTA Online is an anchievement. But Rockstar........Glitches that keep you from making money linger for months without a fix. Each DLC cost more and more in game money. Each new DLCs in game business pays less and less in game money. But Shark Cards still cost the same real money for the same paultry in game money.And missions? Well, they are bugged to hell! In the past an occasional mission would bug, normal in online games. But recently they are RIDICULOUSLY buggy. Today for example, I tried a Gunrunning delivery....bugged! Change server, loose partial payment, oh well. Finish delivery....Server Error......no payment. Worst luck so far, but getting worse over time.Hours wasted, coincidentally this gets worse just before a new DLC where youll need lots of money? Convenient.Oh, and the hackers are just as bad or worse than before. My theory is the real players grind most of their money, the Modders just buy Shark Cards and never bother grinding. Youll spend your time changing servers over and over to dodge the hackers, and THEY KNOW as long as they dont spawn money, they wont get banned. They can abuse you all day and until they glitch money, Rockstar dont care. Result? If your playing fair you are meat for the amusement of the inevitable hacker who wont get banned or the exploit fixed because Rockstar knows where the money comes from.
