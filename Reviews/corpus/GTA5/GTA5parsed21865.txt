GTA 5 used to be one of my favourite games, but now with the more recent updates, i am  quickly losing interest in the game because of rockstar/take twos stupid decisions like making everything super overpriced forcing you in to buying shark cards removing mods and making the payouts complete garbage which makes farming very tedious
