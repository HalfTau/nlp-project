The game is amazing, story mode felt a bit short in terms of gameplay hours, but definitely enjoyable. GTA online needs some improvement though. And the number of players in a session should be increased to more than 50. Currently, I am not able to join the session with more than 15 players. Its a must have if you love open world adventure.Gameplay  10/10Graphics  10/10Multiplayer  9/10
