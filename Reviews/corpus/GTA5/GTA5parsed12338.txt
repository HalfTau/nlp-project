THUMBS DOWN.From the start of this game Im treated to some DRM nonsense, as I try to register for an account for Rockstar And WHY do I need to register for a game that I bought with MY MONEY EXACTLY?? I already paid for it, the game shoudl be mine without any privacy pay walls but have the window fail to connect to the main server about 5 different times, forcing me to register on the website joy of joysThen, I have to restart the game about 5 different times JUST TO GET IT TO TURN ON WINDOWED BORDERLESS MODE.And THEN ANOTHER 20 TIMES JUST TO GET THE GRAPHICS SETTINGS TO FING STICK!!! And all the while, Im RESTARTING like 200 goddamn times.AND THEN THE GAME STOPS READING MY KEYBOARD!MY LOGITECH, USB CONNECTED, WIRED KEYBOARD SO MY CHARACTER IS STUCK IN PLACE for some reason, despite being not stuck JUST A SCENE EARLIER!!!!!! !Do 5 year old psych ward patients program this game? What kind of an imbecile do you need to be to program a game THIS POORLY. AND THEN to levy a creepy private info wall that both needs your steam account for SOME REASON AND needs you to REGISTER with Rockstar?WHY AM I REGISTERING WITH YOU, ROCKSTAR. So you can steal my info? Try to control me? Spy on me passively by raising a last minute, blue balls private info paywall that I have to give you all of my favourite s ex positions on so you can control me?Basically, Rockstar is becoming the new EA.Heres the funny thing  GTA V isnt even that good. Its too realistic. Vice City was classic Rockstar. There was a strategy layer where you had to capture turfs and earn money from them, buy businesses...there were jumps everywhere, the cars felt amazing...Same for GTA III. Since GTA IV the GTA series have been getting more and more boring and realistic and just meh. GTA San Andreas was the last real GTA, Rockstar can go and jump on a pipe, see how that feels for a change, becase thats all they deserve.
