Rockstar Games really nailed it financially, nailed it with innovation and most important, nailed us gamers with their longloading times,matchmaking issues, player drops, no logical solutions from R support when having issues from their end,  sometimes it just wont even load the next heist screen after you finish a setup, having to restart game and see it has not been completed for example, which is sadly what made my rageometer peak and  write this damn review.Since launch I loved this game, breathed it,  grinded it so long with my crew, but the love is fading away as Rockstar Games never really focuses on fixing the core issues and keep unbalancing the racing aspect of the game.  I dont feel the spark anymore, time for VI!I would still recommend this game if you never ever played it, ironically.
