Time consuming to earn money that is so little. Lots of vehicles are too expensive and will either take hard devotion to make the money or have to end up spending real money for fake money. Not to mention all the new military vehicles and other random crap that doesnt make it gta any more. It is unfortunate that rockstar does this. Not to mention all of the hackers. I eventually decided it was not worth the space on my computer.
