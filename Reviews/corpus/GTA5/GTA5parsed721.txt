Single player is pretty awesome. Online is cancer. hackers in every game, and a paytowin theme running a fullpriced game. Load times are very long, just to be put into a game with a hacker who ruins your experience. Could still be a great online game if Rockstar bothered to do anything about hackers.Highly recommend for single player. GTA V online though... Expect 50 of lobbys to have at least one hacker ruining the game for you. Hackers or modders as they are called can even screw with your client forcing you to forceclose the game or restart your computer.
