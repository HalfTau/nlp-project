Rockstar makes great games, but unfortunately Take Twoand Rockstar by association have decided to act against the interests of their community and ban modding. Therefore I am unable to endorse these companies and their business practices, and highly recommend you avoid supporting said practicing by purchasing this or any of their other games. Hopefully, we as a gaming community can come together and tell devs and especially publishers that this is not okay, and that causes them to reconsider doing things like shutting down modding communities.
