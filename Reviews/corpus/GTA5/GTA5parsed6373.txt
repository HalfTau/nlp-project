About this game 1. Singleplayer is awesome 10/10  you will surely enjoy it. I promise you that.2. But if you are going to buy the game for online purposes, you need to pass and thats the only reason why i dont recommend this game which is really shame but has to be said or your money will be wasted. I have over 200 h on ps3 and almost 70 h on PC version and i can tell you couple things about online  Matchmaking is awful , no region lock meaning if you are from EU you will end up with people from USA and China or Russia so ping is terrible and is laggy and unplayable, H A C K E R S, trolls and infinite loading screen  i also have powerful rig and very strong and stable internet connection and still have to wait way to long .
