load screen simulator, online mode sucks until you get atleast 1.25 M for perm VIp / CEO missions, afterwards turns into grinding in solo lobbies so griefers / modders dont kill you and make you wait 30 mins for cooldown. Spend that money on a mclaren just to go as fast as a BMW you can steal off the street , All vehicles even 2m capped at 120 mph top speed. Modders/ griefers each lobby/ mission. 20 minutes to find mission you want to do unless you like sh it transform races or heists people give 15 split or die / quit and waste your time. Very repetitive all day to grind money , this is so Rstar eases you into shark cards. Two characters online , dont share buildings or cars you purchase. Single player able to beat in few days as a low grade gamer  few hours/ day  . Sums up gta5
