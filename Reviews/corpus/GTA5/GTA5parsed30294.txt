I bought this game to play while Im deployed in Afghanistan to help kill the time. I got it installed and played a few hours, but now when I try and play in offline mode since my internet sucks, it tells me it cant connect to the Rockstar servers so I cant play. I know my internet sucks, which is why I want to play offline mode, but now I cant even do that, so the game is worthless.
