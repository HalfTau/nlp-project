Take two screwed up when they shutdown modding tools like OpenIV. I love this game. With a few mods, the game becomes nextlevel. That was one of the most anticipated aspects of GTA5. People waited for months for mod tools to be released. When Take Two decided to have them removed, they significantly reduced the fan base for this game. BIG MISTAKE!!!!! !
