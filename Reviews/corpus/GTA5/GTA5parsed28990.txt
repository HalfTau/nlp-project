I used to mod singleplayer in my free time instead of playing the unbalanced grindfest that is GTA Online but now Take Two ed us over and went and banned any form of modding in singleplayer, now there is nothing to do once you beat the story. I say that because GTA Online sucks so bad. Only after playing it for about two weeks I started to see the huge problem with it and when i saw it, oh boy did myget hard, The huge gap between expirenced players and new players would make anyone switch back to singleplayer. But now when you do that there is not anything to do BECAUSE TAKE TWO TOOK OUT MODDING!  THIS GAME AND  TAKE TWO. This game isnt worth it at all. Save your money for other games.
