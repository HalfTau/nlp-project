 you rockstar. Even though Im not much into modding but shutting down Open IV is BS. If you think itll help you to get rid of cheaters then youre completely wrong because OpenIV does not affect MP, its only for SP. It will only get worse. I also wanted to mention that MP is not worth playing, all you have to do is grindits quite boring and exhausting and of course there are lots of cheaters who want to ruin your game experience.
