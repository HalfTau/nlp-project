They claim to have free DLCs for online mode, but to enjoy them you generally have to have a massive amount of ingame currency and they dont provide many ways to grind to earn that kind of money. So they instead encourage you to purchase shark cards. Also they can bann you from online mode without even giving a reason and once you try to apeal that bann you just get an automated message telling you that all decisions are final. Waste of money.
