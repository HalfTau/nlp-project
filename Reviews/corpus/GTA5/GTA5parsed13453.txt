i love it when you get into a lobby and then a hacker gets mad at you and spam drops you a bunch of money and gets you banned. and to top it off, when you try to appeal the ban they just copy paste the same message over and over again with an automated bot with employees hackers run rampant and make the non hackers suffer. thanks rockstar! your made a terrible online game and community. M O N E Y isnt everything,
