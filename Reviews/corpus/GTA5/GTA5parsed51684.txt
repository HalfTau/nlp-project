Getting the PC version was my 3rd time purchasing this game, for the sole purpose of modding the game. Now that OpenIV has gotten their CD, due to Take2s greed of trying to force people onto their microtransaction filled GTA Online which I have no interest in playing, I can confidently say that I will never purchase another game from Take2 / Rockstar Games again.
