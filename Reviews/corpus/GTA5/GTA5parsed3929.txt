This review was trigerred by the people downvoting this awesome game.As said above, the game is awesome, not even 11 out of 10, this is really 15 out of 10, one of the best games ever created, an epic that any person even remotely interested in video games must own.The single player story and gameplay are great, but there is more, there is GTA Online. Youll make your own story.This amount of free content we got wouldve cost another couple hundred bucs from any other developer screw you EA, Paradox, Ubisoft. And you can get it all, now, for 27.99,A game from 2013 that is still better than all AAA titles from 2017, and doesnt feel tired or outdated in 2018, what other game can boust that?Yes there is a lot of stuff to buy in GTA online, but its all for in game currency, that is easy to earn and youll even enjoy the process. I feel bad for the people that complain they cant buy the new content cause they dont have the time to earn the money, but thats life my dudes, people grow up and they have to make choices.Thankfully, youll always find people to play the online heists, theres lots of players online at any hour, have a hour or two to kill? Do a heist, get yourself half a million of game currency. Easy. Dont have the time for heist but you want the content? Why do you need it if you dont have the time to enjoy it anyhow? I call t on that.Anyway, stop reading and go buy it now, and pay full price if you can, this game will give you thousands of hours of joy.Have fun, you antisocial psychos!
