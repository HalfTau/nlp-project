TakeTwos recent actions have been appalling  where Rockstar have actively engaged in the Modding community for nearly a decade, going so far as to showcase many mods on their official blog, their parent company in TakeTwo have just destroyed all that hard work and effort, and forever soured the relationship between the modding community  Rockstar Games.This has nothing to do with game hacks, and even if it did there are other ways this could have been dealt with and the OpenIV team would have certainly treated the misuse of their program as a priority  worked to patch any exploits hackers may have found to misuse on GTA Online. The unsurprising truth is that it boils down to TakeTwo not making enough money 700 million from Microtransactions alone  GTAV has made over 3 billion and counting since release, on a budget north of 250 million and it seems that they believe that through this heavyhanded approach, that theyll somehow safeguard microtransactions.The worst part is, this has done nothing to stop hackers at all, because most leaving as most until evidence to the contrary has been provided hackers dont use OpenIV.The game is good, mods made it better and TakeTwo is run by Satan.Edit Rockstar have finally convinced TakeTwo that prohibiting OpenIV was a bad idea and they have have now reversed their cease  desist order. This is a great victory for player controlled content  modding and as such, I will be amending my review to reflect this. The games still good, mods make it better and TakeTwo is remains to be run by Satan.But good job Rockstar.
