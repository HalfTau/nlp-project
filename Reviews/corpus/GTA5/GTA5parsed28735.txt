On the behalf of OpenIV, I can no longer recommend this game. Mods make GTA on the PC, GTA. If Rockstar does not understand this, than they really do not know how to conduct business. Sorry Rockstar, your actions really made it clear that you are only in the game for profit, not for the dedication of your customers.
