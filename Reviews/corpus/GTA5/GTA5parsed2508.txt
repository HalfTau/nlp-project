Well, I dont know what to say, really. Im going to recommend it because it can be very fun, especially with friends that have the game. Not saying its boring alone, just more fun with friends. Once you buy something, feels really good and satisfying. Many features and things to do that you can pretty much stay occupied all the time or just mess around with cops or just go on a massacre. However, if you are one of those people that hate grinding, do not buy this game because youre going to have to grind a lot in order to buy something because honestly, in my opinion, I think that the things in this game are expensive and you need to spend lots of time to get something in game, which relates to a paytowin style game. If you want money, either buy a shark card from the beginning or be prepared to grind youroff. Who knows, you might even be one of the lucky ones and find yourself a hacker/modder that is generous and he/she will give you some money. Dont do it though you might get banned.
