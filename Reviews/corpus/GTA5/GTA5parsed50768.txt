Take two just essentially banned single player modding for this game. The modding tool OpenIV that was banned did not work in multiplayer and if you tried to launch multiplayer with it installed the game would crash to desktop.This is ridiculous. GTAV had a thriving mod community that gave new life to the singleplayer game that R and Take Two stopped supporting long ago.Im done with this game. This was a terrible move on Take Twos part.
