Technically, GTA5 is a great game. Amazing graphics, quite a big world. But the single player is quite boring after the game is complete, because there is not much to do except the achievement. All enhancements are for online only. WHY? Why can not I just buy all the houses and vehicles in singlepayer, when they are in the game? Why do I have to play online when I do not want to? I would normally recommend this game because it is great in itself. Negative ratings creators have earned their arrogant approach to the gaming community. They still prefer multiplayer full of cheaters who are not capable of doing anything, and even do not let the players relax in the standby with all the newcomers.
