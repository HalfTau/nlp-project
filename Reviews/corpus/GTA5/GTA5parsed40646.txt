Honestly, this game is not even worth buying when Single player mods are no longer available.Yes, I know SP mods are still available but only the boring ones.The MAIN REASON I got myself a Gaming PC was because of GTA SP Mods, and now theyre gone.Before anyone says Just play online. Im not interested in GTA Online on PC.Fk you Take Two, money whres. Im not hating on Rockstar, I know its not their fault.Also please sign this petition to try and save OpenIVOver 40,000 people have already signed this petition.
