Killing OpenIV ruins this fame. GTA Online is terrible, with the only good thing being extra content that is locked out of single player. If I have tat content, I should be able to use it. But nope, Take Two wants even more of my money. Better buy those stupid Shark Cards to keep them happy. Microtransaction do not belong in GTA hell, they dont belong in gaming, period.Nice job, Take Two. You dun goofed, and now consequences will never be the same. And Im not buying another game from this publisher until they drop the cease and desist. You should support modders, not threaten them. Stop acting like Nintendo.
