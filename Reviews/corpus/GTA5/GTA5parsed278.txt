Grand Theft Auto is a fairly fun single player experience, and you will likely enjoy it, however, you, like many people are hoping that the multiplayer is good, I can assure it is not, while playing in a closed friend session, it is very clear that rockstar wants you to spend mroe money, as almost vehicle of any value is priced at a range where you will have to grind way more than you want to, as shown by teh fact that 95 of my hours in GTA online is just grinding the fastest way I could find. However if you can get past that, closed sessions can be quite fun wiht your friends.  The real problem with GTA online is public sessions, which you often have to be in for certain jobs and such. Almost every single public session has at least one hacker that goes pretty much completly unpunished unless they hack in money, and if they dont ruin the experience, then the griefers will, people that will almost never be punished because they didnt hack, but will work as hard as tehy can to use all of their resources to kill you over and over again. You may try to report hackers, as that will at least increase the chance of one being punished, however GTA follows a premise where you cannot report more than one person every, at least 10 mins in my experience, so if you are dealing with multiple hackers, you canreport one of them and leave the server, or stay in the server getting killed every 30 seconds for 10 minutes while you wait to be able to report the next person.
