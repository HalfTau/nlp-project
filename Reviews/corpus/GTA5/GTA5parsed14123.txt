This games excellent single player is definitely worth the money. Unfortunately the online support or should I say the lack of from Rockstar is appalling. Constant bans, retracting of online currency, lack of action against actual problematic players make the online aspect quite literally unplayable due to the amount of time you have to invest in progress. Should you decide to pour hours and hours of your free time into the online, expect it to suddenly disappear even if you somehow have never run into modders and not modded yourself. I have had friends send tickets to R asking for help to check their accounts in every way and see that no modding or account abuse has occured, only to have them send them copypaste answers and ignore any request for help. I loved this games online, but dont play it anymore out of fear of it being the greatest waste of my time.
