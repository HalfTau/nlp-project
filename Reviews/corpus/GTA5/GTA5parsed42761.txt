RIP OpenIV,Wait like 2 years after PC release, after when everyone who was gonna buy the game has already bought it, to kill mods to continue pushing Pay2Win cards on a online mode that gets stale after about an hour. Really makes you think.RIP ModdingSTOP !Open IV TeamTook away modding.Do NOT buy this game. This game is not worth your money.GTA V was turning into something special until Take Two decided they didnt want us to have mods. You have to grind and get griefed by script kiddies in GTA online or shell out money to buy Shark Cards. This is what Take Two wants just more money, they dont care about your experience online. This is why they had OPEN IV shutdown. Everytime i join a multiplayer session there is at least one script kiddy, never fails. If you are looking for a great online experience do not buy this game.GTA 5 is really fun. I never get get bored because theirs alot of things to doIm leaving a negative review on behalf of the OpenIV team. But all the people gettingat R, its not them! Its Take Two Interactive. They are the ones who did this
