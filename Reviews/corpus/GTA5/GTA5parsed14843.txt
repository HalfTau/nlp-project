It isnt that is this is a bad game , The single player is good some single player dlc would be nice though  I would reccommend this game if you just want single player but the online portion of this game is not to good i mean i love the grind but the online component is way too grindy redoing task such as stealing vehicles and selling them gets very repetitive and thats the best way to make money the second best in my opinion is hiests but there are only 5 hiests and the only good one will get repititive aswell the biker dlc is nice but running you buisness becomes to much of a hastle and its not that enjoyable after a while gunrunning dlc is bassically another biker buisness and the smugglers run is not worth it for the price tag of around 2 mill for a hangar  when without 4 people you will baraly be making money . The community for this game is extremely toxic and i would reccomend just getting some friends to play this game with you .In short i reccomend this game for the single player and not so much the online which is sad considering they are putting all there work into online we were promised a single player dlc a never got one so buy this game if you just want single player dont bother with online unless you have some friends to play with it might be fun in the beggining of online but the repititve tasks will make it boring very quickly.
