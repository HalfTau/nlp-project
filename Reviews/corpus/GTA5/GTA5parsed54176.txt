Love this game, but TakeTwo can go  itself with restricting mod usage in SINGLEPLAYER. They dont even add new content to singleplayer. So much awesome content graces the lands of GTA Online but none of it reaches singleplayer, and if you wanna spawn content from Online in singleplayer using mods, youre ed now.
