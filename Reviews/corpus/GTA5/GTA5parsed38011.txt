TakeTwo Interactive and Rockstar take their consumers for granted and assume that their actions against the community have no consequences.They have shown through their actions that they do not wish to provide their customers with a fun experience in exchange for 59.99. The only thing they seem to care about is filling their pockets with microtransactions while angering their singleplayer community to the best of their ability.Do not support them.
