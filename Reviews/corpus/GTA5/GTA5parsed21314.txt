Id write more in this recommendation but I cant be bothered. The same way Rockstar has chosen to treat their community.  this game. The FUBAR of this game escalated from 0 to 100 faster than any vehicle in the game itself. It now only condones, and encourages, griefing and the purchase of shark cards. Rockstar has, with surgical precision, completely cut out every single player who once had fun in this game. Not playing it anymore.
