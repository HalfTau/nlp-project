Players We have a hacking problem can you please fix it?Take Two Okay will do.... 2 years later Hmm, it seems that it would cost us actual money to make a anticheat that works and we are just not making enough money off of shark cards to justify it. So instead we are happy to announce that we shall make all mods pretty much unuseable now! It was a long and hard work but we put our best minds together to fix hacking! We hope you enjoy your hacking free enviroment, and dont forget to buy shark cards!Me So glad I didnt cave in and buy their Blooming shark cards.
