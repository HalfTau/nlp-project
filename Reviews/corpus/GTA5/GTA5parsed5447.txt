Review from a PVE player.DONT BUY it if you like PVE gameplay, you either get killed by players alot so you cant make any money without being in a sort of PVP mode or if you finnally can play in peace you need other players to help you with dropping off your hard earned cocaine and if you start that mission the whole server is being alerted that you are doing a drop and everyone gets in their tanks and gunships to kill you.Also NPCs are all well trained snipers even the ones with just a sidearm/handgun from miles away.Selling cars you can only sell 1 car every 45 min and you normally only get around 3.5k a car with a max of 5k sometimes.Community the community can be good at sometimes and helpfull if you can find a nice crew to help you but most of the time its toxic as hell, especially those hacking russians.So if you like the previous GTA series and like PVE and dont like PVP then dont waste your money and time with this game.So MY verdict is 3/10ps. Rockstar is all out to sell those shark cash cards so everything is expensive and you dont get much money at all ingame, all this to increase the chance you buy those cards, so in my opinion this game is P2W Cash cow all the way.
