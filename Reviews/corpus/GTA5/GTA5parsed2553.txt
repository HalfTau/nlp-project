Awful game. Modders on every server, so you will be extremely lucky if you dont get fucked by them. Pretty much impossible to get any money at the start, so youll have to grind forever, doing boring missions to gain little money. The only easy way to gain a lot of money are daily objectives, and what a pain they are. Rockstar made dull and useless game modes that no one wants to play thats fine though. What itsnt is that they included these game modes in to the daily objectives to make them practically impossible to accomplish. Getting someone to join your lobby is hard enough, but the chance of them not leaving in 10 seconds is closer to 0 than an anime characters body pillow appearing on your bed due to quantum fluctuations. If you somehow manage to get to the teamscreen, you will be kicked out, because there were apparently not enough players and you will then be stuck on a loading screen forever, so youll have to restart. That however doesnt really help, as it takes over 10 minutes to load online. Also, it has very little to due with skill. The more money you invest, the more overpowered vechicles/weapons youll have. That is all multiplayer though, the singleplayer is great. Everything is balanced, fun and you dont need to torture yourself to gain money. However, singleplayer can only last so long, therefore you will have to go online eventually. All in all, its punishment for anybody who comes in raw.
