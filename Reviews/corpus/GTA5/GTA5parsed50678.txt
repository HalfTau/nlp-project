EDIT MODS ARE NOW BACK so can fully reccomend this game, just spent hours driving around in all sorts of vehicles and loving every second! !If you wanted this for the mods well sorry but Take 2 has crushed your dreams.55 hours loved this game with mods plus this is my third play through PS3, PS4, now PCBut cannot endorse PC version with the modding community effectively killed.If Take 2 decision to kill Open IV is reversed then will be changing my review.Until then avoid this game.
