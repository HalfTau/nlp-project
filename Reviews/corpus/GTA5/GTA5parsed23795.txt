do not buy GTA 5 if you like to costumize or have fun in the games you buy to your liking.. Rockstar does not want you to have fun in single player because they think its making people not buy there in game currancy for single player, so they took out costumizing and modding your game at all for more money giving a big middle finger and us and asking for our money. this game,  rockstar
