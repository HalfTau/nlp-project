Take Two have completely gutted the modding scene for absolutely no good reason, citing that the mod Open IV, a basis for 90 of the mods for GTA V, as such OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience.This statement is entirely untrue, as Open IV does not touch the online aspect of the game in any way, shape, or form. It is a purely singleplayer modification.The only reason they have done this is to attempt to take attention away from the singleplayer modding scene and direct it back towards GTA Online, a microtransaction filled . It seems their Whales have finally dried up, and they are desperate after making billions to cash in just a little more. Take Two. Sign this petition
