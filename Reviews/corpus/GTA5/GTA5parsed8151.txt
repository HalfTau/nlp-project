It was fun while it lasted.  Rockstar appears to be issuing temporary bans for no reason whatsoever. I logged on today and receieved a This account is cuirrently banned warning.  I have never used mods, never violated any of the Terms of Service, yet now here I cant log in and my progress will be reset.  I am a person who hates having hackers ruin the game, and now I am being treated like one.  Not to mention, Rockstar offers no appeal to bans and any attempt to request support immediately has its ticket closed.
