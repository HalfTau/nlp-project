If youre looking for an awesome and fun campaign sure, but the multiplayer is some of the most unbalanced garbage. Rockstar needs to completely rework it, from square one. It favours those who pay and those who have the most in game money. Gun play in this game is cancer, unless you completely remove the Heavy Sniper, Gatling gun, and any other super weapongame plays really well in EARYL EARLY EARLY days when no one had the money or the levels, but now its 100 pure cancer.
