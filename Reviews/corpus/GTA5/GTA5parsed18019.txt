was cool when it came out. Online play is terrible, they expect you to play hundreds of missions to get enough money to buy the new conten...... oh wait no they dont silly me. they want you to pay 80 to get a shark card with a measly 8m on it. Yea that should get you 1 modified car lolI am hoping with everyone standing up that they will work towards the next game instead of releasing terrible free dlcIf people stop buying those cards they will get the point
