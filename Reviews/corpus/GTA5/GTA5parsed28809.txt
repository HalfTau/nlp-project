While the single player and even the multiplayer is great, I must jump on the recent bandwagon here as it is extremely disheartening that Rockstar is putting expected single player DLC to the wind in favor of microtransaction sales, as well as damaging the passionate modding community also in favor of said microtransactions. This unending corporate greed seems to get the best of them.Mods are an incredibly important aspect of PC gaming, and they should be defended. The recent additional shut down of the excellentlooking Liberty City mod makes this situation all the more concerning.
