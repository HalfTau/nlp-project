 ROCKSTAR GAMES AND THEIR  SOCIAL CLUBTHAT DOESNT LET ME  START THE GAME!EDIT Was able to start the game eventually so I could continue my story progress, but I had to use a hack tool to avoid the social clubNow I have finished the storyline and I am very impressed with the game. If only the social club never exsisted though... As Im writing this, the game started working again with social club, but I must say that the thing I hate the most of all things is 3rd party tools that has to run while playing newer games today, I hate those tools!But in the end, GTA V is a great game with very impressive graphics!
