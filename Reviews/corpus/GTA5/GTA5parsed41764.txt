I support the OpenIV team. No longer support Rockstar until they reverse their decision. First the return of paid mods from Bethesda at this years E3, and now this by Rockstar. It really does seem that once my favorite companies get bigger, the more greedier they become and forget about who made and what made their games great in the first place... which is the fans and modders who keep their games alive to become what they are today.
