God Damn, Rockstar had to know the precussions of allowing Take Two to  up the modding community, truely I am ing outraged that some dim witted idiots not naming and names TAKE TWO want to make more ing money on one of the top 10 most selling games of all time, literally. This has extreamly messed up modding and I know that this is not Rockstars fault but this has made me and many many others put Take Two games on my blacklist.So I encourage you if you enjoy modding communities in video games, join me and countless others in blacklisting any game shrouding the 2k logo for Take Twos selfish interest in ruining the amazing modding community of GTA V and many other games.PS Please excuse my language, I hope this shows the amount of hatred I have in the actions of Take TwoSincerly,Go to hell Take Two, but first give us our mods back!
