New Update did a terrible job of eliminating hackers and caused public outcry.The new vehicles and weapons released in Gunrunning are overpowered to say the least. Any player who isnt being given money by a person modding the game will be defenseless against APC, Mobile Operations Centers, and the like. Overall a negative experience when playing online.Story mode is fun for about 12 hours, until after you complete the main story. Only when youve gained your riches do you find out that effectively none of the online content is in Story mode for you to play around with. Overall a negative singleplayer experience.Regardless to Rockstars upsetting actions in the new update, GTA V is still a unique game, and has some upsides to playing it. Ive logged over 450 hours on it, and Im still finding new things to do. Although playing online since the new update has been a hassle.If you are thinking of purchasing the game, the choice is up to you, but my experience has been generally negative.
