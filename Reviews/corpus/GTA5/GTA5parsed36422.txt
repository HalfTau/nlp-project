TakeTwo has ruined a great game with a fantastic modding scene. Whats so wrong about being able to add the cars you want into your single player game? I never played online anyways because I have a crap internet connection, and modding singleplayer was the only thing that kept the game fun after I beat it.Heres to you guys at OpenIV... Youll be missed...
