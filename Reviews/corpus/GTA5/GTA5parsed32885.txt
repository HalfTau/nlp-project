TakeTwos cease and desist to mod makers has disrupted and downright destroyed any and all faith in Grand Theft Auto V as a product.  Please dont purchase this product, as youll be reinforcing an absolutely destructive and horrendous paid mod mindset various developers are starting to have, which is just absolutely unacceptable.  PC gaming since the beginning has been about the community and the mods that have been crafted with love for the game only make PC gaming better.  Please dont support this kind of overmonetization  Dont buy this game.
