This was, originally, me whining about how Rockstar support screwed me over. I rated the game well but did not reccomend it on the basis that support wasnt very helpful. Slow as they may have been, they did come through and resolve my issue after I gave  them ample proof of my side of the story. To summarize, the game is great, but be sure that you are careful with what you do with your account as, unless you have a very strong case, customer support cant help you.
