Rockstar games, I love them, Ive loved them ever since i can remember, and I still do to this day. TakeTwo on the other hand?  you. You send a cease and decist letter to the makers of the best modding platform thats ever been created OpenIV if anyone is not familiar what im talking about, and youve shut them down because of these new Online and Modding policies? what did they do? they mod SINGLEPLAYER, its the third party idiots who actually make mods for online. Who, funny enough, even after closing down OpenIV, and patching the game? Still modding online by the way, on all platforms. You are a disgrace to gaming as a whole, and now you belong far below Konami in my book, which is very ing low.Ive bought this game on release on all three platforms I play on PS3, PS4  PC, same with every other GTA released, as publishers, you should be ashamed of yourselves as a, so called company.
