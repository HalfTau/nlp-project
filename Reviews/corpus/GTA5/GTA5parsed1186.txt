Would be better if the cheaters were allowed to give players a buncha cash, new players werent completely crushed by players whos stuck with the game, people actually played the missions.HOWEVER!Single player is still fun, and has inspired games like Watchdogs 2 which are just as good in their singleplayer gameplay.Wouldnt play this game anymore myself, unless I somehow got a group of friends to do the hiests with me.Play with friends, or for the races.
