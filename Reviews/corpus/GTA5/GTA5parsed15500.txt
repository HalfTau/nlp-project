Base game was fun, but the online community is garbage. Every lobby is full of cheaters, griefers, and the whole gamut of jerks. Rockstar constantly milks the player base for money with outrageously priced ingame items that you can conveniently purchase with real money if you want to compete and have nice things. Avoid this like heroin you dont need it in your life.
