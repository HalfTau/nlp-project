Singleplayer is a ton of fun, online is a bit different. It is fun, dont get me wrong, but the fact that this is a 60 game with microtransactions for ingame currency is pretty awful and if I were to be honest, pretty dam annoying. Theyre gonna give you 8 million ingame currency for 100 and think thats a fair deal? The fact they even have these loathed shark cards in general is frustrating. Rockstars a great company, so why did they suddenly turn so hungry for even more profit from a game that gave them thousands upon millions of money without these shark cards. And now, to entice players to buy these godawful shark cards, they make the game a grind to get anything you want. Youre gonna have to grind and grind to have a little amount of fun. I payed 60 for this game and you want me to pay more? Pathetic.5/10 Wouldve been a perfect game if Rockstar didnt get greedy.Edit I should also mention that at times the community can be absolutely abysmal.
