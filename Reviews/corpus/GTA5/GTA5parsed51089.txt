Take 2 has decided that mods are not allowed on their game by going so far as to send cease and desist to a well known modding team that have been modding for years, yes YEARS so do the right thing. Tell Take 2 that if modding is suddenly magically illegal, making horrible decisions and removing options for consumers is also illegal.
