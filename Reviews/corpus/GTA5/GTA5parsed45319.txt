I initially got the game at launch in fall of 2013 for my Xbox 360, even then the single player felt weak to me compaired to other GTA games but the game felt worth while. a few months later GTAO came into being, A step up in some ways over GTA4 but they removed the GTA4 style lobby screens to make queuing for things more then a bit more annoying. Then the waiting game started, features got pushed back, more shark cards and the like, I quit far before hiests become an option.Fast forward to now and it seems like things are far worse then better, after friends begged me to get the game one finally gave me the money to just buy it, I wasnt gonna buy is a second time, about the only thing I find even remotely fun is mesing with the new cars and most of those are so costly that I got bored of the grind to get them, the hiests are okay I guess worth running once atleast maybe twice. but this game wasnt worth the 120 bucks that was paid for it to get it two times. I feel bad for anyone that wasted more then that, since I have freinds that have paid for 3 or more copies and shark cards,
