Love the GTA series, Ive played almost all of them since I got a console. I bought GTA V for pc for the modding potential, but with the recent news regarding OpenIV and how modding is basically dead, I cant recommend it. Honestly, if youre planning on getting GTA V then I would recommend waiting until TakeTwo Interactive stops ing over modders because what they did is unreasonable and honestly completely unforgivable.
