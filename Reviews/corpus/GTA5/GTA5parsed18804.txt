I used to play this on the 360, i can say that the singleplayer is quite good, but i prefer the story of GTA IV because it was more focus in one chacarter instead 3, i found to be more easy to relate to 1 protagonist instead of 3, still though, mods are a plus in pc gaming and this franchise its no stranger when it comes to modding.As for the online part, its bad for the most part. It can be fun at first but after 100 hours into and still grinding myoff, it start to get boring. After a while you dont get the feel that youre progressing in anyway, it feels more like im doing this for nothing, trying to get a bunch of fast cars and crazy vehicles just to amuse me for mere hours/minutes. Sure they drop alot of free updates but then again... its the same thing all over it, you grind alot, you get what you want and after some hours/minutes youre done. As for the grinding, its ridiculous, this is a AAA game that you pay 60USD and it feels like a mobile game in the sense that you must have the patience of a virtue to earn such item, if you do buy this game soley for the online... well then prepare yourself to redo alot of heists, vip/ceo/biker bussines and 2xRP/Money events or pay real money just to get something that feels overpriced. Another problem with the online aspect its Hackers, i can assume that 80 of the freemode servers its bond to have at least 1 hacker and its even sad when half of the lobby ask the hacker for in game cash... or even worse, when the hacker starts to play with your account.Overall GTA V it is a fun game at most, but i think it is somewhat overpriced because of the multiplayer. I think Gta online should turn into a F2P or something like that while we pay 30USD just for the singleplayer.
