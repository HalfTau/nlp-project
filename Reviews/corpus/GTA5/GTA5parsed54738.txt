I overall enjoyed this game in single player both on pc and console, but not so much now. I found that the cars had to much grip for my tast so i used the slidy cars cheat code for better handling in my opion. One day the code made cars undrivable after an update and rockstar seemed to not be fixing it.It seamed that all they care about this game now is multiplayer. In single player cars still disappear from your garage if you use auto save, they broke their own cheet code, and most recently the game refusees to run at 60 fps no its not my card the game is only calling for about 50 percent of what the card can provide and doesnt matter what display settings i have.So i try online multiplayer and get hacked, so i had to deal with rockstar for a day to get back my login information back. I look into this problem and see that their online gameplay security is so bad, that any person with basic computer skills and the game can pull and decript your user information if they played with you. So make sure you have differnet password for this then anything else.So online is a bust and singleplayer is broken, time to turn to mods so i can enjoy singleplayer. Well not so fast, now TakeTwo Rockstars Distributer has sent an Official CeaseandDesist letter to Open IV, which is the backbone for GTA mods since GTA 3. And Open IV does not have the time and money to fight the legal battle so they have agreed to shut down.So yes if you want a game with broken single player in my opion with continued glitches that dont seem like they plan to fix. Or a multiplayer where they are basicly makeing money on people making micro transactions, and you can get hacked basicly by anyone in a basement with a computer than this is a game for you. Personally Ill go back to GTA 4, see below for the links for TakeTwo vs OpenIV and the Petition to overturn it.TakeTwo VS OpenIVPetition to save Open IV
