OK... Take 2 have relented somewhat, after Rockstar apparently went to them and said heeeey, lets not have our reputation ruined over this mod buisness, right? K, thx...Rockstars hands arent as clean as you might think but Ill give them the benefit of the doubt and let this be water under the bridge..As always, GTA5 is a damned good game, bit high on the cheaters and the grind, but a good time overall.. love the updates ofc, hope they give us more actual grand theft auto CEO missions... Have a good time and play clean!
