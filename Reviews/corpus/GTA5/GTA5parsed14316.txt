ITS A AMAZING GAME TO PLAY FOR ENDINGLESS HOURS AND HOURS AND REPETIVE ENOUGH KEEPS YOU WANNA KEEP PLAYING FOR STORY OR ONLINE THEY ARE BOTH A BLAST STILL HAVE A BLAST MODDING SINGLE PLAYER AND GOOFING AROUND. ONLINE IS A BLAST AS WELL BESIDES THE FACT MOST IN GAME ITEMS ARE QUITE OVER EXPENSIVE AND REQUIRED SHARKCARDS TO BUY THEM IF YOU DONT HAVE IN GAME MONEY I RECOMEND FIND SOME FRIENDS ONLINE AND HOP IN A GROUP AND ALL GRIND FOR SOME MONEY OR RP MAKES IT HELLA EASIER I CAN STILL GRIND SOLO A TEAM IS ALWAYS GOOD WITH 1000  HOURS IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON STORY OR ONLINE ITS WORTH A NIGHT TIME DRIVE WITH SELF RADIO TO SOME RETRO MIAMI WAVE AND BLOWING UP THE HOLE CITY CAUSING KAOS TO PEDS WORTH IT
