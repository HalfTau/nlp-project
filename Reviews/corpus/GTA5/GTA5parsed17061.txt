The story is amazing and one of the most fun ive played. The game hooks you in with a story that after you finish you wish it was longer. The gameplay feels great and the characters are really rememberable.the multiplayer is actually the worst ive seen in forever. it has all these cool things they constantly give dlc for, but then you realize almost all of it is behind microtransactions. in order to get anywhere in this you have to spend real money to get fake money. even after you do all that some asshat uses hacks to get you permanently banned. if you are a new player the chances of some guy running you over at full speed with a fast and really expensive car are really large. plus ive heard even when you get to the top and have all thethere is nothing to do anymore. you have all the crap, there is no grind. and that is the biggest issue with the gameplay. all it is is grinding. grinding and eventually realizing at the end it wasnt worth it. thats why so many kids use their mom or uncles credit card. they buy all thisto realize in the end that they get tired of it fast. and what happens when you quit the game? money wasted? ugh.So the conclusion is Singleplayer is amazing! multiplayer is microtransaction hell.Also geesh Rockstar why dont you make some singleplayer dlc. Thats what everyone wants instead of more expansions for something everyone is starting to hate.
