Drip feeding content, when there is content they add things that are oversaturated like supercars, bad servers that take 20 minutes to load, and the WORST thing about playing online are the scriptkiddies that use mods to godmode and forcibly crash your game.The single player is good but all of the sudden it seems like Rockstar forgot about it, no updates and no single player DLC like they promised.
