Another example of a company completely out of touch with its players. A company focusing their entire business model with their  online service selling in game money and with a shockingly bad customer service which in most cases you will receive an automated response, so of course they would shut down Open IV a modding program that focuses on SINGLE player mods. This is not the same company that I used to love.  YOU I wont be buying another one of your games.
