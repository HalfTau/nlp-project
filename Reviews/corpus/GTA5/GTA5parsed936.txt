Everything about this game is amazing except for the fact that there are lots of in toxic wannabes out there who hacks and makes it unplayable for people who just started playing this game. However, i just realized later about this feature where we can enable the passive mode to avoid any firefight.Apart from this, the hardcore grinding that we have to go through to purchase stuff literally makes it the most expensive virtual life we live in. I mean seriously for a friggin tattoo 25000 . This game would be a lot better or even the best if the cost of the minor stuff or the common ones infact are reduced to a certain level.Keeping all the above aside, The game on the whole is fun, Graphics are friggin amazing. The online version is way more fun. Id recommend this to anyone who have the patience to grind or the ones who are rich and can pay for the so called Shark Cards.
