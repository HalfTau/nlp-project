Was excited for the game when bought on release which was already much later than BOTH releases to consoles. Time and time again since that PC release Take Two has continued to dig holes showing that they obviously dont care about their customers. Regret buying 2 copies of this game at full price and wont be purchasing anything else from them until something changes.
