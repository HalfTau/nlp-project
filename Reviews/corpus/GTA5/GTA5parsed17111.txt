Great game, especially Multiplayer. Find yourself a good PvE crew if you want to make money, and you can have a pretty good time. If PvP is your bag, dont expect to make much. Oh, and dont cheat. You WILL get caught, and you WILL get banned. Simple as that. You agreed to it when you created your Rockstar Social Club account.
