After some hundred hours of playing, even the online mode gets boring. I mainly play in a private session with my friends, but after time, it gets old.Everything is expensive, Ive already bought the most expensive assets through grinding, mind you, and the payoff is... even more expensive stuff. If youve never played the game, then sure, play the single player portion, other than that, NO.
