This game series is one of the most iconic and genre defining series ever made. Yet I utterly fail to understand why Rockstar wont get official servers so that we can get rid of hackers and such? There is ZERO moderation in online play. Rockstar is becoming the next EA.Dont get me wrong, the singleplayer mode is fantastic, the game is extremely optimized, it plays very well. But the online is not worth ANYTHING of the price they ask for. Its essentially a free to play online mode slapped together to go with an otherwise amazing game.I dont recommend this game. Not on 50 off, not on 75 off, maybe on 8090 off, sure I recommend it. But dont even expect to have a good time playing online, because the community is They cant compete with players who rival their own level, so they take it out on new players. No one helps out at all. They wear the invisible clothes and blow up yourfor no god damn reason. OH! And then they keep on crying GTA online is dying, no one is playing the game, there is no online population. Well tough luck kids, youre the only reason that happened.Dont even get me started on the 10minute long loading screens that is actually matchmaking...
