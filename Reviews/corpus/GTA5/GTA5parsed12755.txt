READ BEFOR BUY GTA 5!!! This game or the error game costs u 59 and only thing u get is a BIG error screen every time u wanna play Gta. I have got 6 or 8 errors under 40 hours playing this game and now the last error i cant even fix. I have Deleted and downloaded it 4 times, i have rebooted ALL the files 3 times, i have open the game as admin and opend steam like admin. I also downloaded copyd files from internet and replaced all the old files 2 times. NOTHING WORKS! This game is all broke. All Guns and Cars and planes cost u IRL money if u want them. But dont worry u can still get it from Hacker that gets u banned when they give u money. I have over 800 hours on ps4 and there i still havent had a problem. IF u want gta 5 Buy on consol.
