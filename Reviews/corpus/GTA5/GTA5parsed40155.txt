GTAV was developed with a budget of 265 million US dollars, and made 1 billion dollars within 3 days of release. Yet for some reason some people thought that charging more for ingame, online only cash was justifiable because adding in new cars or short spins on online PVP cost hundreds of millions to produce, right? This is a 60 dollar game that sold extremely well, there is no excuse for microtransactions. It seems as if TakeTwo has forced Rockstar to develop nuggets of content for the online multiplayer and hold them hostage behind days of grinding the same missions youve been grinding for the past few years unless, of course, you paid more money. I see Rockstar developing progressivbely more unique new vehicles and improving on the online game while their publisher forces them to lock it all away from the majority of their players, its really sad to see happen. Maybe if we didnt buy into Take Twos plan so heavily theyd lay their hands off the development of this game and wed see fun come back? This is the same Take Two whos CEO recently claimed they had been generous with how much content theyve allowed us, paying customers, to enjoy for free. Rockstar may still care about their game but as long as Take Two sees it as a major cash cow they wont allow them to freely improve it. Do not buy this game, wait untill this all blows over.
