I just bought a hangar with the new Smugglers Run update and it is trash. The missions are extremely difficult to complete if you dont have the best planes and just get the default ones they give you. You never have enough time to get all the objectives done with 20 minutes. Most of the good planes are over 1.5 million which you can barely get without using modded money. This is just like what they did with Gunrunning. You buy one thing but then you have to grind 24/7 to get any of the new stuff.
