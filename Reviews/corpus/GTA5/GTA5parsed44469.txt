The free modding tool OpenIV is almost ten years old, and its been fighting Rockstar for most of that time. Now that the developers gave up after Rockstar declared them illegal even though if they took it to the court, Rockstar would almost certainly lose, Id say the game is not worth buying.Its very obvious that theyre trying to milk the game as long as they can, with the two fully priced releases, microtransactions and the fact that its sold for the full price two years after the release. They also cant keep their word the release dates and the promised DLC, have a poor anti hacker system and generally treat the players like crap.Otherwise, its a pretty good game, though I dont think its worth 60.
