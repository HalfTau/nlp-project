Take Two is a company who doesnt care for its customers, they only care about money. The Cease and Desist letter they sent to the OpenIV team and all other modders in the past is a direct indication of this. Anything that has even a remote chance of jeaporadizing their cashflow in any way they take as a direct threat that must be dealt with swiftly and as harshly as possible. The only way we as gamers can stop these AAA developers from continuing their blatant disregard of their customers is to stop spending our hard earned money on their games and choose to support the developers who put their customers first.Sign this petition please
