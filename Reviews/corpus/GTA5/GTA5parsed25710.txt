Once upon a time in a city named Los Santos. You could become the Hulk and smash all the cops around you, or you could get the batmobile and pretend that you are Batman.But now its a boring scary place where you only can have fun if you play online and buy shark cards or waste hundreds of hours earning the money you need for new DLC and other Thats not the world I wanna live in. I want the good old Los Santos to come back.
