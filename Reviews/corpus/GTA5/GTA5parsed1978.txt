Amazing game, had it on the Xbox 360 a few years back and finally decided to buy it on PC. And oh my god was it a good purchase! Amazing story, insanely funny and virtually infinite online mode and pretty much the worlds best  with it all simulator. 100 recommend to anyone that has a PC, even prebuilt ones. I run an I34160, intel HD4400 and 8GB of DDR3 ram and still manage to get a steady FPS at a playable quality that doesnt make the game look bad. So if you are considering this game, I suggest you buy it!
