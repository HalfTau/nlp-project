TLDR The game is fun, however it turned into a grind fest or P2W game.The singleplayer story and open world is amazing, the problems are in the online world of GTA V. To get stuff you need to earn money to buy weapons, get cars and houses. You can earn small amount of money everytime you do missions. Or you can just pay some real money to get millions worth of ingame money. I rather pay a small amount for a real DLC and a fun little grind than this. There is also a problems with cheaters in GTA Online.
