The game itself is brilliant it is a Rockstar masterpiece.However its being ruined by Take Two Interactive, a company that treats you like a money making monkey. They do not care about us gamers, all they give a damn about is money money money. They dont do anything about cheating on GTA Online unless its you messing up with in game currency and not using microtransactions! GTA Online made 700 milion  last year and yet its not enough for Take Two, they want all your pocket money.And now to top it off they sent a cease and desist letter to a Open IV  a modding tool for SINGLE PLAYER CONTENT! ONLY! You thought that EA was bad? Nope... Here you have a top of the line scumbag! FU Take Two!Long live mods and modders!
