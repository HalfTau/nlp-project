I do recommend this game. It is immensly fun and this comes from someone who only plays online.However I do need to adress some things that I have to do in order to make it fun. Play ONLY with friends To many cheaters exe on public servers However this means I cant do alot of the main grind elements to get money. There are ways to get around Essentially I end up playing the heist content with friends alot and troll around.For me this means alot and is probably what I think is fun but if you are looking for new content and campaigns exe at the current time I would NOT recommend you get this game.
