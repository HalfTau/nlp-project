GTA in general has been one of my favorite games to play on PC or Xbox. Single Player is very fun and theres lots to do, except one thing. Rockstar constantly updating multiplayer with new DLCs and cars. Why not add that to Single Player as well? Rockstar has stopped adding things to Single Player just about 10ish months ago and theres definately isnt as much to do in Single Player as there is to do in Online. As for Online, Im pretty sure a lot of people are now talking about it, but everything is WAYYYYYY too overpriced and it takes forever to get money. Cars and planes used to be less than 2M, maybe even lower and now there are planes and jets that are over 5M!! !Heist setups only give you about 1520K each, unless if the heist is double money, then you earn money faster. Races give as much as about 3040K if it is a full session and it is a newer race. With the new DLCs, there are now bunkers, hangars, and facilities to get, but dont forget that they start at over 1M. but for a bunker, dont forget to get the upgraded staff, and updated security, which will run you about another 2M. As you can buy planes and flying cars and stuff, there is a discount price and a regular price, but oh yeah, to get the discount price, you need to spend another 3M to even get that, but that may help you in the future to get other vehicles. For the MOC Mobile Operations Center costs at the base 1.2M, but if you add the vehicle and weapon workshop, and the Command Center, that runs you another 1.2M making it a total of 2.4M to get a truck.As there are many gripes about GTA V, it is still a very enjoyable and fun game to play with friends and I recommend it to anyone who likes to do missions and kill people.
