I definitely recomend this game, because its a lot of fun to play.Online or offline, its just too much fun to play, but there is always that kind of people that wants something more,so, they make mods for the game, i dont use mods but i see a lot of videos, and it seems to be fun as hell.R wants to remove any possibility to make mods for the game, and i dont know why.R should work on a better anticheat and let the modders play their mods on single player.If R remove all mods from the game, modders wouldnt been able to have fun anymore, the game will be boring and a lot of youtube channels that use mods to make videos will end.ConclusionI do recomend this game, but.R needs to work on a better anticheat.R shouldnt remove the possibility of making mods for the game.
