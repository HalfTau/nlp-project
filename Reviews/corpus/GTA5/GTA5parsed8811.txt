Finally took the plunge and bought it during Black Friday with the 8m megalodon card.  Ive plated all the GTA games since the original came out way back in 1997 and the only reason I hadnt gotten this one was my PC wasnt powerful enough, but an upgrade sorted that.Just been playing single player and really enjoying it so far, a lot more than GTA 4   the choice of jumping between characters is great. Missions are fun, plenty variety, radio stations are great, just a good game.Have only done a little bit of online play, so cant comment on that yet. I am not a massive fan of microtransactions and feel that this 8m will be all I buy for this game.
