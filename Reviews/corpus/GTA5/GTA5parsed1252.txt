Great game to play with friends but if you are playing alone i wouldnt really recommend onlinethe online mode has really become total aids nothing but modders and useless  updates with garbage new cashgrabs and way too much of a grind. everytime i get into a game i like to  with people bc i have millions of dollars and nothing to do, eventually i pick on some retard thats getting mad calling my resources crutches then i destroy him on ground with normal guns and he puts a water fountain on me with his  menu he got for free on an account that will get banned in a week. Dont play multiplayer unless you have modded money.the story mode is one if the best single player campaigns i have ever played the only complaint i have is the plot is a little cliche with the whole just one last job thing but still very enjoyable
