I loved this game first when it came out but not its just sad. Before GTA Online really made you feel like a normal criminal / gangster and you could feared cops but now ... youre like the most researched criminal in the world stealing military grade stuff and vehicles. Every dlc that they add are so expensive, you have to grind youroff so it looks like they force you to buy their shitcards. The online mode is infested with modders, some drop money and makes the session nice but most of them are just holes that kill everyone and I even met one that could crash an entire session freeze your game. And guess what ... instead of finding a way to stop these modders they sue OpenIV. OpenIV was only for the solo mode and it didnt harm anything, it actually made the solo mode way more funnier. Dont buy this game except if you want to go in private sessions with your friends and do funny stuff but then CEO missions will be disabled so no new vehicles for you and if you really want money, pay a modder or just grind this game like its a full time job.
