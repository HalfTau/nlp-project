I love this game, aspecially the singleplayermods... but the fact that in online everything is expensive as  and if you want something actually cool you have to either grind for hours or get a shark card using real money, is really annoying.I cant play the game currently because it keeps crashing when i start it but the time i played was 100 worth the 30 i bought it on sale
