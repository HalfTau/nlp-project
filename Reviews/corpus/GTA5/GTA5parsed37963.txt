The way that Rockstar has treated the gaming community, with what theyve done to a company that has been one of their biggest supporters/enthusiasts OpenIV is extremely hostile to not just them, but me personally.Ridiculous. We cant accept this what a way to treat the people who have helped your game sell much better on PC...hell, its why I even bought it on PC.Crap.
