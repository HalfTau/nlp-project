Everything about the core gameplay in GTA V is amazing and warrents the highest of praise. It will not recieve this however until a very particular problem is addressed. Microtransactions need to be removed and modding needs to be encouraged. GTA V has entertained me for many hours, but I cannot continue to support a game if the publishers dont support the community.
