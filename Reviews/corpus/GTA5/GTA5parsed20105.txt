Dear Rockstar,I just guess you earn at least some  with this game, so here are my issuesreduce loading timesmake it a stable game nearly everytime I lose my goods due to technical issues, connection losses etc.pricing for everything is not acceptable under this circumstances offer compensationsI just ask for this, not because I am greedy, I just get frustrated, fed up and think about playing sth else right now. In Addition, these things make it more interesting for players, who dont earn game currency the regular way...Hope youll at least read this and, in best case, solve these things.I still think GTA has highest potential and and is one of the best games ever, but I vote negative at the moment.Cheers
