I liked GTA V, the singleplayer at least Online is a mess. Its the best Grand Theft Auto experience you can get, with the immersive world, fun activities, and the great story. Why am I recommending against this game? Oh come on, you know why, everyones doing it today. I could be writing a serious review where I elaborate on why GTA V is such a great game, instead this happens.Congratulations TakeTwo and Rockstar, having one of the best selling games of all time isnt enough for you?
