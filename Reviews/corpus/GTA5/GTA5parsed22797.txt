10/10 its GTA. It has an overall very good actionpacked story, well um I would say this game does have an amazing story to keep us entertained for hours and hours so apart from the story mode which we will be spending more time doing crazy stuffs. Thats GTA for all of us D Doing crazy stuffs and doing more exploration. So, lets talk about the characters. Trevor and Michael are the Best Buds Ive ever seen in a video game but with an awkward rage relationship lol, Franklin the son Michael always wanted! One of the most beautiful thing about this game is night which I personally find it so beautiful and so realistic!! What else? Ah the neverending mysteries UFO, Aliens, Unseen Monsters, discovering deep ocean and some creepy noises at 3 A.M will keep you ingame forever, Oh and few Youtubers will make you to play this game over and over again p. The details in GTA V is just amazing and we have to appreciate it and the game is well optimized as I almost run at 60FPS on my laptop which has an i5 Processor and GTX 950m with 12GB Ram. You have to love Rockstars attention to detail! Rockstar predicted every little dumb thing weridos might do.. Youve lots of stuffs to do in game after youve done the story mode. There is more than enough content packed from Collectables, Discoveries, Mysteries  Side Quest Etc. Rockstar didnt at all disappoint us with the latest installment
