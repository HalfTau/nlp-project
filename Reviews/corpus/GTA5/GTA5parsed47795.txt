The game is great  but attacking modders? Misguided, ineffective, offensive, bad for the game as a whole.Shutting down OpenIV wont solve Online hacking. For one, the tool is already in the wild  theres no way to eliminate it entirely. Hackers will simply use their existing copies to build upon.Secondly, the tool was simply coopted into making the process more convenient  the software vulnerabilities that allow malicious actors to alter Online gameplay are intrinsic to the game, not the mod toolkit.I have been the victim of hacking in GTA Online in the past, and I believe that I will not be any safer after the mod toolkit has been shut down. The game is still broken, hackable, exploitable, all to the detriment of the players.
