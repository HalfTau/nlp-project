Totaly of a game. Will not ever buy a rockstar game after this They perma ban you only if you do money cheats which eats into their bottom line they dont like you trying to make fake money like WTF its just a game calm down. Plus i wouldnt need to cheat if these ers actaully made the game fair and not put everything over the top. All they care about is making sure you buy their stupid money cards eventhough you already paid full retail for this I wish i could perma ban people if they dont give me money. Just saying all they care about is money and if you cheat to make it your hurting their profits so watch out. Remeber thisstar making people pay more for somthing wont go well with us and if we have to cheat to make it fair we will. I want you to know i dont give a flying ing pigabout your bottom line cause you have already made your money back and then some on the game alone not including the stupid money cards. So  YOU AND HOPE YOUR ENTIRE COMPANY GOES UNDER AND EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOUR ERS ARE HOMELESS.
