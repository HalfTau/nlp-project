Love the GTA series and loved GTAV singleplayer, but the lack of a singelplayer dlc and the expensive GTA online is just off putting.GTA online is fun with its many gamemodes and missions but it feels design to be grindy as hell in order to get people to by expensive sharkcards which doesnt really give enough money to buy anything.As it is now it just feels like rockstar wants to squeeze as much money as they can out of the gta fans. So dont feel like I can recommend this game as its just too damn expensive to play.
