This is the best online game I ever played. Its very fun to play online with your friends or crew. I havent played a while on steam, but I already played this game  for years on my ps3. I disappointed with rockstargames because i cant transfer my character on my ps3 to steam from social club. But is still recommend this game, its my favorite game. Its sometimes boring but sometimes its very fun too.
