PC gaming is all about modifications. Why? Because the modders are the people who actually play the game. They are the ones who notice the problems in the games design. Even better, they are the ones who fix it..Take Two is trying to destroy that. They ship a broken game, and dont allow the community to remedy that. They complain about hackers in the game, but hackers are only a problem because they have made the money in this gameto get. The root cause of their problems is themselves.Playing GTA Online is a microtransaction filled pile of everyones least favourite emoji. The most expensive of the microtransactions cost. And they have absolutely ruined the balance of the gameplay. You could get a minimum wage job and buy the ingame currency, and have more ingame money than somebody who plays the game. And if youhave an actual IRL job, you probably have the monetary sense to realise that paying for the ingame cash is a complete waste of time, and that you should just keep your earnings or buy a better game.Dont buy this game. You will regret it, just like me and every other reviewer on Steam.
