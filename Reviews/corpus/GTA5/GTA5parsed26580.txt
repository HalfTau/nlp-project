Stripping away from the consumer and limiting the content creativity, attempting to remove the modding comunity is entirely unforgivable. I LOVE mods online and hope modders continue to update mod tools for years to come because I ABSOLUTELY despise rockstar for being greedyand implementing shark cards. It really pisses me off that they try to go after the modders who help us be able to use the stuff that just gets flaunted in out faces, like oh you want a yacht, bunker, or office? Spend 100 real dollers for it on shark cards or go  yourself. Oh you already bought the game 3 times full price for PS3, PS4, AND PC? Too bad you still have to buy shark cards. Words cannot describe the absolute joy of seeing all the overwelmingly negative reviews rolling out for GTAV recently. Stop trying towith us big publishers, because we always win. I hope everyone leaves their Negative reviews, because this was extremely stupid to do in the first place, and you know Publishers will try it again.The power of the PC gamimg community. Consumers win.like this can fly on consoles, but not on PC!
