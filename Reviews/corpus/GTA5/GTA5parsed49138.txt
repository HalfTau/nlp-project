Just jumping on the bandwagon as mods can put new life into games from people who love and cherish the game to put their time and effort into it.  Taking away mods even unofficially and threatening your playerbase with lawsuits, just to make more money on GTO is downright mean.  Also the game was just unplayable for me because it was a crappyport and I dont use my controller enough to care.  I miss san andreas
