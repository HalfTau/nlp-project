Ive heard that Rockstar managed to revive OpenIV from T2, good job.But I have GTA IV, I have GTA V, why cant I play them together?Its not like T2 or Rstar will make it happen anytime soon.Or maybe people should wait for them to make it happen? In that case, dont buy IV or V.Social club is still a stupid thing, tho.
