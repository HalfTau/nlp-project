First of all, why the hell do I need a Rock social club account to play a single player game? The publishers have become so greedy and corrupt as is evident from their actions towards the modding community which barely makes a dent on their profits. Sadly, I already own a PS4 copy and its too late to refund that. Im also planning to cancel my preorder of RDR2. Rock would do well to remember that GTA got popular due to its single player, not because of SHARK CARDS or multiplayer. If I buy one of their games again, it would be a used copy so that these people dont get any more money.
