When people start hacking money into your game because of your ridiculous pay to win business model so you start issuing mass bans to modders and some people who didnt even mod anything they just got money from modders so players start making their own multiplayer outside of your pay to win online service so you send private investigators to their house and shut it down so that way they keep hacking money into your online service so you issue a cease and desist order to a modding tool that is used for single player mods and inadvertently encourage players who want to play your single player game with mods to pirate an older version of your game
