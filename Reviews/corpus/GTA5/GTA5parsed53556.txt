Well what can I say? Honestly not a bad game but TakeTwos absolute abysmal greed is making me write this. No reason to really go into detail, everybody else has already written a review on why. Im just adding to it cause I want to see this game drop massively in rating until they change their damn greedy policy. Though I do want to point out Take2 have sold basically the Same. Exact. Game. 3 different times. Ps3/360, Ps4/XboxOne, and now PC yet even this being in the top 5 for best selling games of ALL TIME, Take2 still isnt making enough money and decides they are the law now and can make whatever their EULA says into law. Well you cant Take2. Go  off you Yeah I am pretty salty about this.
