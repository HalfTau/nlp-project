Great game now that kiddie modders are kept at bay. Kiddie Modders where ruining the online experience then cried when they could no longer spawn money on themselves and forced to pay for shark cards or grind for money the right way. I like cheating too but not when its a community server where people try to play fair and use skill. For example, before I would get a headshot or three on a cheater/modder to find out they had GOD mode enabled.... long story short the modder would teleport to me and even after I would go into PASSIVE MODE the cheating player would still kill me. I rate GTAV 10/10 now that we can play fair.
