the game is so bad improved in terms of stability, i get bunch of problems even from the first time i opened, especially in online, sometimes game could hanging in some kind of loading screen and hella bunch of glitches. so the conclusion is this game have such fun experience in terms of gameplay, but lacking of stability and support from the rockstar itself which makes me not really recommend this game for people that hasnt buyUPDATE7/14/2017the stability in online is getting worse, the overtime rumble mission can suddenly hangs, and i already get it 4x and 2x of them were some kind of cutscene part and for sure all people in the mission have the same problem, the other 2x is the screen hangs but the game itself were stay running, and today just got the worse one, my launcher crashed suddenly when i in a mission, so please rockstar fix your game first especially in online before someone get bad sport because trouble that caused by the game itself and please fix your support, its so lacking on thatUPDATE8/23/2017the online is lacking of stability, the game oftenly only hanging in the freakin loading screen forever and the game still oftenly hanging in story mode loading screen. a simple conclusion is that this game is soin terms of stability
