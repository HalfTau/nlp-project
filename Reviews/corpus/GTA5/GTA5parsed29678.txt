Aside from the stellar singleplayer experience I cannot recommend GTAO, it is horribly mismanaged and rife with cheating because every mission has low payouts for the time spent to encourage the purchase of shark cards Microtransactions to obtain money more conveniently, but there is no semblance of a coherant online experience as it is essentially everybody griefing each other in the open world nonstop or you going into missions for 35 minutes at a time to earn 40K, so save up millions using that method to purchase anything fun or interesting and you have the most boring grind, which is tough to imagine considering its GTA gameplay but somehow they managed to make Grand Theft Auto Online incredibly boring / frustrating / grindy.
