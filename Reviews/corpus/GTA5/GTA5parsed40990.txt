GTA Online is finally playable again! I can not remember the last time I could log in to a session and not get blown up by some modder. It is so nice to see rockstar taking thier products seriously. Can not wait for Red dead 2, and will continue to play until GTA 6.  Thank you so much rockstar for fixing hacking in gta online.
