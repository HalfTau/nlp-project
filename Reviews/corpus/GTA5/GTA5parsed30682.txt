The parent company of Rock Star keeps attacking the modding community of the offline version of the game. All because there were problems with online. Well if they would actually fix their online system and work with these modders to keep their tools from being used to mess with online play there would be no issue. If I could return my game I would at this time. I like the game but I will probably add this company to the list of do not buy.
