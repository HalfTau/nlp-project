This game is great, Online has no issues with hackers From what i have experienced so far. The only issue you will have Is installing LEGAL Mods for Story Mode.If you install the correctly like I have, you have a 50 chance that it will work...I have a Legal modmenu for story mode and it works... I had to download 3 different types of mod menus and only 1 works, I tried getting a zombie mod and that did not work... All the mods are the same version to the game so i has to work but it doesntIf you are not going to install mods and want to play legit, Youll be completely fine with the game, I have seen no issues or problems at all while i have been playing GTA V Story/Online...Please dont be supprized if you run into 1 or 2 hackers in Online as Mod menus are very very easy to install... Just depends if the mod works or not.Im still rating this game a 7/10 as its like console just a little bit different.
