Then in public lobbies people run free with trainers or mod menus. Rockstar refuses to adress this, instead they ban players who are giving themselves money instead of spending their entire paycheck so they can succeded in a game. As a long time RockStar fan, this game was amazing at the start, despite multiplayer being delayed for a bit, then the Heist were promised, and wasnt even delivered till Next gen Or when this game launched on PC. They lie to their fanbase constantly, Is it fun? Yes. It is worth it? Absoutly Not. The single player is amazing, however the multiplayer is just one big flaw in the game. If you still decide to purchase this game. Buy it on a huge sale or somewhere cheaper online, and note that the mutiplayer isnt going to be fun, itss the equivelent of scraping pennies off the floor to pay for college. Thank you for reading.
