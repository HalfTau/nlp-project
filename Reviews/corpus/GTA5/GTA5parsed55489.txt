The single player game is great, the characters are interesting looking at you Trevor, the graphics are good, the storyline is hilarious.The multiplayer is garbage. Its riddled with hackers, the community is extremely toxic, its painfully slow and frequently breaks and the UI and method for connecting with others is absolutely the worst. Add to that the fact that you cant play by yourself or with a group of friends because certain activities require you to be in a public lobby.Its a damn shame MP is so awful, because they genuinely have some neat activities. But when it takes 30 minutes Im being hyperbolical but it is an inordinate amount of time to load and connect, and then has to take another 30 minutes to load and connect every time you want to do something? No thanks. When in game resources cost extravagant amounts of money that you cant readily earn in game and youre constantly reminded that R is willing to sell you in game cash for real money, making this a pay to win title? No thanks. When matchmaking and event lineups barely work, if at all? No thanks. The infrastructure for their multiplayer is awful, even though theyve had four years to fix it.Dont bother wasting your money if you didnt pick this up back when it first came out.
