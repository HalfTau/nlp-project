I didnt like the story, gameplay in the story mode is pretty okay, but compared to GTAIV the story is really weak. After I finished the story I had no motivation to complete the few side missions after the main story.Online play is just a constant grind to get cars or get money for making a company / bike club. If you dont have a friend that owns a company or similar, you wont be really able to get a lot of money in the beginning, which is really frustrating.Performance is decent though, I have a low tier graphics card and CPU and it runs decently45 frames with low / mid options.
