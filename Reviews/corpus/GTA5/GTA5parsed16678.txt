Single player pure awesome. Tied with San Andreas for my favourite GTA. Port is well done, very scalable and modding support is great.However, I do NOT recommend this game to anyone. The only circumstances I would recommend a purchase is on sale. Even then, it was a wrench for me. Buy the physical copy if you can for even cheaper. I am an idiot with no DVD drive.I dont want to beat a dead horse, as many people have listed my complaints far better, so Ill summarize Cancelled single player expansions in favour of milking multiplayer Banhammer for modders who dont cheat in multiplayer Insane multiplayer grind to encourage micro transactions Rockstar making every effort to discourage all forms of modding Rockstar turning their backs on a loyal fanbase to reach for the low hanging fruit casual demographicI am very worried for Red Dead 2.
