I can not recommend a game whos publisher has sush a backwards view on modding that they are willing to send a cease and desist letter to one of the biggest mods for the game. That combined with the companys hevy focus on micro transactions on the multiplayer makes it so I really can not recommend the game, no matter how good it is.
