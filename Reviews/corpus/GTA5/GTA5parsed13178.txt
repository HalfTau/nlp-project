Good and funn game, just expect Loss of ingamemoney due to not working purchases for supplys in your bunker you pay them, but they do not arrive If you get Kicked or loos connection, just in the time after a Mission completion when the Mission Info is still visible you loose your goods and do not get any money. Ah and you get a message that it is bad sports to leave during the mission, even when you not leave by your own will. Continously get killd by other players
