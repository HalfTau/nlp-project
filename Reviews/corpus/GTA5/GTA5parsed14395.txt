I cant remember much of the singleplayer which is probably a bad thing, the multiplayer is fun for a small amount of time but as you get into it you realise you need money to do basically anything fun, the only way to get money is by grinding for an insane amount of time until you get 8 million so you can buy the latest car that just came out or upgrade all your shiny new weapons. if you can find enjoyment in this game after level 100 in mp god bless you and you should probably get your head checked.
