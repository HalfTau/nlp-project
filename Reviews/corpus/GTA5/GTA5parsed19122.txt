This game is for you if youre looking for either,1 A game to kill time while downloading another game.2 Some fun online open world gameplay.3 A good story.Ive played this game for a little while and came to the conclusion that, this game is okay. Ive been playing it since it came out in 2013. The singleplayer is fun, when you play you can pretend youre a hitman and just kill people. Or you can download mods that expand this game to be several more hours, although you cant usually play multliplayer with mods installed so you usually have to delete the mod files if you do want to play online.As far as online goes, you can either play solo and do missions with others and  just get money, or be one of the millions of otherand just run people over, machine gun them to death, and call them names.Either way the story is good.
