GTA itself is great. The developers however could use some work. A great open world sandbox caked under countless hours of grinding just to afford a single car or to spend real money.ProsBeautiful gameStory mode is fun and enjoyableOnline is fun with friendsFreeish DLCConsYou want the new DLC? I hope you enjoy spending 4060 hours unlocking it.Trolls, online mode is filled full of people who enjoy ruininging your experience.Grinding gets repetative after a whileIf I said all this, why do I still reccomend it.Story mode doesnt suffer from these problems, and even with a huge grind playing heists with friends, minigames, or just messing around is worth the cost of the game. Just be warned progression is slow.
