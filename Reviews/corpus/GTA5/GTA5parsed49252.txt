With the removal of mods this game will be uninstalled from my library. I was planning on preordering Red Dead 2 but not with this type of controversy going on. Rockstar and Take Two.... Make this right or forever lose a valuable customer that plays your games on every platform. Seriously so disapointed with the way this was handled. The community obviously thrives and grows off the content you cant be bothered to produce your selves. you Rockstar and Take Two.
