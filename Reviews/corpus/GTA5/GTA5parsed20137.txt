Had GTAV on the xbone and loved it. Got rid of the xbone and recently tried to play this again but it sadly ended up with my refunding of the game. Ill break it downGame content itself is great. Story is funny and serious at times, I think the variation of protagonists is well thought out, and overall I really enjoyed it. However, that wasnt on PC. On PC I never got a chance to play due to more than a few major bugs with this port. Ive heard others having the same issues as I did with the Social Club bug but the fixes never helped and I usually expect AAA games to at least function after download. Im sure there are ways to get around most of the bugs you might encounter, but having played GTAV before, I didnt feel like dealing with it.If you choose to buy this, I hope it runs great for you and you never encounter any issues like I did. I know plenty of people who play with only minor issues which are to be expected these days. However, given the sorry state of my copy, I cannot recommend this game until it can function to a decent degree without a great deal of effort on the buyers part.
