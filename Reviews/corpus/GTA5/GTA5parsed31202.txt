The online part of this game is Its P2W with tons of crappy tactics for microtransactions. They turned it into a ing grind fest which is ridiculous! This aint no damn F2P online game! Wtf are you thinking Rockstar? Its all good when its singleplayer and all but dont get this game thinking Online is all fun and games. No. Id only recommend it for the single player, but big downside of that is that they have now removed OpenIV or modding. Thats some horse  you and your tactics, for trying to Keep cheaters away. Its always been a god damned problem. No one gives a flying . WE paid 60 ing dollars for the game yet you treat us like peasents. Its like giving your fans a big o middle finger to their face saying  you, we dont care of what you think Also whenever you contact their help support they are unpleasent to talk to, no thanks, keep your  support to yourself. Trash, I want my refund.
