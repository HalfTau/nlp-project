I may or may not be addicted to chaos, check hrs. Sure theres hackers and modders, just like any MP game, there are more, but it may be that the devs are more interested in giving us neat concepts to play with.Yes the ingame cash is a cashcow, but there are ways to make money.Play it to mess with stuff, and be messed with. MP is an openworldPVP concept, so its expected to get griefed, just change sessions. If not potato then it doesnt take long.The single player may be a great story, dunno, spent almost all my time in online. But I can say, switch to Trevor from time to time, its worth it.
