The story mode is good. The online portion does have some issues. The modders are almost unbearable. Money making is hard if you find a good method to make money it isnt as bad. There are some glitches that are really bad, I got a raid on my cocaine business and then I fell through the map for a few minutes and then came back up, but I lost a lot of time. You arent forced to buy shark cards I have only bought a couple when it is double money on them. If you find a good money making strategy you can make about 1,000,000 in a little more than 2 hours this is solo if you have more people to play with you can make a lot more money in 2 hours. Would I recommend it, yes to someone who likes having fun and grinding to get money, would I recommend it to someone who just wants to kill people and have fun, no, because you wont be able to afford any of the new stuff and you will get killed by some guy with a sniper rifle that has explosive rounds.
