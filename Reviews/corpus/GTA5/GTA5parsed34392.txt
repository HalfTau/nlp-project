Playing with nearly 600 hours on this game, a month ago I would have recommended it to anyone that would like a sandbox freedom style game, now Take Two Interactive has announced after around three years of the game being out that modding is illegal. They made OpenIV A single player modding software shutdown because of it. I play the game so I can mod and play in single player. I dont play it often because of the multiplayer and the insanely toxic amounts of rage and rudeness in Online. After all of these games that theyve let people mod in single player on then now making it illegal, they will be lucky to have me ever play a single one of their games again. Not cool Take Two... I do not recommend this game. Thanks a lot.
