As somebody who has spent decades playing GTA games and mods, I am highly disappointed at TakeTwos decision on actively attempting to limit or remove modding. The game is... honestly sort of mediocre by my tastes, it hasnt really grabbed me and sucked me in the way San Andreas or even IV has and I really didnt like IV either, but at least there was the potential of mods before that potential no longer legally exists. For this reason I cannot recommend this game for most users the game isnt fun enough, and we cant make it better.
