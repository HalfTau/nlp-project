GTA 5 has gotten too whacky recently.  Its on its way to becoming all the annoying parts of Saints Row.  SR was great but it wasnt serious in the way GTA is, which is fine, but we dont need 2 SR.  And now with the modding to be killed off and only Rockstar developed mods its going get much, much worse.
