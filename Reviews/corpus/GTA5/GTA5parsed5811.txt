Two years ago I was put in bad player pool by a modder after  several weeks of trying to deal with support when they kept closing the unresolved ticket I finally gave up and stopped playing the game. I come back 2 years later to find my account still in bad player pool. I write a new ticket and start getting the same scripted response blaming me and having ticket closed unresolved . This company is disgusting.
