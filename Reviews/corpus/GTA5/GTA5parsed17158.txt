This game would be perfect if it werent for two things1 Horrible matchmaking and connexion problems2 HACKERS.Too bad the latter ruins the game so much that it has become unplayable, and Rockstar has done nothing to solve it appart from raising ingame prices benefits the hackers, since they are the only ones who can afford it and banning innocent people hackers dont get banned because you cant report them, they are untraceable ingame thanks to their hacking menus.Not to mention Rockstar has removed money from most honest players, in last update. It litterally robbed players of hundreds and hundreds of hours grinding for ingame money.Now this game is just a chaotic hacker wasteland.This is the end for me.
