This game contains graphics of men, women, monsters, animals, or all of the aboveor something else! There is a main objective you must complete before moving onto other parts of the game, at which point it may or may not become a little bitmore difficult.This game uses a mouse, keyboard, a combination of the two, or perhaps a gamepad.Either way, you have to control something, whether its the main character or theenvironment, in order to complete goals to beat or, at least, complete thegame.Yep, Theres things on the monitor when I start up the game. That must surelymean that it has graphics. They may be good or bad, youll have to judge that foryourself.7.5/10 I recommend it because its a game.
