This game is amazing. The singleplayer will be talked about for years and sets a standard for what a Rockstar game is. There is so much stuff to do in this game.GTA Online is also extremely fun expect when you have MODDERS/HACKERS killing you for no reason just to screw with you. They have added so much content to the game since its release. All of it free. You dont have to buy shark cards. You can make a decent amount of money doing missions or just rolling with some friends.
