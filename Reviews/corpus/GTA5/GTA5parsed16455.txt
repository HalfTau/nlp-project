Its a shame because the game is really fun to play with friends but the online is becoming flooded with modders. What is even worse is that those that are getting punished arent really the modders but the innocent players who got money from them or even random players. I lost 2.6M even though I never received illegitimate money. I tried their support but like many players told, they dont even bother to read your ticket and only copy and paste a response that merely fits your problem.
