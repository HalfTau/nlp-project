I bought this game on 2015. I havent played before, just watched videos on youtube and friends talking about. When i bought it, i had a bad pc that could barely handle the game, but i had so much fun in the campaing and in online. But in the past months, the online experience became a terrible time. They make us spend too much time or too much money on overpriced things, that on every dlc gets more expensive.If you wanna buy this game for the singleplayer, go ahead, its one of the best games I played so far. But if youre looking to player online, buy another, because at this point of the game, you be facing hackers almost every time, and still will be just loggin in to farm money without having fun.Ps sorry for the bad english D
