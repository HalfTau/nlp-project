 you, take two. Modding is a staple of the PC gaming community. Back in the 90s through early 2000s, most devs were  cool with modding, and the ones that were cooler about modding encouraged it. The coolest of the cool handed the keys to the game the tools or even the source, to the community. Notice how the franchises that did that are still celebrated and loved today. Just look at the original Doom. Look at the Unreal franchise. The community was the lifeblood, and thats no different for you. Unfortunately, we all saw your moneygrubbing with GTA Online but passively put up with it. If you cant respect your players, then we cannot respect you. We should boycott your company into the ground, but youre lucky that the general public are saps. You wont get my money, but thats a drop in the bucket.
