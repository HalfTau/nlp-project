I regret the money and most of the time spent on this game. The singleplayer is uninspiring and multiplayer is a grindfest dependant on playing with friends to find any fun. Basic UI is unfunctional and frustrating. The first GTA I put decent time into and it will take drastic change before I buy another.Also Take Two is a dishonest, greedy, anticonsumer group I have no intention of ever giving money again.
