I enjoyed this game a lot ESPECIALLY online play...I played 100s of hours online and slowly grinded heists and BOY was it a grind to get to the point that I owned everything by lvl 130. I was running low on money and started the grind again and ran across a modder who was giving away ingame . I decided hey, what harm could there be in gettin a bit of money right?, WRONG. After all that grinding and playing legitimately BOOM. Im banned for a month and all characters progress is deleted/reset. Are you in kidding me? I placed a support ticket but the only thing they seem to do is copypaste their policy. It took me about a year to calm down from the ban and to not be so salty about it, just to come back to the game and get thrown into servers with 20 modders in it and each of them blowing up the server and spawning characters and cars in my apartment. SolidA work there rockstar. Ban the legitimate players who decide to not grind for money for another couple 100 hrs, but allow the modders run rampant.TLDR  Rockstar is a bunch of greedy fucls who endorse modders.
