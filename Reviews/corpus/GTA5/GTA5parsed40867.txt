Lets start with the fact that instead of shutting down the TRUE HACKING TOOLS, they Take2 Interactive did shutdown OpenIV which is a programm that was in development for almost 10 years, to only later on shut those down, so theyre image doesnt suffer that much after this fiasco. OpenIV made it a lot easier for people to install a diversity of mods.And at the moment OpenIV is the only tool available out there that is able to open the encrypted .rpf files, without it Modding is reduced to a fantasy since the files cant be accessed and is illegal. For me as machinima producer it closed a lot of doors and possibilities.A lot of the people who bought GTA V on PC did it for the mods and  not for GTA Online. Maybe if it wasnt for GTA Online we wouldnt be here in this situation. I blame the Shark Cards. GTA O has become a grind, you will see your self repeating the same Heists over and over again to just get a little , thats a thought out thing by Take2 so you buy their Shark Cards intead. At the beginning you got a lot more  out of doing missions but now its a ridiclous grind. Its a shame to see how grindy companies like Take2 and R which I respected but not anymore. They took down the last thing that made me enjoy GTA. Damn I miss the days of modding GTA San Andreas and IV, it was so much fun trying out things like the Big Foot mod, Iron Man Mod, Map conversions,..etc. Microtransaction are ruining the gaming industry, developers are getting greedier by the day. Thats why I only respect CD Projekt Red, theyre one of the last enthusiast studios out there who are down to earth.Its Doomsday for the GTA Modding communityThank You very much Take2 Interactive and Rockstar Games for buring your TRUE CORE fans.
