Tried to play the game I just spent 60 hours downloading, only to find that rockstar wont let me access the game I paid for through a service which incorporates DRM and a log in system without also logging in to their own pointless rockstar social club I then attempted to log in through a newly created rockstar social club account and was told I couldnt use that new account, as my steam account has been permanently tied to the rockstar social club account my housemate used to play max payne 3 on my pc seven years ago.After an inordinate amount of faffing, I finally found the link on the rockstar support page which lets you send an actual message to the support team, and am now eagerly awaiting the moment they permit me to finally play the game I bought almost a week ago nowUpdate rockstar support will allow me to unlink the old rockstar social club account from my steam account BUT in doing so, they will block all accounts involved from playing the copy of GTA V I just purchased, even though I specifically didnt click I agree to the key linking pageUpdate 2 after several days back and forth, I was finally allowed to play the game I bought a week earlier
