Banning mods is not acceptable we pay good money for these games and limiting the creativity and fun from the game for more money is criminal, developers please look at yourselves you USED to be a respectable game developer but obviously your just another EA not buying any more of your games or crappie in game micro transaction currency. GOODBYE!
