Take Two have really ruined the game for most people due to the Open IV situation. Modding completely removed... They didnt think about all the players that play singleplayer with the mods. Without these mods the game is dead.I worked hard for lvl 178 and had almost 7 million all for nothing. I got banned for 30 days because a modder dropped cash  on me. After the 30 day ban was up my whole account got wiped and i had to start fresh. They need to revert back to the gta with mods otherwise the community will die.
