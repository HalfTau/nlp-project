ProsBasically the entire story modeThe story mode is well balanced, the missions are great and there are goals to reach for  e.g 100 completionThe missions are replayable and enjoyable.The prices for things actually make sense.The characters and random AIsThe clothing and carsThe radio stations. I dont think theres a single radio station i dont love, theyre all great and made to seem like a real radio station my favorites being Rebel Radio, Soulwax FM, Radio Mirror Park and West Coast ClassicsThe FREEDOM and POSSIBILITY. There is so much to do that even single player can keep you occupiedAll the little things that are determinant, including the end reward.ConsBasically the entire online mode.Overwhemingly overpriced... everything.Horrible and glitched matchmaking. Like when i try to play a specific race or something itll out me in something completely different. Do youu want to host seeing how we couldnt find your desired game? Sure! Okay  you heres a completely different game that someone else is hosting Togglers hackers/cheatersGreifers. I knoe this is GTA but it gets really ing annoying when theres a greifer. Sometimes its fun to be one but sometimes people should just find something else. Ive been forced to find new games all because I couldnt exit a building or customize my character which i was trying to do. Also passive mode is terrible.Boring missions that barley reward.UNFAIR BAND  if there is a mod on your computer you can get banned and a perma delete of your character. I got my character of a couple years from PS3 deleted because of a story mode mod. For now on Im sticking to clothing and other appearance mods.I am going to recommend GTA V but it is a very light recommendation.Keep in mind my scoreStory  89/10Online 3/10
