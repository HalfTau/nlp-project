Where can I start? Probably one of the most greedy games of all times, it live up to the Los Santos culture and ignorance. The game by itself is fine, fun and addictive but what really  it up is the way Rockstart have decided to handle everything just to play the game. The single player of the game for example is not even called single player but Story mode, this may seem like nothing to you but the point is that they pretty much havent changed the single player since release, while they keep updating the online with overpriced vehicles, houses, bunkers and more trying to force people to spend money on the game or grind for 100 hours just to buy the good stuff, and did I say this things are only available online? Yes online because everything in the game requires online even if you want to play single player, have a slow connection? Well I have bad news for you but you may not be able to play the game at all because youre forced to sign in to Rockstart social club just to play.The game by itself is good, everything else isnt.
