Dont let the hours deceive you, I put way more hours into this flaming pile of dog excrement than Id like tho admit.I will start off with the story, its been praised as one of the best game stories and open world in recent history although I can see why people might see it this way I didnt.Ive now tried getting through the story 2 times I just cant get further than the first 2 hours before I turn it off it honestly doesnt appeal to me I guess its just not my type of game.The multiplayer is where the real drama starts. The first few hours are a lot of fun if you play with friends the monthly updates always have plenty of content in them to keep you busy for a while and add a lot of new vehicles every time but thats where the fun ends most missions are bland and grindy and to get the vehicles you have to spend a absurd amount of money which you can only get by replaying the missions over and over again its clear that the developers want to sell their digital way of earning money called shark cards. Shark Cards are basicly the modern scumbag equivalent of money cheat codes, not to mention that these shark cards are stupid expensive.If that isnt the biggest issue with the game it will be the hackers. In almost every online lobby you join there will be a hacker some friendly most scumbags that ruin the game for others by killing you over and over again or trapping you inside something untill theyre bored.If you want help from Rockstars Support you wont find any on their site or social media its filled with automated responses you are better off just waiting the problem outThe game is a huge mess right now and not worth the money they ask for it, if you really want the game I am not stopping you but I would say wait till Rockstar actually gives aabout their playerbase,
