The game itself is a beautifull work of art. Optimized to the assembly level to give even old/potato PCs a chance to run this baby at FPS and graphical levels above console peasants sorry, had to take a jab there XD. The story is incredible, the world is absolutely stunning, the characters are mostly deep and make sense, and there are countless refrences to pop culture and 4th wall braking gallore if you pay attention.The online part isnt that great, there really isnt much to do besides fk around with your buddies and do repetitive missions and races untill you get so bored, that you start finding races with loopdeloops and that other BS fun. The only redeeming aspect of Online, are the heists, those are quite fun, but again, there are only a handfull 5 or 6 I believe?.But it cannot go without mentioning that Take2 and Rockstar to a smaller extent is milking the Online cow waaaaaaaaaay too far. The Shark cards and the microtransactions are plain cash grabs, and just add inflation to the game, which in part makes making money a grind if you dont want to spead REAL money. Ugh Of course I get that this was the most expensive game ever to develop, and they are a business, so they have to make ends meet but after almost 4 years on the market, still being sold for only 17 less than original price without sales of course, youd think that they might not need to resort to greedy and unnecesary cash grabs to fill their  quotas. There is just no excuse for such greediness.Oh, and lets not forget about the massive neon pink elephant in the room the Cease and Desist given by Take2 o OpenIV. Its another case of a big company waving their mone dk around, intimidating the little guys, and ultimately affecting the end user. Even though they apologized, its just more evidence that they dont care about the user and only see them as a  with legs. Scummy.
