And I thought nobody could disrespect modders more than Bethesda.But seriously, the only reason why older GTA Games especially San Andreas and IV are even playable anymore is because of modders. Not only that, but mods exponentially increase the games replayability.I really like GTA V even if recent updates are making GTA Online much worse, but I cannot support Take Twos actions.
