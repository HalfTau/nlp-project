What can I say? .... ITS GTA! !The games awesome... total freedom to race, travel, fly, swim around a large map and kill npcs, players, animals and destroy a bunch of stuff. Lots of stuff to do and quite a grind to become a mogul but its fun. Always loved the GTA games even from the 1st one.That being said....Modders are pieces of sht who have no life and need to stop fcking with players because its a dck move when they cant die. I hope R is able to ban every MP modder idc able ppl modding the SP storymode since it doesnt affect others.
