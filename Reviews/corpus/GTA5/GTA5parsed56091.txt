This is a fantastic game, and one of my favorites in the past few years. However with their recent acctions against modding, even modding the single player, by sending a cease and desist to OpenIV, means I will no longer be supporting Take Two or Rockstar from this point forward, unless they issue a formal appology and officially retract this action.
