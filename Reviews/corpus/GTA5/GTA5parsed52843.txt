Right down the line Its really disgusting how GTA V is treating its community. A great Pity. Take Two.. you are ruining the players fun at playing this game, its just obvious how you are grinding the last penny out of this game. The playerbase is hopefully going to shrink. Pay to win has finally taken over our loved GTA.Im currently not recommending to play GTA V  GTA V Online
