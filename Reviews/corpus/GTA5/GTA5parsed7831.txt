Buy on sale.. is all I can say. Modders everywhere, changing your level and giving you money you dont ask for when you try to be as legit as possible.. and those modders are the nicer ones. Some of them will spawn a lot of big boats on your head, which will nonstop colide with the world and make you lag, before your game crashes..
