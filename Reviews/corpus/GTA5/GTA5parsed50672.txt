Well Take 2 has for now reversed there decision on going after mods and OpenIV so I figured Id go ahead and change my review to be more open and honest.Not really much to say really. Its fun and good graphics, also quite a bit of sandbox goofiness the thing is, it can get a little confusing trying to find what to do next in the story and please, do NOT go online as its just not worth it. At all! Online mode is little more than a shark card selling machine.If you can find it on a good sale, grab it.
