Take2 setting the lawyers on modders like rabid dogs. Modders who added value to their product, through love and asking nothing in return. The whole point of this charade is Take2 wants all your money. Not just some, not just a lot, all of it. So the response should ultimately be give them nothing.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, if you really must play it, find another way  borrow/buy a second hand copy on console so T2 and R get nothing, the experience will be mostly the same anyway since mods are all but banned.
