A fresh install. I launch it for the first time. Social club starts loading and it says auto sign in failed. I have NEVER linked my steam account to a social club account because I dont get the chance for that. It should pop up if you launch GTAV for the first time, but for me, it never pops up. YOU, STEAM say I have to contact rockstar support, but it is you who are not giving me the chance to link it to Social club. I have reinstalled everything multiple times but again, I dont get the chance to create a social club account as soon as I start the game. You cant link a social club account to a steam profile, you can only link your steam to a social club account. If I fill in my game code at the Social club site, it says its already used by steam ofcourse But AGAIN I dont know the social club account that steam has, because I never had the chance to create one, I can say it 100 of times and if I search online I get people who want to UNLINK their steam from social club, But I dont want to unlink, I never had the chance to link it at all!ing help me and Ill delete this review. If you still read this review then remember this ING NEVER BUY THE GAME WITH ING STEAM WHO SAYS GO TO ROCKSTAR IF YOU NEED SUPPORT, while the blame is all on steam who doesnt give me a chance to create a social club account0.0000001 / 10
