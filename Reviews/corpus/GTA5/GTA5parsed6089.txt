One of best sp experiences you can get, also one of the worst mp game. There is always at least 1 cheater in every session and ptw noobs terrorizing your game with jets and there is no other tools for stopping those jets other than other jets lock on missiles are just crap so you etiher grind hundreds of hours to buy a hangar and jet or getby some morbidly obese chinese hacker or a spoiled 12 year old kid. GTA Online is just a big dissappointing pile of its not different than CoD, a ptw blackhole. But note that these apply only for mp, sp is awesome but after seeing rockstars  handling of game i wouldnt bother to buy it and just download cracked one.
