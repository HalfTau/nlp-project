Its a decent game but unfortunately the publishers are screwing it over, they have a habit of threatening everyone who makes any tools for the game with legal action even if it doesnt affect the core online experience. I feel a bit sorry for Rockstar as its most likely not their fault, but I cant recommend buying the game and funding that sort of behaviour.
