I had been debating for a while if i should buy GTA5 for the 3rd time for my pc since I built a new one. I did some research into modding the game and the mods sold me on it so i shelled out another 60 for the game, however after owning it for only a month take two killed the mod support and now the game is just the same thing I played 3 years ago. I really wish i could get a refund so I could spend my money on something else instead of this.....
