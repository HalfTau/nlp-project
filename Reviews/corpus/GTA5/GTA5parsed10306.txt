Well Grand Theft Auto has been around enough that most of us know almost a lot about the franchiseSo whats good about this particular one you ask ?..well first ask your steam friends coz am sure at least 2 out of 10 people you know own it could be more not lessThe Game PlayWell this iteration of GTA is a mix of goodies from older iterations it even grabs some perks from Red Dead Redemption,driving is not as tough as it was on GTA IV in game population interaction like Read Dead Redemption Role playing and character build up youll like the most of itStory/Plot No SpoilersThis time around its based on three characters not just one and just like every GTA iteration you dont just start from scratch building an empire its just different for each character you can interact in between characters in game or even switch to your own online character,Story is great I personally like the GTA4 one,but this one is not bad or boring either I feel like ending it again and again and game environment also place a part in it because it is the bestGraphicsGraphics are amazing they really nailed it Los Santos was not as fun looking in San Andreasjust the Los Santos part as it is now graphics of this game make it very addictive especially the Game environment is best ever on any GTA gameRequirementsWell most of GTA games have been tough on GPU and Hardware side of things but still Ill say compared to GTA 4 this one seems well Optimized to me although stil you need a good gaming rig for 4k UltraGTA Onlinehere comes the best part I recommend every user to at least buy this game for GTA Online,Unlike FPS games High Speed internet is recommended but not mandatory yes youll spend longer time in Loading screen but once you are in a session swapping sessions joining missions is not a big deal I have personally tested it on a 4mb and 2mb network even on evey traffic ,The online features are great you can build a character and start from scratch like any GTA story mode and work for other players or earn from missions plan heists but cars apartments and the best part is unlike story mode or any GTA game before your car if insured wont be lost if left on map it can even be claimed if blown or wrecked ,wish they implemented this in Story Mode
