Honestly, ignore all the bad reviews. Its a fine game. Though online seems more like a f2p game at times, its mostly only if you want 100 of everything on online mode. Since they revoked the cease and desist from single player mod supports and OpenIV I dont believe that all of the bad reviews are really necessary anymore. Though i do recommend buying it only when it is on sale. 60 dollars isnt quite worth the amount of content you get.
