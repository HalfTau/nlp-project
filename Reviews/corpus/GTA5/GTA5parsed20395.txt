Hell, GTA V, AAA game  Amazing game  S h i t t y company with positive reviews. The company makes a whole load of bad decisions, but it does not affect anything people care about, so no one gives a damn, pertaining to the fact one skin can cost as much as the whole game, but ah who careswhen they should. The next GTA VI game will be free D, everyone will be happy, but it will cost 42 a day to play with no single player, and no one will give a damn. But, when they start messing with the modding community oh ! hell no!. An undoubtedly undisputedly supported 100 pile of s h i t company Rockstar Games creates a AAA pile of s h i t and its praised as long as its GTA. The gaming community has become autistic, subnormal, and defective I do not know how this would be applicable to a human, but its 2017 I am sure some SJWs Social Justice Warrior have found a societal way of using made up, political, or grammatically incorrect words.
