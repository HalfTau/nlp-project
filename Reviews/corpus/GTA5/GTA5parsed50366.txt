I played this on PS3 back around the time it was released. Got about 300 hours extraThe singleplayer story mode is pretty fun to play. Just like any other GTA game. But the multiplayer part is why I am giving this a thumbs down. I occationally meet hackers/cheaters. They are immortal, can one punch you, fly like superman, and what not. Mainly they seem pretty chill, and likes to hang around and have fun, but when its one of those who abuse their powers then its hecking annoying getting insta killed every time you respawn.Also, if you play with a female character, prepare to get sexually harrassed by lonely, creepy guys.
