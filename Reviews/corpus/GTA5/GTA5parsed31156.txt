Beyond the fact that T2 hates mods and the PC community, along with everything else that has happened over the past several weeks, the game is unstable and frequently stops responding on many systems.If you search online for errors, youll get a range of suggestions ranging from verifying integrity of game cache doesnt work, running with administrative privileges doesnt work, reinstalling the game also doesnt work, I dont mod either, to... lol, get this... enabling compatibility mode for Windows Vista! I kid you not. It actually seems to help people in some situations. I thought it helped me until the errors continued a few days later.These errors have been going on since 2015, so apparently R hasnt been able to or hasnt tried to fix them. I have suffered these stopped working errors on multiple machines with different configurations. Because of them I have never been able to beat the SP game on PC without getting frustrated and playing something else. I dont even want to know how bad MP is.So yeah, spend your money on something else.
