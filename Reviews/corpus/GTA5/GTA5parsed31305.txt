It was enjoyable for the first few weeks or so, before the fun slowly began to deteriorate until only a cocktail of boredom and disappointment remained. GTA Online today is just a nest of exploitation for hackers, jumped up wnkers in supercars who mow you down like a rabbit, and the overshadowing reminder that Rockstar failed to get the stock market running and then blamed it on their fan base. As for singleplayer, the storyline is above average but the gameplay gets repetitive and Lester is annoying.
