An amazing game that gives players the option to play even Online how they want to. Me and my friend can play this by ourselves and screw around with no fear of ppl flying by and trying to destroy our faces while we decide we want to do our own stupid shennanigans. Tons of content still being released for Online and the singleplayer is engaging and a pretty impressive legnth.
