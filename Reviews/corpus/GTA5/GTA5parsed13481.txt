Best selling game amazing 10/10Yeah the game is pretty, but if you compare it with other Rockstar games is very lacky, just looking at the predecesor, GTA IV had a lot more mechanics in the world that made it feel more real, also a better story.This game you are probably going to enjoy for a while, maybe not finish the story but if you have friends you are going to use most of your time in multiplayer despite of the millions of hackers in every server.But the main reason of this negative review is Rockstars horrible practices about this game, like changing the games price in big sales to not change the final price, or only making a bundle available to avoid refunding in case people want to do that, complete hate towards the moding community that had done some amazing things for this game, going to the point of even banning people even if they play in singleplayer, and never forget the horrible microtransactions that are the shark cash cards
