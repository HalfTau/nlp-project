Great game sad to see the ratings go down so much though. the single player mode is great a lot to do. the multiplayer is great IMO sure modders have pretty much ruined gta online but there is so much more to do, and people dont know how to make money anymore all they care about is getting modders to put in billions for them. Its sad but theres no stopping it. but as i said there is so much to offer that can get you to put hours into. ive played the game since it came out and bought it on every system that could offer it and i can say for sure theres still things that i havent discovered. As i said before its sad to see all the ratings go down is because if they make 1 mistake theyre whole rep gets ruined. It shouldnt be that way and people should look more into the things that Gta 5 and gta 5 online has and stop wasting there time on 1 slip up.
