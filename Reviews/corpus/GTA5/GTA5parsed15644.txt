First Rockstar removes the ability to mod single player. I understand their reasoning behind it, even though I do not agree with it one bit. To prevent online cheating, ok. Fine. But that can STILL be done while allowing other mods in single player.Now, they have STRIPPED money from accounts including mine. Money that was EARNED. NOT BY EXPLOITING OR CHEATING!As of now, I am done with Grand Theft Auto, Im done with Grand Theft Auto Online and I am DONE with TakeTwo Interactive!I had actually planned on purchasing Red Dead Redemption 2 for the PS4, but now Ive decided against it as I refuse to give this company any more of my HARD EARNED CASH.All of my gameplay time is on my other Steam account
