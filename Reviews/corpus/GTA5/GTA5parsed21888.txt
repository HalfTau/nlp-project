I think the other reviewers are full of crap. I had this for ps3, and loved it. However i got bored with it because i didnt want to switch back and forth from tv to ps3 all the time for the social network crap. Now, as for the modding thing, Im glad there finally doing something about all those crappy mods and hackers out there. I dont want my game experience ruined because some idiot decides to dump 5mill on my head like they did on the ps3 version. Its to easy to easy for people to beg and beg, and it gets annoying fast. The ps3 version i beat with in 24 to 48 hours, thats how good it was for me. For pc, its changed quite a bit, and for the most part for the better. You for one get paid more, you also have more stable hiests, and you can actually use a keyboard to chat. This is a major bump up then people annoyoing you with voice spamming music, or stupid idiotic squeakers throwing around weird screamer music and annoying you. Yes they had mute, and change the voice to friends or crew only, but that defeats the purpose of having a global chat room.Anyway, yes after buying it on sale i would reccomend it. I would not buy this game though again unless it is on a sale like  this. for a first time game, you would get your moneys worth for 50.
