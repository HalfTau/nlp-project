the single player is awesome!!the multiplayer would be awesome if it were more balanced and wasnt blatantly trying to sell over priced shark cards.the multiplayer missions just dont pay out enough and everything in game is over priced.  so its baisically a marketing ploy to sell in game currency but the game has a lot of potential to be great.  rockstar got greedy with this one, and turned into a grind fest or spend a fortune on in game currency just to blow through.  it has the potential to be fixed really simply if they marked down in game prices or the shark cards themselves to give the consumer their moneys worth
