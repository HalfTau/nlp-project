First time having to bother reviewing something.Basically the same as being said elsewhere. Rockstar took my cash despite the fact that I dont play public games, only play with family or alone and have in no way been in contact with modded money. They even have the nerve of advertising their Shark Cards real money payments for in game cash after taking my money away.They refuse to acknowledge the issue, close tickets with bot responses and wont reply to tweets regarding the issue.Do not buy the game until this issue is fixed, you run the risk of your in game cash being removed.Heres a forum thread with hundreds of people having the same issueA properly disgusting situation considering I went out of my way to avoid modders in game.
