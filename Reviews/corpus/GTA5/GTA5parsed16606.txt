Before the recent update Smugglers Run, v 1.41 Rockstar took legitimatly earned money out of the accounts of my two mates I play with. Support just replies with copy past answer. I searched the internet and found out many more had the same problem. Legitimate money got taken away by Rockstar, while hackers still have a quazillion dollars.And now, they are offering everybody 15 more money when buying a 75 Sharkcard.Also, with this update, you can finally buy the P996 Lazer, for 6.500.000 Ingame . With tuning and the cost for a hangar which is necessary to be able to buy the Lazer, you are looking at around 9.000.000 Ingame, Thats OVER 75  OF REAL MONEY. These DLCs are no longer free.
