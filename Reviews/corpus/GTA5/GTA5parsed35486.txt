Grand Theft Auto V was pretty much that game that pretty much freed me of my bordem. Playing it on console was nice and all, playing through the story a bunch of times but eventually I got bored of it. So once I bought this game on PC, I was thinking Its just gonna be the same process over again so why not spice up the experience with a few mods. So pretty much I was trying out addon vehichles, trainers Menyoo more specifically, and just simply goofing around. But one day I was planning on adding a favorite car in the game and OpenIV needed an update. I was actually hyped about it until I saw the message of OpenIV being forced to stop the project due to T2 cease and desist letter. I somewhat cried after seeing that mostly because it felt like my fun experience was simply taken from not only me but from many of the players who were also cranking up their fun on GTA V. So until I can have fun once again on GTA V, Im not changing my review and Im not gonna uninstall OpenIV until justice is served.
