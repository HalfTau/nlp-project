Everyone was hating on this game for Online being hacked and singleplayer mods being taken away but its a great game. Never saw any of that and I could care less about the three mods people use in singleplayer. The story is great just as much as the characters in it and the online experience is very fun with all the jobs you can complete with a crew plus all the fun events that happen time to time. Overall the game looks great, plays great, and is just a work of art.
