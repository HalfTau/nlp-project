this game has a great story mode if you want to buy it for it then i suggest waiting for 50 sale .. the online in this game is a complete disaster while yes the online has many great ideas and they sound great on paper put when you come to play online it is completly different, everything is way too expensive and thats because they want you to buy their over priced shark cards which results in a game crawling with cheaters , modders in this game are every where i cannot play a session without comming across one, even when completing missions they ruin the fun some guy teleports to you while youre doing a vip mission kills you then steals the item, you go to play deathmatch and all of the sudden some guy on the other team is invincible, hell i was playing 2 minutes ago and some guy started teleporting to me to kill me over and over ..
