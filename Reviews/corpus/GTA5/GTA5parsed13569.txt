Extremely advanced game, this game has so many features and small details, Im not sure how they did it, but it mustve been very difficult. it is also pretty fun, lots of people with different interests would like this game. You can do races, missions, story mode, just mess around, and so much more. This game is 4 years old and still getting updates and events, still one of the best games out there. However, some of the gameplay can be repitive and tens to get old. There are also a lot of hackers in online mode which either  with you or give you free money, which can make grinding seem pointless. Also one minor, but notable issue, is that the voices of characters in cut scenes dont match their lips very well. That isnt something I would base buying the game off, but just something to know.
