Nearly everything about the singleplayer game is fun, until you beat it and theres nothing to do except for modding. Before the idiotic actions of Take 2. Ill get to that later. GTA online is awful. Microtransactions, hacking, and spawnkilling rid it. I only bought this version of the game for some of the nextgen bonuses and modding. Let me get this straight Rockstar DIDNT take down OpenIV. They have no problem with modding and they have even promoted modding, but not on GTA online. A couple of days ago, the OpenIV team got a cease and desist from Take 2. OpenIV is probably the biggest modding tool for GTA. Now, GTA V modding is practically dead. There were entire channels dedicated to GTA modding, and now they might go homeless. I think that the actions that Take 2 have made are awful. Post more negative reviews if you despise these actions like I do. Make people notice that modding is big with pc players, and not to mess with it.  Take 2.EDIT Rockstar released a statement about OpenIV and first off, its not true, and second, it makes me believe that Rockstar actually caused this. So,  R and Take 2.EDIT 2 Now Menyoo and something else has been shut down. Menyoo was slightly deserved because it did effect online a bit, but I had Menyoo and I never used the online features. I still dont support Rs and Take 2s actions.EDIT 3 Its all over. OpenIV is back and running, and Take 2 have retracted their cease and desist. I am switching this review to positive later, and changing the statements I said before. I still think that these actions were stupid, but they have learned from their mistakes. I still hate the shark cards. A quick tip dont buy them. But I still like this game, so I am going to play theout of it.
