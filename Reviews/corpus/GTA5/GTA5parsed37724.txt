Mods are responsible for some of the greatest advancements in PC gaming. Take Twos cease and desist to try to end modding is a slap in the face to so much of what we as gamers take for granted. Its an insult to the community, to fellow developers, and to the platform itself.I love Grand Theft Auto, but to continue supporting this in the face of such actions would be hypocritical. Bullying modders is a very, very wrong thing to do.Dont give your money to a publisher who is trying to fundamentally undermine gaming. Dont buy Grand Theft Auto V.
