Cant believe they discontinued OpenIV. The only reason people glitch and hack online is because you make it impossible to earn money, if youre having fun online, you are definately not making money. You are losing it.Edit I know Open IV is back up but it was a dumb move by Take two, the main rant about this post is how much GTA Online is trying to suck money from our wallet.
