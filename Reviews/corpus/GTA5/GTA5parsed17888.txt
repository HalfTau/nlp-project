Single player  It gud.Online  It no gud. Overpriced items. Microtransactions. Mindnumbing grind system. Hackers and modders everywhere.Only buy if you want a good single player experience.If you want a good multiplayer experience, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Its ing attrocious online.Optimization is gud too.Given the single player experience, this game is really only worth like 3040 now. Having it still be 60 is disgusting.
