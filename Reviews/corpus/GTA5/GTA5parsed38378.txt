The base game was fine and all, but mods just made it so much better. Shutting it down out of no where was such a poor business move on Taketwos part. I assume it was to force online play so that people would buy their over priced shark cards so that they dont have to grind forever for some littlemobile with their very basic and boring missions.They could of done so much with the online but instead they decided to go a very uncreative route and turn it into something like an MMO but without the Massive part while also keeping the same amount of grinding.Would not reccommend until they fix their hopefully their will realize all the negative reviews and how bad they ed up with this little stunt
