Oh Take Two. You really ed Rockstar. Youve made plenty off this game. Your fan base only really sticks around BECAUSE of mods to be honest And the free updates, which are usually only OBTAINABLE by modding money because it is REDICUOULSLY expenseive. Oh well. I was banned a few months ago anyway,  good thing I did not buy another copy! See? You could of had me buy the game AGAIN instead of banning mods. Shame. SHAME!
