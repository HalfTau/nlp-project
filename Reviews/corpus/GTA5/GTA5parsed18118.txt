Bought the game on a different account which basically locked my game to that account only. Theres no way to play the game from this one since they ask me for a new product key. If i try to log into my social club account that has the game redeemed on it from this account, the game rejects my login credentials even when they are 100 correct and just reseted the password to a new one by saying theres been a problem with the log in information. Then youre sent back to enter a valid and new product key.Great ing job, Jewstar. Im not about to give these scum another 3060.
