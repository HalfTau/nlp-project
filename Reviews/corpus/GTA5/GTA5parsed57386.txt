Thanks T2 for killing the modding community. I believe that if I buy something I should be able to do WHATEVER I want with it, after all its MY money I spent.Im not a multiplayer guy, so a good SP campaign with lots of content is key to me, and dont get me wrong, GTA V is a good and entertaining game but it seems like theyre only adding more content for GTA O. With Take Two essentially killing  modding in one move I think its over for me. I dont want to spend real money just to have some fun in a buggy multiplayer game.Besides, what if other games developers start doing this same thing on their games?
