Hey Take two,  you. The game is insane, your multiplayer is really great, im enjoying it as well as alternative multiplayer FIVEM. I also enjoyed playing on singleplayer more and more hours, even after getting all the achievements. And you know why i was still playing singleplayer story mode ? because i ing modded it..! LSPDFR, car models, scripts etc etc... These mods were develloping so fast and so good and there you shut them down for nothing ??? something that doesnt even reach multiplayer ?3 Rockstar, F Take two.DO SOMETHING, youre getting hated from your community and im sure youre losing more and more players.And btw, openIV supported you by not allowing cracked version to be modded. but you just stabbed your friends from behind. What a shame.MODDER/HACKER or those ing online modders that simply use menus.... please learn the difference..Oh i forgot   you.
