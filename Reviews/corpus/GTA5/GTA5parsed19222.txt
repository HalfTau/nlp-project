GTA V is a great game. I owned the game on console, before I picked it up on PC. My chief complaint is the multiplayer hackers, and is why I do not recommend. Literal hacking, as in teleporting, spawning in objects, spawing money etc. It is not rare either there is a minimum of one per lobby. Rockstar has utterly failed to combat hacking, so if you go into GTA Online be prepare to have a hacker have your fun killed.
