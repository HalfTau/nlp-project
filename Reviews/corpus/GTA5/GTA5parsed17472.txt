This is a great game, tons of great content and amazing physics, I end up just driving for hours because of how well they have made the driving experience.  This game has hundreds of hours of replay ability, thousands even.  If youre willing to put in the time to unlock the content.Slowly, they have been adding more and more content and gradually making everything more expensive, they finaly add a way to make a decent amount of money/ hour but it is extreamly repetative and honestly kinda boring after months of it. But thats not why Im writing this review.Im writing this because Rockstar has decided that they can/ will take your money whenever they want.Ive been grinding away at the Import/ Export missions for a few months, getting my bunker going ect..  Ive been in servers with modders but I havent received money from them in almost a year been killed by them though..., and my money was adjusted shortly after.  After months of grinding I login to find that my money has been adjusted, in the days leading upto smuggers run, Rockstar took 2.4 m and left me with 150k.I love this game, I want to keep playing,  but now Im afraid becasue it seems being in a lobby with a modder is enough that I may lose the money Im saving to by cool  Im fine with them taking money that was modded to me, but taking money that I worked for...Instead of punishing all the players that get money forced on them from modders, fix your anticheat.
