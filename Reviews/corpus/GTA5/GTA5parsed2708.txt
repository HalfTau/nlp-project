This game is amazing and definetely and fun experience either by yourself and even more fun with friends. Yes, there is a lot of modders in the game that like to ruin your experience in Online, but not as many as you think there is. I have only gotten in to one modded lobby with UFOs but that is it. EYes, I have hardly played this game and had just put a full day in to it, but it is definitely worth it to pick up when it is on sale, not at the full price of 60 to be honest.
