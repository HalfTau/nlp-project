I never played online much, online was boring to play because I didnt want to buy shark cards just to have cool stuff in the online game, which is the only actual way to make money. Got it on sale for 30 and I completely regret buying it. Seriously Rockstar, taking off support for mods? Eliminating open IV because people are tired of wasting money on shark cards so they cheat in the game. Now I cant even use mods in the story mode, and thats all I ever did was screw around and blow crap up. I cant even do that anymore? Screw you Rockstar. Dont ever buy anything from them, they dont give a crap about  players, they just want their money.
