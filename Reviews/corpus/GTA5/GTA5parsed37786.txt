SINGLEPLAYER Fun, but dumbed down, as casual as you can get. The story starts pretty strong, but fails to deliver any depth after some hours of gameplay.MULTIPLAYER Grand Theft Auto, the name used to mean something, it used to be about actually stealing cars. Nowadays GTAV ONLINE is about BUYING cars, very expensive cars. Buying anything useless really, just to make you spend REAL MONEY on shark cards. The post launch content being severely damaged because of that. Instead of focusing on actual content that takes effort to make like the Heists they decided to go with fancy meaningless crap to grab your money.
