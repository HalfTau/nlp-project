Grand Theft auto Series use to be my greatest joy and pastime, sadly these days i just get angry every time i try to play, between the non stop drops when playing with friends  because their servers suck, and the rediculous forcement of having to buy their shark cards to ever get anything in this game, its Trash and i dont ever recommend it. If i wanted a pay to play game id just go back to Archeage and suffer that.
