Grand Theft Auto V is probably the worst game I have played in my life. This gayme was probably made over the course of a weekend, fueled by day drinking and DMT. The story is about Frank and his gang of gundam warriors trying to invade Voltrons hideout in Michigan. Like how. The controls are  ing broken. They removed Down B so now I cant even shine properly. The gay orgy scenes were way too short, the director was a ing moron. The whole plot revolves around Trevor getting a new hat, and its not even cotton. Michael doesnt even have a character, like, hes on the box but not in the game, I dont know. You cant eat, or kamikaze. Also the police have back acne. BacKnee. Theres only 4 songs in the whole game, and theyre all just Ed Sheeran Gun Syncs. As for the guns, theyre actually decent, but I dont like the way the reload animations look. Looks like a homeless man farting but then  by mistake. Its just awkward.The girls dont exist. Theres no uplifting message about friendship like in San Andreas, which made me feel incredibly medcially sad. The most glaring issue, however,  is that the  game is a complete ripoff of Yeezus, which is probably my favorite movie of all time. Cockstar.In summary, Grand Theft Auto 2 is horrible and you  shouldnt buy itif you  want  a real game, go play Skyscraper Simulator0/10
