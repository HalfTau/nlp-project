There was a time when I almost liked GTA5, but TakeTwo has such a hard on for mobilelike microtransaction bull that theyve ruined the online experience. That wasnt enough it seems, because now theyve ruined the singleplayer experience by removing moding. Add to it the 20 minute load times and you end up with a game that isnt playable, nor would it be fun anyway. Save you money and buy a game thats actually fun.
