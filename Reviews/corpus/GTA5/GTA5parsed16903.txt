single player is amazing, it has a great storyline and separate individual tasks to complete which keeps it interesting, depending on how long you spend on the game it should take you under a month to complete it all.Multiplayer is pay to win, if you want all of the best apartments, offices, cars etc. and dont want to spend time being a ceo you will more than likely be buying shark cards. Ive not had much problems with the online community because there are ways to get into online sessions alone if you do your research. If you do run into hackers or people trolling LEAVE the game, simple.Overall its an amazing game and 100 worth the money you pay for it, the only let down is the online community.
