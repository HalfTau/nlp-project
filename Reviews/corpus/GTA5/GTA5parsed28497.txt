Meh, MP is boring, you cant have fun without having millions of dollars which most people modded into the game anyways. The game favors high level rich modders because they have auto lock on vehicles and powerful guns yet youre stuck with a crappy sniper rifle that takes like 4 shots to kill both cause it sucks and leveling gives you more health meanwhile they shoot you once and youre down.If youve come for fun with friends, play gamemodes and stick with em, if youre playing solo. Dont.
