This game really deserves its success, and all the praise and longevity it has garnered. Just a huge game, tons to do, still some of the best graphics Ive ever seen, infinite customization, mods, excellent single player mode, huge multifaceted multiplayer, free dlc all the time, I could go on and on. Probably the best bang for your buck game you can get for the last few years, and if you catch it on sale, its a steal.
