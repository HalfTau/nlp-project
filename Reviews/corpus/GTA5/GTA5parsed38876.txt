This game used to be fun, but singleplayer hasnt received any attention in years and Online is just a grind fest, cash grab, or both. There may not be any paid DLC, but unless youre willing to sink hours upon hours of repeating the same missions for every single vehicle/property you get or spend the value of this game a few times over for enough shark cards to buy them, this game simply is not for you.
