Is this a good game? Yes it is other Barry. Get the reference? I bought this game on sale for 30 USD. Yeah I know 30 is still a lot for a game from 2015. But...not trying to fanboy The game is still worth your time and money despite that it is a old game.ProsStory is fun and you can get mods for it.Online isnt anywhere close to dead.The Devs still add new content to the game, at least one new vehicle each week. Every tuesday as well as major updates every 1 or 2 months.Online is incredibly fun to play with friends.ConsThere is always thatin a tank, apc or plane.Some  will kill you.There a lot of unpatched glitches.Internet lag makes the game unplayableDevs do almost nothing to deal with modders.Modders can keep killing you so fast you cant even leave the game.All in all I think it is a good game as long as you have some friends to play GTA Online with. I would rate this game 8/10 overall.
