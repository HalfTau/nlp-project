enjoyed this game thoroughly since buying it last year. Never played Online as I didnt want to. I enjoyed playing the game with Script Hook using the Flash mods.  My modding didnt hurt anyone, but provided me with hours of gaming enjoyment. BOYCOTTTAKETWO and BOYCOTTROCKSTARGAMES by extension.   Congratulations on alienating most of your fans... Funny how your reviews have gone to overwhelmingly negative since Take Twos announcement.  Have fun in the dustbin of history.
