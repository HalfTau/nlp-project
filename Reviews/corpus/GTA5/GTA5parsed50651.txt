Dear TakeTwo,I do not use mods on this game. However, I do see the necessity for them as they can keep a game fun and engagin when literally evbery other thing has completely lost flavor.If you still want players around playing your game, dont screw around with the modding community. Mods are completely legal and integral to keeping any old game fun.You quite literally are not only shooting yourself in the foot, but also well on your way to killing one of the most fun games still around.Until you realize what a BS decision this was and roll it back, Ill just have to say that this game is no longer for the average open world sandbox gamer.
