This game has gone horribly down hill, hackers rule online and if you dont hack you either have to spend hundreds of pounds on sharkcards or spend literally weeks of your life grinding for one car. In my opionion there should be 2 online modes, one with missions, where you have to build up your charecter and profile by grinding and completing jobs and another mode where youre allowed to use mods and generally mess around with your friends, the main better part of GTA imo.Lastly the developers of this game have started to shut down single player modder that only wish to create content to add to the SINGLE PLAYER expericene meaning that if a user wants to use these mods, he wont even be able ot effect others.
