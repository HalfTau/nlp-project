Customer service is awful, the grind for everything is awful, the whole community is awful, etc. I love to play this game, but you really should only play it with mods. Money is everything in this game, so if you dont have any you cant play, IRL and in game. I like this game a lot, however, due to the company being full of greedy dirtbags, I cannot recommend that you support them or this game.
