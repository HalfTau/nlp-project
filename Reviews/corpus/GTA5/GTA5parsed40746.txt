The single player is pretty good. It got abandoned, though, so dont expect any new content. GTA 5 Online is the biggest piece of garbage Ive ever seen, full of hackers that have nothing better to do other than annoying you. Shtty, overpriced vehicles and weapons that you could only afford by buying overpriced ingame currency or wasting hours on end doing the same, boring missions over and over again. Also getting banned for doing NOTHING, and so on. Dont buy this game if you want to pay for boredom.
