Ill throw my hat in have this game for Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC. Amazing game on the first two platforms. 13 hours in, pathetic optimization issues became apparent on the PC. Now, news has spread that Take Two has effectively banned modding from the game entirely by removing use of the Open IV modding tool.Im guessing this is happening for two possible reasons the Open IV modding tool was somehow being used to affect the games multiplayer component legions are saying it cant, or this is Take Twos first step in attempting to copy Bethesda and introduce paid mods.To that, I have this to sayoff. Maybe you should listen to the hordes wanting more single player content and stop shoving social multiplayer garbage down our throats. And as for the paid mods that is going to end very badly for Bethesda I wouldnt emulate that. Freely available modding in PC games has been a thing for more than two decades, I feel very sorry for every publisher and developer who thinks they can attempt to get a slice of that pie.
