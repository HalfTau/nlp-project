Singleplayer is amazing. The story is great and the gameplay as well.Multiplayer is good with friends, but the bad part is that everything is so expensive and you either have to farm for a long time to get a few mils, find a modderwho is friendly and gives you money or you have to use REAL money to buy a shark card. All in all Id recommend it
