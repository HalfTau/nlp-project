The way Online works so far is that you either try playing the game normally and then get bored with the huge amount of grind that gets you nowhere, you pay for ingame money that does nothing except taking your real money, or you get yourself some mods and get money and everything while having fun screwing rest of the playerbase in the process. At this point only people having fun in this game are not the ones who play it for what they bought it, but the ones ing normal players without getting punished.
