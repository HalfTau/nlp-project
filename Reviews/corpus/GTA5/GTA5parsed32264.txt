I LOVE the single player story to this game. I DESPISE Take two interactive. This game should not still be 59.99 its been years and they have added no singleplayer DLC or content to speak of while they keep cranking their micropayments in horribly optimized online. Now take two decided to ban a single player offline modding tool and used their fancy lawmen at that. So now no one can make fresh single player content. Oh well. Buy it on sale if you want an awesome single player story which really spoke to me as a person when I first played it. Online can burn in a fire for all the toxicity it represents. It is an exemplar of everything screwy in the video game industry at large.
