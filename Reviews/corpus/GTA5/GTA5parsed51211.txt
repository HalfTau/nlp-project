Im here to add my voice to the outrage expressed at TakeTwo Interactives recent actions toward the modding community. Before buying this game please be aware that, until Taketwo retract their cease and desist statement, all Gta mods you may be familiar with will not work. I will also state that until this violation of basic decency toward Gtas playerbase has been addressed, anyone unfamiliar with the debacle should spend their money elsewhere.
