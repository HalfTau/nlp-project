The game itself is fine, not really anything wrong with it, except the orbital cannon just why which is 750k to use once so basically only hackers use it.but i would recommend this for the game itself, for the community on the other hand... thats a whole different story.let me give you an example, you join a lobby with just one other guy, im happy because i can make some money while not being interrupted, but no... the ONE guy thats there with me, kills me and goes passive mode, this and way more stuff that is wrong with the community is why i just cannot recommend this game... and of course the enormous amout of hackers lol but thats part of the community as well so yeah...
