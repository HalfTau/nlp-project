the game is good the problem is the community and rockstar isnt doing anything againts modders and hackers and the game is starting to feel more like a griding game but I recommend the game cuz of its gameplay and the mehanics are great not to forget mentoning the perfect graphics the heists are amazing the vehicles are endless but if rockstar is going to push the grind at us I will have to give it a thumbs down
