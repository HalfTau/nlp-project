Grand Theft Auto is a fun game just to blow some steam off in.I also reccomend checking out FiveM if you ever get board of GTAOPROS Good Combat Mechanics Cars are fun to drive Good Controller support I can blow up everythingCONS A very steep grind Taketwointeractive ethics Very much impossible to get started in the game without outside help Loading Times You will come across someone that abuses a mod menu in a lobby every now and thenIf you are thinking about getting GTA 5 make sure to have a friend that is pretty far in the game that can help you out or just find a modder/hacker I mean whatever you call them and have them drop you money.I acutally reccomend going out and finding a modder that will drop you money because of how bad the grind is.
