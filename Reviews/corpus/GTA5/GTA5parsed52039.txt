This is bull. Once one of the greatest games, now Take Two are targeting their own fan base. Threatening modders. People that actually help boost sales. With legal action and actually sent people to these modders homes to threaten them.Why? So you spend your hard earned cash on shark cards for the TERRRIBLE online mode because apparently the 4th best selling game in the world isnt earning enough money for the company. Even though on the first day it was out it broke records earning 850m in a single day. Thats not mentioning every sale since and all the extra online money.Stop being greedy Take Two. We will not stand for it.
