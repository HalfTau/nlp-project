Why I hate this game. This game sucks because I want to mod the bland graphics and  fov of like 30 in fp view. It makes me sick. However, I havent because I dont want to be banned for online, in the event I want to play with friends. Yes I know supposedly you can for single player, but I havent. The result is that after initial messings around with friends and playing a few times here and there, I wont even touch this turd. Because if I do I instantly want to change my fov and bland colors...and again...its a thought loop I cant escape. Rockstars over for me, I think. Im done.
