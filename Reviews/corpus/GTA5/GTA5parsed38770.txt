GTA 5 is a fine game everyone says dont buy it cause you cant mod it anymore meanwhile they complain about getting banned from online with mods. Playing the story mode is fun even without mods now and online is fun to play even if you have no money like me. There is so many different activities to do with friends or by yourself. Dont listen to other reviews, worth buying.
