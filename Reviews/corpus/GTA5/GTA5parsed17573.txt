The singleplayer is extremely fun to play through, Im at my fifth playthrough right now and Ive never gotten to a full 100.... yet.The multiplayer is fun too, with friends. The recent updates added more stuff to play with but the downside to this is that they keep getting more expensive, even though earning money hasnt changed. Wanna buy the newest car? Better grind for days.When youre alone this isnt really fun to do, when your with friends it gets a lot easier.Im from the old PS3 days and Im still waiting for that Casino and Singleplayer expansion. Rockstar, if you see this, please add them! Since the release on the currentgen consoles and PC the updates have been fun but also kind of a bit insane. Flying motorcycles, customizables planes, bunkers. I miss those realistic updates, and would definitely want to see one of those before the updates stop.Buy the game. Play with friends. Dont buy Shark Cards. Watch out for modders.
