I have now formally uninstalled GTA V, for a few reasons. Primarily I uninstalled the game due to the taketwo modding debacle currently ongoing. This was the final culmination in the online section of the game, which has been for a while a microtransaction hellhole of hackers, cheaters, and people with wallets so big they can afford the 100 needed to buy everything you could possibly want in a game you bought for 60. The microtransactions have now made the online near enough unplayable. If you want to win races, you need a car that can only really be gained by purchasing in game currency. If not, you have a very, very long and repetitive grind ahead. Its ridiculous. If paying 60 for the game three times.... Xbox 360 and One, and for PC, isnt giving the company enough money, they ask for 50 every time you might fancy having a new appartment... Or clubhouse, office or warehouse for the latest DLC packages which are now clearly for nothing other than financial gain. I can not recommend buying the game if you want to play singleplayer as a modded version, and only play the online mode if you are either astupidly wealthy, or b lacking in anything else to do other than vegetate over a grind for not enough money to progress.
