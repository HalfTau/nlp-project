My friend gifted this game to me since he knew how much I loved GTA but now Im not so sure. GTA V is a great game Ive played it ever since it first came out, the storyline is amazing and you will feel a kinda connection with anyone of the three characters in the game. Soundtrack is amazing as well for anyone but the only thing that makes GTA V bad is Multiplayer. GTA Online is great but it does have flaws like the Shark Cards and the new DLCs that cost a lot of ingame and if you do buy a Shark card, Real life money. GTA Online does bring players together to pull off great missions and amazing heists but the new Heist that came in seems more like a cash grab is anything. The past few DLC have seemed like this but The Doomsday Heist is one main culprits in the game. For a game more about trying to make money and getting to the top, the game is taking away your actual money just for a few things in your in game bases. GTA V is a great game but dont be foolish and fall into the trap of Shark Cards for GTA Online.
