Take two has taken a step to far in removing seemingly entertaining mods for such a great platform. Gta was built by mods and that is the only real reason i purchased gta v. Take two is limiting creativity for a game that was almost completely populated by modded gameplay. This isnt just affecting the the modding communitys,  but the people thag record videos of the mods for YouTube. Taking mods from gta is exactly like when steam made paid mods for skyrim. Way to go take two. You killed a game in almost a day and a half.
