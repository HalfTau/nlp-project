GTA OnlineLoading Online. Loading Online. 10 minutes later. Loading Online.Literally the worst game i have ever played in my life.Only good thing about it is its driving, nothing more. Shooting sucks so much that servers dont count any of 20 body shots on lying target on the ground and as soon as he gets up and shoots me in the head it counts it and no its not a cheat its just servers. Loading time is longer, no matter SSD HDD, due to poor servers and on top of that cheaters in every single game lobby dropping event items under map or geting irrational score like longest falling distance 9999999 when from top to bottom is about 15k.Also puting money and weapons in your character slot yes pretty much like game admins and geting you banned or robbed of all weapons/money due to YOU cheating, beacuse rockstar.If you ever think about buying this game. Dont. Its the worst trash out there in video game industry.GTA VPretty fun, but shorter than any other game and lack of things to do. Like no cop, ambulance, taxi missions with bonuses to your stats. Minigames with pretty TERRIBLE rewards like 1,000 and cheapest house costs 100,000. The best income is robbing some money trucks for 6,000, meanwhile you can buy a company for 1,000,000, so if you dont invest on the stock market during assasination missions, you will have to grind for 400 hours just to buy a single company for a single mission. Great.
