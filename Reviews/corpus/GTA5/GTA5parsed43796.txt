Greed has ruined this franchise. Take two is willing to hurt its own community in an attempt to make more money off of its shark cards.I would complain about its hacker problem but at this point who cares. Taketwo actively increases these people with each attempt to make the online as hard and boring as humanly possible to force people to shell out money on those garbage sharkcards if they want to progress or get new items.
