After all that theyve added to this game it really is a game you can enjoy online and offline with or without friends. Theres so much to do its fantastic and really is a great game. Rockstar have outdone themselves with this game and the only bad thing I can say about it is that the pricing for everything in online is absurd but it shouldnt hinder your experience too much because there are tons of game modes to play and missions to go through to have a fun time with yourself and your friends. If you havent played GTA V its time wasted
