I absolutely loved the Story mode. Really. Just 10/10 for that one.But GTA Online is an unplayable mess. FIX YOUR ANTICHEAT! I cant find a single server without a hacker killing me. And they always have exactly THE SAME CHEATS, which means they probably used THE SAME HACK which makes me wonder how you people at Rockstar can be so incompetent! BAN THE HACKERS, GET AN ANTICHEAT SYSTEM THAT WORKS AND THEN MAYBE I WILL COME BACK TO THIS GAME.
