More than 50 of my time in this game is spent on using modded game mode, namely LSPDFR where I could be playing as a policeman.Online is fine, but most of the time it is Loading Simulator . It is fine, but the pay to win scheme that use Shark Cards makes a casual gamer unable to enjoy the fullest of the feature offered.Police the online mode, but let any single players do what they wanted with the game. At least if R wishes to stop OpenIV, they should provide alternatives for modding scene of this game.
