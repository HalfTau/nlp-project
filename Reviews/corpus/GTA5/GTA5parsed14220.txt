while the singleplayer was tons of fun and I definitely enjoyed the 30 hours I spent with it, I cannot reccomend its online partGTA Online is pretty much grinding mixed with cheaters, overpriced content, dull gamemeodes that all look the same, more cheaters and more grindingI did spend a lot of time in online, but honestly, thats mostly because I was spending at least a week just to buy a business that could give me at least a bit of money than constantly doing the same heists. and what did I get? a business that gives you slightly more money, but you need to risk getting killed by cheaters/griefers just to get these few thousands extra worth of cash in a world where one million isnt going to get you anywhereoh, and yeah, those that actually grinded/spent real life money usually buy themselves overpowered vehicles that are much more superior than a ing tank. also, bugs, tons of themif you want to go full singleplayer, sure, youll have a blast. online however is only good if done in private sessions and if youre doing missions/freeroaming with rich friends
