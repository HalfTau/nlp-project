There is no better storymode in any game. Online is pretty awesome at first but the grind itself is medium heavy. Add to it the fact that there is no light killing. If you try to pvp between mission cooldowns which are absurdly pointless as far as i can tell youll respawn right next to them or theyll respawn right next to you and itll take much more time than you wanted it to. This is a vehicle sandbox first and foremost, but theyre trying to make it an rpg. Even working the highest paying solo profession CEO  possible 7580k every 40 mins you wont be able to afford the cool stuff for a fairly laborous grind mixed with loading screens that take a good chunk of your experience, hackers that pop in and make you swap servers and endure another 510 min loading screen and causing you to abandon your current mission that you just spent 35 mins on and now have to abandon your meager reward. Weird NPCs that yell Youre boring! and Youre not creative! which isnt so much a problem as just strange. It can work on low end systems with still very good graphics, but all in all I havent gotten much enjoyment or fulfillment for my time. I give the thumbs up to those who havent played yet. I think youll enjoy the entire story and a good start into online at least. And that to me is worth buying a game. However if youre buying for online alone, I would say that the work and wait isnt worth the next vehicle.
