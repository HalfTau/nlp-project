Originally I gave the game a negative review due to the whole situation where a modding team got a cease and desist. Like many people, Im over that. Regardless of that, I cant say I really enjoyed this game as much as other entries in the series. The singleplayer content has characters with little to no redeemable qualites and the gameplay does tend to lose its luster. That being said, the world of GTA V is rich with interesting landscapes and in the general the world being built here is a brilliant parody of American culture. This really makes the games quality subjective. Some of you might love the world, but for others the poorly designed characters will ruin the experience.Moving on tot he online portion, it can be fun if you have friends. The problem is that it is almost pay to win. Most MMOs nowadays try to only sell cosmetics or items that arent significant enough tooff other players. in GTAO, the currency you can either quickly buy or take absolutely forever to earn can create a power gap. Those who drop a few hundred on the game are untouchable while people who just bought the base game are screwed if they arent super dedicated.For people like myself who really hate grinding and prefer interesting characters in singleplayer, this game really isnt all that great. If you love the world building and the absolute madness that is the online mode, by all means pick this game up.
