Grand Theft Auto V is a great singleplayer/multiplayer game. Its singleplayer is rich and there is alot of activities and things you can do and have fun while doing it. The multiplayer was better before, but today its a MEH...But still playable and enjoyable with friends!The down side about this game are the micro transactions.For example, new car update arrives and the car costs lets say 5mil.5mil for rich ppl irl is little. Purchase shark cards and enjoy your pixels basically.But for us nonrich gamers it takes alot of grinding and doing missions to purchase that vehicle.While grinding, most of us forget having fun and just grind grind grind which is bad...We must enjoy this game as much as possible, cars and apartments dont matter that much...Just have a laugh with your mates and HAVE FUN!! !The other down side of this game is the loading. Basically to load into an online session it takes about 5 minutes. 5 MINUTES, let that sink in. You can take a sh!t in 5 mins or have a wnk.In conclusion, the game is not so bad but could have accomplished something better.Rockstar sht on this game.
