A game that has such a vibrant, creative modding scene has had its money hungry publisher issue a Cease  Desist to the main modding platform OpenIV, because they dont want people playing ANY part of their game that isnt the microtransaction laden grindfest that is GTA Online.Wouldnt recommend buying/playing this game anymore. Modding, one of the holy grails of PC Gaming, has been declared illegal by Take Two and its wrong. Awful, awful publisher.
