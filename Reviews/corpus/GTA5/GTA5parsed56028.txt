So have had this game for ages on console and PC. Killing mods for the sake of money? Take Two honeslty  how the hell do you claim to under monetize users when you EARN more then a 100 in a quaterly per annum. Like 60 bucks on a game purchase multiple times isnt enough? A game that becomes uselss after the endgame? A game whose online feature is a money pit and is trash for what it provides? Get a life honestly. Screw you guys.
