No more mods! I think i will not buy GTA 6 if come out i not recommend to buy this game..Without mods is game I pay 60 for nothing just stock game and  DLC which can be playable only ONLINE i HATE ONLINE DLCsAllow OpenIV to do his work and i will support you Rockstar in other case you lose one more gamer which like GTA
