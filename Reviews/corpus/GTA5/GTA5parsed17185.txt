While the single player game is excellent, the online mode is unfortunately a money grubbing hog and Rockstar is constantly doing borderline criminal activity to players accounts. A long time ago I once stumbled into an online lobby where someone was dropping money on my head, didnt think too much of it and went on playing. To this day, Rockstar proceeds to take millions of in game money that I earned legitimately even though they already took all of the money that was given to me by the cheater. This includes in game money that I regretfully attained through shark cards and from countless hours of playing.Even if you dont have the in game money stolen from you by rockstar, the amount required to stay current is ridiculous. It would take an insanely long time to obtain the money without paying real life money and buying a shark card to have enough funds to actually enjoy new content would literally cost hundreds of real life dollars. The online mode is full of buyers remorse if youre stupid enough, like me, to spend real life money on in game currency. Stay away from GTA 5 online unless you have an endless wallet and a large amount of patience for the playerbase.
