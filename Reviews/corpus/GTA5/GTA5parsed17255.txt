Honestly for the price this game is complete trash and considering it took them an extra year to get it to PC its a crashing badly coded peice of This game is so poorly made that it crashed ans freezes all the time and sometimes things just dont work. Rockstar has not stopped the problem of actual hackers in Online lobbies but focus on single player modders. Everything in this game is ridiculously expensive, and all the buisnesses that make it easier cost so much that a lot of people will never own them before they stop playing the game. Especially because lower leveled players are constantly getting ed in online lobbies. If you dont have all the armoured and high damage vehicles the high levels do theyll just constantly kill you when you try to do anything. You need to grind heists and activities endlessly to buy one of the buisnesses/buildings that give you access to more funds and even then it takes even more money to work them. Rockstar wants you to buy the incredibly overpriced shark cards, for 11.99 I can get 1,250,000 in game dollars. Sounds like a lot right? No its jack That will barely get you anywhere in game and its not enough to buy anything that will give you a return on it. I bought a bunker when they first released and I STILL havent even got to HALF what I spent on it. Dont get this game, youll get addicted and its a  game and a massive waste of your time. Play the older GTAs or Saints Row. You can get from them all the good aspects of this game at a fraction of the price that is still 39.99 after being out on PC for over two years when its riddled with bugs and issues. They expect you to pay so much for in game money like this is a free to play game. Rockstar you done ed up. Dont buy, save your money.
