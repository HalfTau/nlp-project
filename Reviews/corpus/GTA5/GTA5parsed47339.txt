You decide to make a big deal about people making free content for your game?.. Okay.You ban my friend from online play, when using mods in single player? Fine.The devs are just plain dumb, sorry. I do not support this kind of behaviour from Rockstar.EDITLooks like Rockstar came to their senses finally. Will change the review once I see fit.
