 Multiplayer is filled with hackers You cant do anything in Online because everything costs millions of dollars, which you will only get if you buy sharkcards keep in mind the game costs 60 to begin with Getting tons of errors upon loading into the Online version Loading time will take up to 78 minutes, after that you will start to question if you will actually get into the server Boring world with not much to do other than small activities like, tennis/golf etc.
