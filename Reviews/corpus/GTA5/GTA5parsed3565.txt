Im definitely hooked by this game...totally stop playing other games when I got GTA V as a gift from a very good friend. However, this game has both pros and cons. Here are my thoughts about GTA V.Pros Stunning visuals Great soundtracks Comprehensive gameplay. The tutorial is helpful enough to get you to know the gameplay. Full controller support which makes it easier to drive / fly vehicles There are lots of stuffs to do in GTA V and the devs keep updating / adding new missions on it, so its still fun even after many years of release. More fun with friends, but you can also play solo if you dont have any or if you dont wanna play with them. P Has both story mode and online mode I like the options that you can customize your online session to play with friends only or with pubs. Basically The Sims for guys and girls with more actions! I would consider the shark cards as a pro because why not? Its a shortcut to getting rich. Still better than hacking though.Cons So many hackers killing the buzz of the game Laggy  The game runs on P2P because Rockstar has no dedicated servers for online sessions as per Enders comment. I sometimes get disconnected or lagging moment when playing with some friends. Some other players may be annoying by constantly killing you. If you get salty, just change the session or kill them back until they change the server instead.
