Singleplayer is a great experience and I would recommend the game when its on sale for 50 or more just for the offline part of the game.Online can suck mybrEverything fun or nice is too expensice and its a pain in theto grindFilled with hackers and pay to win scenarios, its only somewhat fun if youre playing with a group of friendsAt the end of the day, I feel like all the money I spent on this game just went in the trash.
