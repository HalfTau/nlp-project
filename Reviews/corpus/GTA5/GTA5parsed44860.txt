Adding my hours from Xbox 360, Xbox One, and now PC, I have somewhere around 600 hours in all. I love this game. But the DLC is getting worse and worse. Prices are going up on everything. Its obviously meant to encourage players to buy Shark Cards. I would be fine with it, but even if you spent the max 100 you still wouldnt even come close to owning every car from even just one DLC update. Ive grinded out money to the point of insanity and after the release of the Import/Export update, I just looked at the 2 million dollar minimum price tag on the cheapest vehicle and quit. The income produced by grinding just isnt enough, and Im not spending 100 on Shark Cards, let alone 500 to actually afford everything. Now that they killed the Modding community for single player, Ive decided to not recommend this game anymore. Its just sickening.
