I would like to thank the creators of GTA 5 Rockstar for it has braught friends together even people who didnt know they even existed together. But due to all these modding morons I would like to say that the intention of gta online is not to just grind time for money but to enjoy a whole new world that was created to enjoy. Ruining the lives of npcs in peace and also friends without risking real life dramas. To also enjoy an alternate online story line with campaign characters weve all come to know and love...maybe wich is something we dont see in many online games. I saw alot of modders going on about open iv shut down Id say go for it because a game is not fun without spending endless hours grinding for money to no avail.
