Bought it and played a few hours after release. Forgot about it for years.Tried it again years later to justify paying the 60 when it launched. I fell in love with the game and have been playing religously.The online mode has so many different options for what you feel like doing. Racing, First person shooter, Action, Flying etc.The game even has TRON mode. Where you can ride the motorcycles that leave lethal trails. So much fun to be had.Taking the time to optimize the settings and get your mouse setting/bindings perfect is essential. Optimizing your system to game interaction really increased my enjoyment, smoother gameplay is your friend in this game.
