I dont normally write a review for games, but I am making an exception because of the poor decision by the makers of this game. I only really purchased this game because I enjoyed playing with the LSPDFR mod on single player. Now that the company is attacking a large portion of users who play with mods and working to restrict the use of mods, it seems pointless to have the game. I guess itll sit in my game library and collect proverbial dust. Oh well.
