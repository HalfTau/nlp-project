fkng terrible to slap your consumers in the face this bad. You not only just lost good PR, advertising on youtube and twitch, game sales, and micro transactions, but youve got a lot of people who have boycotted you and you can count me in. You guys should seriously be ashamed of yourselves. I have been purchasing GTA since GTA 2. I bought Red Dead Redemption. I have paid a considerable amount of money to GTA over time. NO FWKING MORE. NEVER AGAIN for the rest of my life.
