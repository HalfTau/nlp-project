Not only is this an attack on the Open 4 and the community surrounding it but its also an attack on PC gamers and the very ideals of PC gaming. Modding is something that can breathe new life in a game and put the power of creation into the hands of individuals to allow us to improve something and potentially have everyone benefit from it. Many good things were brought into the gaming community that originated from modding such as counter strike and Player Unknown Battle Grounds. Modding is a force that needs to be encouraged not discouraged if we want this industry to grow.Youve destroyed the very thing youve worked so hard on creating.
