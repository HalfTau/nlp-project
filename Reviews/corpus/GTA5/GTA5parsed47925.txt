Pros It is a pretty decent game if you consider the fun, controls, graphics and storylines.The single player mode got a very nice storyline with real good characters.The multiplayer mode is kinda fun, however, it is a total chinese grind fest.Cons The melee combat is ridiculous, so no point in even using.The player support Rockstar Games provides is pityful, at best.Alone, the fact that they are boycotting mods for their own game explicitly shows how stupid they are.After all, mods tend to extend the life of a game for a long while. Not to mention the fact that having those, usually raise the satisfaction of the users consequently, the approval of such.There are several bugs online and offline, and the servers for the multiplayer mode are .Last con actually makes the  support service even more evident, since they dont fix the bugs nor fix the issues caused by bugs.
