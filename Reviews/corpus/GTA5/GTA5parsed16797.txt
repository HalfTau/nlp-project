Love how Rockstar removed my last reviewIt was pretty long and negative, so Ill tldr itThe SingleplayerIts good but nobody really buys the game for itThe real game, Online The typical proletariat struggles are real in this game,as one must grind their soul away to buy over expensive products Shark Cards can be purchased, but even I find them too expensive Hackers are another thing, and Rockstar refuses to put in an actual reporting system People w/ money are oftenand will kill youDont buy this trash, the grind is real
