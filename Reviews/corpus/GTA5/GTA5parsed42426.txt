So for playing two years, and over 2.3k hours of playing online. Spending so much money and time on this game, R bans my account for having the ScriptHookV. The trainer only works for single player in fact it will freeze your game if you attempt to use it online. I know this because Ive accidentaly log online using the dpad on my xbone controller. Ive even put the trainers files in a folder so it will not activate when I go online, but I guess having it in the game folder was a mistake. Ive tried to contact support but they use the same copy paste robotic answer all the time no matter what I asked of them. If youre going to buy this game make sure you buy two if you want to mod the game. In fact you need two computers to fully injoy the game. One PC for modding and another for playing online. Also they will NOT unlink your steam account with your social club account. Even if you are innocent, your out of luck if youre to start over again. So this is why you should buy two games with two different steam account for each game.
