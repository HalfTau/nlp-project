So if you play GTA V for the single player, its a pretty decent purchase.BuuuuutRockstar and Take Two decided to shut down a modding platform, presumably to curb hacking which it wont.  Given how Rockstar and Take Two act like money hacks for GTAO are like walking in to their safes and stealing money, Im pretty sure that the CD was to preserve their shark card t, which surprisingly, people are actually dumb enough to buy.In short,  you Rockstar.
