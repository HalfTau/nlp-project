Game is garbage. I quit playing a couple of years ago for FFXIV. Came back a few months ago and first thought that the game greatly improved. That is until I realized that Rockstar has made it near impossible to accomplish anything. I/E is fun, until some troll blows you up. Or you steal a car and an invisible modder throws you out into the air like a ragdoll and drives off with the car you just sourced happened to me last night. Or hackers give you a lot of money. Rockstar takes it the next time they patch. This is understandable as it was cheating. But then a week later Rockstar takes more than half of the money that you raised legitimately. I raised 1.5 mil just by doing I/E. Rockstar took 800k of it with no reason stated.Bottom line is that this game isnt worth the price if you want something fun to play. Game is ruined. Will never play this crap again. Probably will never buy another Rockstar game.
