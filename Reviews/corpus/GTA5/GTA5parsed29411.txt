Just throwing in my two cents with this review.First, this is the best GTA game so far, gameplay wise. Ive had a ton of fun with the game, and I think it is really well made.Unfortunately, Take Two and Rockstar have decided that they no longer want to support the PC community. They have essentially banned modding for GTAV, thereby rendering it a dead game after everyone has beaten it. There is an online component, but at this point I see it as nothing more than a desperate attempt to keep making money.To summarize, I enjoy the game a lot, but if I had not already purchased it, I would certainly not do so now. In fact, as much as I enjoy playing it, if I were still within the refund window I would refund this game because of the recent decision made by Rockstar and Take Two.As a side note, social club is completely pointless and should have never existed in the first place.
