im just an 80 hours player so this review might be bad many reviewers that ive seen saying that this game is so bad that its just a waste of money for buying it if u you wanna go online mode. well, i just can agree to disagree on that. first of all, the modders problem. well... i cant say much, since i havent been encountering them that much. i agree that modders are a bunch of z and rockstar kinda did next to nothing on them. but hey, in this online mode you kinda doing heist with the player, NOT AGAINST THEM, and for the doomsday one, just make an empty session if you dont wanna get disturbed. you dont know how? LEARN IT for crying out loud. adversary/race thingy? its not a consequnces once you quit the job if you encounter a hacker so why whinning about it, just find a new oneoh right, it took almost forever i agree with you on that. even if u lose u still got a little bit of money and rp so what? second thing is the microtransactions. this is the thing that made me wanna write reviews so bad. all i can say is  FIND AN EXPERIENCED RICH FRIENDS. yeah, cuz once you do, its so easy to make money from it. export import and ceo jobs,heist finale shares, theres so much option once u got FRIENDS.  so you kinda dont need that shark cards t anyway, i know i dont. cant make friends? whats the point of online game then? making foe? all i can say is you dont have to agree with my point since im only been in this game for 80 hours or so, but yeah, just take my point for thoughts. thats all i can say and oh... offline mode.. what are you complaining about that anyway..TLDR  FIND FRIENDS, its an online game after all. ignore that Shark Cards bullcrap and modders ers, ur good to go
