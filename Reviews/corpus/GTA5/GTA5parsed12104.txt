I love this game, and everything theyve tried to accomplish with GTA Online which is why it breaks my heart to have to leave this negative review. With Take Twos decision to focus exclusively on the online aspect and their new business model of recurring microtransactions being how theyve decided to move forward, what makes them think theyre entitled to a single dime of the player bases finances when they REFUSE to clean out the hackers who are destroying their game? A typical session for me involves having to hop from instance to instance, getting 2030 minutes of open world mission play in before having to hop again to avoid some modder who logs on soley to ruin other peoples fun? What exactly am I paying for if I were to buy one of their cash cards? Certainly not customer service and support, as they have seemingly washed their hands of the PC version. Why would I buy in game currency when a modder just makes millions of dollars rain from the sky? I just dont understand the logic.
