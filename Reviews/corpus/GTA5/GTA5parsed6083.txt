I cannot in good faith recommend GTA online. Your ability to make basic amounts of money is massively gimped in an effort to push microtransactions In a AAA 60 game and outside organised events the game is just one massive grindfest. It takes hours upon hours of grinding to be able to purchase a single decent car let alone these wonder weapons they shoehorn in every single update. This is not a practice I can or ever will support in a full price game and I am disgusted by the corporate greed Rockstar has given into here.On top of this, the latest heist is just a series of missions essentially advertising the new vehicles, filled with bullet spongey enemies The new Juggernaut enemy is one of the worst Ive ever seen in a videogame and monotonous dialogue and cutscenes that consistently fall flat.The cherry on top of the garbage sundae is the loading screens... Every single time the game transitions from one part to another you will experience a loading time of 2  10 minutes for absolutely no discernible reason. This is an issue Ive had from day one that everyone experiences and Rockstar absolutely refuses to address for some reason. Its been proven with mods that it can be sped up and fixed so the only explanation I can come up with is to prevent players from making too much money too quickly and if that is the case, this game is much, much worse than I thought.The only positive I have to write about GTA online is that it can be a fun experience if you can muster 6  8 people and put some races/derby together.However as of writing, the game is little more than a corporate cash grab. Steer clear.
