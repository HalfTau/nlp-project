I played for a few hours, progressed online and solo, and eventually managed to open a byker gang after spamming the same heists more than thirty times.Until I received a mail from Rockstar, out of the blue, telling me my saves were reset for violations of term of service no other explanations given, and I never cheated.Now I lost all my saves, including my offline saves. All the progress I had on GTA V not just online was completely deleted, for no reason given.Dont buy this game.
