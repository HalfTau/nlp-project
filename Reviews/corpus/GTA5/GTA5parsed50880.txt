Rockstars best seller GTAV is a great game for a short time. If you realy want to play online in a Good way you need to pay aton of money like over 200 to get everything. This is realyand i just hacked the game for a good time. Got banned for a good reason and i started playing FiveM Online but offline This is much better as it has a great RP community and i have racing games to play instead of GTAV racing. A few days ago T2 R parrent company shutdown OpenIV. This is sad for me as GTAIV was a great game if you mod the game. But T2 needs its gready money and i dont blame them. But this is just to stupid for me so i wont reccomend this game as it is boring to play without mods.
