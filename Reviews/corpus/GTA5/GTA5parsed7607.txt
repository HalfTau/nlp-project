is a fantastic open world game. The singleplayer is narrating about the life of Michael, Trevor, and Frankli. The story is pretty memorable,it has fantastic gameplay and missions. Its singleplayer is easily one of the best Game ive ever played.however have a different story. Im pretty new to the online feature of GTA V. GTA V Online is pretty fun to play with friends, it contains alot of fun minigames to play and the open world is fantastic. However to join a lobby it takes atleast half an hour and sometime it fails to load, even tho i have a pretty fast internet connection. It has a toxic online community and hackers, and Rockstar is constantly FalseBanning people because theyre too good, being manipulated by a hacker, or just absolutely no reason whatsoever. In my case it was for no reason whatsoever, the customer support is not much of a help aswell.
