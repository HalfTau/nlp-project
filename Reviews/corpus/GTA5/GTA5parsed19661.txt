Gonna keep this short and sweet. This game is great fun, great fun that I have sadly been prevented for playing for a long while now. I like many others was banned forever for modding the game when I booted up multiplayer. I had been spawning and money and such. I was modding in money becuase I again like many others was tired of doing the borring repetitive missions for the overpriced items online. Ultimately Im in the wrong but whats important is the reason why I turned to modding in the first place, the stupid expensive items, and the horribly expensive shark cars. Great game horrible business practice. Do not buy in current state.
