It pains me to give this game a negative review, but Rockstar has some horrible blatantly anticonsumer/gamer greedy cash grabbing practices. They have officially sold out. Everything that they were, innvoative as it was, serves only their shareholders interests now. No more single player content, and you can be certain the same will apply to red dead redemption. The philosophical question of what defines video games as art vs purely gamey? That line has been crossed Rockstar you sell cheap tricks now, and youve diminished the artistic and storytelling craft that went into the game you created. Devs, shame on you.
