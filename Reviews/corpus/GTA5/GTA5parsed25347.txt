I bought Gta V for the mods, and now theyre banned... If you dont have the game, and want a vanilla experience go ahead and buy it, but if you wanted the full experience with mods, funs and friends... dont.Edit Mods in sp are again available and not prohibited. Anyway, the mp is full of hackers, or people killing you, making money is way too hard. Dont recommend the mp.
