Many people would be horrified if they were informed that their creation, the thing that bares their name for the entire world to judge them by, turned to garbage. They would be outraged that something they help make is broken, unfair, or misrepresented.But not Rockstar. You guys wanna know why? Its because theyve already made more than a billion dollars. Think about your favorite celebrity or even sports figure. Kevin Durant? Brad Pitt? JayZ? None of them have even close to the amount of money that has been generated by Rockstar. The money they have made is so ridiculously high, Americans have a name for it FYou money. Now, FYou money is exactly what it sounds like its so much money that the person, people, or in this case, the company that controls it is no longer responsible or accountable for their actions. It literally doesnt matter anymore. Rockstar has made so much money off this game that they answer to nobody shady business practices, greedy microtransactions, a completely flawed and broken game it doesnt matter anymore. The money they have made from this game means Rockstar can tell the community to go Fthemselves, and wed just have to take it. What incentive do they have in fixing the game? In balancing the money system? In just simply allowing NPCs to stop calling our phones? None, because they have all the money theyd ever need in 100 consecutive lifetimes they dont need to fix or change or even be held accountable to anything.This is the reality of the situation. And the sad fact is that theres not a whole lot we can do about it you guys. People will forget about GTA online and its horrible end user experience, and well all focus on RDR2 or maybe even GTA 6. In the end, none of this matters.
