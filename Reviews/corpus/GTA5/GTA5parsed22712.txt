One of the greatest open world games ever created. Amazing story, memorable and whacky characters, really well written and quotable dialogue, really fun missions including really cool heists you can plan out yourself. Multiple endings to the game and missions give it a lot of replayability, and the world feels incredibly living and breathing. Its fun even just to go around the map on a bycicle and look around at your surroundings. The world is very massive and insanely detailed. This is a game that will keep you hooked for hours and I highly recommend it to anybody that loves games. I didnt even mention the online mode, which is also yet again fantastic. Its  really fun and addicting to play with friends. You can do heists with buddies, missions, screw around in the world, or even go to your apartment and get drunk and watch some television. Theres also a lot of guns and cars in the game, all of which are customizable with plenty of options to upgrade it with. 10/10 would drive around from alleway to alleway stabbing people and taking their money again.
