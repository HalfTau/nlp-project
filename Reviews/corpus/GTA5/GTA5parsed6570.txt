Bought this game on Xbox a month after release, friends played it, seemed fun, bought it on PC, was still kinda fun.But now, I dont like what this game has become. Single player has a great story, but the online is broken.If you are new or low level in this game Prepare to die and prepare to get talked no matter what you do. You can try to work your way to the top, but know that the person with the most money is almost guaranteed to win everything.Maybe a level 30 player lands a homing rocket on a hydra, maybe a level 20 player headshots a insurgent driver, MAYBE a level 5 somehow stops a tank. But none of that matters when the dead player whos level 200 just respawns and then casually destroys that person for the next 45 minutes until either they stop or the low level quits.Essentially, this game becomes one giant grind to become op. It started with grinding rooftop rumble, then it was heists, then so on and so on. Regardless of how you get there, once you finally reach the point where you can hold your own against other players, youve really got nothing else to do other than harass the lower levels. Sure you could grind and unlock everything, but most of it is just stuff your more likely to die using instead something more well...everythingproof.Short version lvl 1you die, lvl 30 die a little less, lvl 50 plus a couple million you can call in a tank and kill anyone without their own, over and over until they leave the session.PS Dont buy shark cards. Be ready for ban at any time.
