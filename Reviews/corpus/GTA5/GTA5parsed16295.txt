Youll be lucky to find a game that matches this in terms of having aton of fun with your mates. Server issues and loading times aside, the game is a masterpiece in terms of outandout FUN.There isnt much to say grab some mates, jump into an online game and decide from a million different possibilities from there. If I could afford to upgrade my PC Id have way more hours in this. Unfortunately the newer updates pretty much broke the game on my poor 50 CPU.
