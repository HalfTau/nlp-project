I go into a server and try to help out a guy whos getting ganked by 2 people in an armored car with a minigun on top, and another guy in a flying motorcycle that shoots homing rockets.I get mykicked trying to help him.I go into passive mode and relax after the tense situation.I get called a griefer and they all kick me off the server.10/10 would logic again.DISCLAIMER If youre buying this game just to play singleplayer, the singleplayer is pretty good. But if youre going into online, let me give you a warning. Gta Online has its ups and downs. On one hand, you can purchase the aforementioned rocket bike and go for a gank hunt with your friends. On the other hand, you could be on the recieving end of thatpounding and get killed many times trying to escape.But i digress. Online for the most part is good. Only in a minority of times did the above happen.Overall pretty solid.also  shark cards.
