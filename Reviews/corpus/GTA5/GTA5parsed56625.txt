Rockstar stepped in to defend the singleplayer modding community, and TakeTwo is willing to listen. So, in light of this, Im changing my review back to positive. Unless they pull more crap in the future.This is an excellent game, really. I wish they made more singleplayer content, but with mods you canmake up for it.
