Though I only have a few hours on PC I have many more on PS4, this game has become a second job just to try and enjoy the low level stuff. Rockstar has stopped caring about people and focused on the money by releasing overpriced garbage and telling us we should be thankfull for it. At this point I dont even care about Red Dead 2. GTA V is great storywise, but Rockstar has become a terrible company.
