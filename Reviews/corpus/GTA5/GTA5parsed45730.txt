Review was previously more negative towards singleplayer in light of the recent antimodding controversity. This has been adressed by Rockstar since then, so the review has been adjusted.GTA Online is one of the grindiest online games I have played in years. The payouts from jobs are pitiful, and Rockstar keeps adding new content that demands more and more investments to even be accessable, which are only reachable if you buy into their microtransaction scheme. To make matters worse the community of GTA Online is one of the most toxic online experiences since Ive last been on s /b/, and cheaters are rampant.The main game is quite good, however. Rockstar has now released a statement that mods are allowed on GTA V and told TakeTwo to calm down, so as long as TakeTwo plays ball all is good in Singleplayer Modding Land again. The story itself is good, with characters ranging from the downtoearth and relatable to the bats insane, and plot points that satirize real life quite well.
