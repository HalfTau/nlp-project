Overall, this is a great game. I wont waste time on single player, because its great and you get what you pay for. Anyway, what I wanted to talk about is Online. Its a great experience, but beware, because youre bound to meet your fair share of hackers who will go out of their way to make it impossible for you to enjoy the game. Talking from experience here. The other major issue is Rockstars anticheat system. There are players who have legitimately earned a lot of money like double RP and cash weeks, heists and whatnot and still got banned, so theres that.Last but not least, the things that are being added in the DLCs are expensive and require either grinding or buying shark cards. Your decision.A tip that I use sometimes If youre interested in doing the CEO/gunrunning/import/export stuff by yourself and/or with friends, you can try unplugging your Ethernet cable for a spilt second if youre using a wired connection, that is and quickly putting it back in. This will throw you into a public session all by yourself and it usually takes some time for it to fill at times it will remain empty all the time, if youre lucky.All in all, I do recommend the game, but only if you will be able to deal with the aforementioned issues.
