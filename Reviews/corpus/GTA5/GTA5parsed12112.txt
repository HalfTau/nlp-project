I have bought this game on 3 different platforms, i dont play online much anymore so was very surprised to get email from rockstar saying i was banned for cheating? I heard other people complaining about this and i didnt really believe it . Well i believe it now, I have never cheated or tried to cheat this game in anyway. It took me years to even get my character to lvl 75 and I had a whopping 900,000 in my account,  I even spent about 100 on shark cards. I will keep trying to contact rockstar in the hopes i can get my account back,  But i will never play one of their games again until they fix this situation. I get that people can cheat and that sucks for everyone but they seriously need to fix whatever parameters they use to determine who has cheated the game. Banning paying customers has to be the dumbest thing any company can do.
