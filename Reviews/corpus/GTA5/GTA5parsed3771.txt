Just beat the main storyand hanged around sometimes. The game has a Good story, has a very big city, just driving through this big city have a lot of fun. Whats more GTAV probably has the best graphic of GTA series, and like old GTAs have high freedom, so this one is more reality. so I am not gonna play this game in front of my mom and grandmother lol.
