GTA V is a mix bag for me. The main story is fine, nothing really special or memorable for me except for the torture scene. The game clearly did not go a realistic apporach like GTA 4, and went for more of a San Andreas approach with it taking place in Los Santos and stuff. This game is very optimized, it can run on a lot of platforms with a solid FPS. Looks like Rockstar learned from their mistake of that disgusting GTA 4 port. If youre getting the game for singleplayer/story mostly, then definately get it. If youre interested in this game because of the online say friends are playing it, good luck. The online is hectic, and honestly unfun without friends if youre new. Like, I feel like the online is only fun with friends, and still hackers are gonna  up your Sure, its amusing at first, but soon becomes frustrating. Then, hackers spawn youton of money to either be nice/ban your account. And the hackers, my god, so many of them. Every session I have been on has a hacker it feels like. Were at to the point where sharkcards are too overpriced, because of the hackers giving everyone so much money.My final thoughts GTA V is a very optimized and beautiful game, and the story is enjoyable enough I guess. Stay away from the online unless you have friends, because you can do heists together. Without friends, you have to trust random people who usually just trollyou off. Be careful of mods, if you go into Online and have any still active, you will be perma banned.
