A few reasons why GTA V became cancer.1. Actively shutting down 100 legal singleplayer modding tools after refusing to develop pretty much anything for singleplayer postlaunch should not be encouraged.2. Alot of people are getting  perm banned because a hacker dropped money on THEIR heads There is nothing you can do about that.3. Alot of false bans.4. R support is cancer, you cant send a appeal to them.5. Game was 60 euro, 1 day before summer sale they change it to 80, during the summer sale they are like WOW LOOK AT THIS THERE IS 25 OFF THE GAME IT WAS 80 NOW 60. Go f yourself, there was not even a f discount.6. They are so money greedy.7. ITS8. JUST9. F10. CANCER!
