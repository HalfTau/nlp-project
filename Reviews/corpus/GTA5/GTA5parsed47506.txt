I honestly dont play this game anymore, and I dont particularly care what happens to it. However this thing with OpenIV scares me. It scares thatoutta me. For one reason only. Paid mods. This is TakeTwos big first step into eliminating mods as they are now, and their first step into monetizing them. Nerdcubed summed it up best.

Kerbal Space Program is next, Im calling it here.
