While GTA Vs singleplayer experience is rich with detail and wellcrafted, the vain approach RockStar and Take Two took with GTA Online has been an irritating thorn in my side for more than two years. The implementation of Shark Cards GTAOs microtransaction system has effectively ruined the online portion, turning the acculation of ingame currrency to  access content into an unreasonable grind fest for those who refuse to pay for said microtransactions. Side note How exactly are RockStar and Take Two getting away with charging 100, nearly twice as much as the main game, for only 8 million in GTA cash, that is clearly a fcking ripoff seeing as to how much the free update content goes for ingame. I had lost any interest in the online mode after the currentgen releases.Then came the PC version. The only justifications I had for purchasing was the increase performance and the massive modding community GTA had garnered over the years. A community that was driven almost solely by passion had provided some amazing content. Thanks to Take Two, that might now be over. Years of work and dedication thrown away for reasons that are currently up for speculation. According to Take Two, the modding of their games is now considered illegal. The future of the modding community is now pretty murky what a damn shame. So in the kindest words I can think of Fck you Take Two, you greedy fcking ccksuckers!
