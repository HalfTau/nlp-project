I dont usually write reviews but, man this entire scandal has me reallyoff.If you dont know what happened, TakeTwo recently banned the use of the mod Open IV, which is a mod that is basically REQUIRED for all other GTA V mods. They effectively killed singleplayer modding, one of the primary selling points for GTA V on PC.Now I personally dont mod singleplayer in this game, but there are two primary reasons why I care about whats happening. The first being the fact that TakeTwo made it impossible to use a majority of the awesome vehicles from GTAOnline Hydra, etc., therefore making the only way to use them being through modding. This is an incredibly  business practice and a balatant attempt to move players into the microtransactionridden GTAOnline.The second reason why i care this might get a bit off topic so Ill keep it short, is that TakeTwo recently bought Kerbal Space Program, a game I adore, and also a game that heavily relies on the modding community. It genuienly concrens me that TakeTwo might turn that game into a microtransaction, unmoddable hole of a game that GTA V is now.Continue to spread the word, do NOT let TakeTwo continue through with this. For the sake of GTA V, KSP, and all other future rockstar games, dont let this happen.
