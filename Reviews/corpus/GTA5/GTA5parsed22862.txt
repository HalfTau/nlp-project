TIME TO BOYCOTT ROCKSTAR AND TAKE TWO..... I love this game, but hate the people behind it more. Typical scenario / ENTER SESSION  CHEATER LEVEL 7777 DROPS MONEY ON YOU  CHANGE SESSION  GET BANNED FOREVER.. I have over 2400 hours of playing and they simply banned me for someone dropping on me. It feelts like they are country not a company. The politics within the company is making them lose so many fans. They treat the majority of gamers in a careless and would only listen to youtubers whether they are right or wrong. Their system hasnt been improving. They find everyway to stop people from making money, just for people to buy shark cards.  Pacific Standard is a big example  MORE ? All DLCs are repetitive and boring. The map feels so tight and small if youve been there since it launched.It feels like its a car game ! Suspending random people, and they wont listen. Send proof video / screen shots, they wont give a tiny rats a s s and keep the ban. They will wipe all your money if someone dropped on you, and wont even consider your grinding and hours and months and years of playing legit. Theyve introduced so many anticheating ways to only end up banning the innocent and leaving the modders ingame. Who on earth bans someone forever ? Only God puts someone in Hell forever. All this tells you that they are extremely stupid and cannot control their game or know whos cheating ! Youll fall in love with the game and then GROW UP by the time the next part comes out. Lets see when will GTA 6 arrive to a store near you.I can rant for so much more, but this gives you a brief.I would highly not recommend this game.
