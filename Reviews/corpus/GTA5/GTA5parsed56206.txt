A mindboggling example of awful game design and developer apathy and greed.GTA V online is a repulsive, grindy, overlycurated cashgrab. The entire game is structured to encourage the purchase of overpriced virtual currency. Way too much emphasis is placed on fair play and personal vehicles in a game where the focus SHOULD be on creating chaos andYourefor blowing up other players who are griefing you from inside their soupedup bulletproof invincomobile. I cant even imagine the kind of twisted logic that led to some of these decisions.Rockstar has made like a billion dollars off this polished turd and they cant even provide competent anticheat or dedicated servers. If you play in public lobbies, your day WILL be ruined by cheaters. Its guaranteed.Also, the loading screens are unbelievably excessive and the multiplayer UI is atrocious consolized garbage. There are literally three or four UIs that could be considered the main menu and none of them are intuitive. They made a token attempt to actually integrate things into the world, but at the end of the day what Rockstar actually expects is for you to spend most of the time navigating menus, waiting in queues, and spending money on shark cards to afford the toys added in their free updates.If you want to buy this game for the singleplayer, its a very good game. Do not, under any circumstances, fall for the scam that is GTA Online.
