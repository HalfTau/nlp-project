Bad community, horrible grind, horrible moderators.Buy this if your want to spend hours upon hours of time trying to get enough money for anything.Single player is the only good thing about this game, online is now a cesspool of toxic players, a majority of which targetting people that are lower or just trying to make money.Doesnt matter if you make your money legitimately or not, youll get it taken away by Rockstar anyway.I recommend the singleplayer story and gameplay but Online is horrible as of now.
