I just want to say that I have loved this game, to a point. At first, everything was working great! Amazing graphics, even better gameplay. It was flawless! I go to shut it down and call it a night... I return the next day and find that everything must have been a dream. I am plagued by constant stuttering and completely horrible performance. I reduce the settings and everything clears up again. All is right in the world. Then, we rinse and repeat. I go to play the next day and wouldnt you know it, the issues are back! I have tried just about every possible fix for this. Including uninstalling and reinstalling the game. This is completely game breaking. It wont even function on the lowest settings anymore. I have gone from liking this game as probably one of my favorites, to absolutely hating it. I just want it gone.
