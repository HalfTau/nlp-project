So yeah, Ive got about 300 hours in GTA V. About 1015 hours of it I want to say was put into the Campaign on my PS3 then my PC. I loved the Online in this game when I could play it, That didnt really last all that long though when I started up the connection was poor, like real poor, That got fixed somewhat at some point even with decent internet. Not that I really complained as I had substandard internet then.The Story itself is fun, even if it is horridly underwhelming with the lack of content put into the Singleplayer once they worked out they could milk us for all our worth with Shark Cards online, Many things in the story were essentially left open, only like 5 Heists tops be the end to Level up our crews in the game.The Online community at best was trash, You cant explore the map or do things like armored trucks without at least 8 people on a server, Same with all of the other random events, unless you can get a server of friends together, youre not gonna get to do much short of mill around doing the jobs that pay about 00, Things in the game are expensive as hell that need you to get a Party of 4 people together so you can do the Heists, YOU NEED Friends to play this game for anything fun.The variety of vehicles is great as I said, BUT Again, you cant get all the features in the Singleplayer experience, Something I got relegated to after a Permanent Ban, I know how I got the Ban, Not going to argue it because the games really not worth the effort anymore, I have no friends to play it and the community still has a  tonne of hackers that can strip you of your weapons for being a big enough problem for them, after they come at you in a car, they also have the means to mass flag you for a Nice and quick ban. Are all the people who get banned guilty? Not really, is the game worth getting unbanned on? hell no.I just pray Red Dead Redemption 2 isnt as Cancer as this ended up being.Rating Literally dont buy this game if you dont own it, its not worth it./10Vindictator1972
