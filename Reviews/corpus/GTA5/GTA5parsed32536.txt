This is unacceptable. You guys realize a large part of your customers bought this due to the fact that they watched a NerdCubed or other video and said, Hey, even though I dont really like GTA, that looks like fun!. Mods are integral at this point. Theres no way around it. This is absolutley pitiful. If there was a Hell No button for recomnedation, Id use that
