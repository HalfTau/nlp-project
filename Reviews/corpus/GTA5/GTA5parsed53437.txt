Great game, great developer, terrible publisher. This game had infinite replayability because of modding and the amazing modding community. Modding for GTA goes back 10 years, and now the publisher has effectively banned mods for the game, and threatened legal action against the modding community. So, uninstalling GTAV, and wallet closed to this organization until this gets resolved. Too many other publishers who work with the community, not against.
