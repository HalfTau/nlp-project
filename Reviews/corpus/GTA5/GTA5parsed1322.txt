Singleplayer story was lame for me. It is just not realistic. SP gameplay is so boring too that the moment you finish story mode, you basically just quit it. Online is great with many games to play but it is too much of a grind. It is difficult to find good heists and missions not to mention the unneccessary loading screens. Half the time online is spent on loading screens, waiting for players, and wasted time from players quitting because they suck. Great open world and graphics but its not worth 60 bucks when you cant play it for crap. definitely lost interest in this game after 2 months of playing.
