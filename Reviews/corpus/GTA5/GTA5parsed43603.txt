Ive always loved the Grand Theft Auto series, but this thing they got going with GTA V has got to stop. Singleplayer has been completely neglected, while online is getting turned into a hackerinfested pay to win game.Why? Well heres whyEverything is expensive, while every job gives you nothing. but still, Take Two recently said they werent getting enough money out of their players.. Youre actually able to see how some of the first cars introduced where at a fair price. You can then go look at the recent dlcs and see a price of 10x the first vehicles.Hackers are everywhere and none are really getting detected and banned. Atleast not enough for the game to be playable without hackers everywhere.They recently banned modding in singleplayer in hopes of making SP players go to MP instead. Allegedly it was to stop hackers in MP, even though this aint how it works. So now the only thing thats getting updated with new stuff is the MP part.Some of all the stuff you can do to make money cant be done without being in a session with other players, which means youre kinda FORCED to be with hackers and rich people with big jets. Casual players like me stands no chance against that.RussiansLoading screens are WAAAY too long!Its time to stop being greedy! Youre destroying the title along with Rockstar games! I hate you TakeTwo.
