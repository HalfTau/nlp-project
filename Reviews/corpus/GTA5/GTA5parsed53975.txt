You know..... I JUST BOUGHT THIS 2 WEEKS AGO SO THAT I COULD MOD SP! Why did you had to be s and ban OpenIV?! YOU T2!!!! Its moments like these that make Ubisoft, Activision and EA look like saints that actually care about their communities!People, I cant stress this enough DONT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU PLAN TO START PLAYING ONLINE! YOU WONT ENJOY IT, YOU WILL HATE IT! AND EVEN WORSE, YOU WONT BE ABLE TO SOLVE THAT WITH THE CAMPAIGN MODS BECAUSE THEY REMOVED THEM!I hope other publishers will take this as a lesson to NOT. . WITH. THE. INTERNET. Because if you swing at it, its gonna swing back much much harder.One more thing. Dont blame R blame T2 for OpenIVs death Also, CLOSING OPENIV WONT SOLVE HACKING AND MODDING IN ONLINE!!!! !Damn you T2 and I hope you rot in videogame and internet hell!The man who has millions at the cost of his conscience is a failureB.C. ForbesUPDATE As of 7/6/17. Well we made it T2 backed off OpenIV and OpenIV is back online look I really love this game I sincerely do its just that what T2 did was unforgivable they permanently tainted themselves. Hell even R is ashamed of its parent company I mean its awful that they had to go through this I just hope that other companies dont make a mistake as big as this. Sure recycle your formula or put microtransactions but GOD FORBID IF YOU REMOVE THE MODS. You saw what happened and how it endedStory 10/10Online 4/10 and Im being generous here this would be a 2 if it wasnt for Agent 14s character.Mods 10/10 Buy this for modding sp you will surely enjoy this and extend the lifetime of this game
