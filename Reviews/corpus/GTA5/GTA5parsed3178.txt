Ive waited this game to be released in PC then I start playing it for the first time because I skip the console version, but its worth it. The singleplayer storyline was fun, although its shortended and the map is not as huge as GTA San Andreas. The GTA Online experience is also fun to play, playing Heist with friends with all the laughter etc.
