Have owned the game on PC since it came out. The single player is great, you can spend hundreds of hours outside of the missions which just goes to show how good the free roaming gameplay is. However the reason why I wrote this review is because of the insane number of people online cheating. Rockstars servers clearwly werent design for PC as they can be exploited in so many ways by cheaters. Cheaters can modify almost anything to do with the game such as teleporting any player, killing anyplayer and deciding who kills them, spawning any object, crashing other players game, etc.Therefore, I can not recommend this game
