Singleplayer The story is very good and enjoyable to play through. Wide variety of missions and you rarely do the same thing twice. Characters are good and the voice acting is generally brilliant. Overall great singple player experience.Online The online is pretty fun especially with friends and youll never run out of things to do. BUT everythng is so expensive. Id understand if it was just cosmetics such as cars or something. But its not. Its thinks you require to make your online experience better such as bunkers and facilities. Now you dont NEED these to play but theres hell of a lot less to do if you dont. Its like R is screaming BUY SHARK CARDS despite the game being a huge success. Loading screens are sometimes ridicoulous and end up not loading at all. Not to sure about hacker situation as they only really drop money which isnt such a bad thing.Overall Great game thats slowly being ruined by the online. I do still reccomend this game because it is still a good game with a lot of content.7/10
