Im glad I have a second account to talk about this game.  Screw TakeTwo for this nonsense they pulled with mods, deeming them illegal in a single player sense.  I bought this game on PC for the mods.  I own 4 copies of the game, and for what?  Typical cooperations, blinded by the wall of money.Dont get this game, or any TakeTwo game, if youre looking to mod.  Dont even give them a dime if youre not modding.
