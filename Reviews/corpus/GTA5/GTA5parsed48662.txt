Support OpenIV The developers have given their community no free roam for a game we spent over 80 dollars on, The development team for thousands of mods had always respected take two/rockstar for their game and programs and this is the way you treat the community who have paid and stuck by the teams especially after their P2W cards were introduced, this is disgraceful and you Rockstar and Take two are just money hungry.One piece of advise for the developing team of GTA V, deal with the hackers ONLINE, in your own online servers, in all platforms and leave the others that are modding OFFLINE alone.Lastly, if i could get a refund i would, theres no reason to own a game on PC when the hackers are all over the only multiplayer platform you people will allow, which is your own. Stop cheaping out when you have made so much money over the years after the release and spend some on actual security for your players. You should be ashamed of yourself.
