One of the worst online experience ever !! The solo is nothing but a masterpiece but the online part, which is the main reason people play this game nowadays, must really and sincerely be one of the worst Ive ever played. Just look at all the other reviews saying the same thing !Endless after endless loading screens, game filled with cheaters, missions and world riddled with bugs. Its the bottom line of fun, you spend your time driving around going from point A to B and often restarting because of bugs. And dont start me on other players, ruining even further the game.A shame, a real shame.
