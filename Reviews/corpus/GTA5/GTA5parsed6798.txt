The constant refusal for dlc and content for singleplayers and the over riddiculous grind fest that is online, makes this game the gta so far. I hate the coperate greed on display, ps there are mods to unlock all content that is online for single player, so they could have easily just unlocked for single player without any problem, but then they couldnt sell you micro transactions.
