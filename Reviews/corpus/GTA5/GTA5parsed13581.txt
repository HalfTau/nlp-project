i am  refunding my game, due to the fact i cant transfer my xbox character to pc i wasted over 70 for a pc version only to find out that youve stopped transferring. Got gta day 1 never used any exploits, never cheated, I stuck through all the money grinding. I just didnt know how little you cared about the fans. the game just keeps getting worse and worse, every new update is just as bad as the last.
