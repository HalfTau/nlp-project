I loved GTA for such a long time but with Take Two misfit it makes this game unplayable and removing the communities hard work with spending there own time to making these for free for the community and have it taken down by a company that just wants it for money. What they should do is add workshop support or something close to that and make modding more easier to use and not touch the onlineEDIT YES! gta is back with mods thanks to rockstar listening but items are still overpriced in online but other then that great game
