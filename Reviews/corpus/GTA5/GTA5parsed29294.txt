So i go out and support Rockstar by buying this game on pretty much every console until the PC version came out, so i can install some cool mods and play again. I pay 60 for this game when its quite old now and now i cant mod my PC SINGLE PLAYER GAME!!!?????? IM DONE!!! Uninstalled it. Bad move Take Two. Next time i buy a rockstar game, it will be from a bargain bin.
