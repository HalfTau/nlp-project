The story mode is one of the best out there. Unforutnatley once youre finished with the story mode youre forced to play the trash online mode that requires you to play useless heists that were created by a bunch of monkeys with keyboards. Stopping there is giving the game too much respect. Pay to win? how about PAY TO FUING HAVE FUN? ANYTHING THATS FUN REQUIRES YOU TO BUY VIRTUAL DEBIT CARDS AS IF YOURE NOT ALREADY IN  DEBT IRL ALREADY. Rockstar, please make your game fun again. oh yah and gl trying to farm money, after buying some uninspired buisness as well as a low tier sorry excuse for a bike gang that only has you spending more money to try and make money, I LOST MY 900K JUST RANDOMLY! THANKS ROCKSTAR Ill ENJOY MY 80GB ON MY SSD THANKS!
