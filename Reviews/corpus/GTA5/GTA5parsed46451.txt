I used to like GTA V a lot. But Take Two that garbage company that publish rockstar games just made modding in GTA V illigal. Do not blame Rockstar for this, the only company that did this was take two. Me myself played the GTA story mode with car mods and redux graphics mod, but Take two made an end of that. The main reason Take two did that was to let people pay Sharkcards with the only goal to make more money. I just wont play GTA V anymore until modding comes back!
