I would like to help a good cause by making a positive review on the game.With recent addition of gunrunning, OpenIV modding tool was successfully banned by The Suits along with other major modding. Thos others, hardly modding tools. Lets be honest the actual usage of those is hacking and as such they should be treated.Without the modding tool, the game as the whole is to be recommended as the main title says Grand Theft Auto V review. It doesnt show the last update only, so it means its for the game as a whole. And again, I am happier with those tools banned. Would I write a review for the latest update only, it would be as the whole neutral. Something was taken something of similar value was given. When you encounter a hacker, hed start adding money to your account and other crap. I would say Okaay, someone gave me a lot of money, great. Oh wait, what will I do now? I can afford everything. And in that moment the game looses the meaning. Whats the point of playing the game without playing it right? Without goals to achieve, etc., etc. You would encounter a hacker every 5th session, I expect it will be much, much less often. So in the end I would rate the last update as positive.Thank you for reading.UPDATERockstar has launched a contest for their own new GTA editor. I hope it will replace the banned ones with better integrity against hacks.
