Everyones hating on the game for the mod banning, but to be honest there wasnt much of a choice. Modding got out of control on GTA Online, and they had to do something. Regardless, GTA V is definitely worth the money. The story mode is phenomenal, and the amount of detail that was put in the game is amazing. The online aspect is impressive, and the heists are great, even though its annoying to wait for people to join and when a troll joins your heist just to leave and start everything over. Overall, even after four years, its still one of the most impressive games Ive ever seen.
