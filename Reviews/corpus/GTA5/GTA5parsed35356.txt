After 395 hours played into GTA V, I cannot recommend it. Single player is neglected beyond the morgue, and multiplayer is exploited not just by the players, but the creators themselves by notching down the value of each new material that is released just a week after its release. Also worth mentioning instead of tracking those responsible for modding, the whole community was squandered by losing their hard earned money thanks to Rockstars incompetence of moderating the game.Gameplay is good, graphics are good too, the rest looks like it came from hell, which kills the gameplay value.
