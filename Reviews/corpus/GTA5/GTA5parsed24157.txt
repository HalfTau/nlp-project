What a bunch of whiny little sooky s some people are. I dont care that Take Two sent a cease and desist to open4. I am a working adult who enjoys playing the game without  the need to mod/cheat. If ya dont like it the way it is dont play it.Rockstars statement on the whole thing?TakeTwos actions were not specifically targeting single player mods. Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody, Rockstar said.Rockstars ban is a result of people like me getting sick of the cheats online and asking for something to be done. People reviewing this game ought to ask themselves how they would react when cheats mess with their fun? They would beright?If ya want your single player mod tools to remain by all means have them, but if you abuse the mods and mess with innocents who just wanna have fun in the game online dont sook.Nothing but a bunch of sooky little kids who are crying coz they got a smack. Harden up cheatards!
