Single player is fun. This could be one of the best online games ever. Rockstar will bleed your wallet. If you want to grind it out and not pay to win more like pay not to get trolled you still have to deal with stuff like trolls in a jet fighter droping bombs on your head when your trying to get around town doing the grind. The other players are toxic. I lost all enjoyment playing this game online. I want it to be good but the system is screwed with the pVp killing going on
