Rockstar and Take Two have shown all they care about is GTA Onlines horrible microtransaction system by removing many of the abilities to exclusivel mod SINGLEPLAYER. This is totally insane. The economic system in Online is also horrible, requiring tens of hours of boring repetitive gameplay of the same mission which give you the most money to get a good vehicle. you Rockstar, and  you Take Two.
