Normally I would rate this game positively. I enjoy it greatly. Though I cant recommend it due to Take Two Interactives new policy of shutting down the modding scene. Until this policy is reversed I will never be purchasing any Take Two product. I certainly cant wait to see them do this to Kerbal Space Program where the mod scene is so incredibly prolific.
