After having over 700 hours in this game on PS3, PS4 and PC, I think its finally time to review this game, FIrst I would like to say this games gives FREE DLC. While Shark Cards do cost real money, your really dont need it. Rockstar constantly provide new jobs, races and other different game modes where you can make tons of money. I suggest players invest in the CEO buissness since it has a stable pay grade with almost little effort. Aside from what they provide in game, the game itself looks amazing. GTA5s open world is probably the best open word in any game. There is always something to do in online lobbies. From killing other players to participating in certin events, the open world never runs out of things to do. In addition to that, the graphics arew amazing. Any graphic card above a 780ti, the graphics will look amazing. Althought one tip I can give users is that you should get really good RAM for this game. Its a huge game and the game requires lots of memory if you want smooth performance. My build includes a i5 4670k, gtx970, 8 gigs of RAM. With everything set to stock speeds, I can average the game aroundf 5050 FPS.If you dont want to read all that, Im going to just list pros and cons.Pros FREE DLCOPEN WORLDAMAZING GRAPHICSEASY TO RANK UP ONLINEIN GAME MONEY IS EASY TO OBTAINGAME DOSENT REQUIRE A SUPER COMPUTER TO RUNConsHAVING FASTER AND A LARGER AMOUNTS OF RAM IS NEEDED FOR SMOOTHER GAMEPLAYLOADING TIME IS LONGONCE YOU HIT LEV EL 150 YOU NEED TO WAIT FOR DLC TO GET NEW THINGSMODDERS CAN RUIN THE ONLINE EXPIRENCE SOMETIMES although rockstar is good and taking them out
