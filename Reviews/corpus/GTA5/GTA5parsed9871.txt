This game was good in the beginning but ended up badWhat I liked Single player The characters The onlineWhat I dont like Prices are too high Sharkcards are unbalanced The rich can pick off the poor players, they cant defend themselfs The money you can make in game is unbalanced, 100 k for a maxed out weed factory or 400 k for a max cocaine lockup isnt that much for the work you have to do the story isnt clear what the end goal is The things they add doesnt belong in the world of gta 5That was my review
