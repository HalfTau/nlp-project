Bought this game for the modding.As of today, TakeTwo has sent cease/desist orders to modders.No more modding.Because people were modding things from GTA Online into the single player game.No more mods.Because they want people in GTA Online so they can charge microtransactions.Never buying another Rockstar game ever.
