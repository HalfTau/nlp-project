First off most of my hours are online being a loyal user! But today August 28, 2017 they took all my online money from me that took tons of hours to achieve. Everything online is crazy expensive, which in turn makes you have to buy a sharkcard which is the only way their still releasing DLCs and new content which is honestly pay to play in my book.If it takes over 10 hours to get a decent amount of  to spend it on cars, helis, ect. Then you can spend that in seconds.   Then again a sharkcard if you want more stuff. If they made it that you could do a heist or a job then have millions to spend all night with your friends instaed of a money war which is like the world today! Good Job Rockstar Keep it
