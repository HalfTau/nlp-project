Game was fun at launch, now its just a money grab to get people to buy in game currency at absurd prices. Economy of the game is inflated beyond playability. Get yourtogether. The development of this game has been pathetic and anyone who has been in a position to make decisions that has led the game to its current state should be ashamed of themselves for letting it get this bad. Your game is bad and you should feel bad.
