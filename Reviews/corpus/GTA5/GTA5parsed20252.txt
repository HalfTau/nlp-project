Dont even log into GTA Online. just buy it on PS or xbone. Game is still infested with people using cheats to greif servers.  notice how i said chets instead of hacks? since people are more concerned with symantics rather that the issue that this game is a wate of money.In all seriousness the SIngle player mode is alright, but nothing amazing.Went 2 for 2 in trash lobbys tonight, within 20 minutes in each lobby i was ejected from my car and blown up untill i left the lobby. while on passive in a auto shop.Decided to post about it on the forums and was met with people being toxic.Ex Hurr Duur people getting greifed is funny.  every post followed this logic, or people claiming that they hack just to watch people get frustrated.well it wont be funny when you have no one left to play online with and the game dies, followed by a massive lack in sales for GTA 6 if that even becomes a thing.and people wonder why PC gamming gets a bad repDont feel like getting banned for somone else blowing up my car, and me, and the entire sessions population. Knowing T2 and RSs hot streaks with bans im just going to uninstall.Honestly let this be a warning to anyone looking to buy the game , if you want online content look elsewhere.
