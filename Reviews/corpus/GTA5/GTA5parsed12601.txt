Single player is decent. Online is cancer.Do you like playing a game where you have to grind for weeks to buy insanely price inflated vehicles, where every lobby has someone modding/cheating, cheaters who use those cheating programs to do nothing but grief and/or cripple legitimate players so that they can even more easily win already easy challenges, a joke of a reporting system that is purely aesthetic, wrongful bans for legit players, no bans at all for cheaters, scripted responses from Rockstar that expect you to deliver a laundrylist of information on alleged cheaters to the point that you would need to record your entire play sessions only to get another scripted response that amounts to nothing, all while getting spammed to dump even more money on shark cards into a game that should very well be free?Then this is definitely a game for you.
