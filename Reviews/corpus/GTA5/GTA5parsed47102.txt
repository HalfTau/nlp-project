A singleplayer game turned multiplayer turned massive cash grab. Take Two wants you online so they can drain your wallet in a pay to win environment and thus decided to remove mods from singleplayer. Im surprised they havent outright removed singpleplayer, the root of all evil that prevents them from earning more money.
