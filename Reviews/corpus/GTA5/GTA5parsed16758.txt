One of the most popular broken games in history? At least the online aspect... Dont waste your time  money.I wanted to expand on this review to give others a more detailed list of reasons to avoid this game. First of all this is focused more on the GTA online side of things but some of which still apply to offline play.1. This game has some of the most derpy feeling character control i have ever used. Its far too easy to jump off of bridges and roofs by accident and die or get shot by other players.2. Unfair competition  pay to win. You WILL get killed by other players that have an advantage over you because of the fact that they can afford cars/helicopters/planes with turrets on them. One way of fixing this is to turn on Passive Mode.. But the problem with passive mode is you cant use any of the weapons you just spent 100s of thousands of in game dollars on.3. The modding community. Imagine all of the above negatives affecting your play only to suddenly include constant death from exploding out of nowhere, the reason?.. You have become the target of a modder. They have the abilities to control what weapons, vehicles and even the amount of money your character has. So after spending a bunch of real money on in game money you have to now worry about whether it is even still there.
