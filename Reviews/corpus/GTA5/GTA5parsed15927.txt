Me and my buddies mostly play in a session together and block everyone else out of the session. Two of them were banned, for the same reason  losing connecting to the game constantly for a few days because of internet stability issues. Thats right, if you constantly lose connection to Rockstars servers, you will be banned and you cannot appeal it under any circumstances, along with having your account wiped.Now, they have ripped 2 million out of my account for no apparent reason. I have never received modded money, and especially not 2 million worth. All my friends have lost between 800k and 2mil. We normally only play in a session together, so I have no idea how we could have received so much modded money.The game itself is great, however I cannot recommend a game from a company with such an appalling way to deal with their customers. The games multiplayer is a P2P system rather than dedicated servers, a part of the reason for the massive amount of cheating in this game  and it will always be like this as long as there are no dedicated servers. I have lost trust in Rockstar because who knows, I might log on one day and be randomly banned and lose everything without being able to appeal.
