Take2s attitude towards modders and the modding communinity gives me no choice but to give Grand Theft Auto V a negative review. In no way am I saying that it is overall a bad game, its one of my favourites, but i cant recommend Grand Theft Auto V if you are looking into modding your game  modding being a useful and different way to play your game that you likely paid full price for. Furthermore, Take2s reasoning behind the mod ban frustrates me, they say that it is to protect players who are playing GTAOnline, yet the OpenIV mod only effects Story Mode  the mode that I and many others primarily play. Its as if Take2 assume that everyone is only playing the online mode. In many ways i cannot stand GTAOnline, it is riddled with microtransactions and loadtimes, and is likely the reason we do not have a Single Player expansion pack DLC. If you are not concerned in modding your game or supporting modders, then i would recommend you buy GTA V  its fantastic
