Single player was surprisingly fun. Characters are well developed, with excellent voice over. GTA Online on the other hand is a hit or miss. Plenty of trolls around, and the best way to play GTA Online would be with friends, or a group of similar minded individuals. Ill give it a thumbs up, but recommend buying it only when sales are on.
