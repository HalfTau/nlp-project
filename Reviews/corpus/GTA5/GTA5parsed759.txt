If you are looking for a game that is not all about grinding then this is not the game for you. When the game first came out it everyone played the strory and I really enjoyed it. However when it comes to the online aspect you are either grinding for hours of end to get the best car so you can legit do well in races with for then a new dlc to come out and there is a new car that is better and you are having to do the same thing all over again or you are doing the same for the weaponised viecles so you even remotly stand a chance against greifers and moders and even then they can even come out on top and the shark cards even though they may be a quick way of getting money it is really overpriced for the little that you do get. Look I may not hate the game all together as I have made most of my online friends though this game and we have had fun together on the ocasion, it is just way to time consuming and it just isnt fun anymore because I am worring about keeping up with everything
