The only bad thing about this game is the overpriced items in online, every new update the prices always increases for these new items which is kinda forcing you to buy sharkcards, which also makes Rockstar money hungrySo if you saw a youtube video were you saw something like the Avenger and made you go  Wow! i am so going to get that ingame myself! then dont get excited because itll take you forever.Has GTA Online become pay to win? In my opinion, Yes kinda.
