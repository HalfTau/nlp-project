Devs/Publishers banned modding online. Fine. I wish they offered the option for private/dedicated servers so I could mod with friends, but whatever.Now, youve issued a CD on a modder? For offline play?Remember when modders got job offers, not CDs?I got this game as a gift, and still somehow feel like I wasted my money.
