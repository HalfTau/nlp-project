Almost unplayable online because of all the glitches. Very difficult to get onto a job without something going wrong. Constantly end up on loading screens that go on indefinitely so you have to restart the game. Dont know how more people arent complaining about this. I just went 25 minutes trying to get onto any mission at all and it kept kicking me. My connection is perfect by the way. 3/10, would be 10/10 if they fixed these issues.
