Solo game okayish. If you want to optimize your playtrough and be able to buy everything, you need to delay some missions until the very end though, requiring metagaming. This is a big nono for me as it artificially require you to restart the game if you want a perfect save.The online ?Loading screen simulator pay to win garbage.Even with a very good computer and fiber connection, you will spend most of your time in loading screens. Devs should ither go the mmo way, where all actions, menus and lobby are accessible from the free roam and only specific missions are instanced, or go the overwatch/payday way, where you are always in menu except when playing missions. As it is the game is good potential ruined by the iest UX i have seen in a game above the 5 price mark.Verdict Only buy this game for the offline, the online is not worth it. And as it is, there are better game with fun/money ratio. If I knew in advance of its limitation, I would only have bought GTA V below 20 bucks.
