Its Grand Theft Auto its pretty great. Rockstar has supported modding for years but their parent company Take Two Interactive have just banned the creation tool which was the base for most mods on GTA5 and modding is illegal now according to them. I already had this game on the ps3 and I bought it mostly for the mods and the graphics and other updates of the next gen. Mods kept this game alive and fresh Bad Form Take Two really. anyone want to spend more money in the online mode now? thats why mods are dead. because SHARRK cards Bro. stupid stupid move whomever is responsible should be fired.
