When it comes to single player this game lives up to the GTA name and gives us an amazing story with a big open world.But multiplayer is kind of neutral ground, there might be free DLCs every now and then but theres no way to make enough money to buy the stuff they add with these expansions, they keep prices high so people have to buy shark cards for real .Im giving it a thumbs up for the single player experience only.
