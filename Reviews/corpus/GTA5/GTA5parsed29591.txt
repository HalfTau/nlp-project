All I want in this game is to play a closed session with my friends with nothing but a few car retextures that do not effect anyone negatively. However, Take2 decided that we cant have nice things and instead they will shove microtransactions down our throats and let North Korea and their nukes rule the online lobbies hackers. This is why I will not reccommend this game, Take2 is greedy, lazy and all they want is your money!
