I played gta5 on and off on xbox360. Purchased on PC solely for modding purposes I enjoy crafting and releasing mods for various games you may have played a couple of my mods for Skyrim, but I never really published anything worthwhile for gta5.GTA5 was slated to have three separate dlcs for single player, yet it has received none. This is due to how well their microtransactions have been received for their multiplayer, netting them obscene amounts of cash easily in the millions, if not billions, but I dont have those numbers in front of me.  They treazted this game like a freetoplay android app, where everything is only unlockable with purchasing ingame currency, or grinding for days straight.Unfortunately for us, apparently R/T2 found we were still spending too much time in single player mode, and wants the rest of us to switch to their onlineonly format to purchase their microtransactions.  So theyve effectively banned the largest modding tool, as they claim it allows people to hack currency that they want people to pay for.So they killed single player with zero promised expansions to focus only on a grindfest/microtransaction hell, found that still too many people were not playing multiplayer, and effectively banned mods.Another dev/publisher that I refuse to purchase from, hot on the heels of Bethesda. Awesome.To be fair, it makes sense from a business standpoint they arent concerned about longevity, or how many interesting mods can be created for GTA5.  They have an interest in returning investment to their investors, and I guess people go hogwild for microtransactions in this era of gaming.  I just refuse to continue to support this practice, and encourage you to do the same.
