I thought it was a decent game for what its worth, back when it came out. But things have changed, and the overwhelming focus by take two on microtransactions and online grinding have turned me off from the game on a personal level for quite some time. The recent revelopments of take two now deciding that they need to quash out mods in order to presumably make more money for themselves via shark cards are the final straw for me, and will do what I can to avoid take two products going forward. I may have already bought the game and played it for 60 hours, but I can still leave this negative review and maybe new gamers will take a hint that take two is one of the worst kind of money grubbing game publishers.
