Rockstar is trying pretty hard to push online and their cash system to sell shark cards but at the same time they have given up moderation it seems of people modifying the game in online servers. A lot of people ruin the online experience for tons of people, and Rockstar has made it clear that they dont have plans to improve single player. Love the game but its getting longer and longer between when I boot it up.
