Outstanding singleplayer. I recommend it.Horrible multiplayer experience rampant cheating that can cost you as noncheater your game key microtransaction hell grindfest.But, here is my definite downvoteIn preparation of monetizing vulgo suck dry the playerbase even more shark cards, anyone? this is the first company ever to declare modding ILLEGAL.Yes, you read correctly, as of 5.6.2017 modding of the singleplayer experience was declared ILLEGAL. They started to send out CeaseandDesist letters and took down the popular mod tool OpenIV already, no kidding.Because if singleplayer gets nice funny content from ambitious people for free, no one should have it apparently.Instead of taking on the rampant cheating and horrific experience in multiplayer. Or selling a DLC extending singleplayer.As a sane adult, and on behalf of the OpenIV community, it is my civil duty to give this a full hearted downvote. Insert many, many,...., many swearwords here. Unspeakable ones. You  beep  beep   beep fubeeping pieces of beep mothbeepers.Whats even more worrying is the fact, that this hellish publisher recently aquired Kerbal Space Program, a title with a vivid modding community..yeah..right.I dont think so, fellas.As of 16.6.2017, this title accumulated several thousend negatve reviews within a matter of hours. Serves them right. Because it is our voice that makes things count and decides on THEIR earnings. Unhappy customers? Doh...Verdict buy on a sale for the singleplayer experience. 40 Bucks tops for a game from 2015. 30 bucks for a nonmoddable game.
