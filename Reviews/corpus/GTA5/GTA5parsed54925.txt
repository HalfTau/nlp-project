This is the first time I have ever typed out a review for a game on steam. I gladly support all the modders around the globe and for Take2 to cut them all out is wrong. To the people that enjoy mods like myself, we cannot let this slide. I love Rockstar and all of their games They literally had nothing to do with this but as a community we cannot side idle. I will not stand for this.
