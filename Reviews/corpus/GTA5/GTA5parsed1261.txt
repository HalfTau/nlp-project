most unbalance game i ever played before. if you spend 1M on business and you start with supplies on open roam so other players will fk you up  and somehow you manage doing that you will get wrecked trying selling. i just stop playing after this happeni was MC and i have another player on my side. we bein giving an unarmed chopper to deliver the goods and some other player decide to take us down so he come from the end of the map in a second on jet fighter so i jumped and shoot him like 30 time with guided rocket i manage not to hit him just make him crash one because somehow the jet can escape any thing. and before we move on he just spawn another jet finally he left the game i toke the chopper to complete the mission but guess what it stopt before the mission finish and give me no money at all bear in mind i spend 20k in ammo and armor so fk you rookstar
