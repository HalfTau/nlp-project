Not minding every hacker or griefer thats bound to be in literally every server, the game on its own is actually pretty good.The singleplayer is well worth it on its own, I finished it but didnt mess around with everything.If you have a couple of friends, online is a blast. While things will require ridiculous amount of grinding to be able to afford them, with a few buddies its quite enjoyable to just do missions and mess around in between them.
