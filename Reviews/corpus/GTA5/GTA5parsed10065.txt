Yea I am too early for a review, but I really liked this game!For singleplayer I would recommend it, no questions asked!Story, Gameplay, Setting, Dialouges, I liked all of them.Overall I would give it a 9 or 8 out of 10.One more thing, I bought this game on 50 discount. And I am very much satisified for what I paid.If you want to play only the Singplayer, then dont pay the full price.As for the multiplayer, I havent played it. And... most of the reviews say its absolutley trash because of Rockstars banning system.
