SP R really tried to get back to 3D era roots and make it as packed with content as it was in San Andreas. In my opinion, it worked well. Game is really fun.MP Ghastly abomination with ingame purchases despite having 60 price tag, grindy as your average korean MMO, amateur coded network, almost no cheat protection and as a result, thousands of cheating mouthbreathers exploding you and make it look like you explode everyone, among other things. Avoid it, for your own good. FiveM is better.
