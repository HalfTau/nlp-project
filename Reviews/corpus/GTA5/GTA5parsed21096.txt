Despite the immense amounts of negative feedback this game has received recently, and the cancerous YouTube communinty that surrounds it. Id say this game is still worth purchasing if you like to play with friends online. It has fun gameplay, a vareity of different activitys to do, and not to mention an amazing open world. Even if multiplayer isnt of any interest to you, you can still play the amazing singleplayer aspect of the game. And with the return of modding, after the whole fiasco over its legality that is, there even more content to enjoy. Overall, if you are in a position to buy this game, I suggest you do. Thank you.
