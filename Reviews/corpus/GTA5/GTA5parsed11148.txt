Modders are everywhere, expect one in at least 1/3 of your games.Driving an important car for a mission? Kicked out of it and unable to walk.Chilling in your apartment? Tanks are being spawned on you to try and crash your game.It seems like the only modders that have gotten banned are those who drop money for other players. Actual hostile modders are allowed to ruin the game for everyone else as long as they dont mess with Shark Card sales. Despicable.EDIT I should say that the single player story part of this game is top notch. So many small details and things you can do in Los Santos make it feel really genuine and a blast to play. The above is only for the online part of the game, which is where I clocked most of my hours in. If youre thinking of buying this game for the single player, I highly recommend it.
