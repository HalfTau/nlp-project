I wish I could give this game a thumbs up but sadly I cant although I have a ton of fun in this game it is only because i have plenty of friends who play it with me and even then it is only two hours of fun then you all stop playing for a while then you all do it again later and then repeat. I really wish that rockstar could add a story dlc like they have done before but sadly rockstar is only after money now, it really breaks my heart to see such an amazing franchise change for the worse, I really hope that rockstar changes back to what they were like in the olden days, but until then i will sit here waiting and hoping like every other gta franchise lover.
