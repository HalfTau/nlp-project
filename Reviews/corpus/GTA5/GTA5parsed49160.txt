Im gonna say right off the bat that this game used to be a blast. The Online was a bit grindy, but fun. The singleplayer was good, and had the oodles of mods created by community members to add tons of longevity to the game. Unfortunately, the multiplayer is no longer fun unless you already have the money to get everything you want or unless you really really enjoy grinding  missions all day. The singleplayer, while still an enjoyable experience, has lost what gave previous GTA games so much, the mods. With Take Two sending a Cease and Desist to the developers of OpenIV, they have clearly shown that they dont give aabout their customers.Even if this game was still a blast to play, i cant recommend supporting a publisher with such strong AntiCustomer policies.
