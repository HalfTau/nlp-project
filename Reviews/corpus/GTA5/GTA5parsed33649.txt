Great game, why is everyone hating on latest take 2 thing...And why are their so many reports people with like 1hour of gameplay reviwing the game? and hating..You are also reported under breach of steams TOS, though with a comment like this im sure you may have already been comment banned in the past as you know reporting such reviews as yours is a reportable offence, and can have you blocked, please keep note if you have been review banned in the past, you can get a perm.. because first is usually temporary nice game hours, either pirated, or a troll, or stolen game, you have no right to post such a review
