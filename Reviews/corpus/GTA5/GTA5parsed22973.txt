Bunch of moneygrabbing  with no thought to their community, they say they are releasing all these new exciting features and ways to make money but with the latest update it has just become even clearer that all they want is money, especially considering the game is quite old now. Its just outrageous considering some people have already bought the game for 40 odd quid, and then have to pay a pretty penny more just to enjoy the game that they payed for.Unless you plan to hack in money or know someone that will do so for you then I would strongly recommend avoiding this game.
