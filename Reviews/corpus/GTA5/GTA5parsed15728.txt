I absolutely love the story, and multiplayer aspect of this game. This is one of the best games ever. There are so many moments to be made online and offline. Recently people have been complaining about R taking money away from them, i have not experienced this so i cannot comment on it. Either way if you want to get lost in hours and hours of gameplay, play this game!
