DOnt listen to the cry baby modders about their reason for negative review. Rockstar didnt ban modding but thier publisher did because it uses a injection system which can and is used for hacks on multiplayer. Multiplayer used to be great untill you get teleported around, cars blows up by someone looking at it, among countless other things that go on. Dont blame rockstar, they are trying to fight for modders about working a solution out. The reason I use quotes around modders is because when you are in single player you are a modder, but as soon as you come into multiplayer with that crap you become a hacker/cheater. Game is great, I hope now they clean up multiplayer so it is fun again!
