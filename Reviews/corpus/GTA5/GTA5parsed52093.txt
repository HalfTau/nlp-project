The game is fun and all, but the recent shut down of modding in the form of OpenIV is what makes this reveiw negative. By not supporting modding they are making everyone angry. Thai claimed that the mod allowed online cheats, despite the fact that OpenIV do their best to not change the online for this very reason. Instead of contacting the developer of OpenIV when they Rockstar allegedly discovered some new hacks enabled by OpenIV and ask them to fix whatever allowed it, they instead sent an illegal cease and desiest order to which the OpenIV team had to comply to not have to endure expensive lawyer fees and a court settlement. This is t, and my negative review will stay up untill TakeTwo bnacktrack from this. If they do not, then I cannot reccomend their games aymore including Kerbal Space Program.
