Ive played this game since it came out on PC. Ive always been a big fan of the GTA series especially the PC version. Mostly because of all the mods. I have been playing modded GTA since GTA III. FFS, the first online GTA gameplay was in vice city and that was created by modders!!Ive thrown so many hours into LSPDFR and just dicking around with all the mods available.Take Two, youve taken a past time away from me. Shame on you.
