Mutiplayer is just a scam to get you to buy overpriced shark cards. Singleplayer is worth the purchase , but they are not going to release any singleplayer DLC even though they said awhile back that they would. They got lost in all the money idiots were spending on the multiplayer scam. Only recently have people realized that the mutiplayer was just a scam , to bad it is to late. The idiot players set the tone since they spent so much on shark cards not realizeing the scam they were buying into. Any and all singleplayer DLC was scrapped because of this. Now they are just doing BS multiplayer DLC. They overpirce it in game with in game currency to bait people into buying shark cards , and people spend HUNDREDSLITERALLY of dollars on DLC that would cost 23 dollars in any other game.
