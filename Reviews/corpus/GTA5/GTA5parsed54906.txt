I cant believe Take Two would do something so terribly greedy. People who have spent the past decade making their games enjoyable long after all of the original content has been completed have seen all their hard work go down the drain. These people took pains to ensure that OpenIV cannot be used alongside GTA Online. The real problem with Online hackers are the coders and gamefile editors who corrupt files while playing Online, NOT people installing singleplayer mods.This will do literally nothing to curb Online cheaters they will continue to do what they do, which has nothing to do with OpenIV. I wish this decision would hurt Take Two financially, but I know that the main market for Shark Cards 10yearolds who buy them with mommys money so they can go online and insult peoples mothers wont be affected.What a shame.
