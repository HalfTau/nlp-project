Before, it was soooo good dont get me wrong. This is great games! Amazing story for offline! Online are also great, but nowadays after u complete story mode...U began to play online..things are messed up!I mean  EVERY. ING. TIME... They will keep calling you to buy new things that came to the game Such as facilities, army bunkers, CEO base, Motorcycle Club, etc.. THESE DLC WILL KEEP COMING AND NOT STOPPING..its annoying how u will get spamming on and advertising every 5 minutes while u are free roaming exploring stunning Los santos, drive cars or shoot someone AND the players that annoys you in free roam...THESE AI will keep calling you no matter what you do. Hey go to foreclosure.mazebank. BLAH BLAH BLAH FROM RON, FROM LESTER, FROM MC, FROM CEO, FROM etc..... I mean GO  YOURSELF its annoying! The rest its pretty good, believe me Offline and Online are both fun to enjoy, graphics, story, gameplays are amazing 3 Huge addicting love!...But advertisement are killing the game, otherwise stay with fake one and play offline if you are not serious with online with ur friends...because nowadays ONLINE are EFFD UP...Stop spamming to all the players and yes plz banned the hackers already ALSO..Rockstar started to turned original grand theft auto into a fantasy saints row already, wheres the original realistic mastermind or gang stuff goes?...Please improve it...i know new things must come, but the way u do is what people loves. For me you must conserve what this game goalsgta sa fans? etc... Keep it coming!
