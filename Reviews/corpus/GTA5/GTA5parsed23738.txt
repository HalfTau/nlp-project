I like the game not the buisness plan for the game. TakeTwo are just a bunch of money craving jews that just want shark cards. while writing the review i have played this game for 44 hours and all i have to show for it is two run down garadges one semi expensive vehicle and a cheap phenoix i picked up off the street.
