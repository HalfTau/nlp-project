 Not optimised.. at all. I have to use lowest settings to get an unstable 45 FPS whereas in games like Overwatch I can get 75 on Ultra. Cars float over the road, or youd think so based on how they handled No idea what to do between missions cause they all seem to just end. I guess I just wait until someone decides to call me... Dont press anything when the Rockstar intro video is running cause it will crash your entire computer. Rockstar think their game is an Operating System cause it wants to run in Safe Mode after it crashes Rockstar think their game is an Operating System cause it has to run a 10 second process to shutdown Rockstar promotes largescale outsourcing which explains the above stated issues. The physics engine is unacceptable for this day and age. It hasnt improved at all since titles as old as Vice City The graphics is bad. Maybe this is related to being forced on low settings but even fundemental stuff like hair and models are at 2005 levels compared with what other companies can put out. Dialogue is excessive. Entertaining for the first 2 sentences and then its just a bore.
