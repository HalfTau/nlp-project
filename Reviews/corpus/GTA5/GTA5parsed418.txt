Been playing since the initial release on PS3 and Xbox 360, played on Xbox One, and came to PC, had to start completely over due to the player transfer function being removed, but oh well. Lets get started.The Pros Very well optimized Fun experience with many hours of gameplay The great GTA experience everyone loves GTA Online is funThe ConsGTA Online It has seriously turned into a massive cash grind, costs to afford even small things have gone up so dramatically you will need to grind a few days to get something small, incentivizes shark card purchases, or the starter pack, both of which will honestly not get you far.The community is very bad, comparing to the console versions, Ive seen very few modders on the consolereleases, however they run rampant here, as if R care very little for the PC community, it can makegameplay unplayable at times. Especially when you may not even know if they are modding, and justmake it look like they are superior to you in any wayControls Some controls are good, lots are bad, even with adjustments being made. I had to use Synapse to get the sensitivity even close to usable, combine this with the fact the gamepad has more options than the KBM, for example the ability to change accuracy between aiming mode and looking mode. Operating helicopters was awful, however it was fixable. The jet however I was unable to fix, I have auto center mouse activated for jets and my mouse refuses to follow the jets POV, making it nauseating to operate a jet, and almost impossible to actually combat enemy players in one. Overall I reccomend this game, because despite its problems I continue to play it, even though I hate it with every fiber of my being.
