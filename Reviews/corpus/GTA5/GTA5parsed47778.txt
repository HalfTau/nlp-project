Freedom choices of mods from different creative creators.Story strongly connected to our free roaming actions.A super realistic open world game.Graphics never gets old. Players can enchanced their graphics by downloading mods reshade, natural visionSuperb choices of music in the radio.Hundreds choices of vehicles to be purchased.Busy, moving world.Different selection of ingame sports to play if were bored.Hundreds of player/character custimizations Low, Medium, High end shirts to haircut.AI loves to give positive or negative comments to our main character.Poor online services for meSome minor bugs does not really bother meYou can no longer do police missions  mods are avalable LSPDR etc.AI feels to sensitive for me. Reacts to unnecesarry things.Airplane and road vehicles traffic are not always constant.No yatch/apartments in single player mode C though, mods are availableRockstar Client are not that reliable to use, but overall does the job kind of well.Car mechanics are not that well and also aircrafts control are not the best.Weather dynamics are not that intelligent but again, does the job well.
