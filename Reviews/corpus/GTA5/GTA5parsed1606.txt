The game is quite enjoyable. The story in itself is a masterpiece as it engages you no matter how many times you do it, and there are multiplle endings which is a plus. The only bad thing i have to say about this game is that some of the players who play online are not the most welcoming people and many find ways to make the online aspect easier by modding/hacking, thus ruining the game for themselves and others who take advantage of them.
