They should definitely improve the NPC enemy script, by changing it from Die you piece of sht! to Buy shark cards!, and I dont wanna be here to For Rockstar!Jokes aside, this game is made much more difficult than before, because they want us to buy their shark cards. Just as, making ingame cash harder to earn legitimately does not gain you more income, R. It only makes more people use hack/trainer, and makes playing your game less funny and more painful. Why do we play games? For FUN. If it is not fun, then why do we play it? If no one is playing it, who shall you sell your shark cards to?This used to be a good game. RIP.
