I have over 2000 hours on this game on my Xbox, its very fun until you see how much Rockstar over price cars, but you can have crazy fun in single player with only a trainer Menyoo is the most popular I have over 200 mods on my game and its crazy cool. I have car mods, graphic mods, planes, everything has been changed to make the game like my dream game.I recommend this game if your looking for a game that has hundreds of mods, but online has cars worth 20 real money.I have spent over 3000 on shark cards for this game on my Xbox and I deleted my profile so rip.
