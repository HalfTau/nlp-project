I love GTA.  Ive played through almost all of them since 3 and gone back to play them again in most cases.  V was a breath of fresh air after the grittiness and focus on story over mechanics from IV.  Having 3 characters work together through the campaign keeps things interesting and makes for a varied experience as you play through.  I think most people think of themselves as a Michael but in reality play like Trevor.  Trevor is the epitome of the GTA type player.  He says what he thinks, hell kill you for looking at him funny and he has no moral bones in his entire body.The online is great for passing time.  You can log in and actually earn some money doing races/missions/heists.  Or you can just drive around stealing cars and shooting at people.The one warning Id give for anyone playing this game.  Dont waste your money on the shark cards.  Yes itll get you into endgame online content instantly without the grind.  But there are so many hackers in this game its always a 50/50 risk when you log in online you might get blown up from across the map, banned, or repeatedly shot and blown up for no reason whatsoever.  It doesnt take away from the fun of playing GTA.  But it does make you regret spending real cash.Also  the load time for online is ridiculous.  Sometimes youll sit there for 510 min before even getting in game.  Once you do though...  Ive probably spent 20 hours just trying to break into the secret military base and steal a Jet.  Something that is infinitely easier once you can buy a hangar for your smuggling operations in the base.  But its still a great feeling to break into the base, steal a jet, and fly around shooting things and launching missiles.  This game could have been even better, but its still pretty amazingly fun.
