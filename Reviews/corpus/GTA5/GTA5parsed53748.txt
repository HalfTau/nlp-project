I never liked GTA Online, mostly because MM is about as competent as a jellyfish trying to learn quantum mechanics, also because of hackers. I use a trainer on SP, just to get inf ammo and all that just to have fun, and have an ENB to make it look cool. Well, I had, if it werent for Take Two being s for money and telling their playerbase to take a long walk off a short pier.
