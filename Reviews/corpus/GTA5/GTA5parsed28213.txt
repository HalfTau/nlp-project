People on openIV spent HUNDREDS and possibly THOUSANDS of hours of manwork to make your game better, and what do you do? Shut them down...            game is pretty fun but when the developer and publisher are this  to their fans, I cant go on with supporting them, this isnt even count the greedfest that is GTA online, the most paytowin thing Ive seen for a while...
