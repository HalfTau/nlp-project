First things first, I really think that Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best games ever made. I didnt like it at the beginning, I just fell in love with it while playing the story mode.Now straight to the main point The Online Mode. Even if the players are randomly shooting at you Its fine. You can either befriend or kill them. Your choice. I personally like both approaches. The loading screen aka the waiting game isnt so bad if you are playing with your squad. Its far better than playing a mission for 10 minutes and when the world is dearest someone decides to leave. Sounds tough? How about repeating a heist more than 20 times because someone keeps dying over and over again? Bad things happens but is it worth it? Well yeah it is. It only depends on you whether you survive in San Andreas.I met some strangers at first whit whom I managed to complete all of the heist challenges and I kinda got a little bit rich. If I could do it then so can you.This game is awesome. From the good gameplay, amazing soundtrack and beautiful landscapes to the free content once in a while.Well, you better check it yourself.
