Having Bought Two Copies of GTA V and playing well over three hundred hours on console and PC, I can say that while the single player is great It lacks replayability outside of the heists and going crazy in the free roam. The Online aspect has been the subject of many false promises, Hackers running free, Overpriced Vehicles and weapons and a general cluster of issues. The only thing that made this game worth while to many people anymore is the fact that you can mod this game with a nearly limitless amount of mods to fill many different types of play. A lot of people have put days of their lives into their projects and mods to make this game more then what people thought it could be. TakeTwo however has decided that in an moronic attempt to fix something that shouldve been fixed very early into the release of GTA Online, They should take down OpenIV, Not that it will do any good. GTA Online had so much promise and it was wasted infavor of fairly pointless DLC that costs an incredible amount of ingame money in an obivious ploy to push people to buy Shark Cards
