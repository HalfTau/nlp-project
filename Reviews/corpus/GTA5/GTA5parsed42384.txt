Ah, I remember when they first announced GTA Online.... If you want to have a grand time grinding the same missions over and over again for a meager amount of money unless you grind Asian MMO style, having lobbies full of hackers and griefers, and shark cards, by all means, get this.But if youre like me, theres an entire single player you can mod to your hearts content and never get bored!Oh wait.Thanks Rockstar and TakeTwo.
