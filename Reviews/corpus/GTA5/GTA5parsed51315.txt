So a bit ago, being a broke player, I was grinding my businesses to make more money, update comes around and they state I was given money out of my control and it was a mistake, so they cleared out EVERY LAST IN CENT of my cash I just spent hours collecting. Pisses me off when you have to grind so much for online cash for them to just wipe it away every few months.Each time they do this, makes me regret getting this game, and its such a loss of time each time, you dont even want to open the game.Like , just because some hacker gives me money and I have no control, take the money they gave me away, not every last cent and reduce my level. This has happened so many times now, I dont even know if I will go on multiplayer again.Just buy Vice city or SA. They wont  you like V does.
