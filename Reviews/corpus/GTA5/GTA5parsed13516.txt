I beat the entire game twice. The campaign was really good, but my favorite part was the mods. Playing this game on pc allows you to almost change the game completely with zombie mods, new guns, and even entirely different campaigns.If you can I would highly suggest you get this game. Its perfect to just  around in the sandbox if youve got nothing to do. And same goes with the online mode. Ive got 1,200 and ing around in the sandbox, especialy with mods, never gets old.
