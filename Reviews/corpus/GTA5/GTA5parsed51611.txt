Ive never posted a review for a game EVER but for this t I shall make an exception.GTAV is probably one of my favorite games OF ALL TIME but the quality of its online content has seriously decreased.Every update that is put out costs more than the last to the point where the only people who can purchase anything online are modders and big Youtubers farming views.This modding fiasco will definitely be the straw that broke the players collective back and Rockstar and Take 2 are going to feel the backlash.I love GTA but it seems GTA doesnt love me back. It loves microtransactions instead.
