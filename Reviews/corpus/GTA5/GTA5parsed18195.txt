This game is unplayable in groups of two or more.Joining together in any mission or session is almost impossible.for the sixth time i am trying to set up two pcs in same room same internet to play together.after 1h45mins of trying each time we always end up in separate sessions,teams and evrythingloading time for each leaving and joining is 510mins on 3k euro pcs.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR MULTIPLAYER with friends!After more than 5 years they still didnt do anything about it i hope they loose money and players thiw way.Otherwise they wont bother repairing it making normal lobbies like in evry single normal multi player game!
