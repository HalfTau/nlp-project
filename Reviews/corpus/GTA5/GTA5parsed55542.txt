Take Two can go suck a fat one. Do not purchase this game right now. Take Two and their subsiduary Rockstar Games are trying to pad their own pockets even more by requiring the most prominent mod in their most popular game, which is currently the fourth best selling game of all time, to cease and desist. This is a serious blow to the freedom of the single player community, as mods are one of the only reasons I, likely many others, purchased this game. Furthermore, this is a statement by the producers of this game, and all other games that they currently own, including games like Kerbal Space Program, that they do not care about us, the gamers and loyal customers who have already paid at least 60 for the right to play this game. We can not let this level of tyranny and vile greed go unnoticed or unpunished. Spread this message, Take Two needs to know this can not continue.
