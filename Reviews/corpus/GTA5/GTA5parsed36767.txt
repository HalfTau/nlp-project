They didnt even care enough to make sure that the letter wasnt extremely poorly written and filled with spelling and grammar errors. Despite Rockstar and Take Two advertising mods and Rockstar encouraging them, despite them saying that they were allowed, Take Two is now claiming that the modding tool can be used to hack multiplayer, which isnt true. The mod and other modding APIs, such as Script Hook V, which are required for almost every mod, disable the use of GTA Online while mods are installed. Take Two has often disabled mods with updates or tried to get rid of them years after their games come out, destroying the hard work of thousands of modders who worked to make the game more enjoyable for players. They are now not letting you mod the games you pay for, and they will do this with all of their games. I fortunately had already downloaded OpenIV, so I can still mod my game, but now anyone who wants to purchase the game cannot. Do not support Take Two, and do not give them your money, until they genuinely allow and support mods on their games. I could accept the grindy paytowin multiplayer filled with hackers in a full price AAA game. I could accept the toxic community in Online. Because once I got bored of Online, I had modded singleplayer to go have fun in. But now you dont. Dont buy this game. Vote with your wallet. Take Two only cares about money, so denying them it will send them a message.You can also leave a negative review if you own the game, refund it if youve played less than two hours and had the game for less than 2 weeks, and refuse to purchase the game. Dont let them take the modding that makes this game great away.
