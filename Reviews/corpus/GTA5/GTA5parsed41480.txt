You cant just ban mods for single player mode mates, so in regards of the OpenIV community, heres your reviewThis game is so bad, its so unoptimized, its community is the worst in the gaming history, I have never modded in single/multi player mode, but taking the right of every person who PAID for this game to modify it for their OWN usage without harming anyone is just atake. If this doesnt change back to normal, the reviews are just gonna get more negative and negative. After that, petitions for Refunds will start, and NO ONE WILL EVER GIVE A FCKING PENNY TO YOU EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
