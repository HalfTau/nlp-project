Once upon a time Rockstar was a tiny company coming up into the world with a quirky series, it had charm and wit and an open world to explore. But the real gem, the 1 thing that kept their games being boughjt and played years down the line was Modding. With modding you could near anything with the world from add cars to flying around as superman. Now, it seems their ego has grown larger than their reason. It was a long time coming really. Once they monotized online play it was all a downward spiral from there. Now, in 2017, they finally pulled the trigger on the last bit that made Rockstar games fun and disabled all modding in an admitted attempt to get EVEN MORE money out of people. This wasnt some naive move, the ceo od the parent company TAKE 2 stated this was all to get people to spend more on online play. So with that, this game has become worthless and is no longer worthy of being played, or the company endorsed in any future games. They set their priorities and greed won.
