I had heard that GTA V was a waste of money because of how many hackers ruin the online experince, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that only a week or two before I purchased it, Rockstar implemented a system that banned a lot of hackers and effectively cut down on the number of hackers in servers.I really enjoyed the singleplayer, it had a fun story and many unique missions, but the online is really the fun part of the game. Constant updates and plenty of friends to play with me, I dont think Ill ever become bored of Heists, races or any of the other crazy, chaotic things you can get up to doing in the online. There is rarely any lag and most people are friendly and play the game like it should be played. I dont think there are too many hackers, and if I ever rarely come across one, I can easily find a new session wheere there isnt oneThe one thing I will complain about is that it takes quite a while to save up for anything in the game. However, with a little bit of extra effort, patience and time put into the game, its a lot of fun to find creative ways to earn money with friends or by yourselfOverall, 9/10 definitly worth playing, even after 4 years of this game being out, it is fun, and will be fun for a long time.
