GTA V is about 3 main characters. Franklin, Trevor, and Michael. A group of friends doing heists, and beating theout of people. GTA V is about taking other people cars. Or you could play MultiplayerI have spent 50 hours just on the Story aspect of GTA V. I was very sad when I finished the game because of how good the campaign was. I dont like to play Online since everyone has better stuff then me and gets boring real fast. I play Story and mess around and did a lot of fun stuff. If your for the story that has 20 hours of Missions, Side Missions. Go ahead buy this game. If your about a Story that you can replay over and over. Buy this game. If your only in it for the Multiplayer and never gonna touch story. Dont buy the game9/10 for Story part of game6/10 for Online part of gameOverrall score is 7.5/10
