Thank you  Rockstar for talking it through with the OpenIV developers! Were glad that youve taken the communitys side of things. Sadly it had to take a petition and entirely shredding the reviews of the game. 50,000 people that downvoted this game are in the process of reverting their reviews with more friendlier reviews. Once again thank you Rockstar and  TakeTwo. Theyre still on the poo list because of that
