In my pathetic real life I could never afford a flashy sports car. In GTA I can steal ten, park them in the garage of my gorgeouslyappointed midtown apartment, light up a bong and watch....2 channels. The fantasy falls flat somewhere in there. But still...10/10 will watch tv in a video game instead of real life again.
