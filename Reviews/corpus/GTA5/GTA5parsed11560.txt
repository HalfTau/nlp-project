I love the game...  it is an improvement over the previous games in every conceivable way, story, driving, physics, Gunplay, graphics.  Outstanding.However.I am dissappointed that Rockstar has only seen fit to tend the GTA online money farm and has abandoned 2 crucial elements to good single player content1. No single player DLC?  They didnt come anywhere close 2 using the entirety of the amazing map they created, the possibility for other scripted storylines inside of Los Santos are endless.  Perhaps it isnt as profitable as selling Megalodon Shark cards, with some foolish part of me wants to believe that theres still some artistic Soul at Rockstar.Episodes from Liberty city was superb and I think Los Santos deserves the same treatment.2.   NO GAME PLUS?  This one seems far more simple.  Give players an opportunity to replay the entire storyline, with unlocked weapons, the money from the first playthrough and tougher enemies.  Perhaps allow them to set different default vehicles in the game plus as well.  It would be simple.Im not going to say to avoid buying this game, I waited for a long time to purchase it and I must say it was money well spent.
