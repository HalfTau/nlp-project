Well. I am going to jump on the bandwagon. Screw TakeTwo, modding is one of the only reasons I waited a year and a half for the PC release. Hell I even braved the ridiculous 3rd party DRM for the ability to mod. I mean modding was a big thing keeping GTA IV alive and relevant for a while. Now TakeTwo has ruined this version of the game and may set a precedent for modding in general. I understand they want to cut down on hacking but this is NOT the way to do it.
