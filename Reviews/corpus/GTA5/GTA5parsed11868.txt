A free roam world ruled by pay to wins and hackers. Either pay for shark cards or pay for software like a pos and run rampant doing all sorts of hosecrap.Single player is a blast but GTAV Online is a ing joke. Ive put several hundred hours in to the game between two platforms and was lucky enough to carry my character over to PC. Yet I grind and I grind and am met with some head who strips me of my guns and mankrupts me account. All the time and effort I spent into not purchasing shark cards was wasted cause thiswas able to hack hisoff in a oline game. Oh not to mention that rockstar bans people on a daily basis who encounter modders. So its only a matter of time before I getdestroyed by the banhammer for breathing the same air as this
