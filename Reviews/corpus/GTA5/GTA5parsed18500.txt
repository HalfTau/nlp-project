Look Rockstar GTA Online is almost unplayable for me as of right now, I dont even remember the last time that I was able to get into a lobby in which didnt have multiple hackers, and people that killed me so often that I couldnt even get into the menu to join another session in which the same things would inevitably happen again. Also the game in Online mode runs like sht compared to singleplayer, I have a 1080 Ti and a 6700K at 5ghz and in singleplayer at max settings except for Grass and MSAA I get around 170fps. In Online however I only get around 90 fps or so and thats with settings turned down too.I know thats still a lot of fps but I have a 144hz monitor and the difference to my eyes is quite substantial. And I REALLY hate to say this but I think the community on console is better for this game.
