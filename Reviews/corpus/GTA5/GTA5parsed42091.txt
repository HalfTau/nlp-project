In its current state the multiplayer is a grindy, unfun mess that is optimized to pull money out of you like some mobile cash grab game.The singleplayer is decent but has been suffering from lack of focus/updates from day one due to the devs being focused on multiplayer.IF you only want the singleplayer experience  wait for a sale. Otherwise I wouldnt bother, at least not until the dev/publisher get their priorities straight.
