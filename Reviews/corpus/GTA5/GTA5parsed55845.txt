Perhaps the finest, most refined and most repulsive example of a company so desperately intoxicated by the wallets of a fanbase so abused, that it brings any merit such a game may have once possessed into total irrelevance.To have the audacity to kill the modding community, the only force that gives this game any semblance of life, is beyond disgusting, and cannot, and will not stand.
