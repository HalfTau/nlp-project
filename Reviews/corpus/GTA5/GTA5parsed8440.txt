Hmmmmm...where do I startSingle player ProsBest realistic sand box graphics Ive ever seenStory is really fun and just the people in lost santos are just like modern idiotsThe guns and customization in this game is amazing theres alot wish there was more but youll be satisfied with itThe driving in this game OH BOYY is smooth af like butter smoother than Forza Motorsports in my opinionThe characters are very well definied only thing is they should have swapped Franklin for Lamar His best friend in the gameSingle Player ConsGame can drop alot of Frames and I mean alot when you driving to fast and its worse on online but well get to that.Big issue is when you are playing or even watching a cutscene in the game if its at 60fps and drops to 59fps the fluidity will be cluncky than in other games where you cant even tell.I wish they added more just a bit more destructable areas in the game instead of just exploding vechicals only.One thing I felt about the story was that the ending was a bit too outta place rushed the game developers should have taken their time to finish the story but some may say the story length is fine but It doesnt take less than 30 hrs for an average gamer to finish it if not less.Unoptimized yess really it will run well in some occasions but hours later in the game the lag kicks in you need like a GTX 1080 I7 intelto run it smooth throough out hoursMultiplayer online Pros You can play with friends and theres ok hiests but thats about itMultiplayer online Conss everywhere but what can I say its GTA 5 youll only encounter good people 1 or 2 times.Literally s that are rank 100 or even 50 will try to kill you if they see you are a level 10 or 15 and they dont stop they follow you everywhere.THE CURRENCY of this game is ridiculously dont even bother to buy shark cards sorry Rockstar but no no everything is expensive and it will take hours to make Millions or 100ks and then you have to pay for some stupid insurance thing on your vehicles.Modders everywhere!!! Ive encountered being modded and couldnt get rid of a mod someone some how placed on me it was the sex mod with the guy humping the girl.To summarize all this get this game if you wanna enjoy modding the single player and enjoy the solo story definite plus for solo multiplayer is dead and I dont mean dead as in players in lobby but mission wise and races and all that not everyone plays those they just go around and kill people on the map
