The single player campaign is very intruiging and fun, but after that, all you have is modding in this game. And since Take two and Rockstars recent actions, that is most definitely going to stop. I could describe this massive problem to you, reader but NerdCubed describes it way better than I could ever do. Go watch his videos on this ery by the disgraceful developers of this game and youll understand why I dont reccomend this game. It is a blatant cash grab by rockstar, has terrible mechanics, and is so much worse than GTA IV. I am ashamed to have spent 60 dollars on this game and will most likely never play it again. The most regretted purchase on my steam account. Not to mention, it is almost impossible to advance at all in multiplayer with you paying for ingame shark cards. F         U               C               K you Rockstar.
