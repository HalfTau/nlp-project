One of the best Single Player experiences I have ever had the pleasure to experience.But if you are going to go Online you will, not might but will, have the worst experience that you have ever had. I would rather play competitive CSGO against 5 spinbotters because then I wont have to deal with losing hours of setup in missions just to lose it all within 3 minutes against cheaters or toxic aholes. To add this games community is extreamly toxic have to admit I wasnt an angel myself but it wasnt like I was unprovoked Dota, LOL and CSGO players look like civilized people compared to these rabble.I refuse to give this game a negative rating because the Single Player alone is just that good.
