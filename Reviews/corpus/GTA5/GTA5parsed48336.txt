Notice my playtime? Guess what? Thats all the time I spent modding GTA V, and all the time I spent playing LSPDFR. LSPDFR has been the heart of GTA mods since San Andreas released. But this isnt just about LSPDFR, although Im unimaginably furious. This is about modding, in general. This is about a passionate community bringing people together with brilliant ideas and new innovative ways to play. Ive been part of this community for many, many years. At this juncture, we dedicate our lives to improving the singleplayer aspect of a game that Rockstars abandoned, due to GTA Online. GTA Online has become Rockstars million dollar baby, and they have done all they can to preserve their new cash cow. GTA isnt even about singleplayer anymore. Its no longer about ridiculous DLCs. Theyve abandoned their roots, and I wouldnt be surprised if the next GTA isnt even singleplayer anymore.PC gamers have gotten theend of the stick for too long. Everything is destroyed, now. Laid to waste. Thousands upon thousands of modders completely silenced. And all thats left now is the new face of Grand Theft Auto GTA Online.Dont let TakeTwo get away with this. There is NO underestimating how devastating this is to the community.
