What the hell happened to just buying a game? Take Two CEO internal letter posted even admits to nickel and diming users and actually being offended that people dont want to keep paying to play this game. Its a single player game first and foremost. DLCs have caused the rise of piracy. Companies cant just release Expanion pack which is more than half or equal in size and content to the original install itself... no they gotta keep nickel and diming creating a pay to win environment where either kids steal their parents credit cards or folks use cheats. It greed breeds rebels who fight back with piracy, hacks, cheats.This game is not a mmorpg. It was not designed to be a mmorpg. Stop trying to make it a mmorpg.The game was good... keyword WAS, but theyve ruined it. STAY FAR FAR AWAY
