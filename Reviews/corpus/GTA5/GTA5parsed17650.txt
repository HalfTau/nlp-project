Brilliant game, like every GTA before it, the stories get better, thr mechanics get better and the overall game evolves each time. So for GTA V story mode, 10/10.GTA Online however is pathetic, yes theres fun things to do, but everything is seriously over priced, and im someone who actually enjoys the grind, you can see my total hours of gameplay, but its ridiculous when a plain black shirt costs 50k, and when every DLC comes out you need to buy more properties like warehouses and bunkers just to purchase the new vehicles and weapons. Youre spending 6 million jusy in setup costs let alone the 100 hours it takes to grind for it, and then to grind for the new stuff. But ok the DLCs are free so its not ny biggest issue. MODDERS! modders everywhere, every session, modders going round killing poeple, in Godmode, taking all your weapons, your money, its absolutely out of control and has been since day 1 but of course R does nothing about it, if you wanna play online be prepared it is 30 cheaters who are on purely to troll and ruin it for others.
