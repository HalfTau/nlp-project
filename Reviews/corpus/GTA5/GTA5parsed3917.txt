This game is awesome, however and honestly Ive played around 40 hours, around 15 hours of that was WAITING the game to load, it disgusts me, the time to load a game is unbeleiveable and unreal, its too much plus the times it just stucks at the loading screen for over 10 minutes, I am off GTA and I regret buying this, however as a game its awesome and I cant say anything bad about it, but the loading time.. if Rockstar cant fix that then seriously it shouldnt make more games with the same issue. Red Dead Redemption had the same problem back in time on XBOX.
