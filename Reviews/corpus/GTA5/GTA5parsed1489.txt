I recommend offline. I do not recommend online. Ive got 100s of hours on console and then got the Steam version. On PC Ive only played a handful of sessions where hackers werent invincible and noclipping everywhere, stealing ingame money bought with real world currency, openly mocking that they cant be banned while ruining everyones experience, teleporting every player on the server to them then blowing up everyone and taking all the loot, etc., etc., 8Dad nauseam...I cant wait until the consumer protection laws catch up with game developers. A lot of this garbage is inexcuseable, and for such a filthy rich company, Rockstar should be ashamed. Theyve become the 100 embodiment of the thoroughly corrupted materialistic mentality that they poke fun at in the game.GTA V online  garbage for proles who enjoy getting suckered by the elite
