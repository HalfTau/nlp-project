Great game. Was from the start. Online USE to be good, emphasis on USE. Alot of modders, and takes incredibly long times to make money for cars. We have hackers/modders in almost every Online session, but Take Two still decide to worry about OpenIV. They should have more priorities than people modding in SINGLE PLAYER. Obveously shows their priotirities. Will stay a negative review UNTIL OpenIV returns, or Online is fixed, as is mainly modders are dealt with, and not as priority but fix how much things cost. Rockstar has always gained my positive vote, but due to Take Two, destroying the game, I wont play until theres a resolution, that favors the communityEdit  Supposively OpenIVs CD has been uplifted. Gained my opvote back
