I really liked the story mode of this game. However, I will never buy another Rockstar game based on the anticonsumer policies of this game company.  There was not a single singleplayer update for this game, yet had a bunch of online updates that often seem to require progressively more moneygrubbing microtransactions with each update. Also, each time players figured out creative and legit ways to generate ingame funds, Rockstar would remove those options.
