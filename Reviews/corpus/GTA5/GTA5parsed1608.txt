GTA V is a great game, with awesome story, great graphics for its time and most importantly, a great map. Now take everything else except graphics and map and youre left with GTA Online. The state of Online is disgustingly P2W and the new DLCs are horrid. I can recommend the singleplayer campaign with my whole heart, but if you for some reason decide to play online, for the love of god avoid public lobbies and only play with friends on invite only servers.TLDR Singleplayer campaign good, online bad.
