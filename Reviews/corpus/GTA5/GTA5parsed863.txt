oh man did i put some hours into los santos... man i felt like i done it all in this game. it was a good time. beautiful visuals, and from the hostile and friendly players all around. those that would help you out with the grind. what can i say. been here since day one, just got my account reset. and to be honest im not all that upset. and i dont mind coming back. and more importantly i cant wait to play red dead 2. please keep up the good work guys
