The core single player of a game experience should never change 2 years after launch of a game, and it certainly should never change for the worse which is precisely what Take Twos decision to remove modding for the single player experience  did for many players.  While the unmodified experience for single player has remained largely the same, the game has seen significant pushes towards paid aspects of its multiplayer.  If you do buy the game keep in mind unless you stick to the now lessened potential for single player, the company does expect you to pay more to get a complete multiplayer experience.
