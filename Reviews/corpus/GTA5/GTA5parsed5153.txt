The single player of this game in a nutshellI hope you are enjoying this video game. Our talented development team is working on expansions that you can use when you play GTA online.The multiplayer of this game in a nutshellAhh welcome to Grand theft auto online. A place where you and your friends can wait for 10 minutes to get into a decent lobby and after that go into a heist requiring you to load even more. Now do that about 12 times so you can buy that new plane or car.... Or a Pisswasser...... Or you just dont do anything and just buy a shark card.Rockstar you had a great game here. You just ed it up with Corperate greed. The fact that you blocked off dlc vehicles  in singleplayer so we have to play your piece of garbage GTA online is t. The game is good, Its just that rockstar is dropping the ball... Hard. Will allow you to spawn vehicles in SP when using a Mod menu
