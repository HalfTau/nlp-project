You know how a company becomes so good and loved by creating a beautifull open world sandbox game ,and lets players explore it , and even change it, add to it, be creative with it there fore keeping peoples interested in it for years to come , increasing the sales for it as manny people bought the game seing how manny crazy mods there are and how much fun they are  and after that the company turns around and spits in to their fans faces , by saying that they are not milking us enough, and there fore they are banning the mods for a single player, just to make that bit of extra cash from the ing shark cards. A warning to rocksar and take 2 , you might be the one of the bigest richest companies in the world right now, butlike that is what makes loose your customers loose faith in you, the reputation that you build in so manny years doing a good hard work can be thrown away verry easy, and will affect your sales in the future , Do you remember how EA used to be a great friendly company, making great games without all that t that its spewing out now ? PRobably not, cause it done ed it up . dont go that way , it is not worth it.
