So ive read some socalled reviews here..But after playing some 750 hours, both online and Single Player, i think its safe to say, that most of the time, i enjoy this game alot.Sure, it has some bugs and glitches, as all other games have, some are fun, very few are hilarious, alot however are infuriating.That being said, alot of the latest socalled reviews, are based purely on the fact, that Rockstar finally have made efforts to stop modders, screwing up the online part of the game, for the rest of us honest players.People tend to believe that game developers, open up their hard work for modders. Sure it can be fun i guess, but the fact is that the developers ing write when starting up the game, that modding is not allowed. So how can you believe that you can mod theout of the game, and not expect repercussions?The online part of the game has beentime, and time again, by people who cheat only to mess around with other players. It makes a game series that i have always loved, terrible!I really appreciate the work by Rockstar, making this game and making all these DLCs for free!Sure, if you dont want to work to earn money, to buy stuff, buy the Shark Cards.Just like in many other games, where you can buy weapons to make the game more fun for you. I really cant see the difference and i surely do not see anything wrong with it!I will keep playing, and enjoying the game with my friends, as long as we find it entertaining. If you dont find it entertaining, stop playing and find something else to spend your time on.
