476.0 hours. Thats the hours Ive put into JUST the PC copy of Grand Theft Auto V. And every last second of it was modded. I paid the full 60 price tag so I could play MY game the way I wanted to, and I didnt bat an eye at it. It was worth every cent. Until now.By sending a CD to a mod that has allowed more to the SP side of GTA V than the developers have in any of their updates since the launch, you have alienated a group of players not just from V, not just from Grand Theft Auto as a series, but from every game that Rockstar and 2K Games have a hand in. Mods made this my favorite game of all time. And now, like so many others, you will not see another cent out of me until a reasonable replacement or solution arises for this problem. Hopefully the t microtransactions are worth it.On behalf of the OpenIV Team, and peeved gamers everywhere,  you, T2.
