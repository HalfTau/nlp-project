Single player is fun.Online is literally unplayble. For starters, everything for sale in GTA online is quite literally 2x  10x more expensive than its single player counterpart. On top of that money is about twice as hard to make in online mode. This is because Rockstar wants to sell SharkCards and they continue this business model because YOU idiots keep buying shark cards.At the best SharkCard exchange rate 100 IRL for 8mil in game, 1 of IRL money gets you 80k of GTA Online money. This means that for their latest update, you would need to buy over 500 fcking dollars worth of shark cards. Rockstar has valued their own DLC at 500 fcking dollars. Dont support these people, they are the epitome of greed.
