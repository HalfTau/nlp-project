They have completely disabled modding in GTA 5 now. They sent the creators of OpenIV, the only GTA modding tool of its kind, a Ceast and Desist letter to get them to stop distributing the tool. Now we have to abide by Tyrannical Take Twos rules and play the official online mode, which is ridden with complete and utter filth and is a grind fest that cant even shake a finger at World of Warcraft.If you still havent bought this game. Dont. Just pirate it. Dont give these s any more money.
