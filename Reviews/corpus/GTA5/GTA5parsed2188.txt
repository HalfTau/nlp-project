If youre like me and wanting to play single player, save your money.Rockstar has blocked off offline access to the SINGLE PLAYER game except for those that reactivate the game every 67 days with online. If you go more than a week without internet while traveling or after moving you can say goodbye to playing this game at a moments notice when internet is not available.Who would want to invest their time and energy into a single player storyline when theyre not in complete control over when they can play it?PC single player the main reason I bought it is broken. My opinion is that conforming to Rockstars single player authenticator would make me a sheeple, so no thank you. PC online is a different topic.
