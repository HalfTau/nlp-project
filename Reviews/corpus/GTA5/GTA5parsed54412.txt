I used to love GTA. I even bought this on ps3 and PC.But their recent actions against the modding community is showing just how crap their business model is.This game is 4 years old almost, let us have our mods. Let us have our private servers.Let the community have the game they want. Your online servers are terrible, the hacking is rampant WITHOUT MODS and youre only showing us that you care simply for shark card sales.Thumbs down. Shame on you.
