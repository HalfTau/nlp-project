this game is kind of a cool...... until u reach the 60. level..... after that its boring as fk. No good and effective money making methode........ everything you do, want to buy is expensive as hell, and when all the cheaters that you dont ban for some reasons are killing you with all these expensive st, planes, tanks, weapons..... it gets very anoying and boring..... so i say Not worth 30 euro /but there is only one thing, ONE thing Rockstar need to do...... better money making metode, and the game will be perfect. Im not saying that u must make 1 000 000 000 from heists... no! but 300 000 is not very much when u realize that you are doing one heist for about 60 min..... 1 000 000 would be okey.... then the would actually be worth 30 euro.... but this ONE thing made me leave the game......
