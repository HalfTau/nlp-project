Edit 6/24/2017 TakeTwo has quietly backed off from this decision today, seemingly because Rockstar talked them down from it. However, despite this decision Im going to keep this review as not recommended because Take Two could just pull the same stunt after the Summer Sale or after summer break is over, or modify their original statement to exacerbate the problem further.Just hopping on the negative review bandwagon because I feel like it.TakeTwo Interactive, the publisher for GTAV, has proven too many times now that they are much more concerned with getting their dirty fingers on every last penny from players/consumers/whatever Strauss Zelnick likes to call the thousands of people that have willingly spent 60 on a game released 5 years ago Bethesda comparisons nonwithstanding. Take Two pushes Shark Cards at every corner for GTA Online, something that would be otherwise ignorable if it werent for the incredible time you have to pour into the game to even get a few million dollars.Besides that, Shark Cards are hilariously overpriced for the amount of ingame money you get.3 to get the same amount you get by spending half an hour doing relatively easy jobs, but 100 for 8 million, which could get you maybe a few high end cars and an apartment. For 100 in Warframe or a similar game with a business model thats not a complete load of bull you could get yourself quite a few new premium items to enhance your experience. Im not an advocate for F2P games in the least, I find most of them abhorrent and an overall bad influence on the video game industry, but for a CEO to treat paying customers like literal sea creatures and categorizing them based on spending habits, there is a problem.Thats all not to mention the recent shutting down of OpenIV, a modding tool for GTAIV and GTAV. Modding is a major component of players deciding whether to buy a game on PC, and by offering the vindictive hand of a lawyer to send a gramatically and technically flawed ceaseanddesist letter to the developers of OpenIV, Take Two has suffered a substantial blow to its reputation.Dont support anticonsumer practices.Dont support antiPC publishers.Stay informed on what youre buying.
