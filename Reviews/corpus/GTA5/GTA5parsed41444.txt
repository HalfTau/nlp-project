Anyone who has ever played a GTA game knows its a masterpiece in its own time. The low review scores are just cry babies with damp diapers over their modding tools being taken away. Im sure some reddit post somewhere brought this on, as most reddit users are autistic, with the only difference being theyre in a group now, good for you! This game is a 10/10 and highly recommended, mass low review scores on Steam wont change the fact that the base game is incredible. Keep crying reddit users, after you learn how to talk to girls and get laid, youll chill out enough to realize writing low review scores just because youre angry does nothing but highlight how people with low IQ in groups can truly, truly make not one bit of difference!
