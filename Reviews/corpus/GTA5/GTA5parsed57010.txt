This is my first, and likely to be my only ever Steam review of a game, but given current events I felt it necessary to say something.First things first, GTA V is a good game, all in all. It provides for hours of hijinks and entertainment, but can easily become monotonous. GTA Online had the potential to be a repreive from this monotony, but was handeled with such greed and a complete and blatant disregard for its audiance that its frankly insulting.The gameplay offered by GTA Online is based entirely around a grind for cash and RP for leveling, and many gameplay elements are blocked out to the player unless they have enough cash or a high enough level. This not only serves to prolong this feeling of monotony, but also stips the gameplay of any of the fun that could be acheived in the singleplayer.This is only worsened by the games use of microtransactions, graciously allowing players to skip the ridicilous and unnecessary grind by rewarding the player with cash and RP in exchange for ridicilous amounts of real money. For instance, the price of a yacht in ingame currency is 8,00,000 which translates to either dozens of hours spent ingame grinding, or 100 in real world currency.GTA Online is also completely hostile to new players new players, lacking the necessary level or cash to have access to any decent vehicles, weaponry, armor, housing, and vehicle storage have no way to combat the more experienced players or those who chose to pay for their levels and cash. This makes it nearly impossible for new players to advance in the game without having to waste their money on microtransactions, as they will not be able to compete with the other players.This monotony could, and was, eliminated through the use of mods, giving the player a potentially indefinite amount of hours of hijinks and entertainment through the hard work of dedicated modders. Unfortunately, and what I find has proven to be the nail in this games coffin, the games publisher TakeTwo issued a ceaseanddesist to OpenIV, one of the major modding tools of GTA V, used by most of the better mods.Now, I am no lawyer so I could be completely off base, but from my limited understanding this ceaseanddesist has no actual basis, but instead is just an assualt on the modding community and on the fans. Unfortunately, independent modders dont have the funds necessary to challenge a multimillion publishing company in court, so instead theyve been allowed to get away with this frankly disgusting behavior.Without mods, I cannot honnestly recommend this game, nor would I want to, and Id recommend that potential buyers avoid this game for the time being, if for nothing more than to send a message to the publishers that we will not tolerate such greed and disgusting, underhanded business practices.On another note, the keyboard controls or terrible, but the game has controller support, so its not that much of an inconvenience.TLDRAvoid this game unless the publishers go back on their current practices and begin to, at the very least, tollerate the existance of mods.
