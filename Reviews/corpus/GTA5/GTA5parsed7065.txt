This game is good for the singleplayer campaign but, the online mode suffers from poor latency, a horrid case of MMO oneupsmanship. Back when this was SD on consoles, the game had a much smaller power scale between noob and experienced player, even now as a returning vet my high end gear is now pointless as newer, more OP stuff has been released. The online mode is also rampant with modders who also scale on beneficial to players or disruptive, depending on who is online.
