The story mode is really interesting and intense. Online mode isnt so much imo It gets repetitive after a while and moneyspawning hackers ruin the game and can get you in trouble. Ive played this game for quite a few hours and I gotta say its one of the best games Ive played on Steam. After all the mess with OpenIV getting closed down, I wasnt going to recommend it. I think mods are, have been and will always be a crucial part to the GTA series. Mods are what makes a story mode interesting again. But now it looks like OpenIV is back!!!
