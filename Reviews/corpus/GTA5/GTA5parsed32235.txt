For those that enjoyed GTA IV and prior for their story, this is not the game for you.For those that liked to explore the GTA world to enjoy a virtual world, this is not the game for you.For those that dont enjoy a cohesive multiplayer experience, this is not the game for you.For online play, Ive not play much, but it is exactly what youd expect. Complete chaos of free for all battle royale arena. If youre gonna talk about other mods, theres the ridiculous shark cards which milks you past the initial payment for the game, which is the main hinderance for me from even committing more time to review multiplayer.As for the world, its big, but its empty. Unlike GTA SA and IV, most of the world in GTA V is empty desert. The single player missions only take place on very small parts of the map. Thes no incentive to explore the rest of the world.The story, its not bad, but not as good as IV.
