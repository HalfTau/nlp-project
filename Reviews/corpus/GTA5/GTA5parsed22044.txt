Gta V is a game I have loved for a very long time. I never really liked the online gameplay of it because I thought it was  too time consuming and tedious to earn money. When I finnaly got bored of that, I started the singleplayer. I loved it because I could do all of these fun things with it. And when I completed it, I started to mod it to have the fun of online without being killed over and over again. Then Take Two came along. They destroyed the modding community in it. Ruinined the game. Now they basically force you to play online. Just for the money. Before any of you decide to buy this, Consider this. Do you really want a mad 5 year old yelling at you and killing you just for enjoying the game.
