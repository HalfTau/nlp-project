Just adding my review/voice as a fan of GTA V.Before I purchased it on Steam, I had it for xbox and spent many dozens of hours playing it. It is so good that I repurchased it for Steam and played through it all again!At every turn, GTA V is one of the most impressive gaming experiences you can have. There is real freedom to do pretty much anything you feel like doing, and the city feels genuinely alive.The acting, graphics and gameplay all are beyond excellent and personally I cannot fathom how anyone could dislike this game. When you consider how far the GTA series has come, just think of the potential for GTA VIUntil then, GTA V will remain as one of the must play games, and is an experience that should not disappoint in any way. To me, it is pretty much perfect as a game. of course, 10 years from now it might feel dated, but as of now it is still outstanding
