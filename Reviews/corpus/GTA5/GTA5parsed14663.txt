 this game. this studio. The story was amazing though. The online part is Hackers can take control over anything and do what every they feel funny. I was in a party not relizing one of the guys was hacking to the end I ended up getting banned with no reason they wont even tell me what they think i did. Terrible customer service. To sum it up i was told to go  myself.
