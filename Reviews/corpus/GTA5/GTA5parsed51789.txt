Overall the singleplayer gameplay is an enjoyable experience from start to finish, especially if you throw a couple of your favourite mods in the mix. 9/10 would replay again! No singleplayer DLC tho, ever... Fck you.But theres a mod for the game that allows hosting your own servers independent of the shtty ONLINE mode, so thats nice. Its called FiveM, youll find it actually has more features than Rockstars big spender imagination of a multiplayer mode.
