this multiplayer mode bans more innocents than actual modders/hackers. And when one of those innocent people they arent even allowed to write an appeal, I am also one of those innocents, these innocent people are banned because people who are actually modding/hacking are framing them by giving them tons of money, so while they have hundreds of hours put to waste, the idiot modding gets to walk away to frame more people. Also there wouldnt be so many modders if everything wasnt so expensive, most players only choice is to buy the shark cards, or mod for free. fix your sh8t if you want this game to get better. If you were going to buy this game for the online mode, Id reccommend buying it on another platform where modding isnt so easy.
