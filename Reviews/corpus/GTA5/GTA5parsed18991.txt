The game is actually pretty fun. Ofcourse when it has finally loaded which takes atleast up to 15 minutes. Sometimes it doesnt load at all or just goes into offline mode and then you can start over.When finally in a session suddenly you disconnect from the session and you are all alone, or there is a hacker in the session which kills everyone all the time ...if you have alot of freetime and like loading screens this game is a must!
