This game used to be great. USED TO BE. Up until the last update, it had been incredibly fun. I admit, the prices for everything in game is ridiculous, and Rockstar will not stop trying to force feed you shark cards, but it was still fun. However, as of today, I have been banned for a month and all of my characters have been reset because I bought a hanger..? Apparently I have been cheating which is a bit bizarre, as I have been playing fairly on this game since the days of PS3. I never thought Id write a bad review about a Rockstar game, let alone GTA V, but as it has clearly been shown, Rockstar do not care about any of their loyal players, and get salty everytime someone earns their money instead of buying Shark cards. A word of advice for new players, if you cant resist avoiding this game, remember, you must go by Rockstars rules, as everything else is strictly prohibited. Kind of like a concentration camp.If you want the game for the storyline, I can understand that as its pretty good to play through, character development is great and the interaction the player has between three characters is a cool idea. But for me, I can never bring myself to play it again, in my mind the replayability is rubbish. But each to their own.In conclusion, I recommend this game for the single player experience, but if youre looking for a game for strictly multiplayer, then there are a lot of better games out there that offer fun and freedom instead of a restrictive experience ran under a dictatorship.
