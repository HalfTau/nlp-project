The game itself is alot of fun especially with friends. I definetly recommend getting it if you have a friend to play it with. One downfall I will say is the community but I ignore it, you cant really do too much about it. But if you have iron skin then youll be fine. But it is an awesome game, there is so much variety and so much to do from racing to just shooting everything! xD Its worth the money in my opinion for sure!
