1 The game focuses on multiplayer. A lot of the MP content is only in MP, not SP, so a lot of the content pushes you to MP unless you have mods see 6.2 The loading screens can take anywhere between 15 minutes and 30 minutes.3 60 game with microtransactions. A lot of the expensive things in MP will take months to earn the money for if you dont buy shark cards.4 MP is riddled with hackers.5 I personally didnt have too much fun with this game. Sure it can be fun with friends, but the SP seems bland, and I dont want to risk going into public servers with all the hackers, so when I dont have friends on, I dont even touch it.6 Take Two esentially outlawed mods for this game by issuing a cease and desist on OpenIV which is the largest mod tool for GTA V. I personally never used mods, but most likely most of the sales of the PC version was people wanting to mod, and on behalf of them I am adding this to the list. A lot, me included, think that this action is Take Two forcing more people into MP and have them buy more shark cards. I even wouldnt be surprised if they start charging money to be able to even play, even after the initial 60 purchase.
