Well, youve completely lost me as a customer Take Two.Your position on modding by killing the Open IV mod team has shut down dozens of mods and total conversions.Rockstars official statement to PC gamer is a blatant lie.  Open IV does not support or enable modification of GTA OnlineI will never buy a game from Take Two or their subsidiaries  Rockstar or 2k ever again.
