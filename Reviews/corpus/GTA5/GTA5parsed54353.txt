Story is great, multiplayer was great, but the last year or so of updates have been basically all the same, CEO mission clones, with prices in flated as  for vehicles. TakeTwo has ruined online lately. Please remember, this isnt Rockstars fault, this it Take Two Interactives fault. They are greedy and are trying to milk as much money out of you as possible. Rediculous. Dont buy if you are going to play multiplayer, which is the only updated portion, so much so that spawning in items from newer DLCs automatically deletes the cars.
