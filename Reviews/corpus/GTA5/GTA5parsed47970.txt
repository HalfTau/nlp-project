Been playing GTA V Online pretty often since 2015. Amazing game. Today when I logged in, the game posted a message about not cheating I never have and then I saw the news about Take Two threatening a modder with legal action. So instead of fixing their network protocol to disable cheating, Rockstar  Take Two decided to threaten the community.I dont plan on coming back.
