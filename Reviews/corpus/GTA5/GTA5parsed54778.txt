What Rockstar did with OpenIV was completely legal, but entirely unethical, it is more a comment on software as a whole then GTA V, the lack of ownership of software and the rights associated with owning something, have completely undermined consumer status and confidence in this industry.  I agree with the protesting commenters on this particular game, but we must be willing to protest more broadly if we are to change a techonology industry wide anticonsumer inclination.
