One of the top selling videogames of all timeDevs still insist on milking every last dime out of playersPerhaps the worst example of microtransactions run amok to date.Almost all of the interesting vehicles are onlineonly and locked behind large paywalls. Normally this wouldnt be a problem just mod them into singleplayer, but the developers have chosen to shutdown modding altogether.If you want to access anything in the free updates be prepared to spend half a day grinding for a single vehicle. While youre grinding you can enjoy1. Server problems2. Multiple, long loading screens3. Instant failure conditions should one of the players in your group get killed4. Griefers...or you can pay Rockstar/Take Two 5060 for that vehicle.I seriously regret buying the PC version of this game so I could play around with wacky mods. The developers can go  themselves for ruining a perfectly good singleplayer game.
