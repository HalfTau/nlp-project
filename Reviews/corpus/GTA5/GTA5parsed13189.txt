Only good for single player modding. Multiplayer modding on the other hand is kind of debatetable, You cant really play the game like a normal player if you havent use real cash, the grind is just too much on top of that the expenses and constant updates that you may or may not catch up with. I do recomend this game for single player ONLY but multiplayer is really  right now and Rock wouldnt really do anything about it
