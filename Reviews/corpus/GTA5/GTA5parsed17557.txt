If youre here for the single player content then yes, it is worthy of your money. However the multiplayer part GTA Online is a complete disaster. Hackers modders, horrible workflow to play with friends, very poor support from Rockstar they ofter wrongly punish the innocent rumors. Everyone is a jackass running around blowingup and killing eachother. For the resourcefull ones, even Passive mode wont protect you. Complete lack of activities aswell, you cant even sit.Garbage.
