SingleplayerThis is one of the best games I have ever played...Beautiful gameplay and interesting gameplay...Tons of content make me want to replay it all time...MultiplayerIt takes a lot of time to load.Everything is expensive  I hate Shark cards microtransactions.Lots of new content and updates  it just doesnt get boring.
