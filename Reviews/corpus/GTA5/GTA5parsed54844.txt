Take two interactive has banned modding tools from this game, completely eliminating our creative freedom and the enjoyment that came from singleplayer use mods. The modding community was a gigantic part to this game, and with that community being shutoff from game access, it pains me to write a negitive review. Dont support this publisher, and show them what they did was wrong by writing a negitive review, or simply not purchasing this product.Keep in mind this is not rockstars fault, they still have made an amazing game and I will continue to support them. But I cannot stand for the actions that take two interactive have made.
