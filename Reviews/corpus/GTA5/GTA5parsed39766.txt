This is what happens when the gaming community bands together. I bought GTA V for the second time on PC so that I could mod the single player and Take Two think that as a customer I havent paid enough? Any time spent in GTA Online came after my time modding the game. This review is part of the stand against the talking heads at Take Two.Another side note, upon the release of the new gun running DLC, I recieved a message as I loaded into the game telling me to stop cheating or action would be taken  I have never cheated however have had money forced upon me by hackers whom are a completely different thing to modders. Sort the hackers out and dont threaten your loyal customers when they have become victim to a hacker.You dont threaten me with action when a hacker teleports me to him and kills me repeatedly for 10 minutes  so dont threaten me with action when I am teleported to a hacker who then credits my account with GTA  for 10 minutes. I dont have a choice in either situatuon!
