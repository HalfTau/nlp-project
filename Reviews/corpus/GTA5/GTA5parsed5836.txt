I have owned this game on three seperate platforms and I cannot believe how absolutely broken this port is. From hitboxes that are unacceptable for a mobile game, to painfully slow pop in of important items in the world e.g. driving along at high speed you car spins out and is smashed up, rock finally loads after youve hit it., to inaccurate floaty controls, to beyond broken AI. How in the hell this game got through QA is beyond me, was there even a QA team at all? Do not buy this game.
