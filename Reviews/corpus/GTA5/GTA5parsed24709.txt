they took away my money which was now at all modded. Ik it was not modded because they already took away the modded money from the last update. Rockstar has official ruined Gta online for me. Personally i would have recommend gta5 to others if it was before this openload problem occured. Now i dont recommend this game to no one because it is not worth its price anymore. Gta online would get boring after a couple months because you have no time to have fun. All your time is wasted trying to grind money with players who are usually a big help but you will 75/100 run into one player who ruins missions/or heist for your group. Also, Gta5 story is out of the question for a reason to buy this game because you can no longer mod the game which was all gta5 story mode had to keep it alive. OVERALL POINTRockstar basically ruined gta5 and 4 because of the openload problem
