This game was ok when it first released, but now it has evolved into nothing short of a fiasco. the online dlc is way overpriced and needs days of nonstop play just to reach part of the items avalible. over the 5 year life span Rockstar support an customer service have gotten worse. Rockstar will ban you for a month or more for looking at them sidways if you are lucky.I highly recommend you do not buy this game which is extremly hard to admit because i like so many others followed gta 5 for years. again do not buy this game it has now become a rip off and a waste of your money.
