Grand Theft Auto 5 is a  simulator for people who have nothing to do in their life. Shark Cards are overly expensive, even moreso then the game itself. Money is a btch to work for, modder in almost every lobby, they can beor not, some can give money and get people banned because of Rockstars stupid cheat detecting algorithm.singleplayer with mods is great, but you are confined to no multiplayer. Roleplay in this game is limited to amateur servers or good servers with selection processes. But because of they high prices which are dumb, I would not suggest the game at its current price of 60. On a sale, yes. I also suggest getting the gam with the 8mil shark card, otherwise you will get ed by high levels. Verdict I dont suggest this, Rockstar may have gottn over 1 Billion dollars in revenue, and 500mil in microtransactions, but that doesnt change their mood of the community.
