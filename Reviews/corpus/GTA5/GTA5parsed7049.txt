This game can die in a toxichole. Only cheaters. Spend all your time grinding for money then be prepared to have it all wiped away due to cheaters takin away your weapons, ammo, destroying your vehicles. Every Single Lobby I join theres at least 1 cheater I go to pvp after grinding for abit of fun boom some 14yo gotI just killed him and there goes all that money I just solo grinded for. yhe  this. WHY DONT DEVELOPERS CARE ABOUT ANTI CHEATS LOCK DOWN YOUR GAME LIKE DESTINY 2 I DONT CARE IF MY OVERLAYS DONT FUCING WORK IF ITS CHEATER FREE I HAVE A SECOND SCREEN FOR CHATS.
