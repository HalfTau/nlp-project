This game is like real life. Those who are trying to earn some money to buy themselvs a decent apartment/car will be constantly killed, camped and abused by those who swim in a pool full of money.Not to mention how horrible developers are by taking money from people that earned it legit because of modder issues.I wouldnt recommend You this game unless You have a crew to play with because its impossible to play alone.
