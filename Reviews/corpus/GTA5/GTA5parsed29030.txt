The whole reason I purchased this game a second time for this platform was because of mds. I had the game on PC for like a week before Take 2 shut down support. IMO the game had been headed in the wrong direction for a long time, with the monetization of Online play and Socail Club integration also a problem in GTA IV. In short, if you are still thinking of buying this game for this platform, DONT. Take 2,  Rockstar for agreeing to this,  online play,  thisgame I wish I could return itThat is all
