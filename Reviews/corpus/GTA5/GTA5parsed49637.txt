Take Two Interactive is another greedy company in pursuit of hoarding money in a nameless multitude of ways, it seems. Rockstar is horrible, their customer service is so bad its not even worth using, its like having no customer service whatsoever. They sent a CD to the creators of OpenIV so people would spend more money on their continuous multiplayer DLC releases I assume thats their reasoning, but either way its scummy.  Dont ever buy from these companies. Supporting a company like this is not worth whatever the game is, what they are doing is just dishonest and greedy.
