Single player feels upolished. You can buy and mod cars, but not save them, so why bother? Lacks the story depth and humor of gta 4 and gta sa. Trevor is a fun character, but overall its just about regular bank robbers doing generic things.Online is a free to play, microtransaction infused, pay to win mess. Some good elements, some bad. Regular pay to win elements such as the most powerful items being locked behind hundreds and hundreds of hours of grind or cheating, or paying real money is bad. Cheater tools being incorporated in the game where people can blow someone up anywhere at any time for 10 are worse. What really takes the price are missions that are purposefully designed to be so boring/frustrating that you will want to skip them, and of course you can... for money.Also do not buy the starter pack. The alleged value is a total scam. You are way better off buying a shark card, although for the reasons above I dont recommend that neither.
