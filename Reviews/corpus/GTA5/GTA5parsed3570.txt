Not recommended for PCMoney money money Rockstar. When will it end?It says product received for free because my brother gifted it to me for Christmas. Ive had it on Xbox 360 and Xbox One and couldnt buy it on PCMy PC runs it good, thats not the issue. The issue is the fact that you need crap tons of money to get even a decent looking car. Do you think a flying car is gonna cost you almost 4 million dollars in real life? Do you think a normal white shirt will cost 200 bucks? Nah.Rockstar removed character transfers last gen to next gen and it sucks. All of my friends have their high level 120 characters while Im stuck here with my level 5 with only 22k. I can understand it was due to modded accounts, but they could make you wait 12 days while they look at your character to ensure no modding has been done.Shouldve checked my account before I went into Xbox One with 30 mil YEET.
