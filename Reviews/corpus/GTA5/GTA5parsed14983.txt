Took me 2 hours just to get the game to start, after downloading 70 gigs, it seemed i had an incomplete installation...The solution provided on the R forum did not help.After second reinstall, and a Verify files option in Steam it started to work...sort of...Changing any setting in the graphics option requires a restart !?. Plus after the restart the game would freeze at the legal statement.SpecsI5 4690kR9 290 4g8 Gigs of RAMso my PC is compliant, but the game is just buggy.Also after reading the forums, it seems that R has the nerve to ban legitimate people from a product/service that they payed for...i will not pay my hard earned money for something like this.
