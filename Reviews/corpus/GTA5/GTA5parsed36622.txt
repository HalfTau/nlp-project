I hate that they banned modding for this game but that doesnt mean this game is terrible. This game is still pretty damn fun without mods either way. Besides this is their game and if they dont want you modding their game then they have a right to not have mods on their game.Also, dont waste your time trying to give arguments andon this review because Im not gonna argue with you people. Just give this review the a no in the helpful and move on with your day.
