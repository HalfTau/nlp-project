Its not worth not reccomending this game due to the Open IV event. Its a great game and has an amazing single player that will go down in history, a true revolution to the GTA franchise and I cant wait to see what they do next.As for the online, yes its fun, theres lots to do but if you want to buy nice cars, start a business or buy anything over one million. Then you may as well either quit your job or drop out of uni and never leave the house because the amount of free time you will need to be able to afford expensive items in this game is beyond what most people over 18 have. If you want those things prepare to purchase sharkcards which are ingame microtransactions in which you pay certain amounts and get GTA cash.You either need to have more free time on your hands than you know what to do with or have lots of money. Honestly GTA Online is the only game where I would say it is justified to accept free money from hackers, not that I have done it myself which is why I still dont have enough money to afford nice things despite selling some cars that werent even that expensive to begin with.With all that said, I would reccomend this game as it holds one of the best single player stories Ive ever seen.
