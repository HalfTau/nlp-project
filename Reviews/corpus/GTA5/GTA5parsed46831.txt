Very little control over their online environment griefers, and modders out the whazoo.with every update making content obsolete and charging crazy amounts of in game currency to upgrade.and now our tools for modding singleplayer have been revoked because of an inability to better monitor their online service...Ill change this review when I see reason to, however for quite awhile there have been issues warranting a negative review and recent events have heavily emphasized on this. We need better online service and freedom while not online.
