Years later, this game still continues to amaze. If youre used to the traditional story model, that would be about the last way Id play this game. GTA V Online is quietly an MMO with a million things to do, and they keep adding more goodies every couple of months.There are a lot of things you can do now, from owning your own survival bunker to running a business or just go play some golf with a few friends. Its worth checking out, and more to the point, you can either play your way to loads of cash or just buy it outright whenever they run a special.
