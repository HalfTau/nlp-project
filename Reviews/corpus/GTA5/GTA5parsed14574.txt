I have to say, the game is extremely fun and full of options you might like to experience. however, I have noticed  several times in GTA V Online, after finishing a cocaine and weapons sell mission, that the game could not add my money into my game account. I said, SEVERAL times, and still Rockstar doesnt even take this as an issue, so I played it plenty of hours online not to get my  GTA money. I have spent time and  GTA to fulfill my suplies bar and after selling those products during missions only to getand bankrupt in the game, not allowed even to reload my ammo. sad
