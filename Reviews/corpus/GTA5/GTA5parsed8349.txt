I guess it all depends on what type of player you are. If youre willing to grind hours and hours on end, you might get some fun out of this. Otherwise you either buy money, or just sit there and dont do anything. I really like this game, its a lot of fun when youve got other people to play with. but money is going to become a problem as you progress.
