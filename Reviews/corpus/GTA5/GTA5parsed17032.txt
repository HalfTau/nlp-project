Dont waste time in the online like I did unless you have a good group of pals to play with. Without friends its just grindy, repetitive, low payout missions for the first 100 hours, and once youre past that the only thing that changes is you gain more ways to earn money just a little faster. I mean sure you get vehicles, cool clothes, weapons, etc. but it doesnt do any good against the invincible force known as hackers. There WILL be on in every single game you play. They will kill you and they are invincible. The only option is to join another game or quit unless you like being tortured. Not even passive mode allows you to escape their onslaught, their gauntlet. Youll likely get bombarded by and crushed by thousands of tons of steel as the hackers spawn dozens of vehicles directly over top of you, eventually leading to your death and the crashing of your game. Got friends? Play in a private lobby. Otherwise, youve been warned. Final verdict? Onlines the content while vast ispoor, frustrating, boring, and worst of all is that you can spend dozens of hours grinding a way just to get it blown away by a hacker in seconds because of howpoor rockstars excuse for an anticheat system is. If this isnt convincing enough not to get the game, good luck. Youll likely regret it.
