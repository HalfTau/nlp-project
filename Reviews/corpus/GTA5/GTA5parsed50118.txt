I own this product, digital or otherwise, I paid for it legally, I am in ownership of it therefore I can do whatever I want with it, whether that be modding it, shoving it up my butt, or drawing rediculous pornographic nazi paraphernalia on the game box.I am going to continue to mod this game, I am going to continue to assist in mod development for this game, and I am going to continue my assistance in mod tool development. Cuff me officer I am the worst the world has to offer, modding in the first offense.Do not buy this game, Do not support Rockstar, and do not support Take 2If you think modding is at fault, you clearly have no clue what youre talking about.
