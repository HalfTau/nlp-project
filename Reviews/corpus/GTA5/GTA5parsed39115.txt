You know it sucks, because the single player in this is a phenominal experiece. The story is good, the characters are likeable, and the missions are great.But then when you take the other half of the game  the online part  everything ison and Take Two isnt helping the situation. Their updates are typically done in a fashion that heavily pushes players to buy shark cards, hackers are running rampant all over, and now just recently Take Two decided toon the player base by essentially outright banning modding. Not just hack mods, ALL mods. Say goodbye to your custom car mods, custom outfit mods, cinematic mods, everything.Thanks Take Two. I hope Rockstar successfully ditches you in the future and you fade into obscurity just like your  shark cards will.
