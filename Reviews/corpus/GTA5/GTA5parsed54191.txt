Dear TakeTwo,Never again will I support your developments in the future.How dare you do this to your once loyal community. you.,DEDITApparently TakeTwo has now enabled openIV to continue modding GTA V and will now only target mods that directly allow any form of cheating while playing GTA V online.I feel like the damage is already done, but hopefully, they will learn from this horrible business move. I can now recommend this game!
