Gta 5 story mode is by the greatest part about this game. even tho its short its 100 enjoyableThe Online side of things is terrible. with the games anticheat program being broken and millions of hackers/modders only ruining your online experince.The Bad Sport system is also broken and given to players unfairly and without warning.Gta Online continues to amaze me with its lack of response towards hackers/modders and Rockstar continues to respond with BS when it comes to the communtiy out cry for the game.Rockstar needs to fix its system. stop banning the victims to hackers/modders and ban the suspects.I wish I could recommend this game but I know most people buy it for the online gameplay.Surely aint worth 60 AUS wait for the sale
