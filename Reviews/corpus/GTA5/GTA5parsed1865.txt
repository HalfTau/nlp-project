Billion dollar game company with years of experience in making beautiful games, somehow doesnt know how to make an online mode for one of their games. The game is great and beautiful overall if were talking about story mode, online however is a totally different thing. Its just a blatant cashgrab at this point as its a full priced game with microtransactions. What with the new Doomsday Heists Rockstar is basically giving a big middle finger to those that dont have the money to start the heists themselves, let alone complete it with the difficulty being incredibly difficult. In addition to that, the amount of hackers in this game are immersurable and with Rockstar not banning these players, I doubt youll be able to have a fun time in an online public lobby without hackers griefing you half of the time. Lastly, they arent even able to maintain the servers properly, what with it taking forever to load into a public lobby when you first start the game, and not even considering the number of times you will probebly get disconnected in the middle of heists. Just really dissapointed in how awful of an experience online has turned out to be and just with how the game turned out overall.
