Greatlooking game. Wish I could play it.Managed the first dozen missions or so, but then it simply got too difficult for me. Im not a master on the sticks, and theres no newbie settings to help me out. Failed one mission literally 20 times, and the game gave me no way to skip it or go around.Tried this because I loved Red Dead Redemption. Now worried for RDR2.
