This will be a review of the single player portion of the game onlySo many elements of great game design come together with excellent cohesion in this game. First and foremost, rockstar gives us a massive and detailed world to explore. It is varied, interactive and filled with interesting things to do. On top of that is a very well done story with three strong characters each with interesting stories intertwining between them all. it just all works so well resulting in a package of quantity and quality something that rarely happens in video games.10/10
