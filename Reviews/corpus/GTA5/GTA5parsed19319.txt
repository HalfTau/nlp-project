Dont let the complaints about GTA Online stop you from playing this game. The singeplayer is by far the best in any game Ive played, and the gameplay and graphics are amazing for a game made in 2013. Now, if you want the online exclusive dlc you can easily just use a mod rather then paying the absurd prices for shark cards in online, or grinding for hours on end.The online mode is really the only reason why this game has been pushed down to a mixed rating, because people complain about the really bad prices for shark cards  but that doesnt make the bigger part of the game bad, and I doubt these people spend much time in story mode. If you do want to go online  dont expect to get any of the new cars without paying a load of either in game or real money first.
