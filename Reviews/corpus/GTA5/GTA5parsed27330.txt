Take 2 interactive is as of me typing this now actively engaged in attempting to  ruin the rights of gamers to mod their games single player experience.Boycotts may not work in the game industry , but I can guarantee companies whom actively betray their fanbase will never recieve another dime from me. I  am  not calling for a boycott, I  am  calling for the gamers to  spend their money in a far better way , Go pick up the Saints Row series , or any other game not made by  Take 2 Interactive, there are literally hundreds of thousands of better ways to spend your money and get the most out of it with an enjoable game.Ive been gaming for over 30 years. I have more games than I can possibly finish in my lifetime on all plaftorms released within North America.  I have no need to support such unethical business prectices that Take 2 Interactive seems to champion.
