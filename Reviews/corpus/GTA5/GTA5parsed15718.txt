Loading simulator 2013. 4 years to optimise the game, and even with a beasty PC and an SSD drive mind you it takes ages to load, and it just loops on the loading screen.Come on Rockstar, you greed kunts, with all that money you are making on Shark cards you should maybe spend some on optimisation.The game is good fun online but with the cost of the game and the fact that you have to pay so much for shark cards means you have higher expectations on how the game is maintained by way of controlling the modders and efficient loading times. So yes, its a negative review and is not acceptable considering the money they have made from this and the amount of time it has been out.
