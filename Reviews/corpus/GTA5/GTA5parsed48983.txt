I dont use mods but Im all for modifying and tinkering with stuff that I paid for I bought this game 2 times , once on the 360 and once for the PC , just immagine if a car company said You cant put stickers on your car or you cant mod the engine to give it 600 more hp even if you used it on a private course .You are being s , arent you making enough money ? You like picking on the small guy ? What is your problem , appart from being greedy s who just want to milk us for more money ?
