this is a great game as is yes people aoff with the developers due to the openIV controversy but i dont see people getting up in arms on the other mods that were shut down for gtav that did affect the online component i for one havent modded this game 1 bit and appreciate the fact that rockstar is still supporting this game.This whole review bombing stuff due to somthing the developer did and not actually reviewing the existing content that people should be making there reviews on in the first place needs to stop if anything its made me realize you cant trust player reviews at all as there is to much hate in the gaming community. look at Ubisoft there games get a bad rap due to the hype and then people bomb the review section buring the actual reviews that look at the content as it is presented at release and then there are people that think a game ispurely based on graphics. i got news for you graphics dont make the game the gameplay and controls do.yes it sucks that modding can be ripped out of the players hand like that but take two saw open IV as a way to mod GTAV as a whole not just the single player so they had every right to issue the cease and desist order now that they realize it was only for single player they have said yes you can mod but within reason and they have any and all right to deny modding of there game just like other games do modding is a grey area and it can damage intellectual propertyEdit November 2017 my stance has not changed
