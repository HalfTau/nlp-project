If you are thinking of getting this game right now because you have never played it go ahead, the game itself is worth it. However I dont recommend this game since it still is quite expensive taking into account its age and that state of the game itself. The game itself is easy to hack and Ive seen youtubers posting hacks for free online. This game aso requires a quite good PC to run at high. I guess the only benefit of the PC version are better graphics, new stories in singleplayer and obviously the online DLC. If you already played this game on consoles I would not recommend getting it as in my opinion its a waste of money
