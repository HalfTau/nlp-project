Ive been always a fan of the GTA series, and this one is truly the most detailed between all of them. I certainly miss the huge size of San Andreas map, but this open world doesnt stop surprising you. And Online keeps being updated with new DLCs, competitive modes and vehicles after 5 years after being released, so this game is still pretty alive.Campaign is too short and Online is full of cheaters, bugs and connectivity issues tho. It takes forever to load in a midtier PC I mean, I can literally make my breakfast and eat it or do a whole pile of dishes while it is loading7/10. But cant stop playing it.
