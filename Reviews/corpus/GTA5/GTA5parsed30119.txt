Grand Theft Auto V is a good game, and if all you want to do it play singleplayer and maybe play around with mods it would be a good buy in my opinion.Grand Theft Auto Online is a different story, it was and probably still is a good online mode. But as of the last time I played a few months ago the prices of DLC items have become so ridiculous that I couldnt keep on playing. See in order for me to be able to buy everything in a new DLC I had to play for countless of hours everyday, or buy Shark cards for hundreds of dollars. And I simply dont have time for that.
