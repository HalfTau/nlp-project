This game is somehow more grindy then Diablo 3, yet this game gives you the ability to pay 60 to get 8 million in game cash. Its faster to work a minimum wage job and spend your entire paycheck on in game currency, than it is to earn that money in the same time.Then they file a cease and desist against the biggest modding platform for GTA to push more sales of Shark cards because apparently they havent made enough money the first 3 times they released it.  Overall a solid 0/10 with no mods.  you Take two.
