The game was supposed to be good, and had many high potential and solid features. However decisions have been consistently made to make the game play worse and cost more, without fail. Real shiny game, cost potentially hundreds of real dollars or several thousand hours to get the good stuff in the game, which is rediculous.Also, Take Two have decided that mods that only affect single player should be banned, because it gets in the way of their multiplayer profit margin. And effectively banned all mods from their content. Blah Blah, fair use is a thing, good luck suing them though. OpenIV being banned, there are significantly less reasons to purchase their content.Regardless, I recommend that no one purchases any Take Two products again, I know I certainly wont be.EDIT Rockstar has apparently flexed that muscle and Take Two has backed off. OpenIV is back up and mods are good. The multiplayer currency model is still scummy. And I hate it, but thats why you dont have to play it.
