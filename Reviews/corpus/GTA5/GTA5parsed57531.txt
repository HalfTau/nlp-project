Instead of going after all those cheaters in the online that make it unplayable, they threatened the developers of OpenIV, a SINGLE PLAYER ONLY modding tool that CAN NOT BE USED ONLINE WHAT SO EVER. They even said themselves that singleplayer only modding was fine a while back.Oh, but Scripthook, the actual cheating tool using DLL injection wasnt touched, so the Online is still full of cheaters.Way to destroy what made your PC version worthwhile. If I could still refund the game I would.
