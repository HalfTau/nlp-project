R have stopped making storyline expansions in favor of lazy multiplayer DLCs filled with cars and vehicles with obscene pricetags for the sole purpose of making microtransaction bux. They turn a blind eye from script kiddies ruining lobbies with invincibility cheats and RP resets, but the minute someone receives modded cash they swing into action because that impedes on their Shark Chard revenue. They take community feedback on what needs to be fixed in order to balance the game and do the complete opposite explosive sniper rifle rounds? Really?. This is a 5year old game that is still being sold at 60. I shudder at the thought of what RDR2 will be like based on what R has done with this game.Oh yeah, something something banned mods
