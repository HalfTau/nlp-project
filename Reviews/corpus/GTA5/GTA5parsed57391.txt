Grand Theft Auto V is a magnificent game and a highlight of the series. Rockstar deserves credit and praise for this achievement.TakeTwo however, the publishers of this game, are sociopathic moneygrubbing con artists who deserve to be sterilized. For this title to be enjoyable again, it is imperative that the famous modfriendliness of the Grand Theft Auto Series is reinstated. Likewise, for the world to be a just place, it is imperative that Strauss Zelnick, Karl Slatoff, and Lainie Goldstein undergo mandatory sterilization and thus their removal from the gene pool.
