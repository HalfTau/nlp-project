This is not a review. This is just my way of showing my dissatisfaction with the latest Grand Theft Auto Online DLC Gunrunning. It was obvious from the start that every Online expansion was just overpriced vehicles, clothing and property accompanied with a few new missions, but this latest one takes the cake. It is blatantly clear that Rockstar is trying to milk every possible cent out of the players wallets by including Free to Play type functionality into the newest content to get the newest weapon upgrades intorduced by the DLC you need to buy a bunker, then a Mobile Operations Center and after all that, as if it was not enough, you need to either wait for 180 reallife hoursingame, time stops if you go offline to unlock all the weapon customisations or pay additional outrageous prices to fasttrack the whole process, which in the end costs over 13 million ingame dollars, or turned into shark cards  over 250 euros. The way things are going with the Online expansions, next well get energy bars in the game so that we need to wait a couple hours inbetween the missions we do. That is the only thing separating GTA Online from an ordinary cashgrab Free to Play mobile game. After over 500 hours played, its a real shame seeing such a great game end up in such a pitiful state.
