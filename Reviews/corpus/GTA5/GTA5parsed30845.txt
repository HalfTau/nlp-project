I get why people are upset about open IV, and hopefully rockstar sticks with thier working witht he mod comminuty for a alternative, but they are taking steps to fix what goes on in online, and given that alot of content has to be done in open sessions, its good to see them trying to clear up as much of the griefing as they can, the fall out is the tools being used by those not greifing to just have fun, but agian hopefully they stick to thier comments about working something out there.The current raitings are a reaction to that, the games fun, a little grindy, but fun, the online interactions hwoever can be all but toxic with some of the griefing, and how hard it can be to get away from, hopefully these steps help there.
