Grand Theft Auto V is an big game which contains a lot of details. There are tons of things you can do, both in the offline, and online mode.The gameplay in both modes are excellent, smooth and fun. However Rockstar in my opinion let us down by the way they optimalised stuff.Its a good game. If they spend energy in optimizing the loading screens and work on adding a good anticheat the game would be the best game ever.
