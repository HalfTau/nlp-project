Bring back modding. OpenIV was the only reason I played this game. Without mods, GTA is a boring and repetitive game. OpenIV doesnt make a profit, the only reason you want to get rid of them is because we are enjoying the mods more than your stupid, boring updates.On behalf of the whole modding community, on behalf of OpenIV and all mod creators who have spent hours and hours, creating and perfecting these mods. YOU ROCKSTAR AND TAKETWO!
