Great single player game.Fun multiplayer if it is with friends. Very long load times on the multiplayer.Very bad stance on single player mods. Trying to force us into only buying shiny cars with fake cash. Single player mods should not be banned.Seperate the launchers. It makes money hand over fist. Spend some time and make everyone happy.
