This has been one of my favorite franchises since I would sneak out of class in eigth grade to play GTA3 at a friends house. I saw Rockstar and Take Two as developers that had earned my respect and loyalty, and I looked forward to everything new that they put out.But the direction GTAV has gone has disappointed me. I played it and beat it on PS3, and I bought it for PC because I wanted to try it out with all the mods created by its loyal fans. I was also looking forward to the the single player DLC we had been promised. Now, the game is nothing but a swamp of microtransactions and cheap content updates designed to milk more money out of players.Rockstars actions against the modding community was the last straw for me. Mods give games unlimited replay value and help create a thriving and loyal fanbase. If their goal is to push people away from singleplayer with this move, it has backfired in my case, as Im uninstalling GTAV today. Im going to skip future titles by these companies as well unless they change their stance on this issue.
