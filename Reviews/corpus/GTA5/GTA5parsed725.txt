Ive played this game since it came out, and it used to be fun. Thats not why Im here though. The game has become unplayable. You either spend days grinding missions, find random players that happen to be good enough to complete a heist, then grind heists, spend real money to get the in game currency, or join the mindless drones that chant is there a modder? and beg for money to be hacked over to them. Playing in a motorcycle club or in a company has you targeted by people who have the money to buy jets, who end up bombing you and your crew until you quit or the missions time runs out, or you get targeted by level 300 hackers that make anyone they get near explode. These hackers have been here since the beginning, and Rockstar doesnt seem to ever really do anything about them.
