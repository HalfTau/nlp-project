Uh, with all the horrible reviews from the multiplayer world, its easy to see that this game might be terrible. Id like to mention that this is actually one of the most best games of all time story mode anyway. The character performances are great, the story is amazing, and the graphics and action are secondtonone.Dont throw this game under the bus for its multiplayer experience which Ive never particiapted in anyway  its rock solid and worth the gaming experience.
