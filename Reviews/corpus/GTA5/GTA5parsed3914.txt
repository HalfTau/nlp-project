I have played this on PS3 now on PC and Im happy the most interesting story i have ever known. Maybe this game has some bugs or something bad, but it wont stop me from playing, because its fun. DMaybe the sad part is that players online have the ability to use the chat box, because PS3 had no chat box and most players were nice. And the PC players arent using it, or reading what others are saying.
