Sadly the online portion of this game is full of Modders, or people who use mods normally for single player use, for multiplayer abuse. It a great game for the single player experance, not so much for the online one.The only way to keep modders from getting is by having a large crew that can dominate the lobby an boot out anyone they dont know. It kinda sad that half the game is entirely offlimits unless you know enough people that play at the same time that you can just boot anyone that joins that you dont know, an thus ruining part of the social aspect of it. Getting to know more people, an making more friends.The second reason why I cant recommend this game is due to the price. The price hasnt dropped at all. It been out for a while, along with the fact that also double dip with the shark cards, making is a pay to playpay to get stuff faster game....Rockstar you should of thought more clearly on this, if you were going to do a multiplayer version of grand theft auto, you should of made it a dedicated online game, instead of this hybrid monster that you have developed that is ruining your reputation.
