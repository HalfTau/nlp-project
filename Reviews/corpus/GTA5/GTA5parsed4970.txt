Ive played this game for quite some time now and have enjoyed it......until the latest update which seems to have made it almost impossible to play on a mostly empty server.I really dont understand why Rockstar thinks its a good idea to make the players suffer. Why always do what the fans tell them not to do? It seems everything Rockstar cares about these days is making money and making sure that nobody can get anything in the game without buying shark cards. The offline game isnt great, and the online community is getting more toxic every day. If I could get a refund today I probably would have taken up on that offer since I hate giving money to companies who only care about money and not the gaming experience.Of course the people who make great games deserve to get money for their hard work. But it seems that some companies only care about money these days, and not about the experience at all. Sure, they give out free stuff. But thats something that they really have to do in order to keep people from leaving the game for good. And since you kind of have to pay extra for shark cards in order to get anyting out of the online experience Rockstar owes their players this free stuff and updates. The free stuff really isnt free  theyre charging you real money for ingame money and then offer you some small stuff for free to make you think that theyre good guys. And thats always something that makes me think of scammers. If you have to pay extra for the experience even after buying the game then the game developers need to rethink why they made the game and for whom. Rockstar, dont change what is already good. Listen to the players and stop giving us  updates. Thank you.TLDR Rockstar sucks.
