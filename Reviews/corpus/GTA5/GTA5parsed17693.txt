Grand Theft Auto V? Good, great, if you want the single player experience, get it.Grand Theft Auto Online? Trash, a tedious experience. Absolutely not worth buying if you only think about the online.Only ing dumbasses can have fun with the online game nowadays. Rockstar forces Free DLC but they are so expensive with ingame money that if you want to buy things for yourself, you have to buy those disgusting shark cards. Much of the game hours on my profile are my younger brothers. In the past I let them play the game. This has changed when I found my 15 year youtuber lover cringe fuel brother attempting to hack ON MY PROFILE. Its his fault hes a damn retard, but this would never happen if the Free DLC didt make you either pass 24/7 playing to earn money or pay your way to get the content.
