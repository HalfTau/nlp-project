Great story, Ive beat it on Xbox360, PS4 and now here on PC. Online started out as being fun with friends, but turned into a cash cow with nothing but little kids with their parents credit card murdering you with expensive vehicles. I thought of online as a RP game, but now it is just garbage. The developer quit adding dlc items into story mode and the only way to obtain them is mods. Story mode doesnt sell Shark Cards so naturally they wanted to quit supporting it and force players into online. All those hours grinding to buy the things I wanted online quickly lost to the pay to win players who had everything always had an unfair advantage. Most of the game is online play now.Story Mode  I RecommendOnline  I dont recommendThey shutdown what I considered one of the biggest modding DLCs, LIberty City in  V. Screw Taketwo.
