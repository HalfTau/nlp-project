Why does Rockstar pruposefully make their game unappealing?? Shutting down Red Dead Redemption PC remake, not letting us  make 3rd party servers, and now shutting down OpenIV so we cant even have our own modified single player worlds? WTF!? Im really disappointed in you Rockstar. Me and many others wont be buying your products until you show us you care about us.Sign this petition please3
