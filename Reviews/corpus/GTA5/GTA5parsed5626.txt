Okay so I want to get this off my chest.GTA Online is my favourite game of all time. I have 200 hours on it just on pc and triple that back on my past two xboxes. Most fun Ive had on a game probably.However, people feel it necessary to complain about prices of content like facilities and bunkers and hangars. You dont have to buy them  yes they are expensive, but if you dont have the time or money to put into the gane then you can expect not to be able to afford all of the new content. Simple. You shouldnt complain about prices, even though I acknowledge they are expensive.Next, players. Yes you get griefers who travel Los Santos with the aim of making your gameplay as little fun as possible. But there is passive mode. If, unlike me, you dont like to fight back so they dont bother you again, enter passive mode via the interaction menu so they cannot touch you. Sound simple? Because it is.Futhermore, a common complaint is the amount of modders. In fact, I ran into one yesterday  he was spawning trucks onto players faces. This is exteremely irritating and has a right tot be complained about. If passive mode doesnt work, I would recomment reporting the modder and joining a new session. The likelihood of a modder being in the next one in minimal.I have also read people complaining that the recent updates have been all to similar. True, they have given a very give a few million to start another business kind of vibe, but again, if thats not your thing, you dont have to buy or play it. Period.I could go on for days but there is no need. I would fully recommend this beautifully made freeroam game, with few faults. My Social Club name is VapouRAngeLGTA if you want to play
