So last week me and 3 friends completed criminal mastermind, a really hard achivement. it took us 10 hours to do and we did it in one sitting. Got the 12 mil payout other achivement bonuses, spent some, then logged off for some time.I come back this Morning to find a Rockstar Game Services have corrected your GTA Dollars by xxxxxxxSame with all my friends they lost 10 mill After grinding through a hard and intense achivement, only to have the reward taken away, really sucks the joy out of an otherwise amazing game.
