This is a tough one, lets get over the huge con firstthis is a grind/p2w game. You can simply not getthe new things withouth grinding. But this actuallysuits the game pretty well. It makes the game funeven after many years, and you can never get boredby the freeroam modeThe dlcs are a bit borring since they are all just newways of grinding but the properties, vehicles and weaponsmakes every dlc exitingReccomended9/10
