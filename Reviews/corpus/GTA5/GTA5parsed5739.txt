I really like this game ,and I appreciate all the effort Rockstar put into this game to create one of the best games ever made ,however there are lots of negatives to be pointed out.I dont play the story mode much ,Im particulary into the multiplayer  side which is very enjoyable with so many things to do ,that actually youll never get bored.Needless to say ,I wouldve expected Rockstar would do something regarding hackers who ruined the free sessions.This is a major problem that was meant to be fixed ,however lately I noticed the hackers decreased considerably in the lost couple of months thats due to rockstar doing their job. I appreciate all the free DLCs which kept this game going for the last 4 years . I would rate the graphics 9/10 especially if you play on 4K monitor ,the image quality is quite stunning. All in all a great game ,with tons of things to do ,that will always keep you occupied.
