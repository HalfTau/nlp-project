I dont normally leave reviews but I think that Take Two and Rockstar banning mods is an important enough reason to leave one. This game is okay on its own, but mods are what made this game something special. I have never modded but I disagree with the approach that Rockstar and Take Two are using to increase shark card sales. As much as it pains me to leave a negative review for a game that I love so much, this has to be fixed.Please sign this petition onto save Open IV and bring mods back to GTA
