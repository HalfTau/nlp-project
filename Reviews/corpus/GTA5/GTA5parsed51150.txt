Thank you Rockstar for fixing this mess. But the fact remains you allowed Take two to take SINGLEPLAYER modding away... Even if it only was a quick time. You dont realise that there has been 14,069,068 downloads onalone. That is a huge part of you fanbase who loved you for giving them a game to play as a Police officer, Fireman or EMT. And although single player was quite fun, Mods make it 10x better to experiance. And i completly agree that online modders should be baned.
