You can basically do what you want in singleplayer after you finish, or during the story it doesnt matter. You can obey all the laws or just run everyone over and fight the cops over and over in story mode. In online mode though, some people may come to hunt you down while others wont give abut thats just human nature. As long as you have fun while playing the game however you want, thats all that matters
