This review was a negative review but I have had a change in heart. This was about Open IV. I would just like to say that everyone should just give rockstar a break with the negative reviews. I really do hope that each person reading the reviews gets a chance to read this because I would really like to say that this is a really nice game. It is very beautiful. There are other ways to play this game without mods. There should be a way for Rockstar to embrace modding as Bethesda does with Fallout 4 and Skyrim. This would be a great solution for everyone but in the meantime STOP COMPLAINING! Eventhough this was originally a negative review, I would still reccomend this game to everyone and as I stated earlier, I hope that everyone reads this review and sees a change in heart. This game is not just about the modding. It is also about having fun.
