Over 400 hours on record and about the same off.This will most likely be one of the most valuable reviews.First off GTA 5 single player is crap loads of fun, it has a fantastic story and can be fairly challanging. Another good part is it can take awhile to beat and you can screw around when you feel that need. I played all the other GTAs and they pretty much nailed it this one with their story, After some time now that its been out, Im eager to see what they put on the future table for GTA...its not done yet...cant be.GTA 5 Online is another whole realm. Its fun as hell to screw around it and mess with people. Early on you were pretty limited, and now days they have the whole CEO and body guards, bike gangs and a bunch of new stuff they keep tossing in which pretty much is the same....I feel they are just Scratching a new field with Boss, bodyguards and could even spark something strait off from that in only larger scale. BossSub bosssbody guardsSoldier etc....It could get big but they would need a new GTA face...2 downsides1 The biggest downside to GTA 5 online is the hackers, 95 of the people who claim they are not hackers are or have tried, and it can really mess up a mission you have been trying to get done or put a lot of money into. But besides that, normally hackers dont mess with you too much unless you ruin their time.2 You dont really have a say in your own product to where it goes and how its handled. so you may end up getting some really  missions they are boring as hell and take forever to do with way more chances for it to get crushed.
