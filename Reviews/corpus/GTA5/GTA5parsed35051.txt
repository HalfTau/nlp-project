If only R separated the Online game from GTA V this would have worked out well, but nope. they failed to listen to what Bethesda said and did with TES series Skyrim and Online far apart. Its T2 being all about PR and money grabbing crap.Its how ironic they represented themselves in every GTA Online updates money grabbing and all of this PR nonsense.This game can get boring without every decent mods installed. But saying that, some people who brings all of the modding/hacking to Online is the reason why T2 decides to take the red pill. And for whoever supports this mone T2 has done, youre nothing but console phesants who really has no idea how SP mods generate more revenue for them.
