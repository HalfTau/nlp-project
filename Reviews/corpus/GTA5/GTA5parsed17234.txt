In total I have been playing gta 5 since it was released in 2013 on the xbox 360 and played it when it was released on the PS4 and when i got a computer i got gta 5 on PC. I have over 1000 hours on GTA online alone and have never had a problem. however i turn the game on today and get a message saying they have corrected my account by 1982998 even tho i dont have hacked money and earned all my money legit in the game. i have heard of many other stories of people getting banned and having money taken away from them for no reason so for this reason i cannot recommend this game until they stop taking money and stop banning people that are legit players. It also wouldnt surprise me if Rockstar were doing this on purpose to get more people to buy shark cards esspecially considering the comments Take2 have been makign about not charging enough for shark cards and how they should be makign more money from the game.
