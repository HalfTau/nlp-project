This one is for the OpenIV team and all of us in the modding community. TakeTwo and Rockstar have shown complete disrespect and disregard for the group of dedicated people who give longevity to their games through creative expression. There would not be the interest in GTAV that there is now without the passion and dedication from the modding community. you TakeTwo, you put your interest in cash wellahead of the health of your community and fanbase.
