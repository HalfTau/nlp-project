Well, the game is amazing but the last few updates kind of knocked down the aim of the game, with the doomsday dlc they basically took some street gangters and made them into world saving heroes, and with stuff like the opressor and explosive snipers, however fun, they are overpowered and can be used to troll/greif and annoy other players, overall would recommend to anyone
