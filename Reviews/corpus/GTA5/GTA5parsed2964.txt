Ive played this game on and off for a little over a year.  Its a good game... good graphics... runs smooth on my setup my only issue is the online gameplay.   You struggle searching for online jobs/ matches.  Its difficult to find other players online,  with Rockstars updates and no resolutions the community is having difficulity being able to play with one another.  So once you login online prepare to be killed instantly... over and over.Ive contacted Rockstar and to my suprise no response as the other thousands of players state the same.
