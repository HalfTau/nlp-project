Honestly, Im having a ton of fun with this game, but I dont really think I would recommend it. It requires a TON of grinding, and there are hackers everywhere that Rockstar will not do anything about. I would be fine with the grinding, if hackers werent in every other lobby blowing everyone up constantly.
