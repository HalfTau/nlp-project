Take Two, Ive bought GTA V 3 times! On Xbox 360, Xbox one and PC. I have over 1000 hours on this game, but the truth is I dont play online anymore and whenever I do, now its just boring, the game is dull and I love GTA! I recently downloaded FiveM a mod for GTA V, you know the one that made youre game popular again. Ive been on FiveM for days straight and I havent played GTA online like that in over a year! Without mods your game is gonna die and you clearly cant see that through your money driven eyes. I will always support this game but you just messed up this time! I hope you can see again why mods are so important and also I hope you have GTA VI ready because without mods GTA V is dead. Trust me I dont like saying that.
