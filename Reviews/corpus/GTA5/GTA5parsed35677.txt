Since Take Two has backed off on mods, I have changed my opinion, but beware that multiplayer is still a free to play grind fest, with the most generous offer of 8 million dollars for just 100 dollars IRL, Money that literally could only buy you a few expensive cars, money that will most likely be spent in a day or two if you play online frequently. Stick to single player with mods.
