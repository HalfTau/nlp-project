Straight out the gate Id like to clarify something GTA Online is terrible. Its badly balanced, badly designed, and the team is charge of it have a contempt for its users. I even got banned for litterally just lagging at one point, and I am now perm banned for money exploits Ban was fair, perm wasnt.That however does not change GTA V being an excellent game, one of the best ever made in fact. The Online is an extra, and is not and should not be the main focus of the game. The world R have created, combined with the excellent shooting, driving, and just general gameplay make it an incredible experience. The story is weak, esspecially compared to GTA San Andreas, however that doesnt change how incredible the experience is.Dont let the bad reviews made you think the game isnt good, its just people justifiably annoyed about the poor online experience.
