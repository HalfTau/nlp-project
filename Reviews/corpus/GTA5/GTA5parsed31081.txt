This game. I have enjoyed this game for the past 5 years that its been out. From messing around in singleplayer, to messing around with friends in online. Modding has been a big thing for me, ever since I started playing the GTA Series in general. This isnt right. I have uninstalled GTA 5 in order to protest this, and Im wishing that TakeTwo didnt do this. But they did. Good luck on the sales for  GTA 6, Take Two Interactive.
