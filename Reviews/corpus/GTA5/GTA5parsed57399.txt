Shark cards have ruined this game idiots that bought them should fall on a sword. It is almost impossible to make money in game becasue they want you to buy the money via shark cards and when the community finds a way to make money rockstar patches the game to stop you. A friends account was ban for no reason other than useing a flying car mod in a invite only session literally gone had to buy a new copy. what he heck rockstar jsut make a cheaters only room dont take the game from us.
