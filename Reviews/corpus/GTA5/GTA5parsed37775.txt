Why should we punish Rockstar on a 3rd partys deciscion? The fundamentals of this game should be enough to support the community and seeing as how the multiplayer factors of the game are being butchered with people gathering money that should be easily gained through microtransactions therefore ruining its economy it may be bad but still the purest format of their regards and what they thought should be reasonable. Regardless the game itself is whats being reviewed from winning rewards and its massive console fanbase. All of this because a factor of the game is removed that wasnt even etched up by the dev team so in an honest regard it shouldnt effect all the hard work Rockstar has put into the game after all it wasnt even there call.
