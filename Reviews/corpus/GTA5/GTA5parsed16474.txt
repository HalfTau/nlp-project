Its a good good game, in my oppinion. If you have some freinds u can go  around do missions and more.Its a realy good open world games and it gets updated alot.My pc isbut i can still run it realy well so thats a bonus.For the singleplayer part i cant say to much, since I havent played it too much couse Online is just soo fun.
