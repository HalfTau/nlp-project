Going to be talking about the multiplayer because, lets be real, just about everyone plays for the multiplayer... If youre buying for the singleplayer, get it on sale if nothing else.Now, I think you should dodge the multiplayer altogether. The number one reason being modders. Theyre in at least half of the sessions you join using free mods that anyone can get their hands on, and of course this means there are people that abuse this. Just now for instance, I was in a session with 2 abusing modders, blowing everyone up constantly, trapping them, destroying their vehicles, etc. One even threatened to reset levels, though Im not sure if they can do that or not. But my character suddenly became unplayable after being disconnected from that session so...This game has been out for years, yet online modding is STILL an issue, which probably means Rockstar has just stopped giving a damn and moved on to other things, people modding in GTA is the least of their concerns. Will also be avoiding future Rockstar titles if this is how they treat their games now. But hey, at least the single player is semidecent.
