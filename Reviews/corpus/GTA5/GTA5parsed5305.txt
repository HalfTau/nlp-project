Too many hackers. I went through the courtesy of playing nearly 100 hours before writing this review. It hasnt counted a lot of hours and achievements.Pros1 Great game, good fun. Just as fun as GTA 4.2 Great graphics, decent used as lightly as possible community.3 Decent character creation, good customization.A very good deceptive glaze to the shitcake youll find out it is.Cons1 Hackers, Modders, Children with stupid parents.2 I pumped enough time into this game that I can say without a doubt, modding is affecting me and others around me.3 Nearly every session has a designated modder/hacker. You have to double check and make sure its not PUBG.Cool Story Time I got 400k and I could literally do nothing about it. All my transactions are frozen, and I can no longer do missions that require the purchase of armor/weapons. I tried playing through passive mode entirely and got to lvl 35 with just jobs and missions alone, then the Exp becameand the game forced me to play with others.4 If you want to play online, this might not be the game for you. Launching a private online session with friends is apparently locked when you have no friends online or in general.5 This leads me to my next point When you get into a heist or heist setup, at least one person will die and fail the mission the first three times. I dont know if GTA 5 has steering wheel support but when a mission is important it feels likethe whole team cant aim or live for five seconds without dying.You will play the same session eight to twenty yes this happened times before someonerage quits and you get no money for the time you wasted trying to do the mission.You will have wasted ammunition, wasted  free time and probably spent more money buyingback supplies you just used on the mission you couldnt finish because of the dying mastertroll.TLDR3/10 youre gonna get banned if you hop into a public lobby.You have to trust people you KNOW are gonna  you over.you cant report hackers with ease, it takes a bit of effort accessing the U.I to do so and the hacker will pump 200k into your inventory by this time.I dont like this game because it is focused on micro transactions and punishing helpless players who just want to play the game.
