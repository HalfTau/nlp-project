As much as I love this game for its gameplay I have to give it a negative review for its absolutely terrible optimizaton and performance. I have never played a GTA 5 session without the game either crashing or hardcore stuttering. I have a decently high range PC and fail to run this game well no matter what I do. So far I have triedReducing settings from very high to medium to a point where my game looks worse than xbox 360Edited Nvidia control panel settingsSet game to fullscreen rather than borderless and have disabled/enabled vsyncVerified game cacheMoved it from hard drive to ssdReinstalled gameMy game still runs like trash and causes my computer to heavily lag. I have determined this to be a issue with the ram but  my ram is fine and no matter what I do it still runs heavily on it.
