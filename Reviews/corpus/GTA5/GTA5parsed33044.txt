I recently got banned for forgetting I had my single player mods kept in my files when I went over to online, I got banned for a month and when I came back R deleted 500 hours of my two online characters.I will probably never play this game again because R made it clear they wont give the characters back.Long story short . You. Rockstar. If you ruin Red Dead Redemption 2 I willon your grave
