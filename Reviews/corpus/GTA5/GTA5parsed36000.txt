Rockstar and Take Take Two, How about banning modding all together, you focus on patching up GTA Online and taking down tools that are made for online???? The modding community MAKES this game a good long term game. The only reason MANY people come back is becuase they can mod. 10 years of supporting modding and now you decide nope. ok. Dont buy.
