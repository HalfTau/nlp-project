Current build of the game on Windows 10 crashes out of the box for single player. Support articles say to download their social club software patch manually, but their patch doesnt run for me since it fails whatever check its using to find the game location. Ive checked the run logs and they dont have sufficient cause information, and honestly, Ive no interest in debugging why it doesnt run.Either a game works or it doesnt and this doesnt, so hopefully the devs push out a patch. Until then, I cant recommend a game that doesnt run.
