Still Holds up as a great game even to this day.Fun to play alone but the best expirience here is with a party of 25 people to play with.Loading screens are very long however, its faster to load up story mode first instead of going straight into online.DEFINITLEY wait for a sale, the game is NOT worth full price today. It goes on sale regularly however, so snag it at 65 off when you canTLDR Enjoyable openworld online expirience.7/10
