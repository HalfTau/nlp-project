! !WARNING OPINIONS BELOW! !Where to even start... I never planned on writing a review for this game but the recent open IV incident has sparked me to voice my opinion and yes this is my opinion some will not agree that is life. I dislike where things have and continue to go when a creative modding community is crushed all in the name of money and micro transactions enough is enough.This game on pc practically revolves around the modding community. The shutdown of open Iv is done there is nothing more we as players can do. I am concerned no scared for the future of rockstar games will Red Dead Redemption 2 and its single player modding community be destroyed before the game even launches will GTA 6 suffer the same fate? Yes I agree and acknowledge that online is plagued by hackers but you see there will always be hackers it has been an inevitability of online gaming since its dawn but open IV was a small part of the total hackers the shut down of open Iv has accomplished very little but was very costly it cost rockstar games and take two interactives reputation and trust with the player base. I hope. They will see the mistake they have made and attempt to fix it but I highly doubt itTldr the shut down of open iv was a horrible and badly planned move and has me worried for the future of rockstar and their games
