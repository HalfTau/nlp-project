The game is fun until a modder blames you so much that it bans you. Not only do you get suspended, you also get all of your characters erased being fully reset except for clothes. I have uninstalled this game and plan to never reinstall it. In my opinion, rockstar is completely  and make everything hard to get in online. The campaign is fun, but when you are extremely limited in online,  Overall, the moral of the story is, unless you planned to play the game and get banned, do not buy it.
