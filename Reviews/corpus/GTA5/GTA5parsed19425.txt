Bought mainly as a benchmark just for my computer, I like the story of the game but thats as far as my recommendations for this game would go. Other than the modding fiasco TakeTwo tried to pull, this game is just outright a ing grind. We all thought Destiny was the king of the grind but after playing GTA Online, we didnt know what a grind was. Finding out that most of the DLC you guys release for this game requires ridiculous amounts of money to use to the fullest was the last nail in the coffin for me. Millions of dollars to actually participate, meaning you grind the same missions over and over, or try and pull heists that get ruined at the last second because some dude thought it would be hilarious to kill the target, drive off a cliff, etc.TLDR until Rockstar gets off their asses and puts out some single player DLC for the storyline or quits expecting you to devote your life to GTA Online, dont waste your money.
