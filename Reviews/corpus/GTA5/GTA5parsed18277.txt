Having put over 700 hours into this game the vast majority of which has been online, I feel safe leaving a review.First off, this game, despite being a few years old, is still one of the most visually stunning games in my library. If you have a GPU capable of putting everything to max settings, then you will be as floored as I was about how majestic the game looks. I never thought Id be taken by textures, but holy  They look almost real at max settings.Regarding Online what other reviews say is true its very grindy, almost in a Pay2Win sense. The best vehicles and weapons are expensive  but are still very achievable if you are willing to put in the hours. More often that not, however, I am able to complete missions Online with little to no opposition from other players. For the most part, other players are trying to make money, same as me. And if someone is griefing you? One can always find a new server. That said, getting bombed to oblivion by aon a flying motorcycle can be annoying... at least until you get one of your own, or one of the several AntiAir options available, and then blast the fer out of the sky.Plus, if you just want to drive around and enjoy the view, you can always enable passive mode and watch the chaos unfold right in front of you.Oh, and since the whole RvsMods debacle, I have seen very, very few modders online. And even then, they arent messing with people nearly as often. In the old days, it wasnt uncommon to log into a populated server and find modders spamming UFOs onto the streets or griefing for the hell of it. Nowadays, any modder that pulls that kinda stunt usually disappears pretty quick  either by getting kicked or in a vain attempt to escape the consequences. That said, the Online environment is a lot more friendly than it used to be.Ive actually seen an influx of new players recently  a great sign IMO. People are still willing to pay 60 because it is still a fantastic game whining teens aside.
