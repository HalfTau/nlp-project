Rockstar have really fcked this game up. They havent added in any content for single player since release, 4 years ago. GTA online however... They add the stupidest unbalanced sht making the big 1630 player servers practically unplayable without getting shot with an EXPLOSIVE sniper or a rocket bike or sprayed with the marksman rifle every time you try to have a sniper battle. What annoys me is they dont nerf/patch anything, they just add something to counter the weapon in the next DLC, making the game worse and worse with every DLC. By the time GTA 6 comes out I bet Online will be completely unplayable full of noobs with their shtty explosive snipers. It really bugs me because this game was a masterpiece, stunning graphics, huge map, great story, fun missions etc etc but they ruined it by rewarding and encouraging the noobs and making the actual skilled players suffer. Theres no point in having skill, just buy the ridiculously OP weapons and you can kill ANYONE In fact the other day i got myhanded to me by a LEVEL 50, 300 levels lower than me, because of all these stupid weapons.Oh and not to mention R taking all my completely legit money after not playing for 2 months but all my friends who have modded money were fine. R is milking GTAO dry, then youll have to buy GTA 6 since 5 will be unplayable just so r can fck 6 up and the cycle goes on.This game is still worth buying, there is still fun in it but its sad because it could be so much better if they didnt encourage noobs/grippers.
