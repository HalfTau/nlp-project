Can not reccomend this game anymore. I simply cannot support a company that would rather let hackers and modders run rampant on multiplayer, yet want to punish single player users? ESPECIALLY since your MATCHMAKING is still broken. I can hardly join any jobs or do any heists due to lack of players joining.You really need to rework some of your online mechanics before you ignorantly decided to ruin single player.Youve milked this game to death for money, and now you are turning your back on the players. We players have the wallets. We decide to buy your stuff and fund your company. Not you.
