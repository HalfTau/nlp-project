While I have well over 500 hours clocked on this game, I simply cannot recommend it to new players. Its very clear that Rockstar no longer cares about their game, and hasnt since the release of Heists update back when it was rereleased for current gen consoles and PC.Pros Single player is fun. The game is very beautiful, especially for a 2013 release. Driving/racing/car customization is very indepth and has tons of content. Performance is pretty good, game can run on lowend hardware. Online updates have been free from the start.Cons Single player has been unsupported in terms of new content for well over a year. PvP is horribly unbalanced and honestly has almost no depth or skill requirements to it like you would see in many other PvP games. Rockstar/TakeTwo very obviously does not care about the game anymore, and simply wants to push more microtransactions. TakeTwo has decided to shut down modding of the game entirely recently. The game is not welcoming, and unless a hacker gives you money which could be taken away by Rockstar making money takes a very long time, especially for a new player. Hackers are in nearly every lobby. New content tends to be prohibitively expensive, requiring many hours of grinding to become affordable.
