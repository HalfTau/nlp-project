TakeTwo recently decided to try and kill all mods for the game, and are threatening modders with cease and desist orders all of which comes after they physically sent representatives to the home of a modder for the purpose of intimidation.This applies to singleplayer mods that disable online access when used.The game is fantastic, but TakeTwo is actively alienating a large part of the community by threatening legal action.
