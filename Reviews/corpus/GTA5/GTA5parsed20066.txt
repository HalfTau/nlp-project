Gta 5 is a freaking amazing game....developers keep adding free content that is usually full DLC sized to keep you busy for hundreds and hundreds of hours. Why i finally decided to make a review is beacause i am disapointed with the community. You buy the game GTA V for GTA V, you dont buy GTA V because there are 3rd party mods. When you put down a negative review you think you are a social hero but it only hurts the game that you put hundreds of hours into yourself and anyone who wants to buy the game for what is, but now they arent going to buy it because a bunch of idiots thought it was a good idea to write negative reviews for a really amazing game.
