So the game is fun.Rockstar is not.Singleplayer is great.Mods are great.Until Rockstar removes them to sell more shark cards.Rockstar doesnt give aabout you. Now that they already have your 60 for the game, their only goal is to sell more Shark Cards. They make everything just a little TOO expensive too grind for, and remove mods so they will sell more shark cards and earn more money.Rockstar doesnt give a  about her community. Only about her money. Its her only goal.
