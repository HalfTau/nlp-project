Honestly, Its a good game. These people crying about single player modding are just big ol babies. They release free multiplayer DLC on the regular, the game runs well, it has a good single player story and kind of a good multiplayer one. Theres plenty to do by yourself, or with your friends. Removing mods for single player doesnt make this any less of a good game. The biggest issue the game has though, is hackers in multiplayer. Every once in a while youll run into someone who spawns a male hooker on your face and forces them to face  you, but you switch lobbies and keep going about your business.All in all the game is a solid 8.5/10
