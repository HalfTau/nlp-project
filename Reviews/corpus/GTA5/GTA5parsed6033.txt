Loadtime are out of this universe. Literally 35 minutes on load screen.In the few hours of playing, ive seen ive literally spent more time loading and trying to play vs actually play. This being the online side as the SM seems to load just fine when I play. Game is terrible and no where near what I was hoping for after this long of being out. Pretty much done playing this game.I feel terrible my roomate got me this to play with him as hes not a hardcore gamer and enjoys the fun of a fkaround game. Sad to say console has this title covered.. at least better than PC.
