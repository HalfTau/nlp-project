I do like GTA V, but I also like the community and user generated content that comes with it.I have nothing personal against the actual game developers Rockstar. Their skill is absolutely amazing and as far as I understand it they are not the ones responsible for TakeTwos sinister and greedy intent to destroy the GTA modding community.This is pretty much a shot at the entire GTA user base. They are pretty much indirectly saying you play the game we give you or go to hell.Well TakeTwo you can go  yourself. l literally hope your corporation selfdestructs and those selfimportant tophat maggots in management fall over and land in some steamy wet dogThe general gaming community, PC, Apple, Playstation, XBox or whatever  all need to resist this t and start taking a stand against these overpowering corporations or have infected the creative industries of pretty much every aspect of our human lives. It has become outright rediculous how the entertainment and art genres both within and outside of the computer industry have become subject to the wills and intents of these money hungry sonofaes of whom I am sure  many  have not played a  single video game in their life, let alone the ones they sponsor.I sure as hell cant refund this game, and frankly I am not sure if I would at this point if I could as I do enjoy GTA V. But, TakeTwo has pretty much committed suicide in my books. As far as I am concerned they no longer exist, and neither do or will another TakeTwo associated game. If I ever cross the path of another I will simply give it the finger, fart in its general direction and walk away.Seriously though   YOU TAKETWO.
