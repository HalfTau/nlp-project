Take Two does not give a crap about its loyal fans. All they care about is money. Not one single player DLC. Just a bunch of online crap added to make people buy shark cards. They ruined the game for a bunch PC users. I have this game on console and bought it on PC just for modding and having fun and they ban it just to sell their shark cards! This game gets extremely boring without mods to be honest. Theyre probably going to introduce  paid mods made by them just for money!
