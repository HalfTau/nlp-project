The story mode is fun and all but mods are the ont thing that really added replay value. Someone could say that is what gta online is for but honestly the online mode is just a way for them to take your money considering that they are always adding something new to the game that will cost you 23 million dollars ingame and there really is not legitimate way to get that without throwing your life into this game or buying shark cards.
