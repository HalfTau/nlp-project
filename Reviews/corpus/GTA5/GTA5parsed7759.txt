I tried playing GTA Online today. Heres my experienceJoined a heist, failed and someone instantly leftGot invited to the same heist, joined, host left before we could even startSomeone who I can swear has a mental disorder flamed me in chat, and began chasing me down in an attack helicopterI exported one car which will be all the money I could get todaySomeone decided to target me and killed me at any moment they could.Then my car exploded for literally no reason. If it was a mine or a rocket, the game will tell you that you were killed by someone else. I noticed several other people dying for no reason and assumed it was a modder so I left.None of this includes the people begging for modders to give them money in chat, and other people being generally toxic.
