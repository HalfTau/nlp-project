Take Two Interactive and RockStar Games need to realize that even though they created the game it doesnt mean that people that buy it have to play it the way they want them to.GTA 4 was a good game but only went so far. Modding the game made its life expectancy much longer. LCPDFR is a big reason why people were still buying the game up to the point and even after GTA 5 was released.Then RockStar says if you want to mod the game thats fine. If you cant do it online. I understand that because of the currency aspect to the game. If you nod you get banned simple as that. OK fine.Now we have people working on their own servers to host online gameplay of GTA 5. Take Two and RockStar are. It loosing money from that but they get upset and send out letters and the project ends.....but then it continues months later and is great.Now that they see they cant stop them they go after OpenIV that allows you to easily mod the game as far as textures, skins, models and so on.All I have to say is that when GTA 6 is released and they see that it doesnt sell as many copies and doesnt continue to sell copies after the hype dies down maybe then they will realize the positive impact modding has on their sells and income produce by their games.They want to be antimodding then thats fine but say goodbye to the money you guys make after your game falls flat and gets boring.
