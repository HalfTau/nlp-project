I am a fan of the GTA franchise and R is truly the master of the genre. The single player mode is fantastic, I think I played that through 45 times at least.Online mode is however overtly complex and is getting more so with ridiculous new modes. I started playing the game on PS3, but after a hiatus, getting back into online is steep and not very satisfying. Im sorry, but the silly simplicity of GTA IV GTA Race mode was much more entertaining.Also, it is very disappointing that a single player DLC never materialised, probably because of milking the online mode  sad reality of gaming these days.As much as I love the game, I have to vent my disapproval with a not recommended.
