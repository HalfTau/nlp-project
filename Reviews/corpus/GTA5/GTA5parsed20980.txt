Shark cards ruined Singleplayer Rockstar games. period. It will happen again in RDR2, this time they will be called Bonds. Screw GTAO, make it seperate from your singleplayer portion, and keep supporting SP too. Not everybody is into the dumb online portion of GTA, but all you do is focus on that and cash in on it, Big time.There goes your flawless image, all due to greed. From Rockstar and Take Two. Great job. And with the whold open IV debacle you can count yourselfs in the ranks of EA, UBI, Square, etc. etc.
