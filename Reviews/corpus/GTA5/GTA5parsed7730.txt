I love GTAV ever since it came out on the old gaming consoles now that I have it on pc and that it runs perfectly, I dont have anything to complain about it.I just wanna say that it is amazing to lay in bed while still managing to shoot hookers, rob banks, and customize a variety of things for your players.Come on down to Los Santos and enjoy the beautiful landscape before you.
