My review was positive but now its negative. Not only is Taketwo acompany with all of this cease and decisting OpenIVbut the online portion is a P2W fiasco. Ive been kicked from GTA 5 online sessions from doing absolutly nothing and just being in my apartment. This once got me placed into the bad players pool. I then tried to contact Rockstar and explain but they ignored me. This is why i not only hate Taketwo but also Rockstar.
