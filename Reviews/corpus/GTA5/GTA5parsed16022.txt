Great job Rockstar! You did it! You lost my trust as a consumer. When I was first suspended for no ing reason I was understandably angry, but I got over it quickly because I knew I could still play. I even wrote a review on the game that I had to delete for this one. This though, this is ridiculous! I cant believe it! I was playing and did all my work honest by doing jobs and a couple heists but they give me a nonappealable, full time ban, online... for nothing! I cant play online and I want my 60 back for this If you buy the game for the story, thats fine but I got it for online, and to have it stripped away from me for no reason? That is just unbelievable. I dont recommend GTA because Rockstar has screwed me and many others again and again. I am baffled. I put 60 and 150 hours in this game to have it reverted to  all. I cant wait for GTA6 so they can  me over again! If you have any self respect do not buy this piece of I will agree its amazing and incredably fun but when they can tear it away at a whim? That isnt worth it. If you have a question feel free to ask.
