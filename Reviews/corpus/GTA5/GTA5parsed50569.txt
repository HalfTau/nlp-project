I have a great deal of time in the game, I enjoy rockstar creations and their take on the social issues of our current times. I am saddened to see that they have decided to shut down the very community that supports them. It is sad to see a company that has been supportive of the modding community for so long shutting it down for whatever few profits they can get. I will no longer be supporting Rock Star or purchasing their games in the future. This is a personal choice and one that if enough prople stand behind we can change the companies actions as a community.
