TakeTwo interactive is single handedly destroying the modding community. Hundreds of thousands of people have bought Grand Theft Auto series games simply for modding and has contributed thousands if not millions of dollars back into the hands of TakeTwo. Instead of catering to the community,  the fans and the people who made them into a company they shut down OpenIV in a careless effort to shift money back into their own pockets. TakeTwo is putting profits over the community and it cannot be tolerated.Please sign this petition to save OpenIV and the modding community
