They dont use turn signals ever, they run straight ing into you and cause you to bekilled at almost any time you come into contact with themThe police will literalkly spawn in front of you and they will try to hit you even when you dont have them chasing you, they know exactly where you are even if they havent seen you.I would not recommend this game to ANY gamer unless you buy it for five dollars and many of your friends have it already.
