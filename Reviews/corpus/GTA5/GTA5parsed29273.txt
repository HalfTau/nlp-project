Not great value for money! I purchased an in game office and warehouse for approx 2 mill  about 20 in shark cards  , I spent about 8 hours stocking it up, to try to make about 650k net, 300 or 350k profit, then  after some other mission it informs me my warehouse is under attack and I cant even hire a helicopter to get back to it before all my stock is destroyed.  Fortunately I managed to quit, using Exit Game, which doesnt save my progress, thus saving 8 hours work. But the game trying to rob me of 8 hours plus in game grind work is serious bull.
