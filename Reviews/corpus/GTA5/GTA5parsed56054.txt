A fairly decent experience ruined by the greed of its publisherThe online portion of the game is plagued by updates containing high cost items with the only option being a slow grind or to dish out hundreds of dollars/euros on shark cards that give amounts that barely cover any of the costsEDIT Removed the modding portion, but the rest of the points still stand for online being a Grundy, expensive mess
