its a really fun game but it gets really boring over  a while doing the same heist driving the same cars shooting the same guns flying the same planes etc.also i played this not for really long but i know the struggle for getting the money for like a descent super car or pimping your ride out its just not fun and seeing the lv 10s with a t20 proto or even a hangar is just heartbreaking when they just buy shark cards
