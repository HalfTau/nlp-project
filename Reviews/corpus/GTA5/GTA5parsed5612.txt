21 hour ingame , since purches , that was like few days ago . Just proves how addictive it is . And the online is not as bad as they say it is , cant denie , if you dont get events x2 cash/rp than it might prove quite hard . But once you hit the rythm you will enjoy the game D .I acualy play alone online only since i have completed single player  and my oppinion is while it has discount , get it if you can ! Its prety fun and alot of cool new things are constantly coming so no doubht it wont get old .
