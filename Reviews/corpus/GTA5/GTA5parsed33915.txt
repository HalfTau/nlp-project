I bought the GTA V for Xbox 360, then Xbox one, and now PC. The only reason I even had the slightest inclination to do so was for my interest in single player modding. Not a single interest to bring it in to the GTA V Online portion of the game, as I am sure millions of us do. I am sorry that a few bad eggs can ruin it for everyone, but those that wish to cheat online are still going to do so. It would be one thing if the Online DLC was even worth it, but honestly every pack that comes out sucks. And nothing has come out for single player in years. I would not even be playing GTA V again if it wasnt for my ability to enhance the single player mode for my enjoyment.All in favor of boycotting  GTA 6 say I.
