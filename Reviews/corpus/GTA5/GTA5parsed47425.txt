This game is a great sandbox to create what you want, and after Take Two decideding to shut down OpenIV, it lost that, I loved this game and modding it, but now they stole that from us to force us to play their online and buy their shark cards. Its sad, guess I can uninstall this, no need for it if I cant mod it.
