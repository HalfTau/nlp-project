Rockstar makes the entire game around GTA Online, and yet it is absolute trash. You can only unlock vehicles is by eitherA grinding through repetitive missions to earn money,or B spending absurd amounts of real money on sharkcards.Not only does option A get boring, but if a hacker comes onto your server and screws with you, you can get banned and your entire character reset. They dont accept any appeals, and there is no customer support whatsoever  just automated messages saying that all bans are final. What could have been a great game and awesome online multiplayer turned out awful.
