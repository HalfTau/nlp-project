Ive been more than a little dissappointed with the lack of additional single player content over the last few years... I was less than thrilled with how badly implemented GTA Online turned out to be.  So many obnoxious, pointless, loading screens.  So much trouble to actually get a good game going with friends.Eventually, just gave up and moved on to other things.Now, I hear about Take Two Interactives assinine assualt on single player modding, figure Id pop in and look around.60 dollars for a game this old? This grindy?  With far too much insentivization of the pay to win shark card model?Yeah.  No.Just cease and desist playing the game.This game friggin sucks cause they have made openIV illegal, basically killing ALL mods and therefore making singleplayer useless. Also, it is clearly cause they want to push microtransactions by pushing us to the online mode. You suck Take Two.take two just ruined gta v and lost all my interest in the game. modding kept gta fun and enjoyable but now it wont be fun to play gta because modding is illegal. I will now say goodbye to gta v until they allow mods again. Now i am going to go to another open world game to mod. ByeRIPAn amazing continuation of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Nothing more is really needed to be said.Just another grain of sand.Support modders worldwide.Let us mod.
