While everyone else is down voting over mods, I have other beefs with GTA V. For starters, for a game that uses the max Payne 3 engine, you cant shoot from behind cover although enemies can. Also, earning money is everything for this game which is fine. However, when Im going a mission that cost me a lot of money to start and the fame glitches costing me a lot of money, that is enough to make me put down the game for months. Im fine if I lose money due to player errors but screw you Rockstar for not fixing a mechanic that turns off players. Me and my friends have put in almost 400 hours combined and there is soooo many neat picky things about the game that make it frustrating. For example, if you are in a group of friends, only one gps navigater line can be used at a time which sucks if you want the group to temporarily split up. Finally, the pay to win in this game is toxic. You can drop 10 dollars in real life money to buy stuff in game like tanks that are hard to fightagainst as normal players.
