Single Player is awesome, but multiplayer needs to be fixed, too many modders online. I dont mind modders, I just hate when i grind my ingame money hard and some kid shows up and gives everyone money. Then Rockstart shows up and takeaway all ur money u have, reset ur balance to 0. It doesnt matter to them, couse it was modded money.
