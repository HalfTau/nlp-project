Seriously, the anticheat in this game is on another level. Its laughably trash.First i get banned after playing the game for the first time in months, shoot my RPG at a hacker I get banned.Then after uninstalling and waiting well over a month for the temp ban to run out, reinstall game overnight, play for 30 min the next day with my friend who is not modding. I shoot him down for bants, he guns me down.You have been banned from Grand Theft Auto Online permanently. Return to Grand Theft Auto V.
