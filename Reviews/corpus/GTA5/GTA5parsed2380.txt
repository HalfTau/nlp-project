First of all I love GTA!! !My very first gaming memories were playing GTASan Andreas with my friends.GTA 5s Story mode is classic and one of my favourite video game storiesonline there is lots to do but the hackers!! !Every second lobby has one.Rockstar even if you have to do it like Rainbow Six Siege did fix the hacking problems.If you want to play online get ready to GRIND.There is lots of content and I give Rockstar credit for that and the races are awesome,but you HAVE to reduce the prices of some of the cars and planes.I have grinded for everything I have but I have played for alomost for 150 hours.I would buy this game for single player only honestly.If you want to play online get friends it helps alot.The verdictIf you want this game for single player get it you wont be dissapointed,but if you want it for online get friends or you are gonna have to grind alot and be patient and nice to others in online.BTW I live in South Africa and sometimes I lag alot,Rockstar there are so many people in South Africa who plays this game so Rockstar put up servers.Peace out Nerds tell me what you think down below
