i was banned once before because of a modder. a few months after i was unbanned i started playing again. in less than 1.8 hours i was permanantly banned. i didnt do anything nor will rockstar acknowledge me when i submit a ticket to be unbanned. they just give the same generic response each time, all i ask when i post a ticket is why i was banned, not if i can be unbanned.
