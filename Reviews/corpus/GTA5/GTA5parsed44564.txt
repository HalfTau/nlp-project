I want to give this a good review, I desperatly do. I bought the game at launch on 360, I rebought it for Xbox one at full retail again, and I picked it up for PC on sale.But, after almost 4 years, they are still charging 60 for this game. Sure, it may still hold the quality of a 60 AAA, but the fact it hasnt chaged in 4 years?Then, theres the character transfers, or lack therof. They removed the option to transfer in march of 2017. This has led a lot of people moving from consoles to PCs, or consoles to consoles, having all of their stats taken away, for very little reason.And finally, The shark Cards. 8 Million dollars does not get you much in this game. Maybe 3 or 4 nice cars. Maybe a small, low tier bunker? For 75. More than the cost price of this game. Sure, they may be bringing updates every now and again, but that is no excuse. Not to mention the fact they have scripts in place in Single Player to despawn any DLC cars they detect.All in all, Rockstar is just trying to maximise their profits, they dont care about the playerbase, they ban people just for recieving a couple million dollars against their will but let actual griefing modders that kill the entire lobby every 5 minutes stay virtually untouched.
