Dear GTA 5,Its been a long time, has it not?Ive thrown money into you, had some fun when anti cheat measures were set into place and cheaters became something of a rarity. Though, your neglect regarding certain things has irked me so well, I would like to thank you for the fun that you have given me.However, this is where the fun ends, I cant play you anymore because there are games taking your place because you refuse to move away from micro transactions.Its clear, its the only way you make money currently, but find a new means in order to do so.Singleplayer? is a fine game with fantastic progression. Earning money, doing missions, feels great, keep that up, feels like a good game.Multiplayer? Its hard for me to say in words the tedium this game brings, the frustration of loosing so much and gaining so little, it  demolishes you eventually.Ive found new horizons to invest my money in, thank you for the time and the laughs, but I think this is a bout time where all of this is hung up.I may come visit you again just to enjoy the nostalgia, but without cusom player created missions, i dont think this game has any more legs to stand on.Sincerely,A concerned GTA player.
