This is one of the best casual games out there.The single player campaign is amazing and will have you invest your emotions heavily on the 3 protagonists. The level of detail and the great performance from the voice actors were the icing on the beautifully crafted cake. Bugs and crashes are extremely rare or almost non existent  without modding or strenuous settings. The game would always be fun even after you finish the main campaign and I strongly recommend going through those Strangers and Freaks missions because theyre fantastic. On the single player alone, 9.5/10Online Mode however suffers from quite a lot of problems. One of the problems being the extremely long, unnecessary, and idiotic loading screens. You join a new session enters loading screen and if the sessions full you would have to press return to your own session which you were always in with another loading screen. Playing heists with random players, especially new players would be a pain. They ruin the game and then left due to frustration and being punish with... NOTHING. During this process of loading in and redoing the heists, there is probably 50 of loading screens which could be easily fixed or removed. If the loading screens arent the worst, cheaters and modders are everywhere, literally, and they will ruin your experience. Overall, I did have fun doing the heists regardless but still often frustrated with the leavers and the loading screens. With those points Ive stated, Ive decide to give this mode a 7/10 and if those problems were rectified, it could easily be a 9/10 experience.Final verdict GTA in general is one of the best games there is up to date and youre missing out in life if you havent finished the campaign and grind the multiplayer. I understand that the targeted audiences are casuals no offense and it is an outstanding casual game! I had loads of fun with my friends online and loads of fun with the single player. 8.5/10  MustOwn
