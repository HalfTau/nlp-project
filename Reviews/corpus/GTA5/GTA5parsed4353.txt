Rather Fun game,It has lots of things to offer,its super fun to go into a game with friends and wreak havoc on everything,And there is storyline!Super open game you can do lots of things in.The physics of the game can be a bit off though, like sometimes you can drive around and hit a bush and blow up your carThe cops seem to pop up before you can dodge them, other than that amazing game9/10 I highly recommended this game.
