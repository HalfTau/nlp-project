this game is absolutely riddled with modders, cant do a fkn thing without dying from nothing, getting random money or level ups or crushed by adders, it makes it really boring. and if you get this game you better either have a lot of money in real life to buy in game currency or a sht ton of time because it takes a massive amount of time to make money and buying money with real money removes the point and fun of the game. so much for rockstars anticheat tools, they suck and legit players get affected because they get money from modders without wanting it and get banned and reset as a result. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME! youll regret it.
