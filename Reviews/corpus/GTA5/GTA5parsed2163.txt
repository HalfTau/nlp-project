Show this review to any parents worried about their childs decision to purchase Grand Theft Auto Five because of the strip club accessabilityThe strip clubs are completely unnecessary to complete the story, progress in the game, or have fun. They are completely optional.On a more serious note, despite Take2 ing over the modding community, and GTAO shark cards are a bit of a scam, the singleplayer has an excellent story, and as long as you dont get banned for strange reasons or modding in multiplayer BIG NONO and you have some friends to kill some time with, you can make the grind much easier and more fun. The heists are a breeze with your friends and its a blast to hang with your buddies.
