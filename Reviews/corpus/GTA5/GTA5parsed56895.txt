rockstar/take2 clearly hate their customers pc release delay for years as one of examples and have now declared open war to customers and forbid even singleplayer mods and harass volunteer mod creators with cease and desist letters.no more money from me to rockstar or take2, until they restrain their corporate greed and publicly apologize. threatening legal action against volunteer community is the worst they could have ever done. even EA would not steep so low.
