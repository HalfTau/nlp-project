This game is highly addicting. Consumes alot of time yes, you need to grind alot to make money yes, but overall its fun and I like how I can showoff all the hours I have grinded with things I can purchase. Although people who dont get much time may not like it because of being unable to work for hours to make money but to be honest there are other ways like the adversary modes too where they have double cash and rp bonus and they pay out well. Overall, its been very addicting for me and alot of fun with friends.
