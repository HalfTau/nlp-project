First and foremost I will say this game has had a problem with installing on my pc, to the point where Ive had to install the game 7 times over the course of my 78.8 hours of play. There have been many good points while playing this game, mostly from playing with friends on the online, but the majority of the time Ive been very lukewarm to it. I dont know if my feeling toward it were from my previously stated tech issues or my distaste for microtransactions in a 60 game, or because the gameplay just isnt my cup of tea. Regardless of why, Ive never been able to fully get into it. And now with Take Two shutting down OpenIV A tool that basically allowed modding to take place, I doubt I will ever be able to dredge up the incentive to play it again. In summary I didnt like the game to begin with and Take Two has killed any reason to play again.
