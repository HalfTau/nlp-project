This is a great solo game, but the online game has run by 10 year old hackers.DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON SHARK CARDS. the online game has a modder in almost every lobby. Theyve completely ruined the game for people who want to play by the rules. So if you like free money in the game, just hit up any modder. if you want to play the game legit, well you screwed. cause the modders will do what ever they want to you in the game.And we must give a special thanks to the rockstar programmers for their complete inabilaty many years straigt for being completely unable to stop the modders from hacking the online game and ruining it for wouldbe loyal customers. I regret the shark cards I bought. the online game is completely currupt.
