I cant really give this a neutral, so whatever,Pros is fun if you have lots of ingame money, Like me, and its the only reason im reccommending itCons SO MANY MODDERS The worst loading times Ive ever experienced in my life The developers are the money hungry af Up there with EA  Activision, They charge 125 NZD FOR ING 8 MILLION, which is worth about 4 good super cars. 5 years after the game came out and its still 91.99 NZD like wtf. Pretty cancerous community. Its kinda pay to win in some aspects, The grinding in this game is horrible, It takes about a week to earn 10 million in game which really isnt much.So the only reason Im giving this a positive review is because I have a lot of money so its actually fun.
