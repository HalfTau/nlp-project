really not that special of a game despite what others once said. The world looks crisp but lifeless and dull.No postgame activities worth playing at all. Worst of all, they made it so you earn money as slowly as in real life. GTA has surely lost its soul.GTASA was the last game where GTA was fun to play.Now, they are designing things with a straightjacket with a focus on milking online cashcards. It would be a boring grind fest  if you didnt participate in their microtransactions haven. Take Two is now no different than the next Ubisoft / EA.
