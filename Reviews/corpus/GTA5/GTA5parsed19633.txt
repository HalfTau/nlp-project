Edit while i was able to get the DRM to stop defecating on my computer, I still cannot recommend this game because of it. I bought this game so me and my brother could have some laughs over GTA, but he cant even ing play it through the Family Share system because of the DRM.Rockstar is treating its players like ing criminals and thieves. Leashing everyone because theyre worried about pirates. Which, from what Ive heard, is the superior way to get this game because you wont be dealing with the DRM to play THE SINGLE PLAYER.So yeah. Pirate it. Tell Rockstar to eat aby not giving them your money and still playing their games. Its the morally correct thing to do.
