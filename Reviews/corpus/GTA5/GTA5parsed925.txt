If you like to constantly get harassed by other players while trying to do ceo missions or motorcycle club missions such as, resupplying, stealing cars for your vehicle warehouse, or delivering your product, than this game is for you. If you dont, well dont get this game because thats what will happen if you buy this game. I tried to like the game but everytime I try and do my ceo missions, there is always someone trying to screw you up and you cant do ceo missions or motorcycle club missions in a private session. You should be able to but you cant. Please dont buy this game. Rockstar needs to know how messed up this game is. Also I didnt mention the amount of cheaters in this game. Almost every session you will join, there will be at least 1 modder killing you over and over again by blowing everyone in the lobby up and going invisible and using infinite health and teleporting you around everywhere. Its a shame because this game has so much potential to be a masterpiece but there are so many flaws that rockstar doesnt address. Instead, they make new content hoping people will ignore the fact that rockstar is letting all these modders into their game. And yes I know, I dont have many hours in this game but ive played it enough to know what kind of crap goes on in this game because I even bought the criminal enterprise pack for the businesses hoping it would be better but its actually worse since everyone in the lobby knows where all of your product is at all times.
