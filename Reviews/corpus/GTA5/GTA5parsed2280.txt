GTA 5  Great Single Player experience and MODSGTA Online  Grindy as hell, Hackers, connection issues Rockstar please fix this,Low PayoutPlease increase, everything expensive, connection issues again, the community as a bit salty. But its really fun when you play it with friends and all the things that you can buy is cool as hell but again, expensive. Overall i think GTA Online has its cons more than its pros but that pros is whats keeping me here
