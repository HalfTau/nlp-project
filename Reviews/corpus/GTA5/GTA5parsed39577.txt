 TakeTwo, and  Rockstar for acting like they have no responsibility for managing their own game. Their  online practicies and repetative DLC already rubbed some people like me the wrong way, but this blatant attack on the modding community, which by the way has nothing to do with online play at all, is crossing the line for more people than I think they realized. Lets see how low the steam rating for this game has to go before they back off and let singleplayer mods exist in peace.
