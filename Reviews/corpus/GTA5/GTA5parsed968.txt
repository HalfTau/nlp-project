The story mode is great but Rockstar do something about GTA online !!! There are alot of players using hacks GODMODE  Using hacks where in they kill everyone in the session without even being seen... Plus I have players who drop random things on top of you in which you stuck in for hours until you quit and join a new session... Seriously? I was excited to buy this game for PC just cuz the graphics will be amazing and thought I would love the online aspect of the game but now I dont know anymore. Stopped playing just cuz of this!Please introduce anticheat system or you will keep loosing players.Now I dont know how much of these feedbacks are passed onto Rockstar.
