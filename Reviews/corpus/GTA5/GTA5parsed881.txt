Playing this game for almost a year now. If you want to have content cars, Appartment, CEO etc you have to do many many missions that get boring or buy shark cards. They charge you stupid amounts for cars that are 10 time higher as in real life. This is what makes the game frustrating. Now many players use mods to spawn cars or make money faster. They also use cheats to play in god mode or have one shot kills and exploding ammo. Finally i was sick of being killed all the time by unfair players and installed my own mod menu. Now i am banned from the game.Rockstar should invest time in making the game better protected against modders and cheaters. But no, they decide to ban players that have had enough of the unfair players. This game is leak and unsafe.
