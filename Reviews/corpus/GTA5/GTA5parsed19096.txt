I am really mixed. This game is great when you are playing in single player mode. I loved the character of trevor because I totally liked to play a crazy bad guy who always wake up somewhere on the map in underpants after a night of drinking and picking up fights. The map is so diverse, missions are funny and sometimes challenging even if the game is not difficult to complete. There is so many possibilities, funny characters, great locations, great cars, possibility of customization and so many adventures and scenarios possible... This was my favorite GTA since Vice city and San andreas.I also have to say that the game runs fantastic on my quite old gaming computer.But after I completed the story mode, I heard that rockstar had no plans to extend the single player mode. No DLC in the future. They choose to focus only on the onlive game....I tried the online game. I hate it. I tried many times because people were always talking about it how great it is. I tried to find the fun in it and I failed. Its not funny. Its a mess, people running around and shooting at you, challenges that you dont know why they exist, and as an oldschool gamer I never take part in microtransactions so it seems that there is nothing for me there. And the long waiting time at the start of the online game is really annoying, same with the big loss of performance compare to the single player mode. Im done.I want to be able to play Trevor again and have new missions in single player.... I still ride the streets of los santos just for the fun to drive in a so beautiful game. Its a shame that rockstar dont want to listen to the fans.
