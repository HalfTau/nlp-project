A good game, its really fun to play with friends.Of course you may feel its hard to earn  in the game, me too. But if its too easy to earn , then there no point you have to try for.Plenty of mission and perfectly prepaired Heist to play, Im sure you wont get bored But you will if you play alone all the time.Lots of stuffs to buy, to play, and Id recommend you to search for some beginners guide for the game before going online. You wont want to have a bad start in Grand Theft Auto Online.
