If you are buying this game for a good singleplayer experience, it is the game for you.If you are buying it to have some great fun online, do not buy this game.The singleplayer itself is very good, with a really nice storyline that revolves around three characters. You get to see what happens in their lives individually, and see them come together on missions. It is not a quick storymode experience if you plan to 100 the game. You are a bit limited to what you can do in the storymode however, which is the only turn off. You cannot change the main characters cars, you cannot share money with each character so you are unable to main one character, it isnt very easy to make money towards the end of the game. You do however make a large amount at the very end, but it goes quick and is not easy to make back up again.The multiplayer isnt the worst thing I have ever seen, but it definitely is something to look past when purchasing this game. From highleveled, rich players killing you constantly, a broken matchmaking system that takes forever to fill up, extremely long loading screens in the online menus if you dont have a SSD, players in your group doing something stupid and then you fail the mission, or even the constant grind to get anything very good. It is clear that the developers are digging a hole for themselves as they add more and more expensive stuff to multiplayer, expecting people to put 100s of hours into the game just to buy something. Of course, you can always buy one of those microtransactions. You know, the thing that EVERY SINGLE GTA V player asked for when they spent 3060 dollars on this game. Yes Rockstar Games, I would love to spend more money on ingame currency after buying your 60 game that is nowhere near worth 60.Pick up the game when it is on sale. It isnt worth more than 30.
