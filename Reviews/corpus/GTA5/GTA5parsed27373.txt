People are angry at R because of this whole OpenIV drama, meanwhile it is TTI that are the real culprits here.They have tried for so long to create a game that would be enjoyable for a large number of people, and even supported SP modding. Hell, they even showcased some mods on their own website. Now that TTI got theirtogether and removed the Cease and Desist, maybe they will actually see the potential in letting the modding community thrive.That said, I am still leaving a negative review for now, to show TTI that they simply shouldnt  over their community, nor R themselves with this kind of t.
