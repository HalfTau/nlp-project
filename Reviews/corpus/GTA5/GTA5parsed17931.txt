Just built my first pc in july and have been waiting to buy this on sale since i had already had it on consol and just wanted to play online. Was disappointed to find out that the character transfer was stopped on march 6th 2017. its still a good game just be warned if your looking to transfer your character you cant. Didnt know myself so hopefully you do now. On a side note the graphics were pretty spectacular compared to consol.
