This is a fun game really, both on PC and on consolegot it on PS4, GTA online mostly. But given the publishers stance on mods, though my current PC can just barely run this game, I cannot recommend anyone to support this publisher at this current time, unless they change their stance. So, heres my laydown of this game...ProsVery fun multiplayerVery diverse and interesting single player campaignlooking at you TrevorEndless hours of entertainment just tormenting the NPCs.ConsCurrently, the publisher has banned all mods for this gameSometimes, the GTA Online aspect gets tiresome with most players in public lobbies just wanting to kill you nonstop.The money publisher makes things way too overpriced ingame, making sure you buy the GTA Shark Cash cards for ingame GTA Onlinemuch Pay2Win microtransactions I hateAll in all, great game, bad publisher.
