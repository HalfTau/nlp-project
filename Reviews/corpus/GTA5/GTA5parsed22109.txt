Screw you TakeTwo and Rockstar for ruining a good game.These negative reviews arent because the game is bad, actually the game is amazing.Its a way for us PC gamers to protest.First off, online mode is filled with hackers, but Rockstars decides to ban innocent players and let the hackers roam free.Also, its too hard to get money in Online mode without buying shark cards, which is exactly what money greedy Rockstar wants you to do.And as for TakeTwo, they tried taking down modding! We managed to stop that, but who knows if they will do it again? How dare they try to take down modding! Dont they know thats what is keeping this old game alive?Great game, money greedy, mod ruining devs/publishers
