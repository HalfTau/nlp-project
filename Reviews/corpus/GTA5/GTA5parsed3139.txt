Im really not a story kind of person, so ill be talking mostly about the online bit of the game.Id say its allright.The problem is the overpriced vehicles and clothes and what not... and the servers...But if youre determined, you can get the money you need. But not easily, since everyone that has custom cars will always win races if theyre allowed to use them. Same with deathmatches and guns.Not to mention that you can buy GTA cash... with real money...And the servers... oh my GOD the servers!Sometimes they work just fine. The next day, you wont be playing online at all.And if you have bad luck, the next day will be exactly the same.Its so bad and makes the online of the game almost unplayable.Not to mention, when it does work and you get into a lobby... every other player rubber bands like hell.And for that, and the fact that most people will probably buy this for the online, i cannot recommend it. I hear the story is good though.
