Singelplayer It has pretty much content and pretty fun story and gameplay, its ok but not great. Its not worth to buy just for the singelplayer neither the multiplayer and there both kind ofin my opinion.Multiplayer Multiplayer was fun before they completely ruined it. New content costed about 1mil at first and thats not too hard to get. However after a awhile ingame content started becoming more and more expensive whit every update. Ingame content now need you to farm 5mil too even get a new car which is insanely much and takes very long time to get. Its such a ing shame the game could be soo much better if not everything had to be so expensive. Lobbys are pretty aids aswell people are pretty toxic and just want to shoot or blow you up, you can go in too private mode i know but when i am playing whit my friend i cant go in private mode because then he cant get into my vehicle.The game modes and mission also gives you ridiculously little money.4/10 Rockstar is just a greddycompany that just wants money and doesnt care about the game or community. It cost like 40 euros and is still pay to win.
