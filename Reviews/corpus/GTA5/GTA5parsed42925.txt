Great game, fun story, classic grand theft auto. The online is sorta always been meh even without the cheating. Heists are great fun if you have enough friends to play with but randos generally drop or take forever. If you dont like the idea of free to play, pay to win type grindfests you should stick to just the singleplayer cause its worth it.But I cant say that I recommend this anymore based on the stance that the developer has taken against players.UPDATEStill dont recommend this game or TakeTwo. Their latest response is filled with cop outs and promises nothing that they hadnt already said.
