Loved the game before rockstar attacked modding. Now it looks like they are trying to kill the single player modding community to try and force players onto GTA online in order to force microtransactions down our throats. Rockstar has just managed to ruin a great game. DO NOT BUY IT IN RIGHT NOW unless you want to to pay microtransactions for online play.
