I bought this game three weeks ago specifically because of its large and active modding community, it was for me, its main selling point. Yet hardly had I delved into adding any mods when the producers of this game went out of there way to destroy the modding community. I had just finished the single player campaign and was preparing to jump into the online community when all this occured. Now I have no interest in giving a single coin to this company, playing its online money farm, or continue to play its oft neglected single player game still waiting on ANY single player DLC and I will avoid purchasing from this company in the future.
