I bought this for the mods. I owned the console version but wanted to play the game with mods and because of Take Two AND Rockstars greedy actions and massive appetite for microtransactions on GTA Online. The truth about online is that it is an awful Sandbox with very little freedom that is ultimately plagued with Shark Cards. Threating legal action upon Open IV was petty and quite frankly ruined the game for me. Just because you killed 7080 of single player mods doesnt mean the hacking on online is going to stop. Hackers are malicious, modders are creative.
