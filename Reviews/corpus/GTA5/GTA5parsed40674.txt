Used to be an awesome game but its completely pay to win now. All the new veichle and weapon mods make it easy for anyone with shark cards or hacked money to grief you. You can use passive mode but then you cant do anything fun. Ive got most of the new unlocks now and they take the good luck starting out at level 1 without hacked money or shark cards.Also be prepared to spend half your time on loading screens or in lobbies and to be constantly dropping in and out single player mode after youve completed a mission.Single player is still good but it hasnt seen any attention in years.
