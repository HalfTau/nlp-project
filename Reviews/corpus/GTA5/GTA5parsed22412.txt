No openiv is bannable and the to utilize all the cool stuff would cost you roughly 1,0002,000 usd, or about 1000 hours of grinding. This is just stupid. Honestly if they made their in game purchases a reasonable amount of money like 10080m and so on, but this games greedy producers have gotten out of hand and are day by day destroying the brand and franchise. Honestly this game came out in 2013 and they are still trying to cash in on it. I never thought a company could be worse than EA with money grabbing DLC but im amazed this game still has a player base and with the recent influx and overall general consensus I give this game about 6 months till the community has all but died.
