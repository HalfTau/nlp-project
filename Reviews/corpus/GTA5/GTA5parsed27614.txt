As a fan of the series since Vice City, I found the single player aspect a lot of fun. The lead characters are entertaining, the detail of the world is incredible, and the missions are generally great, especially the big heists. However, the online component of GTAV is simply a disaster. It seems obvious Rockstar is far more interested in getting people to buy Shark Cards and pay for premium vehicles, bizarre clothing and weapon skins than making sure its a wellmanaged and competently crafted experience. Im not against paying a little extra to customize a characters online appearance, but youve got to put a reasonable amount of effort into making sure the core gameplay isnt broken before expecting myself and others to pony up extra, which is obviously their expectation.My advice Next time dont bite off more than you can chew. Most of these troubles could have been avoided with better planning and putting some effort into maintaining a decent relationship with the player community. Heres a wacky idea Maybe release a single player game with mod support and online game properly supervised separately.
