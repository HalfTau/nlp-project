After working hard to gain cash on the game about an 8 hour grind, a modder/hacker/bored GM decided it would be fun to kill everyone on the server, I just randomly burst into flames like everyone else and even when we died and respawned we were still on fire dying about 1215 times. at that point I logged off knowing each death was costing me money for medical bills.The game itself is fantastic but this event was total t.
