It was concerning enough on release that players could, and did, get banned if they attempted multiplayer with any mods installed. In light of recent events, its obvious Take Two and Rockstar just want to monetize everything at the expense of the players. Dont buy this. Just go play San Andreas again. Dont support this greedy behavior by Take Two and Rockstar.
