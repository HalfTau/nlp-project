Great value for single player alone. Online is also enjoyable with frequently updates despite the game has been released years ago  obviously dev also get benefits from p2win players  however it lack so many crucial features that would totally affect online experience.Firstly , language of preference since this game has a lot of players worldwide , 9/10 times when I get into a session or join a job nobody communicate in English  except for noob , hacker on ? Money pls and other fancy words  which sucks because its like youre talking to yourself and its a disaster when people in the team cant coordinate what to do in a mission. So letting us choose session with people who can communicate in your language should definitely be addSecondly , the infamous loading screen. It takes FOREVER every time  to start playing online and after completing a mission to return to free roam. Same thing when you try to join a mission then it happens to be full , another 5 mins wasted along with opportunity to join other missions.Thirdly , split for PVP/PVE free roam. Dev looked over the fact that there are a lot of players with different play style. Either you play solo or suck it up and play with psychopaths unless youre lucky to find a friendly session.Finally , hackers everywhere. Most of which were there to ruin others gameplay experience such as turning you into a random object , teleport you in a locked area or make you fly around as a rag doll or blow you up inside your own safehouse. Worst part is that they do it openly like people who are level 6666 or 8000 for instant and dev doesnt seems to care at all even though theres a report button.Best to have a group of people you know personally to accompany you as you might not find a lot of people who communicate with you. And certainly the chance that you will find a random civilized person is even less.
