 you Rockstar and Take Two. You sorry sons of bs. First of all you dont know how to manage GTA V Multiplayer, you should hire the players that used to and play GTA SAMP they are the ones that know how to run a MP game. Notsessions... they are impossible to administrate, thats why you have lots of modders roaming free on you sessions.
