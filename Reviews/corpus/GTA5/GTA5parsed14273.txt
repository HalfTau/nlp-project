I have completed the story mode and now i think the game was short, the inmensity of the open world should have been exploited more. Some missions feel repetitive and boring too. In general it is a good game but it had the potential to be longer with more interesting side mission which have also fallen short after completing the story mode. I dont believe there is that much more to do once you have completed this some people claim to enjoy GTA online but I think the game should have stuck more to its story mode since it is what makes this game original, why should you require an internet connection?. If a game is ambitious it should not fall afterwards on its lazy back, in the meantime i do reccomend it.
