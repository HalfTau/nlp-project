In online, the game just turns into a grindfest to get stupidly overpriced things without using microtransactions.Rockstar has continued to offer the worst customer service.Sinlge player mods have been destroyed.Hackers are still everywhere.I was banned, lost all my progress, and wasnt even allowed to know why I was banned. I think the reason could have been some leftover files from a deleted visuals mod I tried in singleplayer, and I literally lost everything I had gained after years of playing.I quit playing this game, and I felt cheated. Seriously, F!k these guys,
