fun... but also this bsBuddy just got the game. Played online... didnt complete tutoriali think its a tutorial intro. Hasnt played since. I just got my new laptop and was gonna play online with him. He logged in and is permanently banned from online with no explanation. Cant dispute it. He doesnt even know how to install mods. He has less hours logged than i do even. He never even encountered another human in the game. Im pretty sure that intro is in its own instanced world. WTF?
