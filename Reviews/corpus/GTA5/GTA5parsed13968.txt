Single gameplay is great honestly! Multiplayer is not nearly as fun as it is filled with unfair advantages through lame micro transactions. Very greedy move from rockstar.. More recently rockstar issued a cease and desist against a popular modding tool used for single player only players. Really hurts the modding community which tends to be the players who stick around for the longest. Really disappointing!
