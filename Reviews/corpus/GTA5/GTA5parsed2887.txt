Grand Theft Auto V is one of the most compelling, cinematic, immersive and memorable singleplayer experiences. It pushes the boundaries of what a Grand Theft Auto game is known for through its storyline, updated graphics and gameplay.If youre looking for an amazing singleplayer story to devote your time to, this game is one of the perfect examples for it. Grand Theft Auto Online on the other hand suffers from the fact that youll need to either have other people to play with or cash to spend money on Shark Cards to afford any added content.I wish Rockstar wouldve added more singleplayer DLC but theyve given us a pretty good singleplayer game.
