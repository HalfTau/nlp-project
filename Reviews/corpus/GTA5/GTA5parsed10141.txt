Story Mode 9/10By itself it was pretty good, however I still prefer San Andreas and Vice City. Additionally, I disagree with what happened in the last couple of months with mods.Online 7/10Online was a great concept and Ill continue playing it, but I there is a lot to fix, and I hope it doesnt hinder later GTA installments.Overall 8/10
