After 2 years of constant failures to load on 3 machines, 4 hard/solid/hybrid drives, I finally discovered that merely running DXDIAG fixes it.Ive played a bit since and its fun, but I think it lost me a couple of years back. Ill keep working through and try to complete it, its a great game, but yeah if I knew the problems I would have, I wouldnt have bought it. Ill rate it up because the game is good, and my experience doesnt reflect the majority. Gameplay wise, its amazing. Just one damned bug that took two years to ID.
