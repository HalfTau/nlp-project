Ignore the fact that the game currently has a Mixed rating, thats due to little kiddos raging about cheats being removed.Going to start this off with a warning If you are a raging 10 year old who cant handle the truth about Open IV, just skip my review. 100 bet that this review will be downvoted by people who are upset that they cant use cheat menus anymore.Thank you TakeTwo for finally removing that cancer Open IV. Literally all of the online cheat menus were made with this software. Sadly the games single and multiplayer were to engrained with eachother and that means that there are no singleplayer cheat menus or other mods anymore. But who cares? Almost noone actually used mods in singleplayer and the only reason this game is being downvoted is because a bunch of raging 1016 year old kiddos watched a video on youtube.The game is extremely well optimized, I get around 130 FPS at 1440p Ultra settings with 2 GTX 1080s. I also got around 4060 fps at 1080p with a GTX 960m on normal settings.The gameplay is fun Most people know what GTA 5 is, so I wont talk much more about that.
