Alright, this right here is a perfect example of how unbelievably ignorant and greedy the gaming industry is right now.GAMES ARE MEANT TO BE PLAYED AND ENJOYED!!! NOT A MONEY MILKING MACHINE!! !Im sick and tired of these developers giving us the middle finger every single time for the past decade.This may sound a bit extreme, but if it were up to me Id make prepurchase DLC before the main game even ing releases illegal by law.Im sick and tired of having my wallet stolen every damn time by people who dont give a  about their community, the very thing thats keeping the company alive is being neglected!And just when I thought this couldnt get any worse, TakeTwo just instantly bans single player modding... Im losing hope in this industry, and considering Ive been learning game development for the past few years in hopes that one day Id have my own part in the industry, completely shattered by these companies we see today...
