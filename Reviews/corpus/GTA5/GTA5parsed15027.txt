I have loved this game for the longest time, I play it on and off and play with mods almost every time, OpenIV and other mods and this mod ban is absolute The game is absolute amazing however when the game first came out I despised the GTA Online, absolutely and that still stands to this day, ive been a heavy fan of the GTA series from the top down originals to now and mods are the ONE massively amazing thing this game has brought to the community that supports it, which is MASSIVE, I understand mods were allowed due to the outrage but what did the developers expect to happen!I still dislike this move by the developers despite them making it hard to make mods for the game originally, they have lost my support for any future games. GTAV will be the last great game they make, if they cant respect their community which does continue to keep the game alive and buy their overpriced stuff then they can SHOVE IT.
