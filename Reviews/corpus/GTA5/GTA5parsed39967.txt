I loved this game for all the shenanigans you can have, cause, and enjoy in it, but you never feel like youve accomplished anything coming out of it, unless you waste an entire day grinding the same tasks over and over for money. It gets boring fast.I look forward to the day that game devs actually play their own games and realize how much of a painful grind theyve made.
