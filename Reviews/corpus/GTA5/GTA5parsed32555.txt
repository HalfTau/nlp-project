GTA V is fun for a while and GTAO is also entertaining but then you realize how much of a grind it is for NOTHING. A few cars and guns, just to help you grind even more and maybe buy a yatch or something similar. With the issues about mods, shark cards, free dlc, etc, both Rockstar and Take Two are devolving into what players loathe.
