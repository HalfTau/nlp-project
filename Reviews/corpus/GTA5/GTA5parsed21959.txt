I like this game, but its been ruined for me by script kiddies.This is the only game Ive ever preordered, I did it because I knew I couldnt trust myself to not spend the money on other things before the game came out I was 12 at the timeI got on this game as soon as it was released on steam, And I loved it, I got roughly 250 hours within my first two weeks of playing it, it was an amazing experience until I ended up in one session where I was given millions of dollars by modders, at the time I just wanted more, and so I went out to look for more modders after that session until I looked up on youtube that I could just get my own scripts to get money.I never stockpiled the money, I would spawn some and buy something, spawn some and get buy some more, I did this until the end of 2015 when rockstar finnally took good action against modders, but by then I had everything and Didnt have to grind for anything.What annoys me about this game is that other players have been affected like this too, for example my friend recently got the game, at level 9 about 23 hours worth of playing he got given 25 million by a random hacker, we told him not to spend any and to report it to rockstar before he got banned, but they only took 2 million away, so now he doesnt have to play that much and in total hell probably have under 200 hours in the game because he never had to grind for anything, which in my opinion is what makes this game so fun and rewarding.
