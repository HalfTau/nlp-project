So you wanna play GTA V? Will let me tell you something if your only here for online go  your self because you know what?  You cant transfer your character you spent 2 years leveling up naw you gotta level up all over again which is not that big of a deal for me because I didint have too much but still I was level 134 with all the heist completed so it made me a little.. but the story is what people never care about because they only care for online heck they should call this game only gta online because thats what this game is at this point and the same thing is probably going to RD2 and so on but dont get me if you get this game in sale for 25 and you only want the story then your in for one hell of a ride 7/10
