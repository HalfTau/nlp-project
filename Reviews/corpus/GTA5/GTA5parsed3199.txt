GTA V is a seriously enjoyable game. The single player campaign is memorable and the online experience is great. The primary issue, outside of the push for microtransactions, is load time for GTA Online. I sometimes get stuck in a load screen loop for almost ten minutes. Even with a good computer, expect to wait a considerable amount of time before jumping into a session online.
