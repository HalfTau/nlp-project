Fantastic game. Even though was released some time ago, the developers are still making fantastic content and expansion packs. The best thing, is that with enough grinding, the dlc is free.Would i change anything?1. Lengthy load times2. Alot of people are complaining about hackers3. Alot of grinding, but the free expansion packs more than mke up for it.werf
