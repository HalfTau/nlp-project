R and the companies affiliated are a terrible, money mongering, short sighted, pile of crap.They punish people who very simply, have never used mods or exploits to make money in their game by removing in my case all except 20,000... FTR im a lvl 140 character and have well over 400 hours in this game...The fact they feel that its important to go after people who have owned not one but TWO copies of this game 1 Xbox at launch and 1 PC at relaunch is stagering to say the least.As a law abiding, day job working, citizen who just wants to play in the wonderful, mod supporting world that is GTAVO with firends WITHOUT being maimed by R because he was present in a session where someone maliciously dropped a VERY small amount of money compared to the BILLIONS that some people have in online, and has Reported those individuals time and time again for malicious use,I am furious... to say the least.Game is ruined.GJ R  Bazooka to the foot.Enjoy RDR2 launch day.Supported from the start,Grew up playing your games,Boycotting your games.Devoted Customer.
