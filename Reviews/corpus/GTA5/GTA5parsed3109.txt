Its a waste of money in my opinion. I get kicked out of heists when I reach the end of them for no reason. Theres too many modders, lag, and people who think too much of their selves.The loading screens are too long. Alot of annoying kids. and many other reasons. So you should just play Campain because you dont have to deal with Modders, Getting kicked from heists, and theres not alot lag to deal with. So in shorter words  Dont buy the game unless you have a good computer to deal with it, or you just want to play the campainEven though its 2018
