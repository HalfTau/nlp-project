This game used to be very good. I myself professed it to be one of the greatest games ever made at one point. So good that  I bought it again on PC so that I could mod it. That was literally the only reason I bought it on PC, as GTA V is probably one of the best modded games on the planet.However, Take Two interactive has repeatedly demonstrated that they are totally against single player modding, by first making it extremely difficult to do encrypting the relevant files, not including and tools or expicit support for mods etc.. Now they have taken the rather extreme action of sending a cease and desist letter to the developers of OpenIV, the de facto main tool for modding single player GTA V.After this action I can no longer support the developers of this game and also can no longer recommend purchasing this game as the modding element is one of the deciding factors for me at least.Update 31.08.2017So rockstar did retract their CD to the OpenIV team. This was a great move, however I still feel there are some big issues with the way they handle modding. There is also another problem The complete lack of any extra content for SP since release. GTA IV had some of the best DLC for any  SP game Ive ever played, however GTA V has nothing for years. MP has gotten a lot of timeexpensive DLC, but SP has gotten nothing.
