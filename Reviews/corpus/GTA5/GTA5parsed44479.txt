 you Rockstar. I preordered this garbage A YEAR before it came out. I was expecting a San Andreas 2 but all I got was a lot of nickle and diminig, castrated modding, and a giant world with nothing to do. I ing hate the direction youre taking the series. I know you wont ever listen since every game is a guaranteed success and you have no reason to change anything, but destroying the last bit of modding left in this game is inexcusable. I hate GTA O and I hate you, Rockstar.
