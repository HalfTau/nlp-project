This game aint worth 60 and i doubt that it worths even 10. Sure its a great and fun game, but only until you get sick of the excessive amount of loading screens, the extremely long loading times, the connectivity issues, all of the modders that just spam money to everyone making the game unplayable, the GIGANTIC amount of glitches and game breaking bugs that ruin your whole game and rockstar doesnt give a single f, game crashes, broken AI, etc... Its just a big glitch festival that costs 60. Not recommended if you dont have patience to spend more gametime in loading screens and crashes, than playing the game itself.
