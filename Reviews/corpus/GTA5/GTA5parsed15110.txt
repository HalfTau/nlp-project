GTA Online was fun, farming and buying cool new items released quite frequently.... Until 1 day Rockstar decided that u have too much money and tempo banned and corrected all your hard work in 1 day. Have never hacked or glitched nor received any money from modders and this is how i was rewarded. Great job Rockstar!Single player is great but online isso only play online if u are prepared to lose ur progress anytime.
