Enjoyable. I now mainly play this in Single Player since my Ultra Realism Mods and Car Mods will not work on Multiplayer. Since playing Multiplayer I have come across Modders and very rarely Modders who purposely kill. I do enjoy running around doing whatever my heart wishes.Now playing Singleplayer with Ultra Realism Mods I absolutely love the look and how well it plays. I do enjoy the game with or without mods. I cant wait for the new Grand Theft Auto!
