 Modder locks you in place, drops money on your head You didnt ask for this money Your money gets reset All of it, not just the modded money. several months later Grind for days to get 1.6mil to get a mobile operations centre New dlc coming out Rockstar has reset your moneyRockstar is resetting peoples money in an attempt to get more people to buy sharkcards for the new dlc.The first time was more than reasonable, as it was modded and I had no intentions of cheating my way to the top.BUT THEN THEY TOOK AWAY MONEY THAT I GRINDED TO GET, MONTHS LATER.Time and time again, rockstar has shown they dont care about the users. They just want your money.
