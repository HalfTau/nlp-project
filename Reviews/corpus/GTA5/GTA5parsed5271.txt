Dont bother with Online mode  The grind is CRAZY.The few missions that are included are too few and become super repetitive. Itll take you MANY tries to pass even the easiest ones since all 4 players public lobbies have no idea what to do/how to play  must survive the mission and be flawless. Ive done entire missions only to fail since the jet landing wasnt perfect.Rockstar is making B I L L I O N S selling their fake money for your real money. Shark Cards should be illegal.  Rockstars predatory business practice should be investigated and shut down with legislation.You need property to store your cars. Chaching! You cant just steal cars and keep them you cannot mod them and your garage wont accept them You must buy all sports cars  ChaChing!  In game characters take turns constantly sending you annoying messages every 5 mins telling you you need to also buy a hangar for your planes CHACHING!  and you need a bunker for the new missions CHACHING!!   RING RING! Didnt you buy our expensive DLC yet???You know there is a flying delorean car available?!!! Its awesome! But its SOOO expensive CHACHING!!! For just this car you can either GRIND for hundreds of boring hours or pay 99 real dollars.Single player is amazing but this is the last GTA with that. The future is scammy shark cards.
