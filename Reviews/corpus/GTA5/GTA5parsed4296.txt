Great game... but i was dumb and got banned after 3 strikes. After that i made a new account and bought gta again while it was on sale. Greed got the best of me and i was banned permanently for a second time but that time without any strikes. I had a copy on my ps3 from my cousin and got console banned for hacking a third time. My friend just recently bought me the game a 4th time and he tried to give me money and we both got banned for 30 days at least its not permanent this time. Let this be a lesson to never hack in this damn game... instead buy the 40 dlc. 7/10
