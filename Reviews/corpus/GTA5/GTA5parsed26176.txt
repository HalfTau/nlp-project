I really dont understand why i never liked GTA V, i still dontIts better in almost every way that GTA IV did but yet...Maybe its the reduced damage on vehiclesMaybe its fact that while the police are more vicious, they can now also be fooled forever by simply riding in a circlesMaybe its the fact that it take super long to get to the first heist with singleplayer up until then being a glorified tutorialMaybe its the vehicle handling, its too controlled, ive never lost control of my car.GTA IV felt like dragging you feet through mud while driving cars but that made it a lot more fun in retrospect. This handling feels as generic as i can make it, more usable definetly, but less enjoyableMaybe its the fact that standing still for more than 2 seconds somewhere will make random people open fire on you for being suspiciousMaybe its the more generic combat, similar to the driving change, all the iconic ragdoll based FUN of 4 is replaced with COVER SHOOTER 2017The online is a flamming mess, dont even try it. Taketwo steps away from it and its microtransactionsBut even after all this... i can still see why people enjoyed it, didnt bother writing a review because it was very mixed for me. BUT HERE WE AREMods improved GTA 4 to the point of godlike status for me, car handling even better, amazing graphics, tons of FUN and SILLY mods that made the singleplayer from a 6 to a 8 for me personally.The idea that the developers would take away their BIGGEST point of sale on PC.. just to make sure nobody cheats in money in the online. a pure cashgrab against PCgamers.
