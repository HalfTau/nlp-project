Great game, but recently TakeTwo has decided to issue a cease and desist on the OpenIV developer who lets you mod the singleplayer, and have decided all mods, including singleplayer mods are illegal. I do not support this action so i do not recomend purchasing this game until TakeTwo changes their attitude.
