Absolutely Terrible!I played GTA Online for about 500 hours and during a mission i was doing with friends, i was kicked off, Banned for 30 days, and had my 500 hours character deleted with about 25 million earned on that character from Jobs, and heists, etc.. They emailed me sand said I was hacking, cheating or otherwise broke the terms of service. I have never installed any mods, cheats, or hacks for GTA V ever, Period. I called suppost several times and was literally hung up on over and over without anyone even listening for 1 second to anything i had to say. I read the terms and services, they have it written in their policy that if you even connect to the server for GTA Online, you are basically already in violation because they instantly reserve the right to ban, or delete anyone if they affect anyones online experience, regardless of what the affect is or how minor it is. For instance, its fully within the policy to be able to ban a person and delete their character if they have a bad connection to the server for just a moment and cause a lag spike that affects the players on the same server. I dunno if thats what happened to me, I had lag semi regularly when i played but if it was thats even more reason not to play this game. And then today i just heard they banned all mods and cheats etc even from single player so now all the Youtube Channels with the crazy mods will be done, even thought i dont play this  game anymore, i sometimes like those videos.Take Two and Rockstar are a bunch of money grubbing s, dont buy this game.
