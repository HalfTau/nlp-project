Takes up a massive amount of space 60gb. Still waiting for more coop adventures read heists. Couldnt give a sh about the racetrack free DLCs or any of that stuff. Give me actual gameplay rather than multiplayer gamemodes that are only worth one or two playthroughs.Looks pretty and plays like every other GTA.Singleplayer is fantastic.Oh and they love flipping the community the bird see shark cards.
