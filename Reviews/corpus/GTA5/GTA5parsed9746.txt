This game is not just another open world game. It combines many diffent genres perfectly. It has the shooting of the Call of Duties, the driving of the Need for speeds, the chaos and crazy fun of Just causes, the story of The Last of Us, the set pieces of the Uncharteds and the scope of The Witchers. It is the best game Ive played so far. Theres a reason why it continues to have so many active players to this day and is featured on the main page of Steam. However, buy it only for the singleplayer, as the multiplayer sucks. Period. Thanks for reading!
