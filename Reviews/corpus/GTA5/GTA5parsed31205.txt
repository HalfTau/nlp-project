Ive enjoyed this game, I really have. But after completing single player, there were only a few options left for me to do next. Online, which Ive played a bit of, but thats constantly getting killed by aholes who just wanna cause chaosI.E. walk out of my house and some prick in a jet just shoots me with a missile and continues to do so when I respawn. OR I could use mods for single player, which made the game maybe even more enjoyable then the regular story. So if you like having a one playthrough experience or getting screwed over by strangers in Online, buy the game. But if you want to experience the fun and community of a modding family, go somewhere else with your money.BRING BACK MODDING FOR SINGLE PLAYER.Edit Well hey, they brought it back, and thats good and all, so how about maybe make it so that online isnt a pay real money to keep having fun type of game?
