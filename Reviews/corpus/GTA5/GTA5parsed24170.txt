The past 4 updates are just the same things rehashed, you buy a warehouse or something that is overpriced to hell and there is little pay off if you dont spend 100 hours grinding. To add to that everything in the updates are stupidly overpriced not making it easy for any new player to have fun with it. All the updates are just quick cash grabs by rockstar to make you spend aton of money and then have no money left to do anything. Its all a way to make you buy their overpriced shark cards. In conclusion if you didnt buy it years ago and had fun with it then dont bother buying it now because its just awful for new players and a cheap cash grab for rockstar.Begining 9/10Now 2/10
