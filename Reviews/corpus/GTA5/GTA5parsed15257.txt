Dont buy this game unless you are willing to spend several hundred dollars on shark cards from the beginning. Making legitimate money keeps getting harder to do, and Rockstar doesnt help by adding more and more over powered vehicles to the game that only people that already have lots of money can buy. Think getting your own motorcycle club will help make you money? Nope, with the new smugglers run update, any random person can just fly by and make you fail the mission with the click of one button. But possibly the worst thing Rockstar has done is enabling hackers. I dont know how you mess up a game so much that someone with a the right hacks can do all the things they can. Fixing the bugs that allow players to do this should be priority number one, not adding in more over powered planes. Even if you are abled to identify the hacker, and locate the report button, their is not cheating or hacking options to report them for. One final thing, I personaly find the recoil, or lack there of, on some of the guns stupid and just ruin the purpose on having different types of weapons. Why use what should be a more accurate rifle, when the machine gun is just as accurate, has a higher fire rate, and does more damage.That makes pvp feel quite revolting to me.
