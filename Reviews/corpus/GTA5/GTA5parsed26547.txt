I do not recommend this game at all, I loved it and spent a huge amount of money, playing by the rules and everything then gets a big f you from them. 30 day ban and a full reset to the account for no reason and this aint the 1st time it has happened to people when I searched online. Customer service dont give a  about you they only want to rob your money. My friends who were in different sessions who also spent real money and a lot of time in the game got banned at the same EXACT time and for no ing reason at all. Whoever is looking forward to play this game just dont get it, all of your efforts and money will be gone anytime when they feel like doing it. Dont bother calling or emailing or even sending requests/tickets to them, you will either get hung up by them, completely ignored or just a message saying all suspends/bans are final and will not be appealed
