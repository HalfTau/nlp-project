WARNING YOU CAN NO LONGER TRANSFER YOUR OLD XBOX OR PS4 PLAYER, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Came from console and was hoping to get my old character back, character transfer ended on 6th March I had no idea so Im going to refund. With the lack of mod support, me having completed the story twice and rockstar wanting to milk me dry by making me create a whole new character even though I have an old character with nearly a months playtime on, there is virtually no point of me owning this game. Unless this is a complete fresh game to you and you have never played it before, please stay clear and spend your money elsewhere.
