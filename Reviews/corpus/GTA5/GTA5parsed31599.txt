Take Two is a rather big publisher company and sadly already has our money.From the Wikipedia page you can read The company has several well known franchises, including the BioShock, Borderlands, Civilization, Grand Theft Auto, Mafia, Manhunt, Max Payne, NBA 2K, Red Dead, WWE 2K, and XCOM series.I dont want you to push dislikes on all those games, but the gaming industry MUST see that we do not support Take Twos actions.Please consider protesting and boycotting future games published by Take Two.ONLY PROTESTING AGAINST GTA V WILL ONLY AFFECT THIS ONE GAME!WE MUST PROTEST AGAINST THE WHOLE COMPANY SO THIS SHT DOESNT HAPPEN ANY MORE TO ANY GAME!! !
