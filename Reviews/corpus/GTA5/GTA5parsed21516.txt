Ever since the recent mistake take two has made, the game will never be the same again. However. the amount of negative reviews its gotten has really suprised me. Is the only reason that people buy this game is to mod? I dont mod, but it has opened my eyes on the problems of this game. A good game doesnt need to be based on modders and cheaters. It needs to be based on a good storyline, and interactive gameplay that is given by the game, not a third party. Sure, I didnt support the ban take two has made, but modders take out the honesty in the game ironic, considering how the only way you can get better is by stealing All in all, people shouldnt be giving this much hate to the game based on a recent modder ban. In other games like csgo, when valve makes a vac ban wave, you dont see people  on them. And OpenIV didnt put up a fight, knowing this cheating would be stopped. I hope this review convinces people to stop complaining on something that would have been approved in other games. The majority of games usually consist of a few hackers and a majority of legit players. GTA V apparently has the minority of legit players, and a majority of cheaters.
