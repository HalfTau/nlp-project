Screw Take Two Interactive, destroying the modding community all because they would rather the player purchases their shark cards on the in game store, maybe if items in the game were not so ludicrously overpriced and money was easier to make off topic then players would not feel the need to mod the online portion of the game. There is no problem with single player mods, they are what make this now boring game great again and give it a new lease of life, if only Rockstar games would realise this is beneficial to their company way more than it is damaging to them  Rant over, f you R and TTI.
