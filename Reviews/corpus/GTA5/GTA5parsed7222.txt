Previous account had 900 hours on the game, come back to it to find that its even worse optimised than before. A strong graphics card gives me an unstable 60fps at low settings, and constant pausing and glitching of the game, and thats just in story mode. Get it ing sorted Jesus Christ. The Xmas time snow is thethough.
