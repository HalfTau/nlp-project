I believe the great amount of negative reviews this game receives is due to the game being not worth the current price.However, if we all forget about the price, this game actually provides you with endless fun and a spectrum of adventure and adrenelin.Sadly, many say they get bored of the game pretty fast.At the end all i can say is that it depends on the person playing you may get bored, but you may have the will to play again.So game on!
