Hi,It feels hard to write a review for such a large game !Offline storyIts great, you need to really get into the world, story and characters of GTA. I didnt do it at first because I wasnt thrilled to be a bad guy but it eventually sinked in and now I regret to not have payed attention to all the details you see when playing the story. I think the game is really worth it just with the story.Online modeI am new to online gaming, in fact GTA is the first time I stay online for so long.PROLots of content, vehicules, missions, assets, you will have fun trying them.Even if you dont have the money to buy them, you can use them in differents mission that provide the best place to try them unless you really like to kill helpless random player.You can join crew in advanced missions even if you are low level.You still level your character and see it going stronger and accessing more stuff.Did I say a lot of content ? CONSLots of cheaters/modders/hackers, I guess its hard to remove them all and I dont have experience with other games. It feels like they are pretty free from getting banned.I would love to be able to do everything in private sessions but some missions/jobs requires you to be in public sessions.It wont be long before you explode or be turned into a christmas tree for no reasons.Of  course missions with small number of player is less risky to turn into a hackfest.Monetization I understand Rockstar needs money to keep making stuff that is free btwbut content seems a bit overpriced. It feels hard to save just to buy a simple weaponized chopper. I think missions should get you a little more money.What is making the matter worse is character calling you every minutes to ask you to buy this facility or this operation center and it feels like you are swamped in disguised ads to buy stuff with real money. And of course you cant turn these calls off. Check how many forum threads there is on that.Overall Id say, try to have fun in missions with trusted people and dont try to own lots of vehicules or assets.Because if you get into this, you either grind money all of the time or purchase with real money shark cards to have money ingame.I understand that players who bought shark cards keeps Rockstar making free DLC so I thanks them but we should make sure they dont overprofits from this.
