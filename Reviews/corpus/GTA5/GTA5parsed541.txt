Great game but inflation is insane in online.Any good cars for missions/ballistic uses cost above 1.8 Million and barely anyone can ever afford that unless they mod, do a couple missions/heists, or buy shark cards. 5 for 200,000 ingame is useless considering most fast cars or good cars are at a million or above.
