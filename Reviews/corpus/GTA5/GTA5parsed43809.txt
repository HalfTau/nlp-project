This game has easily become another typical game focusing mainly on microtransactions. Considering every new update they release a lot of cool things for their playerbase to use, they also come with an extravagant, extremely ridiculous prices. One can argue that you can easily grind for this money. You actually cant without wasting half of your life on this game. Every mission including the heists give a garbage amount of money to you after completing it. Why is that bad? Cant you speedrun it? No, you cant. Why? What if you dont have friends to play with? You can get stuck with randoms who either just randomly leave, or the typical trolls who love to kill the poeple in middle of the mission/heist making you fail and causing you to wait even LONGER to get your hard earned money that is as significant as losing a single dollar bill is to a billionaire. This then leads to the overwhelming increase in hackers and other major eploits to get you money, and considering lots of the playerbase is so desperate to get money, they will go to these extremes. Rockstar will then do everything in their power to rid of these things, while affecting millions of other innocent players who just want to play the game and have actually earned their money the hard way. This new update is an absolute joke, this game has easily turned from of my favorites into a pile of putrid, infamous garbage. And for the playerbase who loves to mod, they were also given a massive F U in this garbage update for this now garbage game. Rockstar fix this now. We as a playerbase are beyond disgusted at your greed and stupid decisions.
