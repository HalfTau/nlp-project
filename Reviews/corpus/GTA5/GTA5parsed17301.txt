My special cars spawned by my trainer are despawned immediately and this is indeed Rockstars choice. They do not care AT ALL about the PC fan base and community. They let hackers run wild, and they even limit your single player experience when GTA is made 100X better with modding.They do this because these special vehicles that are being despawned are very expensive in GTA Online, almost forcing you to buy a few shark cards.Can you stop fisting us Rockstar!?Your business model is horrific. I cant support this game any longer. Just let Rockstar milk the dumb as a sock full of sand, vulnerable console peasants. Their time will come.
