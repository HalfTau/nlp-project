People who are complaining about innocent bans are 100 lying and trying to defame the game because they got caught hacking.  Dont believe any of them.  Ive had hackers try and get me banned by doing things like money drops multiple times, and each time i just altf4 the game and submitt a report to rockstar, who informed me that they have systems in place to detect if the money is dropped on you, and even more systems to sort out getting rid of the money properly without affecting money bought with shark cards.t aside, this is an extremely fun game.  I mostly play online and havent touched the story but this review was mostly bought on by reading the other reviews.
