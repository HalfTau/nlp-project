SINGLE PLAYER REVIEW ONLYI have no interest in the multiplayer aspect. I dont have friends to play with nor the time to play regularly. I tried it for a little bit, but didnt like it very much I dont usually like multiplayer experiences like this, so my review is based off of the single player story mode only.The story mode is great. There is a wide variety of entertaining missions and side quests are fun and worth doing. The characters, for the most part, are well made. The dialogue is often hilarious. The plot is often rediculous and over the top, much like a Tarantino movie. The motivations for the protagonists sometimes feel forced especially with Franklin in some places, but its a GTA game, so who cares?Most people with negative reviews are only negative because of the multiplayer. This is one of those cases where it is a shame that the single player and multiplayer are forced to share ratings. The multiplayer may deserve a thumbs down I wouldnt know, but the single player absolutely deserves a thumbs up. Ignore the multiplayer reviews and you wont find many negative single player reviews, with good reason. The single player experience is fully fleshed out and you dont need to do any multiplayer to feel like youre getting your moneys worth.
