The main appeal of GTA V on pc was modding. After you beat the game,  you could literally do whatever you wanted in the sandbox.The mod developers even disabled access to online when using mods.Because T2 is too lazy to up the security on their game, they decided to take the lazy route and just ban the mod itself?Yeah, GTA going forward has lost my vote and my purchase on all future games.I dont trust T2 to do what gamers want anymore.I never played online either because of how stupid it was, now Im being punished because R wants more money.
