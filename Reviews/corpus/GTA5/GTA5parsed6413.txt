GTAO gets stuck on loading screens and crashes so often that most people quit playing after a short while, those who still want to play it have to grind for hundreds of hours or buy microtransactions more expensive than the game itself to have access to content because there are more paywalls than in every free mobile game.Instead of creating a nice game experience Rockstar are trying to milk as much money as possible out of their GTA Online players.This is no longer an AAATitle, its a ing joke.
