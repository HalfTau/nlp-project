I personally do NOT enjoy modding my games all that much, whats the point of modding something to fit your fantasy if you cant enjoy the base game that the devs put so many years to make? But this, this really is not something i can support. Why would you ban mods? The Grand Theft Auto series are defined by their freedom to let you do what ever you want, not to mention that you literally allowed the modding community to get so big. And now you just want to shut it down? Why? I cant give you my support with such an attitude towards fans.
