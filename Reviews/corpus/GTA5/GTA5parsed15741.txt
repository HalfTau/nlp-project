An extreamly addictive game with so many different things to do. There is something for everyone. Racing, heists, missions, pvp, shooting, running businesses, flying, driving and so much more. There is stuff you can do alone including the offline single player story mode. The possibilities are endless and they just keep adding more and more to the list. If you have ever watched a friend or a streamer play and thought hey that looks fun, I suggest you take the leap.
