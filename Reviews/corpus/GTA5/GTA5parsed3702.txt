To sum up the game The story is filled with action and the nword is used in every sentence along with endless cursing from the main characters. The strip club I dont really need to describe anything here Infinate customisations for every character, so if you want to look crazy as possible or the most boring, its available. Online is very good except from the modders you can team up with your friends and create a crew and do heists and missions together to earn a lot of money and RP. Layed back game, you dont have to grind much on the game unless you want to buy something which is very expensive, you will have to replay the mission a few times. Overall a brilliant game a mess around on and have a banging time.
