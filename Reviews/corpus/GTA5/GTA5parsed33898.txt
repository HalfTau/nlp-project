The early community was built upon modders and tweakers who have perfected the gameplay and overall feel of the game. Also thanks to them the concept of multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto became popular to the point Rockstar implemented it themselves in the sequel of San Andreas. Banning a modding tool which is primarily used in machinimas for funny and entertaining videos will in no way shape or form prevent illegal use of hacks in multiplayer. Dont put a giant  you on your loyal community. It will seriously show in your sales numbers
