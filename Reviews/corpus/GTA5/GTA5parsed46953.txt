Cant recommend a game sold by people who literally say youre not a valued customer unless youre buying a shark card every week.The antimodding stance Take Two tried to push on us was just sht smeared on like frosting on that urinal cake.Edit I know R took a stand and helped get OpenIV off of the blacklist, but I still hate Take Two with my entire being, so as much as I appreciate Rs effort there, Im not amending this to a thumb up.  The ramming of Shark Cards down my throat in a P2W online game remains unacceptable on its own.I wish Id never given them my money.
