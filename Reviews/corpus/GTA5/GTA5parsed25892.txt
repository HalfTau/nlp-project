For total immersion, this game is perfect online. Theres driving, shooting, amazing map, a million activities and a big community of players. If you put in the hours, it is really rewarding.At the same time it isnt your casual after work game  it can be but you may find the content far out of reach. Speaking of which, content in GTA online is probably the most expensive of any game of its kind. Overpriced to be frank.All the online moaning aside, this game is worth buying even for the story mode/single player alone. Straight up gaming history.
