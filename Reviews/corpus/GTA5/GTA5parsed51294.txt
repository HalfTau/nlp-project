Given the rising populairity of toolkits/gaming hubs from gaming Developers/Publishers that sell mods, I fear that taketwo activity will en route to the same path, and tries to disperse a heartly mod community inorder to introduce their own mod addons.I had my fun with it but with the recent decision to completly disable and outright ban singleplayer mods I have to sadly downrate this game.I like put to an exclaimer in here that I played only once with a mod that I had to install inorder to progress with the rest of the story given the slow input of fixes or lack thereof in patches, yet another thing that makes free mods so important!
