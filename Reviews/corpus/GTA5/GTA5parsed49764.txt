Any wrong review you read is about the online aspect of the game. Its like people forgot that half of the game is single player story mode... And what a beautifull world, good mechanics, very good pc port, optimized to run on potato pcs and rockets alike.When it comes to online the only thing that bothers me its the loading times, being many and very long. Still a great game, where you can have fun in many more ways that it was intended, if you have the friends for it.
