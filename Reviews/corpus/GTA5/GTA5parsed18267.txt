This game is amazing but I dont think that it is worth full price if you dont have friends to play with because it can get very boring unless you buy it for a certain reason like for me it is bikes. If so, you can spend countless hours enjoing the things that you like doing. When it comes to hackers rockstar have cracked down on them quite hard. You mainly see hackers at hollidays mainly christmas. But I will honestly say that words cant describe the awesomeness of this game. It is 100 worth it! if it is on sale likelike 30 offIf you want to buy it on steam xD
