Id like to take this moment to say that I have never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Cinnamon from the Apple Jacks commercial.That perfect, thin body. Those bountiful, flowing rasta locks. Thesucking lips of a literal God. It honestly ing hurts knowing that Ill never mate with him, go to an orphanage, and raise a set of perfect children with him.Id do ing ANYTHING for the chance to fill his sweet  with my Fapplejacks liquid. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I cant is quite honestly too much to ing bear. Why would Kellogs create something so perfect? To ing tantalize us? ing laugh in our faces? !Honestly guys, I just ing cant anymore. .
