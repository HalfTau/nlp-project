They banned mods in the single player, which seems to me like a way to force players to play the Multiplayer, since they refuse to update the single player, and the Multiplayer is incredibly grindy and repetitive. It is fun with friends, but the gameplay seems to have devolved into a way of trying to get you to buy shark cards. This on top of the fact that they seem to randomly ban some people online, but theres blatant modders in the MP who are free to do what they want means that despite my hundreds of hours over 3 different versions, I cant recommend this game anymore to new people.
