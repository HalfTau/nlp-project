As much as it hurts me to give this game a negative review, especially having put almost 400 hours into it, it deserves it for how money hungry Rockstar has become, the online being a continuous grind for money and, most importantly, the recent situation regarding OpenIV is just really, really sad. Instead of getting rid of online modding, they removed singleplayer modding, making it illegal. I hope Take Two and Rockstar realise what they have done and undo this.
