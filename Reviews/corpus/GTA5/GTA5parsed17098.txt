Review based on online playIm a tremendous fan of the series. Had it for Xbox 360 then bought it again for PC. Ive tried to defend it, but Im done.Its possibly one of the best games to have ever been released, but R insists on making it otherwise.I had my account adjusted previously because of some money a hacker spawned on everyone on the server, that was fair although even the money I had made was taken. Now with this update, all my money was wiped even though not a single cent came from a modder and theres nothing any of us can do about it.Each update brings ridiculously priced objects with the money making close to unbearably time consuming, cashing out peanuts at a time for hours of work.For nostalgias sake Ill probably keep playing, but the disappointment of the players is loud and its all falling in deaf ears.
