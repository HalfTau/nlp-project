GTA V is a fun game in single player but, most gamers like me tend to get bored of playing a vanilla game over and over again. So thats why us gamers love to mod. WIth the new update they pretty much banned modding the game and letting us enjoy the game itself with the communitys mods. Its really sad actually. Yes we can go play the online version but the community there is so bad we can barely get to another block without anyone trolling or killing us.Till this gets fixed I would not recommend the game.
