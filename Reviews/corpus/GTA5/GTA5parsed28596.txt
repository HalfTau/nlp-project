The singleplayer has well written script and interesting side missions, alongside with entertaining atmosphere. Definitely worth a try.What lies beneath singleplayer is GTA Online  great concept as a sandbox but very poorly implemented one. With every new addon to GTA Online, Rockstar forces people to grind or to invest into Shark cards. It wouldve been OK but they simply dont do anything about griefers and cheaters.Players are forced to grind in public sessions where griefers could appear any moment, ruining the gameplay and wasting the most precious resource, the time. This situation fits well Rockstars greed for Shark Cards money. They shouldve made this option subscriptionbased and reduce the grind drastically, instead they just add more.All this while being incapable to deal with actual cheaters. You wont establish new track record for a 3minute race for example, just because some asshat used cheat to beat the race in 10 seconds. Although thats technically impossible to do, those players werent punished in any way nor they were removed from high scores. And this is just one minor example.Not recommended if youre looking for online play.
