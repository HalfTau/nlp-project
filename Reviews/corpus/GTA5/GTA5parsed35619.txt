Rockstar got famous by having easily modded games.So naturally they send cease and desist letters to modders. Well no more rockstar purchases for me. The only time online is fun for more than 5 minutes is when you run into modders. Flying buses, chrome everything, mass teleportation and homocide made this game really fun. Guess its time to move on.
