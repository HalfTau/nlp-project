This game is like GTA IV with way improved driving mechanics. The story in V isnt as developed at in IV, but includes all the crazy satire.Wife cheats on you with her tennis coach. Fist fight ensues. You leave. 20 minutes later, wife texts, Hey want to play tennis? Too soon?GTA V online mode has many MMO qualities and I hate MMOs.
