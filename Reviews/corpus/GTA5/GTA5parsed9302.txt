I only play story mode,never play online or use any mode.So this is a review simply based on the original singleplayer portion of Grand Theft Auto V.If you buy this game to play online mode,please just ignore my review.I think it is a great game.Maybe the greatest game Ive ever played.I buyed it by full price in 2017,its still worth the price.ProsExtraodinary story.Three protagonists ,Micheal,Travor and Franklin.Two Americans and a CanadianTrevor with totally different characters.I love Franklin,he is cuteInteresting npcs,funny plots and quests.A very large and well designed open world map which depicts the whole city of Los Angeles.Pretty nice graphics, well optimizedeven my old pc can run it smoothly....by the lowest level of graphics.You can select firstperson or thirdperson.Happy singleplayer experience of 40hours./Hard to aim when shooting,that little white point is too small to find.2017/11/11 edited seems that this can be changed in settings
