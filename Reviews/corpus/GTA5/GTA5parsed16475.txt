This game had so much potential. Single player was pretty nice. But wheres the DLC for it? Never coming.They want to force everyone to play multiplayer, which is riddled with cheaters, and force you into buying Shark cards in hopes you can stand a chance against them. THEN have the nerve to deduct money you earned legit right before an update.Maybe this is why so many people have turned to modding theyreoff about the incredibly overpriced items in game. They want to ruin this game.And they have.It took a while to realize it after having owned several copies on different platforms, holding out hope for the next update that MAYBE theyd do something about the cheaters.But its become clear they wont. Theyve made their money.
