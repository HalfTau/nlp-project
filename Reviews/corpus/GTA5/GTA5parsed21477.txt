Take Two basically killed their own reputation within the community and ruined their public image with this move. Definitely not a wise decision.EDIT Forgot to mention that even though OpenIV has been back for a while, there are too many issues Ive had with the game, offline and online for me to give it a reccomendation anyway. Good game, bad management and follow up.
