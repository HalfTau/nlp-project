I expected alot more from Grand Theft Auto V for PC ...I have played this game on a console and was one the best games I played for it so far , but I really cant say the same about the PC version ...Firstly  my game is having issues with rendering the textures , so it makes it impossible to drive .Also , I could see the game is a lot more confusing ...
