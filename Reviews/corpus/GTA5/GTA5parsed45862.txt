EDIT Still not giving this positive even after the OpenIV reinstatement due to the way things online are handled as far as pricing. Any missions in MP give you such low rewards compared to how things are priced for any item, which in turn makes it to where you want to hack, or buy shark cards which is ridiculous. Nobody should have to feel the need to buy an in game currency because the balancing is messed up. And this is coming from a player who only plays SP mods.
