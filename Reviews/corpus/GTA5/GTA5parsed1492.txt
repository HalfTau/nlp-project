Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharptongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. Its technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but its also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own selfdirected adventures through San Andreas.
