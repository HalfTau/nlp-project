I cannot recommend purchasing this game title if you are one of many thousands of people who like playing with mods, or even modding for that matter.Im one of those people who have been modding almost every GTA title from this franchise since freaking GTA3, and now all of a sudden TakeTwo decided its time to pull the ability to do so? A freaking decade later??? I do not support such vile acts.
