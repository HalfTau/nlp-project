GTA 5 is a great game. I was a little big skeptical if my new gaming pc which I got for christmas can run this game at the highest settings. Turns out it can and the graphics are great. But buy it here on the pc for single player. The single player is moddable and if you mod the game right then it can be the best game of all time! If you are buying this for online it is not a good idea. The online is full of micro dlcs that are called shark cards. If you are buying for multiplayer then I would recommend buying it on PS4 Or Xbox One. Im not trying to sound like a console peasent here or anything. I play all consoles. The reason you should buy it on consoles is because in my person opinion online games is better with friends and people on consoles but single player games are better on PC. That is my review. Hopefully this helped you with your choice.
