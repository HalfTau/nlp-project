Just bought the game thinking that I would be able to transfer my completely legit character from xbox 360 to my new pc, only to find out that character transfers stopped on march 6. I really dont feel like grinding again and I already spent so much time xbox that I feel like I dont need to play this game anymore. Even though there is a bunch of new dlc since they stopped supporting old gen, I feel like I would soon get bored of the game.GTA V will always be one of the best games Ive ever played and I would recommend it for any new players.
