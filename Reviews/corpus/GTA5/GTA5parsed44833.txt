Considering that i have spent a lot of hours on the PS3 and PS4 of the game, modding was the only reason that brought me into GTA 5 PC version. And i was so pleasantly surprised by the amazing mods the talented modders were able to create. Its sad to learn that newcomers will not experience this joy.Rock has always supported modding. But the moment when TakeTwos billionaire stockholders realized that they arent milking enough money from the sharkcards, they decided to crack down modding even though it has nothing to do with people not buying sharkcards.People who did not buy your stupid sharkcards will still not buy your sharkcards just because you closed down modding. In fact, people making money hacks dont even need modding tools to do it. So basically you justoff tens of thousands of PC players who use modders, and hackers and cheaters will still drop money online.When you let pure greed influence your decision, you can bet that it will be the wrong one.
