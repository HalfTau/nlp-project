On a note, Rockstar and Take Two have every right to protect their own content they, never asked for mods in the first place, Modding is one of the reasons online mode is so ed up. On the game note, Grand Theft Auto V is a very well built a great game over all to play, It has endless hours of content on online as well as very entertaining and twisting singleplayer mode, Cheers to the Grand Theft Auto V developers for working their asses of a bringing us new content. Rockstar and Take two should not be put down for protecting their own content. Full Stop,Neither the less Grand Theft Auto V is a great game.
