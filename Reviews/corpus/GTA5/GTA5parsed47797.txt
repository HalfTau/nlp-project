So, I bought this piece ofgame way back in 2015, and the only reason I did choose this version over the PS4 one was mod support. Not only take two backfired on their deal with OpenIV, since they had consent and could do wichever mods they wished for, as long as that ecosystem would not interfere with Rockstar own, lackluster online experience for the game. Despite OpenIv not alowing mod users to even launch GTA Online, some t statement about this and other meaningless excuses, Take Two Interactive pulled a Nintendo and issued a DCMA Takedown notice. What I end up with is a game that is more demanding than it should be, given its lastgenish visuals, one that is also incredibly inconsistent in its performance, and overall, a shalow, reskined package of the original 2013 game.i7 3770Sapphire TriX R9 390X16 Gb DDR31600Mhz
