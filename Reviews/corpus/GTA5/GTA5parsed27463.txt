Did you pay full price for this game? well congradulations, now you need to now spend at least 500,000 worth of real money if you want to have all of the current content in multiplayer.Buying the game for singleplayer? Singleplayer hasent been updated in over 3 years. I heard the whole team responsible for singleplayer updates moved to GTA Online.Dont invest in Rockstar kids.
