I love this game. A way to fix all this OpenIV is to, well, this might be contraversal due to the size of the game, but just make online separate from the single player game. Sure its another 70GB, but at least modding it completely prevented online, and single player modders are happy. And easy way to promote it is to give out multiplayer steam cd keys to all players who buy the single player version, and make the multiplayer unbuyable.TLDR make the single player and multiplayer versions of the game separate.Vote this up so Rockstar can see.
