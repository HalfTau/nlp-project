Saints Row The Third is a really fun game, in which you play the role of leader of the Saints, a rich gang which runs amok throughout the city.Theres an interesting storyline to follow, which you complete mission by mission  just about all of which involve some shooting or racing around in sporty vehicles well, maybe some are not so sporty, but theyre the exceptions.There are also various extra missions which you can choose to take on.Or you may even just choose to zoom around the city in your fast car, doing whatever you want  shooting at other gangs, police, military, or even innocent civilians, heaven forbid.There is a wide selection of vehicles cars, trucks, helicopters, planes, etc., of which you can store a limited number to keep and use again.You can even modify vehicles to make them hot stuff.Some vehicles have to be unlocked by doing missions.Theres even a selection of radio stations you can play in your car although its a shame that, unlike the later Grand Theft Auto productions, you cant add your own MP3s to the radio.You can also play Saints Row The Third in a cooperative mode with a friend.All in all, its a game of serious shooting and major mayhem as well as some notsoserious shooting and minor mayhem.However, in the name of greater social responsibility, I suggest that you use your powers only for good in the game  drive your vehicles below the designated speed limit at all times, and help little old ladies across the road  of course, you may succumb to mindnumbing boredom, but thats your lookout.If you want a fun time, then I can highly recommend this game.
