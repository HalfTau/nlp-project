Dont buy this game, recently Take Two The parent Company to Rockstar has become openly hostile in destroying the singleplayer modding scene.Take Two sent a cease and desist request to OpenIV a modding platform that managed hundreds of mods stating that it allowed third party softwares to modify the game. Due to this modding in singleplayer is basically impossible. Currently this game is focused on just earning the company endless profits with no focus on what the community wants. DONT BUY SHARK CARDS, DONT BUY THIS GAME.
