GTAV is card based action RPG with real time graphic and resolution controls. I genuinly enjoyed the graphics in the game because it made me feel like a hero. everyone has their own definition of hero, for me my hero is my uncle Lewis. Uncle lewis goes to work everyday in the salt mines, to earn enough money for his family. he is kind and loving if he is sober. sometimes he comes back from work and drink his Big Boy juice and gets violent. one time he slapped me so hard my head ripped a hole in space time. I saw the light and it saw me. the light spoke to me and told me many things. i learnt everything there is to know including that which is unknown. i am have become a god. jesus is my home doggy. after reaching nirvana I kicked Uncle lewis in the groin and he cried. as he cried the holy spirit took over me and in a heavly voice spokeHero siege is a pretty good game  i enjoyed it. at that point uncle lewis burned up leaving behind ashes and teeth.
