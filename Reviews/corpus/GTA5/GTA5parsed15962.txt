i try to download mods. i follow every instuction ,i make sure i do everything correctly ,i make sure i have all the files. Yet when i go to play the games with the mods i installed they dont work ive tried every method ever, and thats not all i try to go online because the mods dont work and im bored, a message pops up saying you have altered game files  or somelike that. The modders are ridiculous i was in a game on saturday and the modder was blowing us up ,killing us with fire ,blowing up our cars and he killed the whole lobby and my name came up saying that i killed everybody and they all thought i was a modder and they were all asking me for money, money,money give us moooooonnnnnneeeeeyyyyy. i told them over and over listen im not the modder and they didnt believe me. Rockstar fix your game .  I have an account on xbox which is lvl 220 and there is no modders on there ive made all my money legitimately and even though i raged and raged and raged at missions , it was still better than a modder giving you money or rank because they take all the fun away from grinding money to get the MOC to get the vehichle worksop , to get the weaponized tampa and then go do more missions to get more stuff. But all that is taken away when a modder give youthere is no fun when you have alot of money and a high rank , all the weapons and all the businesses and cars , well there may be some fun but that all gets taken away after like 2 weeks and theres nothing to do except wait for a new dlc to drop in another 6 months and the rinse and repeat. MORAL fix your damn game Rockstar.
