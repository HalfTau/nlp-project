So ill say it now, this game is buggy and online is completemost of the time. However, no one is mentioning how beautiful this game is. This game does have many bugs, and is a serious cash grab while online. Yes online is extremely toxic, but what game doesnt have a bunch of kids ruining everyones fun? Over all, if you are looking for a fun game to pass the time, single player is the way to go, however the whole story mode can be completed in just a few days. Online is really only for if you have friends, if not, good luck finding a heist in which people will allow a low level to play with them. Online is a serious cash grab ill admit, and if you dont want to spend the money, then you have to grind for hours, just to get the one car youve been saving up for. Not to mention the hackers on this game. Every lobby you go into, is 100 garaunteed to have a hacker in it. I would recommend this game only for those who are ok with alot of grinding to pass the time, for such a beautiful game. Although you should wait till it goes on sale, 60 dollars is a bit much for this game.
