played this game a long time ago and wanted to play it again, but when I launch the game it wont allow me to sign in to my social club account.  The message I receive is, We could not create a sign in token.  Please try again later.  If the error persists, please visit the Rockstar Support website, but when i go to the social club website i cant find a fix to my problem.
