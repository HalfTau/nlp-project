Take Two, the company that owns and manages Rockstar are a bunch of lying idiots. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you care at all about single player mods, because thanks to Take Twos recent actions, issuing a cease and desist to the mod manager Open IV, single player mods have essentially been banned from the game.Not only is GTA Online a microtransactions laden hellhole, but now one of the most fun things about the single player has been taken away, for no other reason than the fact that mods dont make the cts at Take Two more mountains of cash.This is the last straw. I have been getting more and more fed up with Take Twos needlessly crappy practices for the past year or so now, and this is really the nail in the coffin as far as I am concerned. I refuse to give Rockstar or any other Take Two company my money until they reverse their many awful, anticonsumer policies and start offering some apologies.Take Two, are you listening? Stop this madness, we wont stand for it.
