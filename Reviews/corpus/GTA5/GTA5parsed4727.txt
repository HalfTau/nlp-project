IM SURE A LOT OF US CAN RELATE TO THISFirst off, GTA has turned from this really fun free roam city game where you would go and kill other players and rob cars and sotres and do things that were actually possible and it was nice but now every update that seems to come out is nothing but military vehicles or just really rediculous things. now its all about who can blow you up first. like that orbital strike that costs 500,000 for a manual shot and 750,000 for an auto matic targeting.... like WTF ROCKSTAR!!! do you think money grows on trees??? all these new cars and choppers and things cost millions of dollars and your heists dont even give us this type of money and shark cards are so damn expensive and then you wonder why people are modding the game to give themselves wods of cash.my negative review isnt even because of any of this. its because i was banned for Modding or what ever it was. Yes i am definitely guilty of being in a modded lobby and wanting money one time. i was banned for a week and i accepted it and moved on but then the other time i just happened to find myself in a lobby with a player who was teleporting to players and sticking himself to them and giving them money. myself included and then i was once again banned... this time for a month even though this situation was not my fault. the last ban i recieved... i dont even know why or how i got it. i was completely broke and havent been on GTA for a while and i only got online a few times to check out the update and then i was banned PERMANENTLY...i spent 60 on this game and it seriously pisses me off that i spent my oney on this piece ofand cant even play it or even try to send a ticket to get my account back online. this is ing t. Rockstar you guys need to step u your game cause after all the money ive spent on your game and shark cards so i could play fairly and after the hundreds of hours ive spent grinding out missions. we do not deserve this.
