Screw Rockstar for selling the game three different times old gen consoles, current gen consoles, and PC, being the 4th best selling game, yet consider doing this. You have made so much money off of GTA5 and the GTA franchise. Modding is what kept people playing your games and continue buying and playing your games. Its such a big part of your community and yet you treated them like garbage, just like your hacker and banwave filled crappy multiplayer.DO NOT BUY OR PLAY THIS GAME UNTIL THIS IS FIXED
