for many months rockstar has not fixed the weapon wheel bug on pc which includes xbox 360,xbox one and ps4 controlleridk about other controllers, which means if u r a pvp player and want to quickly switch weapons you cant, it will switch to the wrong weapon.this bug came with the import and export dlc and they never bothered to fix it and it ruins pvp for me, on console it works fast and even before the import and export dlc i could do fast switching  with the weapon wheel.months of contacting them , they just forwarded to their higher departments but never fixed it.dont bother buying a rockstar game unless rockstar takes ur feedback seriously and try to fix basic bugs which affects gameplay.they only listen to feedback from many players so you would just rather rate this game bad, they never fix the basic bugs especially concerning freemode.the only thing these developers test is missions ,heists and freemode missions, i think they barely care about pvp and freemode so i think they dont test that.
