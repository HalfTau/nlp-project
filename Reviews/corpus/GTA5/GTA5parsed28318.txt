Great game, so far this is my favourite game and it outshines all other open world games in each and every aspect, optimisation is exquisite and storyline is quite immersive, but the thing that separates this game from rest of the so called open world games is its multiplayer. This game is legit a boon to the entire gaming industry and has taken the term open world gaming to a different level, its open world mechanics are undisputable, unbeatable , be it purchasing a home , a boat, a fancy car, hire private militia or mercs to help you get rid of pesky situations and exasperating players or flex your military grade arsenal full of tanks, AMVs, mobile station etc, right from purchasing liquor, snacks, cigars and all sorts of accessories that are used in our day to day lives like fancy clothes, sunglasses, ear rings, necklace, watches etc , to governing a city and enforcing your own law in it using brute power against others through the virtue of your military grade rig and armoured vehicles, GTA Online has it all, you can also be a CEO , build your own office , have your own factory and clubhouse, be a president of a motorcycle club or be a VIP who can hire other players as bodyguards, control the mob, dominate them or simply obliterate them, GTAV has it all. Its legit a second life to me , there is still so much to explore and so much to explain about how splendid, mesmerizing, addictive and extraordinary this game is , i can keep on going but alas, my words wouldnt be enough to describe and highlight all the key aspects and facilities offered by this game, GTA V is like an ocean, and i am a mere sailor , grab a copy today and explore it.
