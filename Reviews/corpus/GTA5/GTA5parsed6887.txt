Single player is all fun and well written as we all know by now.But mutliplayer... expensive and you need to grind for hours straight.I did a shameful thing and bought a sharkcard once to speed up the process.Since having a child is a fulltime job i cant grind this excessive.Lobbys full of hackers. Nearly impossible to not come in contact with modded money.So i got resetted and 465h of playtime are for nothing.Contacted the support but they dont doat all cause theyre bots.I would love to get back into the game, the new content looks awesome. But starting from scratchand having the super overpriced content in mind, i have to pass.Cant recommend it
