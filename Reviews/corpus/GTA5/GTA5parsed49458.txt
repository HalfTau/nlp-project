GTA V has a great story, but online is a different story. Ever since TakeTwo issued a cease and desist on modding theres hardly anyone online and no one can afford anything in the DLC. I dont even play anymore because I would have to spend more money than the game itself  on SharkCards just to have fun. I know people are starting to see the light when it comes to this microtransactioninfested excuse of a game. DO NOT BUY!
