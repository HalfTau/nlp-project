TakeTwo Interactive has recently banned OPENIV which is a program for modding on GTA IV and GTA V. This includes the Grand Theft Auto modding community which is a good portion of people who have purchased the game. This has been a huge blow to modders in GTA V and GTA IV because its probably the onely reason why they bought the game. Hopefully they can redecide and think about the future of GTA V.
