GTA V was the game to break the internet back in 2013 with record breaking sales. The game earned its records too. Great Story, gameplay, the usual GTA humor, among other things that earned its praise. If you are thinking of buying the game for the singleplayer experience, you will not be disappointed.GTA Online is a rather mixed bag for me and Im sure majority of the community. GTA Online is the first attempt by Rockstar to create a multiplayer experience in the MMO style. Saldy that did come with MMOs cancerous microtransactions. In my opinion, if you are thinking of buying GTA V for GTA Online to enjoy the game with friends and I mean friends as in no less than 3 other mates then you will enjoy the game.If you are flying lone wolf then... Payouts are so bad that by the time you earned enough money to enjoy one of the more expensive objects in the game, you may be old enough to qualigfy for pension. A game about a sandbox world where you can murder, destroy, and generally make the world feel your wrath... can lose some of its fun when you are joined by up to 29 other players who have the same potential for chaos. Sandbox games and chaos have a way of mixing weirdly depending on who causes the chaos. Finally whether it was the developer or the publisher who decided a game that went for full price this generation and last gen have a free to plays business model has some interesting thoughts... You may feel milked for your money playing GTA Online.In short. GTA V? 10/10 Singleplayer. GTA Online... kinda like a relationship... happiest kind of torture to endure/enjoy
