Grand Theft Auto V falls flat. I reached the part of the story where you play as Trevor and it is insufferable. His motives are completely nonsensical and I cant follow them. Previous GTA games have been toeing the lines of am I playing the bad guy, or just a guy trying to make his way in the world, forced into tough situations?, and whilst Franklin and Michael follow that moniker, Trevor is just a big you, youre a psychopath now. Hes extremely onedimensional and is just uncomfortable to play as, I dont enjoy myself in that time. I had to stop the game.
