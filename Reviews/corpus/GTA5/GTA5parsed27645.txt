You know...I used to like this game. It was very different and creative and free unlike most open world games at the time. I was having fun on youtube when i found this video called, GTA V no longer has mods. I was shocked. I only wanted the game because of mod support. Now i know rockstar wanted to do something about online for once, but why did they cancel singleplayer mods? I guess well never find out. I reccomended the game to many of my friends, but now they have ALL stopped playing it. And gudging by the super negative reviews you probably should put mods back in before it becomes as diserted as The Crew 2014. Gamingxp78 2017
