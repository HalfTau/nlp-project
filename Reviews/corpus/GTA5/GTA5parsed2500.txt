The single player is somewhat enjoyable, but Rockstar never bothered adding DLC to single player because its all about making money from GTA Online. About that, without entering solo mode or invite only session, you CANNOT play in a session for more than 15 minutes without a modder joining and ruining the session for everyone by trapping you inside objects, attaching pedestrian characters to you or simply putting you in a death loop. Oh, and they can spawn thousands of objects and crash your game. This is all without provocation, simply because they have nothing better to do. It makes starting GTA Online from scratch pretty much pointless. Rockstar has given up entirely on fixing the servers and keeping modders away. So I installed a menu myself to run as protection, and while it solved many issues I experienced with people trying to harass me, now it makes me more of a target for the more malicious modders who resort straight to locking me in a box and spawning stuff on me. So there is no answer. Relying on Rockstar to keep you safe will not work, and using mods to combat mods does not work. The only solution? Play in Invite Only which locks away dozens of muchneeded features provided by public lobbies, such as utilizing CEO services and MC missions. Not to mention youre stuck in a game by yourself, defeating the purpose in multiplayer.Simply put, if you plan on playing GTA Online, consider playing on Xbox or PlayStation, the only time Ill recommend that for any game title. At least modding isnt as prominent on those platforms but its definitely still there.Or just dont play.Dont buy the game.Dont buy shark cards.Dont participate in this  show. If Rockstar has chosen to stop caring, why should we?
