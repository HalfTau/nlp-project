Single player was fun but is forgetable.  Without mods, the game has zero replay ability.  GTA online is terrbile and exists only to sell currency.Plus, why would you support a dev/publisher that demonizes modding anyway?EditLong overdue but im updating my review since Rockstar restored my faith by telling Take2 to Foff with the mod ban.I know there are still issues but this is a big step in the right direction.
