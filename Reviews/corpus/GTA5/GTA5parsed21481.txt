GTAV is an amazing free world game. You can do anything from driving cars to commiting many felonies and getting away with them. In this game, there isnt much consequence for crime. The story mode has a great plot and a touchy ending. The online mode is even better for doing whatever you want. Drink with your friends, claim bounties, arm wrestle, do what ever youd like. This is my favorite open world game and I would recommend it.
