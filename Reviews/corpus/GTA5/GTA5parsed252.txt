Ill make it known here what Ive told everybody else,is absolutely amazing, memorable and worth the ticket price for the Single Player Campaign alone, let alone the Online aspects. The Evolution of Grand Theft Autohit a high note with GTA Vs release, boasting an Amazing Soundtrack, Incredible Graphics, and an insanely Action Packed, Intense Cinematic Story Campaign.Grand Theft Auto V also comes packaged with Grand Theft Auto Online, an MMOesque Los Santos. Rockstar Games keeps the online portion alive  active with Constant Updates, Ban Waves of Cheaters, and Occasional Rockstar Hosted Events. Personally, I believe over the years of its release, it has become too much of a grind and has lost a lot of general enjoyment, but Rockstars recent updateshave really brought Life and Love back to Grand Theft Auto Online.After release, Rockstar Games talked of additonal Single Player Content, but these plans have since been abandoned/not spoken of since, which leaves me and many others disappointed. People want more content because the Single Player Campaign was simply stunning and superb.
