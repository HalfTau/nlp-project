Great game, but the removal of modding is absolutely ridiculous. I grew up modding gta vice city and it really irks me that they have filed a lawsuit against OpenIV simply because they believe they are losing out on shark card sales. give me a break.Review will stay negative until this is reveresed.edit Open IV is back. and so is my recommendation of this game. Unfortunate it had to come to this to get things the way they should be. Hopefully theyll learn next time.
