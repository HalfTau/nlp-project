I love this game, i do. but i love the single player and because the multiplayer is the biggest part of the game i cant give this game a good review.I have had about 60 of my game time in the single player playing with mods, enjoying the amazing story and just ing around as one of the three main protaganists that are extremely indepth and its extreamily enjoyable.The other 40 of my time has been spent in the multiplayer playing with friends and GRINDING theout of it to try and buy a car that i should be able to steal...Then recently Take2 has taken down openIV because it is effecting the multiplayer, even though it supports only SP and it tells you to take it off your account before you go on the online incase you get banned, there is nothing wrong with it...and so 80 of mods now cant be played because they run on openIV and it ruins the fun everyone was having.Take2 are also cash grabbing s and the MP is full of microtransactions and grinding. You can see that take2 dont care about the SP because of all the free DLC for the online which isnt added to the SP for instance the hydra isnt in the SP but happily sits in MP waiting for some poor kid to buy a sharkcard for 50 and spend that on virtual cars that you should be able to steal...Until Take2 sort theirout i wouldnt reccomend this game and would be weary of any games they release in the future RedDead 2 becuase the game may also be a multiplayer hell hole.
