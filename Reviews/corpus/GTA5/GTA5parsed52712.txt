Edit The devs have tried their best to backpedal but the damage has been done already and the communitys view of the company has worsened. The review will stay negative because there are major gameplay flaws with the gameThe worst problem with the game is that there is little to do You can play missions,around with friends blowing things up while chasing each other, and then do heists. The game becomes a grinding simulator for one vehicle that is a 5mph increase over the last. Racing is just a roll of the dice to see whether youll get an  to knock you off the track, screwing up any chance at a win. Combat doesnt feel heavy enough, its too floaty and unbalanced. You dont feel challenged fighting players, its just a matter of who hits the other player with an RPG first. There just isnt anything to do after the first dozen or so hours.Ill keep this here so people understand what happened.Devs claim to support mods, then threaten mod makers with legal action a year later. Nice t you just pulled there Rockstar  TakeTwo, rethink your position as a game company.If you really wanted the community to be happy you wouldnt target a harmless modding platform. Your method of thinking follows as such people own metal, we love metal workers! terrorists exist, oh no terrorists use solids so ban all solid objects everywhere! Anarchism makes more sense than your guys goal here.TLDR Devs are hypocritical s who claimed to love mods only to essentially ban them a year later.
