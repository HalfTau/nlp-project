So, I assume youre reading this because youre playing with the thought to buy the game. You want to play around with all the cool mods, that make you a drag racer, police officer or Thomas the Tankengine in Singleplayer and then head over to the Multiplayer to race against your friends in supercars and compete in challenging deathmatches, right?Forget it.To the Singleplayer Mods used to be possible and they enhanced the game in a great way, only now the publisher of GTA 5 sent out a Cease and Desist to mod developers threatening to sue them, if they dont stop producing mods.So why did they do it? I hear you asking. Lets first head to the MultiplayerRockstar offers ingame purchases where you exchange your real money for a fake currency. And this is where Rockstar makes most of its money. GTA Online features a bride range of cars that are unattainable through playing the Online mode since they cost tens of millions usual payout for a race 5.000, these cars are completely overpowered. So dont expect to win anything if you just buy the game, you need around 50 of your reallife money of course for a decent car and another 50 to upgrade it. Then you probably use it for a month until the next DLC is announced featuring an even better car, that is even more expensive.But what does that have to do with GTAs publisher sueing mod developers? Well Rockstar and Take Two didnt like that a modded Singleplayer used to be much more fun then their very own Multiplayer. Why would players bother with their Multiplayer? Why would they spend their reallife money on horrendously expensive cars if they can try out way more interesting ones in the Singleplayer?Well, money must sure be honey in the rich publishers game.
