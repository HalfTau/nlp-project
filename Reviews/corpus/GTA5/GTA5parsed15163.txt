GTA V is nothing more than a glorified MP game.  The SP experince has been neutered in favor of the MP microtransaction business model.  The SP part is extremely short and not as well thought out as San Andreas.  Yes the world is huge but there are far less things you can interact with in SP vs MP.If youre looking for a fantastic SP GTA experience, go back to San Andreas.  Saying that this game blows is an understatement.  Looks like Rockstar has turned into a bunch of posers.
