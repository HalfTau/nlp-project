I HAVE GOT MY 37 MIL TAKEN AWAY AND I CALLED THEIR SUPPORT AND THEY SAID IT WAS MODDED BUT I DID THE LIGET WAY OF GETTING MONEY SELLING CARS AND DOING HEISTS AND THEY JUST TAKE MY MONEY AWAY SO I WOULD HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARK CARD BULLCRAP SO THEY CAN GET MONEY FROM THE GAME BECAUSE THEY ARE GREEDY AND WANT MORE MONEY AND I DONT SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH MODDING IF YOUR ONLINE AND YOU GET MONEY THEY SHOULD NOT TAKE IT AWAY ITS NOT ILLEGAL IT IS JUST A GAME BUT THE HAVE TO FEEL LIKE THEIR THE BIG PERSON CONTROLLOING EVERYONE I WOULD RATHER BUY THE DLC THAN SHARK CARDS!
