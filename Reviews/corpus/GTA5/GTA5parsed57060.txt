Ive enjoyed this game a lot, even played the single player campaign through multiple times. Unfortunately, Rockstar and TakeTwo Interactive have said screw single player and focused entirely on enhancing the multiplayer, to the detriment of the single player portion of the game. In the past, the way to fix this lack of attention for single player was to mod the game. Its not hurting the multiplayer community, and making the game fun the play. However, Rockstar has decided to try and kill the modding scene by killing one of the most essential mods, crippling any chance to make the single player enjoyable. you, TakeTwo.
