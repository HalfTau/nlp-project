story mode great...multiplayer where to begin.... Loading Screensgta online is loading screens hell, not short ones also. And u constantly wonder if u gonna stuck in loading screen. Connection Problemsjust when u start enjoying the game u face several connection problems. U either get disconnected from online or everyone else leaves your session. And when this happenes during a mission it drives you mad. U open your ports, set firewall rules, etc.... still no solution. CheatersU encounter cheaters almost everyday. Its not unsuaI to have cheaters in online games but even a level 1,000 guy cheats. He would not risk his buildup character if rockstar was really capable of prevent cheating, right? Bad Communityit all depends on who you meet. 95 of highlevel players are toxic. They just wanna show off to newcomers. But when u meet some nice ppl, its delightful.Everyone left the session during a fun time, then stuck in loading screen. Just closed the game and writing this review. This might give u my point.Stay way from GTA ONLINE unless you join with your friends and have nerves...
