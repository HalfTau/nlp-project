I enjoy the game itself and it is nice to know that the devs have worked long and hard for four years supporting their game. I am not apart of the internet mob that wants to destroy the popularity of the game. Yes mods were fun, but everyone knew that the mods were against the Rockstar ToS. The game is fun even without mods, the devs constantly work to improve the game by offering all the free DLC that they do.
