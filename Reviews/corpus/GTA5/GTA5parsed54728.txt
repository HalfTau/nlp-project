Havnt really modded GTA 5 But I spent a lot of time with a modded copy of GTA IV and i can understand the frustration theese othher reviewers are having. That is why I stand behind them. Seriously you guys are WAY too harsh on people who just wants to have some fun in your game and it all sounds even worse when you add the fact that the modding is for SINGLEPLAYER
