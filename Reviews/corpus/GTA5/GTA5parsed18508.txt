This game is simply put fantastic. Great story, feels as if youre in an 80s action movie. Very good characters. Very funny. But theres one flaw about the game. THE ONLINE MODE! Yes it is fun with friends but the community is terrible. From you getting kicked for no reason to rude and obnoxious modders. Story 8.9. Online 6/10.
