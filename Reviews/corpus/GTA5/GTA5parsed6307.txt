This review can be said in a sentence Story mode is good, never even waste your time on online. UGGH! I love this game so much yet I have to give it a thumbs down.UpsidesRaw Gameplay is super funThe story is fun and quite funnyDriving feels really goodGreat GraphicsDownsidesNOT FOR CHILDRENMight offend someOnline is for people who hate themselves or for the richMost mods dont work anymore because Take Two just UGHThe grind in online I find to be too much and to be boring. I am strongly againest micro transactions in games that charge this much for a entry fee. People in Online are almost always toxic.Warblers Final Word If you want the game for the story mode this game is great but it is on sale alot so get it on sale. If you want Online, stay clear unless you want to throw your money at it.
