Rockstar has lost all my respect, even from the beginning its ed up that you have to either grind youroff just to get anything since its x20 more expensive in multiplayer, you could buy shark cards, I dont know about everyone else, but a game you already pay 60 ing dollars to get shouldnt have its online mode plagued by microtransactions for currency, theres not even a point in the free online DLC if the only two types of people that has the stuff is people with trainers or some richlittle kid using his dads money, so its no wonder that people mod the game. You wanna make money Rockstar and Take Two? Then make a single player DLC as good as EFLC was! I would pay another 60 for something that good, and RS could still have some respect! Ive played the GTA series since GTA 3, and its sad to see a good game series I loved growing up go down the  like this. Until things are right neither RS or TT should expect another penny outta me, and im sure other long time fans feel the same way!
