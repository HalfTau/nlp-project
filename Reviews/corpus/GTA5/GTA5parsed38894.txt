BoycottTakeTwoMods were by far the most appealing thing about GTA V on pc, after putting in about 1000 hours on the last gen version, there wasnt a whole lot new for me to see.AND THEN TakeTwo Decided it would be a great idea to make Mod Software Illegal! Yes! Illegal.Now i understand them wanting to ban cheats but a software for people to make harmless Singleplayer mods.I wanted to start Dabbling in making mods but now i cant.So after this and until TakeTwo come to some sense, I will be boycotting and games made/published by them!Im sad it had to come to this...
