Dont get me wrong, the game is amazing and has a very fun, decently sized story.GTA Online can be very fun with friends, but its mostly ruined by the typical GTA player who will just purposely be an  cause they find it fun.However, it is NOT okay for R to not release any Single Player DLC because of how well their Shark Card microtransactions are selling!
