Microtransactions, Modders/Hackers, Terrible car physics, Very long loading screens.. takes forever to do anything multiplayeronline. Rockstar logic Hey lets build 50 jumps around town and do alot of hills/mountains so players can jump with their cars and have fun, and then we add a system so the cars will randomly explode on landing CARS DOESNT EXPLODE, IN WORST CASE THEY BURN. You dont even get a chance to exit the vechicle like in gt4.. and the developers doesnt give a damn about this problem.
