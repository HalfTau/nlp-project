ignore the people who compalints about shark cards on internet and YouTube because half of them either only played SP or just watched on YouTube.awesome game, no wonder why ign rated it  10/10 and metacritic  97/100still 3rd best selling game.my reviewsingle player  10/10 everything done good, so detailed open world and it is a masterpiecemultiplayer  8/10 yall know the reason already loloverall game is awesome, mods created by people is the most fun thing to play with. although gta is gta. incase on mp, i expected something like SAMP. Anticheat system sucks tbh. even samp has better anticheat xd.game is kinda grind type but still never bought shark card and still have everything.every job mode is fun and i think it deserves more contact missions and heists because i almost played 80 of them. business stuffs are kinda boring now, we need some new rather than source and sell. unlike other games, this game has some kind and friendly hackers but also some bad hackers who can get you banned.Ive expecting las venturas and san fierro as in sp dlc but Rockstar cancelled it. players were hating on Rockstar and they ignored that mp also has story.
