GTA 5 ohh where do I start. Besides take two sending cease and dissected orders and private investigators to mod creators which they took back, Rockstar made the worst and most unfair single player in GTA history to me. GTA 4 end game Loads a money, nothing to spend it on, GTA 5 endgame little money, too many things to buy for too little space. GTA SA endgame LOADS A MONEY, LOADS of storage houses.To me GTA 5 is a joke of a GTA game. All online that requires friends to play which i dont have and now you are required to buy shark cards to do anything.GTA 5s world may be the biggest in actual size but to me its the smallest. GTA SA will always be the biggest. Buy GTA SA then down grade it and mod it and play the GTA SA MP mod.
