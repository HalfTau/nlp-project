This game was quite fun playing through singleplayer. Then I played multiplayer. Hackers happened and then I went back to single player.Then Take 2 Interactive got rid of OpenIV and all my wonderful mods that made replaying this game fun.Now it is bad. If you want a game that you will play through once, touch the multiplayer once, and then let fester in your steam games list then this is the game for you. If you want GTA5 to have more good hours of playtime then you are looking for a time machine DLC
