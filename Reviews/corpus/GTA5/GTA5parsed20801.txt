Hackers Rule the world.And not only that  if you make too much money legit. Rockstar will take your cash with no explaination.Had a friend have his CRIMINAL MASTERMIND money taken from him.. over 14 million total... within minutes of finally completing the Mastermind finale. Essentially 200 worth of Shark cards.They have no idea how to solve the hacker problem so they delete suspiscious money, which jsut means.. if youre good at the game. youre going to be robbed by Rockstar
