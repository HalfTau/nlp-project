Great game overall, The story portion is great, and online is even better. The graphics in this game can even run on somewhat lowend pcs. The price is defenitley worth the price, with all of the online Missions sotospeak with Gunrunning, Doomsday, CEO stuff, Biking stuff, and even all of the default stuff. Even though you start out in online with 5,000 to your name, you use that money wisely, and what you spend that 5,000 on is dependant on your future.
