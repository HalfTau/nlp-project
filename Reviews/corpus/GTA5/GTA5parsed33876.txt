Dont worry, the game is good. But Rockstar is so obviously greedy and against the community that they have to see the customers are not pleased. Blocking mods just because they want people to spend money in online... we already bought your game! and everybody who puts the effort into building a mod for a game has to really love it. youre punishing the people who love your game the most. theyre not hurting your product at all.. but you just did.
