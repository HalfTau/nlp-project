Great game. Awesome singleplayer, and pretty good multiplayer. Besides the amount of loadings and joining online screens, its one of the best sandboxes to have fun with friends or strangers. Many types of coop missions, tons of adversary modes, races, so much bling to buy and best of all, chaotic fun in freeplay. Never got banned, even when using money from hackers. Especially at a 50 or 40 discount, its totally worth it.
