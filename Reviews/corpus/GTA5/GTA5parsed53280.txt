Im not normally compelled to write reviews for game like this  everyones already heard about it, and will have already decided whether it was a good game or not.However, TakeTwo Interactives recent decision to bring legal action against its modding community a large portion of why anyone would even bother to buy this game on PC, or at all I can only discourage anyone from purchasing both this game and any games published by TakeTwo interactive, until such a time as they take a stance that is not directly hostile to their own communities and customers.
