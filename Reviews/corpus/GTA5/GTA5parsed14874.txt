Look GTA is a very fun game and it is something that I love however something that you should know before buying is. IF you have a gta online character from another console you cannot get them on PC. I have a lvl 132 on xbox that I have 100s of hours and have had spent real money on. When I went to transfer that character it wouldnt let me. After doing a little research I found that on March 6th 2017 they removed the ability to transfer your characters. Meaning that you can NOT get your online character from other consoles. I didnt want to have to start over so I got a refund.
