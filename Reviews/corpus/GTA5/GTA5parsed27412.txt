The campaign is good but the multiplayer sucks and Its killng the game and rockstars reputation. If you want good singleplayer DLC like TLAD or TBOGT and multiplayer that is actually good stop supporting the current multiplayer because rockstar is going to milk the  out of it for years to come if they keep making as much money as they are. also GTA 6 multiplayer will be the same.
