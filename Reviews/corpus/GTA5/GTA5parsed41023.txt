Modding is a privilege, NOT A RIGHT.I find it baffling that people are condemning this games reviews based on modsupport. Furthermore, they only stopped the usage of ONE mod tool that they found to be against their terms or dangerous to their IP...and need I say one of the best video game IPs of all time? Let the player base 100k at the time of this review on Steam alone speak for itself, non of the 35k negative reviewers stopped playing the game! And why is that? Simple...This game is fantastic. From the story to the multiplayer, it is literally a damn near perfect game. On top of that, all DLC is accessible to everyone and literally everything can be bought with in game cash. Who the hell could ever complain about this game? Its a blatant example of how to PROPERLY make and support a game.Playing the game as intended is incredible. Even after 170 hours on Steam and exponentially more on console, I ing love this game. The constant stream of content to the multiplayer makes it endlessly playable. Asking someone NOT to experience this gem because of the support of ONE mod team is absurd and an irresponsible use of the review system.Instead of asking you not to support this game in some childish little protest, Id rather ask you to make the purchase on your own merit and based on the followingDo you enjoy well designed and polished video games?Do you enjoy incredibly voiced and written story that is refreshingly entertaining, even still in 2017?Do you enjoy open world and ever expanding multiplayer content?Do you enjoy character and vehicle customization on a deep level, in all game modes?If your answer to any or all of those were YES, then you will enjoy this game. Period.
