I downloaded 2 mods for single player. Drug dealer and custom costumes mods. 2 Mods that would never effect multiplayer in the slightest yet i was banned for 30 days. WTF!. Then after contacting Rockstar how to remove the mods they replied Your banned go to hell they didnt reply that but they may aswell of i then continued 3 times before my ban was up. Then a final time after my ban was lifted and still i got the same reply sorry we cannot comment on mods. Well ing thanks you Go to hell yourself. I was a customer AFTER PURCHASING your stupid sespit of a game. you do not give me the advice and support i needed after download community mods that you DID NOT prevent. Have a beer, take a bath, sniff some ing lavender and then get back to me once your out of your own arses. Cant wait for you to spend another 6 years on a decent game with even worse support. Well done.
