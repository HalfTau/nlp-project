I used to defend this game with a passion, blinded by my love for past GTA games. I put up with the microtransactions and all the other scumbag moves the developer/publisher have made to this game, as they continually tried to destroy whatever little fun was left in the game, but after the recent comments made by the ceo of take two interactive that they are under monetizing its gta online user basewhich is absolutely f ridiculous and the openiv shutdown I will never support rockstar games or take two interactive ever again and urge anybody else to do the same.
