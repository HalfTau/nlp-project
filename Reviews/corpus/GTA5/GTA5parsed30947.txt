Take Two shut down single player mods for this game. Single player which effects no one but the one person enjoying the game is no longer legally alloud to be modded, they shut down openIV who allows us to mod the single player. The company has not released any new content for single player since launch and forces you to pay tons of money in game to play the new multiplayer experience. I do not reccomend money hungry companies who dont like to see the creative and insiring things its community can create. fallout 4, and skyrim love moddersd and help us create new fun and exciting content for single player. The loved game Player Unknown Battle Grounds was created becasue modding exists so please devs stop shutting down people trying to have fun with your single player games. i would reccomend you do not buy GTA
