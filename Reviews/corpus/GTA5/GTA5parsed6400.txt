This was IMO one of the most dissapointing games ever, even when It got first released 4 years ago. The Story was short, boring, uninteresting and the map was also lazy designed with like 90 of the land that is not city being an empty, uninteresting landscape of hills.Online... Ohhhhhh Online. Online was good at the start of the game, they tried to do a story and the payouts were very good so you could afford almost everything by just playing the game. Because Rockstar Games and T2 are now even more greedy than EA, new content is locked behind new stupid paywalls  that they add every update now, though they could have implemented them in an earlier  Paywall Paywalls are Bunkers,MC Clubs and other Bases etc. The Payouts you get in Heists and Business Grinds that take like 34 hours are NOT EVEN CLOSE enough to buy 1 new vehicle.The more business and properties you buy, the more your DAILY rent increases. This means If you have a Bunker and a couple of apartments for example you have to pay 20k a DAY ! Rockstar just makes content expensive as possbile and Payouts low as possible so you have to buy Shark Cards. My last thing that I can mention right now, is that this game is a nightmare to play because of theoptimization. I have a GTX 970 and im playing at lowest, and my FPS are like 3040 FPS. Especially in the Offices during day, the FPS is about 2030. Absolutely UNACCEPTABLE. Do not buy this game. Its gone toand it a middle finger to its Franchise.
