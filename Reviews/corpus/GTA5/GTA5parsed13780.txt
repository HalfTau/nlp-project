Solid single player experience, but once its over its pretty boring. The online is extremely grindy and repetitive to the point of getting no where when trying to earn items/cash. Pretty much forced to use micro transactions.R Promised single player DLC and never delivered. Pretty disappointing experience from one of my favorite companies.
