Being as I used to own a potato computer that could barely run GTA, and wasnt even reliable in Online, I relied heavily on mods for the first 200900 hours I played. Banning Open IV hasnt even stopped people in online from hacking either and Rockstar and/or Take Two have degraded both Online through hyperinflation with new DLCs costing so much money, and not creating ways to make money that can actually match the amount youd be spending and now singleplayer through essentially disabling all mods.
