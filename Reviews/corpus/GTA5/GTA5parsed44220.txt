After expressing their love for PC community, they smack it into its face by harassing modmakers. Even worse is that TakeTwo claims it does that to protect integrity of GTA online, while OpenIV the moding tool in question doesnt work with GTA Online and doesnt hide its presence in the system so you WILL get banned if you try to go online after using it.They say theres plenty of content in GTA Online. Well, guess what I want to choose my own content, I dont want to grind  for days to get to that content, and I dont want to wait a few minutes each time I try to launch a race/heist/deathmatch/whatever.
