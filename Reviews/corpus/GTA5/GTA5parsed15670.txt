Do i recommend this game? Yes. It has a great story modeeven though the others were better and the gameplay is excellent which gta isnt?. But if you are buying this game for the online component, dont bother. Online sucks but i keep playing it. You got to have friends who are willing to grind nonstop with you. Like most ppl say Online is cash grab. But hey theres always story mode. 8/10 for story and 6/10 for onlineunleess u have friends bc its really fun when u have friends playing with u
