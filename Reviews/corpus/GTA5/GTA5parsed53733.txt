Originally purchased this game with the intent of playing and experiencing the beautiful world of GTAV mods. However, the publishers of this game are too overzealous in their greed, and have completely shutdown the popular modding tool known as OpenIV has been forced to shut down due to cease and desist requests from TakeTwo. Rockstar released a state claiming it is to prevent Malicious modding for Online, however this has blatent ulterior motives. Why would Rockstar suddenly care about cheating in a game that has been out for almost 4 years with another rumored sequel in development?  It is highly dubious why a company would put this much time, effort, money, and legal resources into preventing the development of a tool for mods to simply stop cheating years after it already peaked. The more likely answer theyre afraid people will avoid Online if they have mods to use, so they lose profit from people no longer buying overpriced items such as the Shark Cash Cards which cost up to 100 Dollars, NEARLY TWICE THE PRICE OF THE BASE GAME. AND THIS IS JUST TO USE MONEY TO ACTUALLY BUY THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE DAMN GAME. Rockstar and TakeTwo are both simply companies, and companies care about money, they would not spend their own money and resources unless it directly benefitted them. I do not recommend this product as both Rockstar and TakeTwo have killed my enjoyment for their own personal gain, and they could care less who else they  over in the process. TakeTwo is definitely an appropriate name for this publisher, I wish I could have a second take on actually buying this disappointment.
