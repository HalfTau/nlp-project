They tried to ban mods in single player, you have to grind for hours in multiplayer to buy overpriced cars, houses, guns, businesses. They want you to buy shark cards for real money because trying to buy that car you wanted legitimately would take you hours of replaying the same old missions you completed already. This game is almost like pay to win. they never kept there promise to add dlcs to the game. this game is a giant cash cow they need to spend more time listening to the players to decide what the fans want in this game instead of adding more useless gimmicks
