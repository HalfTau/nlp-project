alright so lets be honest here first off the single player is really amazing and great so right now since its on sale its worth buying, however my issue is with online and especially with the support staff of RockstarShort story I asked them to unlink my social club from steam and after 3 days of going through verifiation they go Nope and solved the ticket so I cant respond so defienenrtly I will not support the online GTA StaffSecond about Online apart from hackers and Rockstars constant push to force you to buy shark cards and increasing prices they also ban the wrong the people and dont care about the players as long as they get moneyTo sum it up buy this game for SP but dont buy it for online its not worth it and a waste of money
