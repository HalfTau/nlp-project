Well, it seems as if it worked. Destroying a games reviews as quickly as a company tarnishes their reputation can certainly spark change it seems.Thankfully, Take Two has allowed the OpenIV team to continue work on modding.The game is fun to mess around in. Glitchy, but not terribly glitchy. And overall, its worth the moeny.However, GTA Online still has a massive problem with it costing so much in game currency to get any of the new thing, you have to sell half of your old things.Original ReviewDear Rockstar,Whats next? Having a month subscription just to access your garages online? Having to serve in game jail time for your crimes you commit in game? Youve pulled a Bethesda. Not only is GTA Online basically pay to enjoy at this point, but you also shut down a huge portion of the GTA 5 Singleplayer mod scene. As a result of your terrible decisions, your game has plumeted to an Overwhelmingly Negative score.However, you can fix this. All you need is to man up, admit you made a huge mistake, and let the Open IV team continue their work. Im sure if you do this, youll have a better review than Day One Garrys Incident.I really do enjoy your game, however your incompetence as a company makes me sick. The cease and desist was completely out of the blue, and has virtually no reason to have happened seeing as Open IV has NOTHING to do with GTA Online. You can fix this. PLEASE. Fix this.Your not so loving fan,Pandaa
