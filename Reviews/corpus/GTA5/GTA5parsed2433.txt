This game is amazing but i want to give it negative because, not even joking, almost every lobby has a modder in it. Won a gunfight against a guy and he gotand kicked me from the game with his mods, really cracked me up. But if you go in private sessions or singleplayer, totally recommend this game and modding in singleplayer is fun.
