Take Two has destroyed the modding community in this game in one fell swoop. Instead of allowing Rockstar to release new and engaging single player content, instead they have decided to milk their customers for every dime that they can.The base game itself has made over one billion dollars. How did Take Two decide to move forward with this massive success? They decided to add a microtransaction system to support new content that is online only and derail the celebrated history of top tier single player DLC. Instead, now the player is left with more and more expensive content that either destroys the desire to play the game online accrewing it with in game options or you are given the option to purchase a sharkcard that will give  you in game money for real money.What does this have to do with mods? With mods, players could create their own content, or enjoy the paygated content in single player. This cuts into Take Twos profits by not forcing players to play online and hop on the endless, hopeless, and tedious treadmill of grinding for money to enjoy the content that should have been issued with a 60 game.
