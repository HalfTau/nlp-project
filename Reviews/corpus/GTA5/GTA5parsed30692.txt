Grand Theft Auto was once a game where the possibilities were endless. If you wanted to become Iron Man and kill everything in sight, why not. If you wanted to play as an LAPD police officer and be on the other side of the law, sure thing. Hell, even if you wanted to start an online roleplaying system you could as well, but now all of this has changed. Im leaving this negative review until the stance on modding on GTA V has been changed by Rockstar, until then I would not recommend buying this game.
