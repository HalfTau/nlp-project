Holy crap, this is how you make a game. The game play while glitchy is a very welcome part of the game condisering most glitches I came across offer laughs and not rage fits. The content is not for anyone younger than 13, worries me hearing was sounds like 8 year olds playing the online, but to each their own. Overall, to make this short, this is one massive 40 hour story with unlimited replayability and online while not plesant when hackers ruin the game still a welcome addition. Graphics still hold up to todays standards but are a little out of date, the game came out 3 years ago so that is expected. Gameplay could not be better with awesome heists, and mini missions along the way.9.5/10 Great game and a must buy
