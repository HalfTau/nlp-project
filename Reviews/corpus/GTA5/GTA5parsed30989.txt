I still enjoy the game even after they banned mods and removed cash and rp from my account.  I am satisfied with the content released so far free of charge and they took action against the hackers who were ruining the game for everyone including those who only modded single player.  They might have a plan to allow user created content back into the game but Im fine with what I paid for as it is.
