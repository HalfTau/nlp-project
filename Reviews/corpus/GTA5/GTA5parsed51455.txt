The main thing to do after beating the campaign was the mods.The developers of the game sent a cease and desist to the developers of a tool to make mods for this game.They just want you to play the online. Which is terribly made. You will spend hours playing online just to get two guns and a  car. And even worse they offer in game money as something you can buy with real money. So the game is pay to win. And there is no fun to be had there.Also, everyone online is an absolutely terrible person.
