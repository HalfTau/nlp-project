Ive played a lot of this game. I loved it, too...until they decided that their moneygrubbing was more important than my enjoyment of the game, and they killed off any and all mods with Cease and Desist letters. This game is no longer entertaining, the Grind for Online is absolutely, unequivocally insane, requiring hours and hours and hours to get even modest sums of cash, while everything you need for it is insanely expensive. And when they deliberately kill the offline replayability by ing over OpenIV and killing mods, the game is no longer worth my time. I wish I could get a refund. Take Two should be ashamed of itself, and Rockstar should apologize for this how.
