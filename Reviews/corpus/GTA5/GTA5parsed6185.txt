I think GTA 5 is a very good game. Not story story has more mean stuff. I Dont mod I just get modded by ohter people. I just ignore the money drops rp and more. If people are modding in jobs I ussaly leave because if they are hacking they might make us get messed up like they coudl change the rule of what to do. I dont like any bad stuff in the game like mods bullying online dating and other mean things. I play gta 5 on a laptop the MSI leopard gtx 1060 core i7 7th gen cooler boster 4 killer sheild.
