Since the day of release ive been playing away with GTA 5 on ps3, then ps4 for that next generation performance. Seen some pretty neat mods showing up on the pc version so i was looking forward to giving that a go some day. Wasnt long ago i bought the game on pc. Was getting settled in to completing the story for the third time, to eventually give some of the mods a go at the end. Some nice real world cars and stuffshout out to whoever it was who made that 1970 plymouth roadrunner, i was looking forward to trying it out my dude...i guess that aint happening now. If i knew this was going to happen, i wouldnt of bothered to be honest. Ive already completed the story more times than i really needed to and my experience with gta online is fairly mixed. Some of us dont have time to grind for days just for in game cash, and you can think again if im about to part ways with real money in exchange for money in a game. I dont suppose anyone else thinks this is madness?Im done here. Will not take another step further with this game.
