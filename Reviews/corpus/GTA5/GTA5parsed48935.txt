I did have a legitimate review for GTAV and GTA Online, but its time to rewrite it due to some rather...poorly thought out actions, ld say.The main reason I bought GTAV is so that I can mod my singleplayer game. I do also play online, but I feel that using cheats and hacks in Online is unfair, and for that reason I use two installs of GTAV  one to play mods in singleplayer, and one to play clean in Online. I have never, ever had the impulse to mod online and I never will. My mods stay strictly within my singleplayer game.It saddens me that TakeTwo has cut off a whole community from playing their game. Modding is the only reason Im still playing both GTAIV and GTAV today. It reveals a creative side to not only me, but a whole range of other creators who put huge amounts of time into their modifications.Hopefully, TakeTwo will realise how many legitimate players they have lost to this decision and revert it and/or try another solution.
