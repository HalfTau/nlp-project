Ive played this game for over 1,500 hours both PC and Console combined and I can firmly say, I do not recommend this game. Sure you its fun, but Rockstar has turned their online mode into such a cash grab that its just not worth the effort to do it for some mediocre reward.Example of why not to buyEarlier they added the Gunrunnin DLC for online, this added bunker and new vehicles, previously to this update you couldnt store vehicles that have weapons on them, but now you could and to boot you couldnt customize them at the normal LS Customs. You had to buy a truck that carried the Workshop for the cars. But to get the truck, you had to buy the bunker and in the truck you had to buy the mod for the customizations. And what s you even more is you then need to get supplies for research so you can unlock mods for the cars.
