Pointless! The point in PC Games is to MOD! And now T2Interactive have removed support for OpenIV and Possibly removing .rpf archives, theres no point unless you want to go in a n online world full of 12 year olds,if you want to mod, go buy GTA 4 as its better! Or buy a decent game where you arent forced to play a vanilla game.What agame. I also have no interest in Red Dead Redemption now! Ive also sold my PS4 as I dont want to play GTA Anymore! Rockstar were my favourite game devs, byt i cant be arsed with them now. Ill go and play a siginficicantly better game
