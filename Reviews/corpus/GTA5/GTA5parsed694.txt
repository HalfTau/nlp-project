GTA SP  10/10GTA Online  7/10Story is fine, graphics is awesome, lot of missions are not boring, but earning money in Online can be quite hard and take long time. But the updates are free, so if they want to still make some profit even they already did they have to make it somehow. On the other hand updates are original and creative, I think.And if you want to make sick game videos, there is a R editor too.If you dont have friends to play with, it can get boring really quick.
