I used to support this game, I still do. However,  I cant stand by their anti consumer practices any longer. OpenIV doesnt even effect online modding, and yet they decided to send a cease and desist, when OpenIV is only used for single player modding. I wish they would at least do some research before sending a cease and desist to something that doesnt even effect their sharkcard sales.EDIT As rockstar seems to have spoken to thier publisher TakeTwo and they reconsidered their stance on modding from what it seems, Im gonna revert my review back to positive.
