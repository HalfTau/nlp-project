This game used to be great, but after theirwith OpenIV, and their t statement about it that basically makes them wither liars or idiots, I, NerdCubed, and many others mind you, am officially boycotting all TakeTwo products from now until thisis fixed. That, obviously, includes all future products. To quote the developersOpenIV, Liberty City in GTA V and all other mods/projects from my team and me are only specific for Single player. Rockstar must be well aware about the fact that you cannot access GTA Online while you have installed any OpenIV modThe statement Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody, is just wrong and they know it. OpenIV does not allows or supports any kind of GTA Online mods. We always supported Rockstar in their right to protect GTA Online from hacks and cheats. But, TakeTwos CD was specific for out Singleplayer mods and have no mentions about GTA Online.So dont take thier t. I recommend everyone who cares about this sort of thing join in NerdCubeds boycot. If we take away their source of income, they will literally not have any other choice, assuming they want to keep making games.Also, just to make it clear, I would have done this even if NerdCubed did nothing, because thisis important to me, so dont even try to tell me Im just joining a bandwagon when I would have started this bandwagon myself if it wasnt already here.
