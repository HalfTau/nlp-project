The Single Player is fun but they only add updates to the multiplayer. Sucks.The Multiplayer is hot garbage where everything fun is expensive and you need to buy stupid shark cards to afford anything cool.New update adds cool new heist and even jetpacks. Unfortunately, I jumped into multiplayer for 2 whole hours and magically got banned for a month and my characters got reset.This is unnacceptable for a game that sold better than any other game ever made and I dont plan on buying anything made by this company again. Red Dead Redemption 2 might be an exception though.
