Now dont get me wrong, I love this game. The story is great, visually it looks stunning and mainly... its fun to play. I have mostly played only campaign and havent used any mods. But...actually a big...I cant give it a possitive score/review.On behalf of the PC gaming community ... F you TakeTwo for destroying OpenIV. I have played a lot of modded games in the past, including previous GTAs and it made the already great game, into one of the most fun experiences I have ever had with any game on any platform. Its one of the key things which makes PC gaming so special...We, the gamers, wont be silent on this issue.End of rant
