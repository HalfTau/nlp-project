Rockstar has long since stopped caring bout how Ludicrous its microtransaction practices are, and the Smuggling DLC has further cemented this fact. The sheer cost of each of the items on display is more mocking than encouraging at this point. Rockstars thieving practices are disgusting at this point, and only further vindicate those who illegitimately mod the game, because by prooving that the game will never become cheaper, any new players are immediately turned off when they see that all of the cool stuff shown in trailers is locked off behind a paywall bigger than the FKING CHRYSLER BUILDING! !TO ANY, AND I MEAN ANY NEW PLAYERS COMING TO THIS GAME, DO NOT INDULGE THE MICROTRANSACTIONS EVER, IT IS AN ADDICTING AND SLIPPERY SLOPE YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO RECOVER FROM. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I HAVE WASTED ON THIS SHAMELESS CASH  IS SHAMEFULL AND I WILL BE PROMPTLY DIVING INTO A SHOWER TO SCRUB MYSELF AFTER PUBLISHING THIS REVIEW.In fact, sod not indulging microtransactions. Just get your refund and leave this game well alone, it isnt worth your time and its never going to be anymore. it is dead, bury it and move on.
