I have to admit, I enjoy playing the Story Mode a lot.It has interesting characters, a nice storyline, and lots of lovable features.If youre buying this game just for playing the Story Mode, go ahead and purchase it.If youre buying this game for its Online Mode, or maybe both,then please keep this in mind before you purchase the gameThe online mode allows you to make your own custom characters, and you can have a good time with yourself, your friends, the people in the Internet... etc.But look, there might be hackers who will hack you, and then Rockstar might slowly remove your custom characters, and dont expect to get it back.Of course, you can play Grand Theft Auto 5 Online in Solo, or maybe with your friends only, its just some problems that I have with the Public servers.Theres no need to blame Rockstar for this, the hackers did it.I just wish that Rockstar might help people who got misunderstood for hacking, and probably help them with their accounts.
