Singleplayer is amazing and the multiplayer used to be amazing. Gta online has become pay to win. For example Rockstar has now added an obrital cannon into the game which costs 750k per shot and is an insta kill regardless of if your in an armored vehicle, underwarer, in the air, in a tunnle etc. Rockstar used to be a good game company, Unfortunatly they have become greedy and are now milking thier customers for every penny they can get out of them. Rockstar has become worse than EA in their business practices, and that is really saying something. You are at an unplayable disadvantage if you dont dish out 200 on new content when it comes out. Its really sad to see one of the best games turn into a moneygrab. I was planning on buying RDR2, but I will not purchase another product from rockstar again unless they stop theese practices.
