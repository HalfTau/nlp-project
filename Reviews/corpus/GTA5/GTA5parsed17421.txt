Before you read the my review please look at how many hours I have played on thsi game. Did you look? Good.Now the single player mode is pretty good, love the story and the 3 characters. However there is no dlc for the single player mode in which R focuses on the online mode. Now, with 4,000 hours of playing time and never using an exploit, cheat, glitch, hack, beg/accepted money from hackers, how come I am punished by having my money taken away from me? Never once did I do any of those things and R punishes me. Not only that but I still didnt get all the stuff from the gunrunning dlc. That doesnt even include all the things I wanted to get from previous dlc. 4000 hours and still not able to get everything from a single dlc. Way to go R for making everything so expensive and punish innocent people like me just because Im trying to grind my money to purchase said dlc.I would say wait for this game to be on sale for 30 bucks to buy it because the single player is amazing. As for the online mode, it is a waste of time and money as R never fixes the problems and blames the innocent people for its unfairness and treats hackers like they are the gods of the game.SP 10/10MP 0/10all in all 5/10EDIT Steam Sale 10/27/2017 WOW Its out for half price FINALLY for how many years now?
