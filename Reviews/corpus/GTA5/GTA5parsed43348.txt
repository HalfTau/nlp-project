Something I cant stress enough, if a game is already two years old it should not be the price of a new game.You can say Online gets free updates all the time but in truth youll find that these updates of FREE new content is nearly always going to require either 3040 hours of purely farming ingame money nonstop for a small portion of the actual update or spending s of actually earned money in order to see what SOME of the content from these socalled free DLCs have to offer.TLDR  40 hours of your life grinding away nonstop, or more than 200 for the most recent Gunrunning DLCLets take the most recent Gunrunners update as an example 14,670,000 is the total cost of most vehicles with no upgrades, cheapest bunker with no upgrades No production upgrades, no security, no personal quarters, no transportation, no gunrange, just the base setup the mobile operation center w/ the cheapest truck, the vehicle and weapon workshop, and command center This does not include clothing with the exception of the Ballistic Equipment, or weapon upgrades and the research required to retrieve them, or the modifications to vehicles or research also required for them 14,670,000 is equivelant to, if going purely on the idea that you already are capable of being a VIP which now requires you to have 50,000 in the bank at any time, 200 i.e. 2 Megalodon Shark Cards will be required. Now if you wanted to do this legitlimately on the basis that you already own a decent money making building say for instance a car warehouse and lets just, although this is nigh impossible, say you have all the Top Grade vehicles to sell, always paying the 20,000 to take it to the specialist dealer, netting you 80,000 each time and this is to assume that you somehow never damage the vehicles you deliver. Say it somehow takes you 5 minutes to deliver, a MANDATORY waiting period of approximately 16 minutes, and restocking lets say takes 8 minutes and well say you immediately begin restocking so as to remove 8 minutes from the 16 minute waiting time, and well also say you always get back a top range vehicle. So thats 14,670,000/80,000 which is 183.375. Multiply that by the minutes you have 13 and you get around 2383 minutes or rounded up to about 40 hours of purely vehicle work nonstop And once more this is purely assuming that you gather the vehicles without taking any losses, which is almost entirely impossible, and always taking only 8 minutes to get a new vehicle and not damaging it, again being almost impossible, always getting toptier vehicles, and never losing any cash when delivering vehicles aswell as always delivering in 5 minutes.So in truth, a very small portion of one of the most recent FREE DLCs is equivelant to approximately more than 40 hours of your life purely grinding away, or around 200 if you pay for it. Hows that for FREE? How great of Rockstar to give us all this FREE content, right?Im ing done.
