if you like watching loading screens, this is the perfect game for you. everything is so overpriced, missions barely give you any money, and if you even want to do them, you need to wait for like 1 hour to get group for it, and when you do, you get some low lvl guys ing up the mission and after like 2 fails ppl leave the mission so you got to do all over again. and thats not all, after a mission your game freezes and you got to restart your game again. oh and the loading screens, just to start up your game it takes about 30 mins, so yeah, you need to be patient to play this. instead of fixing bugs in this game, devs adds new vehicles that costs billions.
