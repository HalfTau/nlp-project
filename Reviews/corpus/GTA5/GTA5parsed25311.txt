Modding is an essencial selling point for games like this on PC. Going againsed modding for singleplayer and private servers does nothing but harm your reputation and get rid of any longterm community and lifetime of a game. Open IV was even supportive of the issues that you had with the modding of GTA Online being a problem, but then this happens. Just know that there is a very distinct line between Modding a game, and Hacking a game. All I can say is that I hope you learn from all of these negative reviews and change your opinion before everyone leaves this game as a distant memory of what used to be. At least you already made a ton of money already.
