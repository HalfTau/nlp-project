I started out solo with GTA Online and it was a rough start trying to get money saved up. But once you get a business running it gets better. It eventually got to the point though, where I was starting to lose interest. That is, until I met a great group of friends who recommended Discord chat. We now have our own small crew of people we can trust and get along with, and I must say it has made this game 1,000x better then it was before. When you have a group of people who are also willing to help grind for money and are able to have fun doing it...it reminds me why I loved this game to begin with. Really brings back the nostalgia of it allSo if I had at least 1 recommendation, make sure youre able to use voice chat Discord is the popular program choice Online gameplay isnt the same without it
