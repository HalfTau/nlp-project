Bought this game three times like many, many others. And for me, this game has run its course. The only thing that keeps me playing and the only reason I bought it on PC is mods. And as Im sure you know, mods are f at the current stage. Should you buy this on PC? Not currently, but once TakeTwo/Rockstar realize how much they f up and allow OpenIV to continue doing its thing, and its not at full price, go for it.
