Im giving a negative review because I dont agree with the way Rockstar and TakeTwo are handling everything. Aside from killing off a 10 year community which has  previously been supported by Rockstart before backstabbing them to keep their interest on milking the teats off microtransactions, they have no sympathy for the innocent players who were affected and banned because some hacker wanted to mess around with the game. Their money and hard work gone to waste with no affirmed way of compensating for their loss, even if they put money on shark cards.Filing a dispute against a ban is really tricky and in most times pointless because RS would either send an automated message describing why the ban was issued or close the ticket entirely. They seem to not have an effective way to differentiate between a hacker and a player that was hacked, making it seem like they dont care about their players. It gives off a vibe that its your fault you for being in a session with a modder and it affects the entire online community because it makes going online unsafe for everyone. it is sad to see a franchise with so much potential drive itself into the ground because of bad decisions and poor managing skills.There was a time I would recommend this game but I feel like its not worth the price on top of possibly paying more for ingame currency in order to play with the new toys. It is still a fun game to play at times but the online community makes it hard to be enjoyable. If you want the game for mods, you still can. FiveReborn still exists and it doesnt go through Rockstar nor does it affect game files. The modding community will never die because gamers always find ways to make the game more enjoyable.
