when i got this game, i bought to play with my brother in the online.but with all the hackers in the game it made it less fun.plus they charge you a lot just to get in game money,  they make you pay 100, just to get 8,000,000 in game.i really like the game a lot, but with everything that going on around it, i cant recommend this.if rockstar reads this, remove the shark cards, or price drop the hell out of them, bring back modding for the SP, price drop everthing ingame, so player like me can buy the stuff you make, and last of all give every player who played the game without hacking it 20,000,000 ingame money as a thank you for play fair.  then i might get back playing the game.PaladinWill
