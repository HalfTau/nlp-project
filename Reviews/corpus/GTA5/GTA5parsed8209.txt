What a game! Man, finishing the story mode had some feeling, Rockstar really went to town with that final scene choice C.Its a shame GTA Online was turned in to a money mine for Rockstar, I felt it couldve become something better, the same boring updates keep getting release. Always based on some sort of cargo transportation which costs an arm and a leg and doesnt even pay for itself.Still, SM has mods for it, and they make the game pretty fun, plus theres always FiveM
