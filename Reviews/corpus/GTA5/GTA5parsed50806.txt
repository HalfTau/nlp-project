T2 shutting down OpenIV is a stupid idea. You have essentially killed Singleplayer modding since it cannot be used to hack GTA Online anyway. This seems to be a desperate attempt to push more players to play GTA Online and purchase Shark Cards.Dont support this, or any game published by T2, until this is reversed.
