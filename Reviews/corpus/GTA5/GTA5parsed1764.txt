This game is a true masterpiece in terms of graphics, storyline and gameplay.Though this game has a lot of downsides aswell, the big downsides I have is the following They dont add new content to Singleplayer, only Online. Online is full of modders. I have heards lots of stories of people being banned off online with no reason, youll see a lot of these in the reviews. They are just milking online for money.I have kind of given up hope on online, though it can still be fun to play with friends. Though what I would suggest is to get a mod called FiveM instead of playing online, which is a platform where people make their own custom servers with mods and everything, or just vanilla.You can still play online if you want though, just be aware of the amount of modders, which I really hope they will do something about, though theyve had a long time to fix this issue.All in all, I would still recommend the game, just for the Singleplayer itself and because of FiveM.
