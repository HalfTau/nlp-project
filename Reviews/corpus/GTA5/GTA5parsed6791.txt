This is singleplayer game review. I have NOT played online at all.In a nutshell GTA V is an amazing open world gaming experience. Ive played GTA 1 very very very long time ago, I liked that one. I played GTA 4 until it got stuck was okay game.pros single player world is inviting with plenty of missions, and freeroaming cool, personal characters with each having their unique skills graphics look good still no console port feeling that was in GTA 4 radio channels are great all kinds of minigames and activities ranging from dart throwing to stock purchases cars! cops! the heist missions! man I like them so much first you choose your plan, steal equipment, go for the mission, and espace random encounters dudes robbing somebody, money car coming AI creates create fun situations cops smashing into something that hits something else that hits you... nice progression with weapons unlocking one after another as game progresses so much to explore day/night cycle looks amazing selfie cam D theres just so much awesome stuff in this game I cannot remember it all profanities Trevor has pretty creative words at his disposalcons profanities not for everybody, if you dont want to hear profanities, and characters insulting each other, and drivers giving the middle finger to you when you crash their car...  then probably not a game for you I did not like missions where you have to change the character, that kills the pace of the mission its not that bad theres only few missions like that so far but still You have to like cars to like this game  plenty of driving in this game.I played only single player game and if you are after a great openworld experience in modern world then theres good chances youre going to like this game.
