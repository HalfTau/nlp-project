Having totalled up over 300 hours on the game now I have to say on hindsight I would not recommend.The story is lacklustre but at this point you would buy it for the online and oh boy is that a st show.If you dont die from boredom waiting for it to load in you will be treated to massively overpowered vehicles in the hands of complete cretins who have grown bored of life and only find fun in ruining others experience.If you somehow manage to scrape under the radar of level 400  and his rocket car then you will probably have some modder lock you in a cage. Or strip you of weapons. Or make you immobile. Or kick you out of a vehicle just to ruin your day which is made worse by the fact that anything they do follows you to the next lobby so you have to altf4 and start all over again.All of this would be insignificant if rockstar actually moderated this but they seem content letting jonny no friends mod their masterpiece as I have never seen a nodded get banned or even kicked from the session for it. I have logged 7 support tickets from issues going from in game glitches. Modders costing me hours of work to even in game purchases double charging me and not once have they actually been any help. Simply replying with the same copy paste response each time about how they do not monitor public sessions.Its a good game ruined by a small few and rockstar themselves.
