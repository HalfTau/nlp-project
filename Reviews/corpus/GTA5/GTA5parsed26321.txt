This game is all based around Rs own personal revenue. They dont give a damn about the game or any of the players in it. Its impossible to make money online unless you dedicate days of grinding on BS minigames online. Heists take longer to make money and are ridiculously tedious and the most effective way to make money in the game other than cheating is by spending at least a couple million in one of the online businesses. Rockstar has gotten out of hand, all they want is money and they are milking the community for it. Do not support this company until they start answering the communities requests. BRING MODS BACK!! !
