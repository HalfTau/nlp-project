Ive enjoyed this game but only in spite of the terrible decisions made by Take Two and, to some extent, R. GTAO only exists to promote Shark Cards, and removing mod support is just anothermove by T2 to get people to convert their real people money into fantasy money. There are items ingame that end up costing either 100 IRL or 20 hours of farming but at the same time, they cant up their security to prevent modders from locking you in your house, blowing up your vehicles or removing your guns so you have to repurchase them.Network infrastructure is slow 510 minutes to connect to the server and finicky at best, constantly dropping connections and dumping you out into Single Player so you can mash buttons through a cutscene just to sit through another 10 minute load screen.The worst part about this game is that its fun so you end up putting up with most of the t but if theyre going to spit on their players that are modding their singleplayer experience because 700 MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN REVENUE FOR A 4 YEAR OLD GAME isnt enough then  em
