I used to like GTA, I used to like Rockstar but time and time again they treat us, the gamers likeToday Rockstar Games, and their publisher TakeTwo Interactive sent a cease and desist to the developers of OpenIV, a tool made for modding GTA and allowing the games to thrive years after release. So much time and effort put into the tool so that people could make the game their own and its all gone due to the greed of Rockstar and TakeTwo. I will never buy another Rockstar game after this and it was bad enough as it was with them turning onlline play from something basic and fun in GTA IV into a greed propeled grindfest.Once upon a time I would have recommended this game, I would have recommended any Rockstar game but not anymore.Edit I know none of you want to believe your precious Rockstar is at fault here, I know you want to put blame solely on Take Two but that isnt the bloody case. Rockstar Games is the publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series, Take Two owns Rockstar Games but they infact give a lot of autonomy to Rockstar Games. The people that initiated the CD were Rockstar Games AND Take Two despite what you want to believe that is the way it is. The people you think support mods no longer exist. Management changes in companies and the last time I can recall Rockstar supporting mods was back in the GTA IV days which is a long time ago.Stop defending Rockstar. They do not deserve it.
