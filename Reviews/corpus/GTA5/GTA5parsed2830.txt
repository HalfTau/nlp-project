look i like gta but there is just some this that are ING annoying for example they removed the character transfer option i used to play gta on xbox but stoped cause i dont want to pay for gold anymore and i thought you would be able to transfer your character but no you cant so now i have to restart and lose all the stuff ive done on xbox and also i dont know if this is just my computer or this happens to anyone else when i load up gta online when i start the game up it takes about 1520 minutes just to load me into a lobby and when i load up story mode then go online it take about 1015 probably just my computer and there is a few modders that can be really annoying for example when i was playing i was driving own the road doing nothing but driving to the gun store boom was teleported out of my car to find a adder infront of me i later when to my apartment sorry if i spelt that wrong and there was one right in the middle of it blocking some of the ways to my apartment i would recommend gta casue if you forget about all of that the game is actually pretty good but those are just some really annoying things that i find about the game
