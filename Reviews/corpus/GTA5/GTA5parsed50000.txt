It is pretty obvious that TakeTwo themade this move for shark cards. Example of PURE GREED. Oh and, OpenIV cannot be used online because there are restrictions in the files. Also, what do you expect us to do, grind up to 8M to buy your  DLC? Banning OpenIV does NOTHING and... I also received 40k money bags in online as usual!
