GTA V... I used to play this game nonstop last year. It used to be pretty much my favourite game and the only game I bloody played. It was pretty fun messing around with mods and stuff in Story Mode and yes I did mod online but I got banned so yeah rip and after I got banned, I stopped playing it then eventually removed it from my library. 800 hours of playing gone basically. I was going to write a review on how this game is great and one of the best games Ive ever played but its just not anymore, the online updates arenow, the online community itself is pretty ik I was modding but Id go into a private session and do my not harass other players and blow everyone up. And seeing how modding is now banned fully... thats really One of the greatest modding communities of all time, dead. Yes we have GTA IV but GTA IV is broken on PC. So Rockstar failed to fix 1 GTA and decided to unfix the other GTA. Thanks s No I dont recommend this game, WatchDogs 2 is better, GTA IV is better... hell even LEGO Marvel Superheroes is better at this point.If Rockstar and Take Two decide to unban modding and make it so only online modding is banned, then Ill recommend the game. But for now, play something else. Unless you love vanilla story mode... which is... kinda weird but okay.
