from very beginning i was playing GTA, i only have so many hours on pc because i never had it on ps3, this game is great, but take two policy against mods... i wont accept it and this comes from hardcore player!What i wrote above havent changed in how much i play this game and love it, what changed is my opinion on the developer and such. mod policy changed for a better thankfully and now i can give this great game a positive review, if playing alone its hell of a fun but with friends its like from heaven to hell 3 times on rocket bikes. its a must have online game to have fun with friends.Its still worth playing it.
