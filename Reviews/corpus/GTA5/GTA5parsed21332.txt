ugh...  I ing loved this game!  Ya, they broke the modding communityfor now, and probably accidentally? in order to target online cheaters but its def not fair to say that made the game bad...The game is still very good and very fun... the world is still huge and beautiful and rich/dense...I buy very few games for full retail but I did with this one and never once regretted it...
