Singleplayer is great, has mods, whatever. The problem is the online.Online is a grindfest, not a boring one but grindy. The new DLC is always vehicles with a few upgrades each time.The organization system gets more complicated with every DLC, some have cooldowns, some dont, insurance is broken, some cars dont have an insurance system, spawn sites are changed randomly, its a mess.Rockstar The Devs have been taking peoples legitimately earned money on PC because at this point theyre assuming all PC players have modded cash in Online. Hours upon hours of peoples time wasted so R can try to sell more Shark Cards. Their support site is ignoring all tickets regarding the money sweeps, so that money is gone for good.Gamebreaking bugs are still in the game despite dozens of DLCs and patches, but any and all money glitches get patched within hours. Business model is horrifyingly bad for users, but perfect for the devs.Until R gets their  together, do NOT buy this game.
