Take Two are an awful company that are attempting to kill off modding for this game. They sent a ceaseanddesist to the developers of an important thirdparty tool for creating and running mods that also refuses to run mods when in multiplayer. I will not be supporting them in the future. Dont buy this game, and dont buy any of their future titles or DLC until this decision is reversed.
