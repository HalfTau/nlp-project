Great game with wonderful potential made progressively ier over the course of its lifespan due to more and more focus away from balance, pacing, and replayable features  and more and more on content designed to merely occupy the player or discourage fun/healthy play. By now, the pile of filler luxury content is awfully impressive, but the means of accessing the content is just as much a grind as what is actually done with the content once acquired.To have fun with this fantastic, fantastic game, you have to make your own fun  sometimes meticulously so. Now that the best examples of doing that are suppressed by developers who have time and time again stifled organic experience in this title... dont spend too much time in this one.
