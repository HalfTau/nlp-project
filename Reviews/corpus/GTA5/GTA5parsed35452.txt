Honestly, I always wanted to give the game a negative review, way before them removing the ability to play and make mods. Rockstar is known for trying to grab the most cash from its users. The customer service is horrible and the online experience is really wasted. The singleplayer mode is great, but its not enough for me to give a positive review.ripgta
