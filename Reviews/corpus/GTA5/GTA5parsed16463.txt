The story mode is really good, I love the characters and the missions, but after you done all the things in singleplayer there is nothing more to do. But we had the modding community on our side. But now there is absoulutley nothing to do when they banned all the mods. And dont even get me started on GTA online... They always put aout expensiveupdates and you just have to grind the game for even more hours and days. But if you dont want to grind you can just spend 80 on a sharkcard that gives you 8 million dollars ingame.. Which is ing nothing to be honest, the updaates on this game is so damn expensive so you arent even able to buy anything. I have had this game since the release, I have played it on ps3, ps4 and pc. So I probably have ATLEAST 1000HRS on this game combined. And thts why I have the confidence to write this review. not worth your money if you want to have all the things in this game.
