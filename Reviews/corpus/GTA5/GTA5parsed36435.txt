Rockstar Games and TakeTwo Interactive are perhaps the most greedy and selfish publishers ever. Due to the recent shutting down of OpenIV, I am reconsidering all purchases with them. You should too. They are trying to claim that OpenIV was allowing malicious content into online. This shows the fact they did not review OpenIV at all, and have pure disrespect for the modding community. OpenIV isnt capable of allowing people into online with malicious content. In fact, the program called Rage Plugin. which is most commonly used with OpenIV, wont allow you to even enter online. Rockstar is constantly trying to get money out of its players, and doing what they want instead of listening to the community. I am very happy that people are showing TakeTwo and Rockstar that their actions will have consequences. In this case, the most serious consequence Ratings in the tank, and decreased sells.
