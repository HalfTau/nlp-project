The enhanced visuals look fantastic, but that impresses most about Rockstars remaster is how every little addition builds up to make Los Santos an even more immersive open world than it was last year. GTA 5 can be depraved, amoral, sickeningly violent and childishly desperate to shock, yet its also one of the richest and deepest games ever made, with an ambitious threestranded storyline that holds so many disparate parts together. The lastgen version was a masterpiece. This nextgen version is better.
