Massive improvement over GTA 4 in many respects. Theres still plenty of room for improvement however.Likes Great variety of vehicles including bikes, cars, armoured vehicles, helis and aircraft Some of the vehicles sound pretty decent, and engine noise is linked directly to RPM rather than being a looping audio effect SaintsRow3 First person driving is really awesome, shame you cant change FOV though Mouse/Keyboard commands for driving are actually really good and ive not been using my controller at all Vehicle handling is much more fun imo than GTA4Dislikes Total lack of crouch button in exchange for horrible cover system, still cant go prone Clunky controls Sluggish and unresponsive movement animations, which I guess were created like that deliberately for immersion but suck for gameplay Combat is not the greatest enemies take way too much damage, including direct headshots, they always zerg rush you and theyre super accurate even when you or they are moving at high speed Radio stations are absolute trash imo  of course subjective but these ones are of very poor quality unless you like pop music. Vice City is vastly superior in this regard. Lack of custom character in single player, lack of female character in single player, lack of body customization in either single or online mode Police in this game are horrendous, theres far too many of them, they have infinite spawns including helicopters, they zerg rush you like absolute morons and they home in on  you when youre hiding yet should have no idea you were there.In summary this is well worth the money at the sale price. Decent story but youre forced to use the characters they designed and are forced to use specific characters to progress the storyline. Online is fun but kinda low population nowadays it seems.
