Runs terribly. Loading times are inexcusably long. Given an arbitrary delay so that Take Two could partake in the legendary triple dip and milk every possible generation of consoles and platforms. Shut down modding, presumably because theyre out of touch and thought it was an online cheating tool. Despite that, either unwilling or incapable of permanently deterring cheaters. The higherups have nothing but absolute giggling contempt for you and have used this game to find an equilibrium point between keeping customers willing to pay and charging for as much as possible. If youre cool with being the sub in an abusive relationship, at least buy a console version that will actually let you do that properly.
