They keep releasing free content updates, but in reality it means either grinding for a stupid amount of hours on missions that are horribly boring, or spending a stupid amount of money 100 USD  8 million in game currency  1, or maybe 2 cars in game.Not to mention theyre killing mod support for singleplayer. The game takes a long time to load on a good system. Lots of issues that have come to surface as of late. Dont support these scummy devs that literally are chasing money now.
