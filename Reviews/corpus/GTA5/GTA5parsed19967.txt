I have nothing but amazing things to say about this game.Purchase at your own risk. This game is amazing and theres just so much to do, see, explore, etc. but Rockstar is a very frustrating company to deal with. I can almost guarantee you will have updater issues, social club issues, run into hackers constantly, and feel like everything is just pushing you to.I myself havent had any terribly bad issues, neither on 360 or here. However, I will repeat.. purchase at your own risk.
