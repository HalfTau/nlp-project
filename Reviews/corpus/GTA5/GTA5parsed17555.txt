You can tell by my hours that I enjoyed this game, however on the 26th of august 2017, rockstar decided to rob me of 109318 in gta online. I dont know why they did it because that money was earned through hard work and time. Although the singleplayer is awesome I simply cannot recommend this game. Rockstars attempts to deal with hackers just lead to anyone having a fat bank account to lose their money even if they earned it or purchased shark cards. gg Rockstar
