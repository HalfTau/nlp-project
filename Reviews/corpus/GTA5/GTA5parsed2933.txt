This game would be a lot better for online game play if it didnt randomly put you into servers that cause you to lose your cars or weapons, it should allow you to pick a server and each server should be required to make a discription stating no personal cars or things like this is a killing server for those who wish not to just run around and kill but to also work on missions and such. other than that the game is ok if you can get past its random server t and all the server admins who cheat and dont give a damn about anyone else.
