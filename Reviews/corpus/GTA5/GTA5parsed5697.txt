Very unstable game. My PC exceeds all system requirements yet it still constantly freezes and crashes on the intro mission with the car stealing. Even in safe mode I cant get any further into the game. Im quite dissappointed because I was looking forward to the single player.Im going to attempt to refund it but Steam might not let me because I have a little over 2 hours.
