The Definitive openworld experience... RUINED BY CORPORATE NUMPTYS WHO SINGLE HANDEDLY DESTROYED THE GTA V MODDING SCENE. Im sure many like myself bought the game on PC and subsequently pumped hours upon hours of playtime into it purely because of the widely available OPENIV mod that has done far more to improve the shelflife of the game that shty car updates to the broken, rancid online. 0/10 until the Take2 VS OpenIV issue is resolved
