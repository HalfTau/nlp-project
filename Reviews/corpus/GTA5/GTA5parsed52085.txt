For me personally, the main reason I bought the PC version was for modding. Online is okay, but can get a little boring after a bit. Whether or not T2 was justified in their decision to ban modding is a discussion for the lawyers. And according to OpenIV they wont fight it, which is understandable. Hopefully T2 can come to some sort of terms and embrace the modding community. Until then, I have no real reason to play anymore.
