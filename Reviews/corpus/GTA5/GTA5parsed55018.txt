While GTA V is a GREAT PC port, running 60 fps all the time on my GTX 970 and the story is great and the multiplayer is fun... I CAN NOT recommend this game now for TakeTwo Interactives actions on shuting down OpenIV. I got GTA V on the PC for one thing, modding. TakeTwo Interactive I hope you realise what youve done. DONT BUY! REFUND IF YOU CAN! DONT SUPPORT THE PUBLISHER!
