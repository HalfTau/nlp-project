Never been my favorite game, but i have always enjoyed it. i have messed with modding the Story before and had lots of laughs. With Take two saying no more of what had me playing the game singleplayer at all Mods why should i even touch the game again.The online is fun but i run into hackers more then i care too and they do nothing about them even if you report them with video evidence. can recommend this game to anyone now.Just upgraded my computer also and after i bought a new monitor was going to see how this game looked at 2k ultra. now i wont.
