GTAV is an amazing game with fun multiplayer. so much to do, and see without mods. The fact that it has been alive and updating FOR FREE ssince 2013, should explain itself.  i for one am glad that the modding has been shut down, i enjoy roaming multiplayer and having fun! that all gets ruined when some assclown puts you inside of four bus stops in the shape of a swastika and fills it full of unkillable clowns because you were dominating him with the hood of your car.while it is sad that single player mod support is no longer available, im more than glad to get rid of it if it helps keep modders and hackers out of multiplayer. im sick of s flying around as an unkilable missile , or forcing the entire lobby into a parking lot , or having my weapons taken away and getting killed by some guy who looks like a christmas tree!If you want to mod, there are LITERALLY DOZENS of games that are all about that. Go play Gmod if you want that i play GTAV , to play GTAV.
