Awesome game ! Great single player campaign ! Lots of stuff to do in the online mode, coop and pvp modes are ace, not to mention the heists ! You might occasionally run into some hackers or modders online so just disconnect from the game lobby and rejoin. Dont mind the negative reviews, its only because the mods are not allowed on Rockstars games anymore.
