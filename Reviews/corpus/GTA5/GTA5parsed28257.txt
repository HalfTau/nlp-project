Rockstar seems to have redeemed themselves somewhat after the whole modding fiasco with TakeTwo interactive. However, the game still has an immense amount of problems surrounding their online moderation. Countless players are punished or banned simply for playing in the vicinity of a cheater, reasons that are well out of their control. This problem has not been addressed even after the PC version has been out for two years.
