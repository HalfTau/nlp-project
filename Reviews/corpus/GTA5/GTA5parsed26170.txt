HACKERS everywhere.Motorcycles fly like jets and shoot like them, tiny pistols shoot rockets, this is disrespectful these players are allowed to ruin the game for everyone else onlineI come from the PS4 version where I spent hundreds of dollars for in game content and the game has no hackers there.On PC however the game is completely ruined.To make matters worse, YOU CAN NOT DO CHARACTER TRANSFERS FROM A PLATFORM TO ANOTHER!!!!!WHAT ARE YOU DOING ROCKSTAR, ARE YOU MAD? DO YOU NOT LIKE MONEY? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAAAAAT? Rockstar, youre now just as disrespectful as these hackers that ruin the game, because you let them and screwed honest people over, thanks.Anyways now that I let that out, I want to say if youre ONLY interested in the story mode, then sure, go for it. But that is like paying and getting 1/2 the game.
