The amount of greed Rockstar/Taketwo demonstrates here makes EA seem like Buddha in comparison. This game makes 300M annually 4 years after its release, is the 4th highest selling game of all time, yet Rockstar said publicly that they dont think they are earning enough money. So they banned modding for singleplayer to incentivize people to play online and buy more sharkcards microtransaction.
