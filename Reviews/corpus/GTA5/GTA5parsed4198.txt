This game will crash no matter what settings you put it on. I dreamed of playing this game and it really let me down. I will never buy another rockstar game ever again. I never tried the online mode because I did not buy it to play online. I bought it to play it in single player and it wasnt even about the story. I just wanted to roam the city. After 17 hours of gameplay, it crashed 20 times.
