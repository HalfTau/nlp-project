Maybe a okay single player game but terrible terrible online game thats so full of modders and hackers that literally 29 out of 30 game sessions had hackers in it, and take two nor rockstar gives one bit of crap that this goes on only thing they care about are the modders that give free money to the players ,those are the only ones rockstar and take two care about but not enough to use soemthing liek punk buster.i really cant state that enough how little this company cares for its clients or return buisness which they will nvr get from me ever again any and all product from rockstar or take two is instantly on my boycott list .they are so bad that they even made it next to impossible to acces their game support for complaints glitches and hackers I mean literally after i sent in a recording of some one hacking i could never acces their suport ever again links that used to link directly to the support page suddenly nvr worked after.then there are the stupidly boring grinds that they force u to go through in order to get something to protect yourself from the many jet spammers all in order to sell u shark cards which is even more  20 bucks more a 1 million in game credits that cant  even buy u a decent in game car . then there are glitches and errors that been there for months music volume in the loading menu cant be changed no matter that u turned off music period the game will still play music and will play that music at a volume leverl thats over 9000 liek they are trying to break your head phomes or speakers and what worse is that those loadign time can literally take 10 minutes before it loads u into a online session just t have it come back saying cant join online session due to error so instead taking u back to the main menu it loads u into single player game taking even more of your time to then have to go through the whole online loadig screen again
