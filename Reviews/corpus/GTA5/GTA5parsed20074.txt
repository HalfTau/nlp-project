If you run Discord or other apps that layover inside the main game, you may get banned. The game is not worth the price, the customer support is absolutely terrible, and they have an automated banning system which knocks out a lot of modders, but regular guys get mixed up in it all the time. No appeals, no money back. The shark cards are extreme rip offs, and to be honest, I dont blame people for wanting to mod such an awful game. Nobody should ever have to pay 100 in real cash for a measly 8 million in game currency.Now on that note, I just found a community called gtaN Grand Theft Auto Network, rather than Online in which people can build and host their own servers. Ive just recently checked it out so I cant say much more than that, but at least it gives this repulsive game some light... Far, far, far away from Rockstar.
