average campaign, very short missions, not as much combat as previous GTA games, GTA online sucked. Overall game takes about 19 hours to complete and the majority of that 19hours is spent travelling between missions for the different characters. Still I had fun so wont give a negative review and i liked the first person view they added but still this game wasnt the best and certainly not the best GTA game produced so far.
