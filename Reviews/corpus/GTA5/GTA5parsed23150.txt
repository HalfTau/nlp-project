Literally one of the best games ever created, in my opinion. Story mode is great and online mode is even better.I played GTAV on PS3 since the release date. I passed story mode more then 3 times and I still enjoy playing it. On PS3 I got to level 200 in online mode.Finally I got this game for PC and Im loving every single moment of it.I definitely recommend this game, you will never regret buying it.
