Game freezes in loading screens 15 of the time. No excuse for this in 2017.Also the new content Rock Star releases is always garbage time sink. You get nothing accomplished and spend your time trying to make money and get hardly any for all your hard work. They gear this game so blatently towards buying money instead of earning it in game. The new content where you buy a corporation and sell containers is a crock of s. Almost impossible to actually get anything delivered becasue Rock Star does nothing about hackers and allows you to be hijacked easily while trying to get it to buyer. They have to start banning grievers and hackers. They dont care because they want people to buy money in game to get vehicles. Every day you will feel like you didnt accomplish a thing.
