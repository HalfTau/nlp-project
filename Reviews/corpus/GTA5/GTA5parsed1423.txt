So many modders and hackers. Youll find at least one hacker/modder in one session. And modders in GTA 5 is all mighty. They are not just invincible, but they can teleport to you, make you kill yourself, control you, blind you, hide your interface etc. I think Rockstar doesnt care. They shouldve done something about it long time ago. There are more hackers/modders in GTA 5 than ever. Theres something that bothers me even more. You need to complete 45 missions before you do actual heist. These missions take forever because they usually require 4 people to play. People dont want to play boring unrewarding missions which you need to complete to do a heist so they keep leaving after seeing which mission it is and you get stuck in the waiting room for a long time. Even if you luckily get 3 other people to play, if one person leaves during the game, youll have to gather people all over again and there are a lot of trolls. I think I spent most time in the waiting room of GTA 5. There are many glitches too. The one that bothers me the most is infinite loading screen. It happens once in four times. Its a great game but these things ruin the game.
