Now as you probably have figured from other reviews posted Take Two has just basically killed and buried the GTA V modding scene, by sending a ceaseanddesist letter to the former popular modding tool OpenIV.  The creators of OpenIV were basically forced to take down to download.Yes, they could have taken it to court, and probably would have won the case, but to do that to restore a status quo would be a waste of their time.So, youre probably asking what does this mean to me? If you had no intentions of modding the singleplayer content probably nothing, since online mods aka hacks did not have anything to do with OpenIV and OpenIV was specifically designed to only work in offline and to automatically disable online functionalities, if you had mods.On the other hand, if you had hoped that you could do basically anything extra in offline, say bye to that, with OpenIV taken from us there will be a large migration time to another modding tool and I think many modders wont or cant put the time and effort to basically rebuild their mods. So at least for the time being you cant be a part of LSPD or participate in ANY other wonderful things that the modding community had made.Lastly, I would like to thank all previous/current/future If there will be any modders for their wonderful efforts to make this game a better and a longer experience. The time you spent on your mods is invaluable, but rest knowing that me and many other individuals in community have enjoyed your creations.Sorry for any grammar and/or spelling mistakes
