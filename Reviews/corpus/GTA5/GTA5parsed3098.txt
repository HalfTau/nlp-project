Grand Theft Auto V is the definition of a lovehate relationship. Its one of those games that would greatly benefit from a neutral recommendation. This game does a lot of things right, and a lot of things wrong. Ill be discussing the single player portion and the online portion in seperate sections, as at this point they are nowhere near the same game anymore.
