Ultimately this game was a disappointment. The engine is more impressive than ever graphically and feels great to shoot and drive all around the perfectly sized map but everything else falls short of earlier titles. The online portion uses dlc designed for story mode but ripped and moved over to maximize profit. This game has made me lose trust in Rockstar, and view them as bloodsucking tightwads that hate their own community and modders. Protip if youre going to purchase this title and play the multiplayer, just mod your account to get around the exorbinate pricesthat skyrocket every few weeks.
