As somebody that enjoys mods like the rest of this community that has been responding this way, they have this response coming.There is a fine line between mods and hacks, modding is adding stuff to the game that Rockstar havent added or wont. This gives the community a nice way of having flexability with their purchases without hurting others. The mods are said to be one of the biggest drives for this game, and in the end it probably is. I remember buying GTA IV just to play the mods, and I bought this game wanting to play some of those mods if they got updated.Coming from another perspective, I program a lot. I started to get into programming mods for GTAV, and it may have been rather annoying at times I really enjoyed adding things and changing things that I never really liked or thought I could make better myself. The ability to do that made me have so much fun and try to get other people to come and play my mods and see how they worked for them.Basically your little mod crackdown has ed up your community and its only going to get worse if you keep going. Listen to your community, modders arent the ones that are ruining the multiplayer, we are the ones that just want to add stuff for fun. Hackers on the other hand, they are the ones to be worried about.
