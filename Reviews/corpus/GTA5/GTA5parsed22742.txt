I have played gta online for over 600 hours now and feel like I am ready to give you a review.I will only make a list with pros and cons to make it fast.ProsGrafikStoryConshighly overpriced vehicles a jet with a golden color costs 10 000 000rpbad connectionno methods to make a lot of moneythe dlcs cant be called new content because what Rockstar does is releasing the same oldover and over again just in an other form.broken car phisics that are not getting fixed the fastest cars became one of the slowest with the new updatebugs that have been around since the beginning of the game are not getting fixed but if a new moneyglitch is around it is fixed within a few daysto little freedom u cant store police vehicles in your garage or buy themif you are playing alone it is almost impossible to find good players for heists and if you found players after waiting 30 minutes sometimes will be kicked out of the lobby and have to wait for players again.CEO system is just garbage and joining a CEO organasation ist not worth it at all.highly overpriced shark cards that should NOT buy under any circumstances!!! I would rather recommend you getting money from a modder and risking beeing banned for that.I cant recommend the game right now expacially now as rockstar wants to make modding illegal. Even using mods in Singleplayer is forbidden. Rockstar is just milking the game with new DLCs. All they care about is getting more money at the end of the month but not what the fans want. I am sure new rockstar games wont be any different if they dont change the way they work.PLEASE DONT BUY THIS GAME!
