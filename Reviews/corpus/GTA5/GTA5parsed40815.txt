This is a very bad game. OpenIV is NOT a mod. It is a tool. You are going to be blamed by the entire community. I mean look at your raitings. They have died. You have lost the PC community now. Good luck with the rest of your games. I am not buying any more games from Rockstar until they break apart from there publisher, Take Two Interactive. This is an entire money making scheme. Good luck GTA V. You have officialy died. Now its time to go back to the source engine. This is the reason people bought the PC version of this game. It was to Mod it. just like they did back in the GTA San Andreas and GTA IV games. The game itself is very old now and the DLCs that come out for it now are just stupid. This is a money making scheme and you wont admit it. Enjoy your dead fanbase. Oh just to note, I bought GTA V about 7 times over the past 2 years due to you morons banning my account every time I used FiveM / Five Reborn. I will continue to play GTA V but only on the FiveM community.
