Not really sure how to review GTA 5, but here I goI had 100 hours on gta on disk before I got the steam version so calm down when looking at my hours.GTA online is the only reason the community is still thriving to this day. There are so many new releases that make it so interesting to play. The downside to that is that with the new releases, comes overpowering weapons and vehicles. There is no way to stop these vehicles unless you have one yourself, or find another lobby.There are HEAPS of modders in online. This can make the game 150 better or 150 worse. Normally its good because they give out money, which can be very useful when EVERYTHING IS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.Moving onto the money part, EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE! I would day im experienced in GTA now and dont struggle with the money side of it, but newer players will find it soooooo hard to get decent vehicles and weapons. Dont give into buying shark cards!Overall GTA can be a very fun and addictive game for you, or you hate it due to modders and the whole absolutely everything is expensive problem.Buy the game and im sure you wont regret it! Dont expect to get rich fast, it takes time!
