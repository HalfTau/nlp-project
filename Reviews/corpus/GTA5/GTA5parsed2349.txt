My friends had bought this game and thought it would be great if I did too , Luckily I bought it on sale soim not as bummed as someone else who spend 60 Dollars on it So I had finished downloading the game and then once I had created an account and verified everything , therefore registering the account , I attempted to sign in , then this message popped up We could not create a sign in token. Please try again later. If the error persists contact the rockstar support website.Which happens to be no help at all There are no videos on how to fix this. To run this short , I might not have played the game but this message never goes away when I try to sign in , I simply cannot reccomend this game.If someone has any idea on the fix of this bug , please add me and let me know so I didnt waste all my money.
