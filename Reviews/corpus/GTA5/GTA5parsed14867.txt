GTA Online... While at times it may be fun and lets face it who hasnt listened to Chakra Attack, its really likes to put a big F U to your face at times and with the measly money coming from missions its a punch then a whisper that says  buy our shark cards welp. So with that said it is a game where if your bored and what to be that crazy driver we all wanted to be then play it but other than that its just grinding for chump change and RP.
