What can I say? Its Grand Theft Auto in its most ultimate form...so far. If you havent played this by now, youre either a young child or just plain oblivious. Great story, fantastic characters, expansive world, and stellar graphics that create a truly immersive experience. I cant think of any reason you wouldnt play this game unless your parents dont allow you to, but you should tell them to ing reconsider cause its a god damn classic.
