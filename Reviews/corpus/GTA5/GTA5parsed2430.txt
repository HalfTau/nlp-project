Great game right off the back, i have the Xbox one version of this game and now i own it for the pc. This is probably the best GTA game ever next to San Andreas. With awsome multiplayer experience and an intense campaign makes this game one of my favorite GTA titles. Bailing, missions, funnycharacters, awsome cars, easter eggs all over the place is what make GTA 5 an awsome game.
