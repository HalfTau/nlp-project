Awesome game put about 80 hours into it and loved it. Upon logging in today 9/12/17 I got a screen saying that I was permanently banned. I do have a history of 1 ban due to hacking but when I got banned I removed everything that was hacking related and didnt ever hack again. Programs that may have triggered false ban Discord and Geforce Experience. Rockstar support is terrible for dealing with bans because they basically do nothing to help and now I cant ever play again.
