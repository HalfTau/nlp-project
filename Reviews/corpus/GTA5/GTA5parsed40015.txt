I Love GTA Online, but the way you stopping mod for Single Player. I don,t give a sht. Mods bring us the way what we want. Example i love planes but there are no plane simulator who have physics and handling like you mod in GTA V. Even in GTA V i can do Pugachev Cobra with my Sukhoi Su35. And now the creator stopped the production.  you R and Take Too whatsoever
