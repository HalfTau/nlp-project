Hey so its a good game dont get me wrong my friends and I play it off and on and have a blast.  However recently it has become impossible to play with modders who run around and just ruin the fun for everyone else.  Oh delivering cars sorry im going to put my tank in the way.  Oh getting supplies? sorry im going to teleport to your bunker and kill you with my infinit health.  Sorry rockstar i really like your game but honestly i just cant play it anyore.
