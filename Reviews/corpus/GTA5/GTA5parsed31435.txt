I used to love rockstar games...I was a huge fan of GTA series and have played since first game came out, and bought every...single...one...I realy ejoyed the GTAV also, but in the light of recent events....the light is permenatly shut off ,and i intend to pull out the bulb, smash it against the stone , and burn the electric cables so i will never have an idea of supporting rockstar and taketwo ever ...again.In the name of modding comunity that lifted you to stars and brought PC platform up as high as posible even when you decided to put PC players to second plan by late releases...we supported you, a huge...ing...mistake.So in the light of reacent events   YOU!
