Game 79, if you were to buy everything in 1 DLC with shard cards it would cost over 1000 dollars. You see the problem here? this coupled with low payouts and very high start up costs to make money in multiplayer feels very wrong. They call it free DLC youd just have to play till youre 100 to afford it within multiplayer.
