Warning to anybody buying this expecting to transfer your character over from xbox or playstation...2k and Rockstar have disabled the feature indefinitely, so now you have to GRIND through from the very bottom with NO money not even the 200,000 they originally gave to players to get them started. Shark Cards wont transfer as well.Rockstar claims it disabled the transfer feature to curb the sale of modded accounts but its clearly another cash grab designed to get returning players annoyed enough with having to restart from nothing, incentivizing them to buy shark cards. This ladies and gents, is 2ks Recurrent Consumer Spending model in action.Theyve got one hand in the cookie jar and now theyre trying to shove the other in as well. Shocker. Cant wait to see how 2k ruins Red Dead Redemption 2.
