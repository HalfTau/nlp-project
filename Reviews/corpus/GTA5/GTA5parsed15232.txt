This is one of my favorite games to date. The game right now is in a weird place. In online there could be a lobby full of modders while on the other you could be completely fine. I know a lot of people have just lost some money that they say that they earned legit and that is discouraging, but I think this game still deserves a chance if you havent bought it yet. I have not finished the singleplayer story yet bet I am having fun with it so far.
