Im a casual GTA5 player. I log in once every 6 months or so, get some laughs with my buddies for a couple hours, and log off. See all the awesome additional content Rockstar keeps showcasing? Ill never get to try any of it. I want to..but its locked behind an ingame paywall. This game is not meant for the 85 monfri types. You have to sink A LOT of time by my definition in order to build up enough money to experience the whole game. OR shell out some of your hard earned  to skip all of that. Im dropping a downvote because Free 2 Play elements do not belong in a full priced AAA title... Getting a little tired of feeling like I am being nickel and dimed for a game I already bought years ago.
