60 of GTA online is spent in loading screens. That is, if you want to actually getdone to get fun weapons and vehicles.Its not due to bad computer specs, servers are just really bad, and sometimes youll get dropped from servers out of nowhere. Tried and tested among all my friends, most of them have better specs yet they have just as much problems as I do.Also, the grouping system is quite ed, or should I say the lack thereof? You can play one mission with your pals, then one of four things will happen1. One of you guys will drop out of online for no apparent reason.2. Youll be put in a group with other players, no one in your crew having host privileges so you cant even kick the unwanted out.3. Someones game will crash.4.1. You all try to go back to free play mode but you all end up in different sessions so some of you will have to sit in a 510 minute long loading screen just to get back together.4.2. You will end up in the same session again, thankfully, but someones game crashed and they have to wait an extra 15 minutes to both start up the game and then have to exit a lobby because the game doesnt realize you want to play with your friends so you got put in a different session and have press Home and specifically tell your game that you want to get put in a game with your friends.Also theres the issue which Im having right now Ive tried to start up the game 3 times in a row, all three times I ended up in 10 minute loading screens, I.E. server doesnt connect me. Then even if I get connected I can only do one mission and Ill get booted again. And in the offchance that you actually get connected to a server, youll have been autokicked for AFK because you alttabbed the game because SERIOUSLY the loading screens are so long and you get bored.Seriously, Rockstar, fix REAL designated servers, MMO servers perhaps? Youve got the resources to keep pumping out fantastic updates in an amazing game, but whats the point if the players cant play your game?
