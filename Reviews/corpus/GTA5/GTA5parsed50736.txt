This game used to have a singleplayer campaign with great replayability. Used to.But then Take Two Interactive decided to legally threaten the developers of a popular free mod under false pretenses. A mod which had been out for almost a decade.I can not in good conscience recommend anyone to buy this game now. If it is on sale for 10 bucks, sure. Otherwise  STAY AWAY! Oh, and Online is infested with hackers, so it is not worth it.
