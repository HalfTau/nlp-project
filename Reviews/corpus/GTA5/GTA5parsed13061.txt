This is my favorite game but rockstar never fixed the stutter issue on 4gb ram. I can only play up to 15 mins of no stuttering and with 3040 fps after that it falls down to a bad 525 fps which is unplayable. They didnt even change the minimun system requirements. i have to upgrade to 8gb ram in order to play this smoothly.
