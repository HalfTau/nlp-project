With the cease and desist letter Take Two, GTAVs publisher, sent to OpenIV, the end game for GTAVs story mode is the horribly borring. Without OpenIV, mods that added content to the single player are no longer able to be installed. If you were planning to buy GTA to mod the single player, that is no longer an option.If you were planning to buy GTA for the Online mode, if you can look past the grinding and high prices it is a all around OK experience.
