This game is so good, I dont even think I can put it into words. The gameplay, the story, the characters, the graphics they all come together. Its one of my alltime favorites.Here are my only complaintsRockstars customer service is pretty bad. For the most part, I almost never have problems with GTA Online. But, every time I do end up having to call the help line, I either get hung up immediately after finally connecting with an associate, or I get put on hold for 3 hours.All in all, Grand Theft Auto V is a great game. I would totally recommend it to a friend....Its not family friendly, though. Dont show your parents.XD
