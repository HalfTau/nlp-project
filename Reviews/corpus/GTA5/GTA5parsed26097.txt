I have to say, i hate how this game is so good and so bad at the same time.My final review has to be negative as this game has been aimed at forcing people to eitherGrind for hours to make small amounts of money.OrBuy extremely expensive shark cards in game credits.OrHackI preordered this game, thinking it was going to be a fun and easy experience.But it feels more like a full time job to get anything you want.
