Played since pre ordered so way over 4 years, and ive got alot of nice memories from this game, the cars are awesome, the story is the best one yet and i love the gun play but the sometimes the movement isnt the best but this is totally worth buying, this game will be here for atleast 2 more years until gta 6 comes out so if u dont have it and want it, buy it if u can!if u see some moron that doesnt even have the game say itsdont listen to them! this game is awesome, look at my hours! ive enjoyed it for this long, so can u. i recommend that u have a good pc for this game to experience it to its fullest! a gtx 1050 4 gbs will be just fine! and atleast 8 gb ram but other than that ur set to go!i hope this helped your decision about buying this game!
