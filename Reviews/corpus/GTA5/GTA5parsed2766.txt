ok never thought the day that i write a review for gta v would come but here it is, ill post somethings that ive noticedgreat story,smooth gameplay,good controls for the most part but boats,planes,and helicopters control like youre trying  to control a hyperactive kid with a piece of candy sure youll be able to get him where you want but it wont be easyok now after praising this game for stuff that is necessary its now time to tear up its bumGTA V tries cunningly to hedge its bets by swapping between 3 protagonists in the hope youll at least like one of them  but that smack of gamble is fallacy to me its entirely possible to flip 3 coins and have them all come up tails or for two to come up tails and one going in your catsgiving it bowel cancerFranklin is the closest to being the protagonistprotagonist cause he does the standard gta straight man thing where he rolls his eyes at every random weirdo as the best way to put a contract hit but follows their every command like a passive aggressive husbandMichael at the other hand is a very active aggressive husband who quit bank robbin to get more time with his family screaming at them and breaking thingsAnd theres Trevor who seems to be an attempt to represent the standard mode of behaviour of a gta player and that is hes a filthy immoral psychotic with the innate like ability of an incontinent honey badger in a house kitchen an hour before the health departments inspectionand theyre not likable in my opinion not because the kill people andlord knows i cant throw stones in that department at least not until i clear the basement out,theyre just poorly written and inconsistent which may reflect the fact theyre being written by enough people to choke a sarlacc,Franklin just comes out as whiny,Michael realizing that all his ill gotten wealth hasnt brought him happiness seems to think the logical solution is to get more ill gotten wealthbut having all that said the games still pretty good and you should probably buy it
