Beautifull singleplayer game with extremely awful online multiplayer experience. Unmemorable online game rules, almost pay to win microtransactions and most of all cheaters.You can be convicted of cheating even without cheating. Cheaters are using your name to kill players and frame you with that. Aimbots and the wallhacks are the least problem of this game. This game is extremely easy to cheat.If you want a game with good story, buy this game. Better on sale. But be careful with the multiplayer.
