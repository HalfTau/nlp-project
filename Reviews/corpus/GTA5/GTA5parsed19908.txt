At this point I can only be angry at rockstar for their online support. Dont make an online game if you arent going to do itcorrectly. I mean, people being banned for being in the same session as a hacker? And on top of that you decide to wipe out players that you have any suspicion of hacking, as well asnot allowing you to even try to get your account back. Youll get on the phone with rockstar support and they will be like, Hello, this is rockstar technical support how may I help you? Then you say something like, Hello, I would like to ask about my players ban and would like to understand why you banned my account Even in a nice and polite way Depending on the person you talk to, they will be completely angry at you for no reason. Another issue that really makes a lot of these innocent people mad is when you post on a forum and you have these stuck up people that think they are too good for anything that tell you that you shouldnt even be playing the game and that rockstar doesnt ban people for no reason. Technically, there is a reason, but that reason is completely  and it pisses me off to see that rockstar allows this crap to happen. I just would like to let anyone know who is looking at this review, if you even had the time or interest to read it all, to take these words into consideration and dont fund these moneygreedy scumbags even if you think the game is cool or whatever. People need to see this and understand that rockstar may make cool games, but they really need to be hit hard in the support industry to try and make a change.
