The primary reason I bought the pc version of this game was to be able to use mods.  Take Two doesnt seem to give a .  Online is a grindy dumpster fire unless you pay for Shark Cards which I would never even remotely consider doing, especially now, so I really only play SP these days.  Unfortunately, Take Two doesnt really even want anyone doing that, considering that SP has missed out on quite a bit of content that made its way to MP vehicles and customization mostly.  Most likely due to the fact that in SP, they cant charge people real money for in game items.  To make it even worse, these vehicles that get added to the MP side of the game cant even be spawned in with cheats/trainers.  If you try to spawn them in SP they immediately vanish.  The only way to access these vehicles in SP is through the use of mods.Sending a CD to OpenIV really only serves to show that Take Two doesnt want people to have fun with this game anymore, they just want people to give them more money.
