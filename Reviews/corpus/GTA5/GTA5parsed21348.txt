Once upon a time when I was a wee lad I bought GTA 5 for Xbox 360.This was a great adventure, it was a brand new game and a brand new me driving over female workers and having sex with Chop.However, my life took a turn for the worse and I suddenly became highly engaged in PC gaming. It overtook my life, to say the least. I left behind GTA 5 and my Xbox, exploring my new PC gaming adventures...But then I remembered that this beauty of a game is too on the PC! I jumped with excitement because there mustve been a million updates, so many new possbilities.Now that I own this game, its taken over my life again. The pros are that Im back to killing female workers , parachuting my car, and going on drug runs..The Cons? What the heck is up with those shark cards am I right? Lower those prices, dudes.
