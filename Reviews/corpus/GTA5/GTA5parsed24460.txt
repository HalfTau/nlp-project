Grand Theft Auto 5 can be described as one of two things either really good, or exceptionally bad forcing you to drive your fist through your moniter when a 12 year old goes trigger happy with some missiles the best fix for this is to just quit and pretend that you did not just die 10 times in 1 minute. It all comes down to how you choose to play, who you play with and what you spend your time ingame doing.If you enjoy the story mode, great! No issues there. If you want to play online with your friends, then you need to make sure that you do not grind ceo or biker warehouse missions with unpleasant players that want to make waste of your 8 hour long session. Simply avoid all of the toxic and salty players which is over 90 of all gta online then you will be fine. Also watch out for the hackers. They offer money that will get you banned.
