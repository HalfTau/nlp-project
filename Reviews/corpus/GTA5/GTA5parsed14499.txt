the single player was perfect without a doubt  it was 10/10 for me , But the multiplayer on the other hand had alot of issues .the idea behind multiplayer is good but the microtransaction and the prices are stupid .basically if you want to have fun roaming in the city you need to buy stuff with real life moneyyes you can manage with a cheap car and play 24/7 to make money if you dont have a life not even a gamer life cause a pro gamer makes money playing different games . selling products is a nightmare and its not worth it . heists  have the worst matchmaking ive ever seen in any matchmade game. since rockstar doesnt develope any single player dlc and the multiplayer is microtransaction based. i think the game has changed and its not a quality game anymore .Microtransaction is a Disease when a game gets into it i stop playing it .since the game is more about multuiplayer im gonna have to say i dont like the game anymore .
