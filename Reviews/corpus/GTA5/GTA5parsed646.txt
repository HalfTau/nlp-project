The game is poorly optimized underwhelming and overall a stupid hassle to deal with rockstars DRM launcher that  itself if you are forced to play the game offline for a day. hackers will ruin your fun online by harrassing you or your team with instant killing. and thats before the new i win button that can be easily purchased to rain on someomes day when you lack the skill to take someone out yourself. overall dont touch it its trash.
