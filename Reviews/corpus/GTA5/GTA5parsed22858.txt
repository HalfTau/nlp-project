This is  a great game with a wonderful story. The online can actually reward hard work if the player is willing to actually spend time on playing the game. Modders are a problem, but they can mostly just be ignored. I would highly recomend a controller and actually looking through the settings to maximize your play. This is the multiplayer game that my friends and I play the most. As long as you do not mod in online you do not get banned, put some work in.
