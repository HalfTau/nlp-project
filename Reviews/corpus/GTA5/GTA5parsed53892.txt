As a person who never even bothered with the single player, and generally dont touch mods, because I have little interest in altering the base experience of a game. I must in good conscience comdemn Take2s actions regarding OpenIV, and the crushing of the single player modding scene it is currently doing.Do not give this company, no game purchases, and no microtransactions, Boycott this company. They dont care about you, they view you as and I quote Wood that can still be chopped. You are nothing more than a wallet.
