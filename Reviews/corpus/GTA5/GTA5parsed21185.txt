Yeah, lets face the fact that if they didnt fear a financial burden, they wouldnt be apologizing to anyone. Theyre not listening to the community or doing whats right. Theyre protecting their product. GTA online is designed for money, completely and utterly. It is completely pay to win, and everything else is a grind. You can blame the company, but the consumer is the reason this stupid bullsht keeps occuring, all over the gaming industry. They wouldnt be making money if you didnt waste your time buying fictional shark cards. After the story, I dont play this game online unless its a private lobby with friends.Rockstar and Take Two are not holding a good ratio of income VS output. Online mode is very basic, it is extremely boring. It is not what we were promised. Also, the DLC theyve released is the most basic BS, Ive seen more impressive stuff made in garrys mod. This reminds me of the morons who sht their pants over Valves CSGO update where they added defuse wires. Its easy to make, and computer illiterate people get excited, because they have no idea how little effort it took to create.When you support malformed business practices, youre making a statement that they will be tolerated. It is successful, and will continue to be successful, as long as the idiot consumer lets it occur.As for the hackers, you get the free money scripts from the same websites you get Godlike cheats from. Put 2 and 2 together.
