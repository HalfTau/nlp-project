This game is the quintessential must have in any gamers inventory. It retains all the key elements of a good grand theft auto game while also introducing a vast and spacious open world filled with fun activities in single player and multiplayer. The multiplayer mode included with this amazing piece of art is absolutely amazing. Free updates by the developer really shows that they do care about you and i, the customer, and in my opinion the customer is always right. But of course lets not forget the amazing addition of the single player campaign. The story is filled twist and turns at every corner leaving you in awe at what you are experiencing. But of course, Rockstar, being the pioneers that they are, decided to drop a HUGE bomb on us and provide THREE yes i said it THREE playable characters in the single player campaign. We as the player experience the hardships of a broken man with a broken marriage, a white trash piece of and the best character of the trio, the hard working african american man. We are taken on a journey of self discovery, dissapointment and heartache guided by the amazing characters created by the gaming gods Rockstar. Although i do say we are the players of this amazing journey we are the ones being played into this realistic world that i personally wish i was in. This game is a MUST HAVE but i can also say i cannot recommend this game to anyone not even my worst enemy. This game has taken up my whole life and i am planning suicide now. Thumbs Up
