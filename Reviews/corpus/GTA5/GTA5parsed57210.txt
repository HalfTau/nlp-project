Rockstar and Take Two have treated the PC community as an afterthought and less those on consoles. First we have to wait ages to get the game here, then they take away single player modding tools for no good reason. Sure, take on those hackers who make the online play difficult. I have encountered them. It is no fun. But people playing in the single player space have no effect on those in the online space. Makes no sense.Plus, there has been no single player expansions. GTA4 had Gay Tony and Lost and the Damned. GTA5 gets new gameplay modes for the online. I would gladly pay for single player, but am pretty much done with the online regardless of what new modes you add. Nothing worthwhile since the heists.
