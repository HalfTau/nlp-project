Jumping on this hate train is an easy choice at this point. I stood in line for midnight release, bought 3 copies 360,ps4,pc and have probably in total spent close to 1000 hours in this game. I love this series, but everything fun about GTA V is being ruined by some s that forgot what gaming is about.Modding is now a core part of gaming, especially in open world titles. Youre just being stubborn and ignorant if you cant see this. Its more likely that greed has just taken over and Take Two is unable to reason beyond what theyre accountants tell them.Shame on Take Two. You created something great, just let us enjoy it. Youve already made rediculous profits off us on this title, what more do you want from us before we can just have fun?
