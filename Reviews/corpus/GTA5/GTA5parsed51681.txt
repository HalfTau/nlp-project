When you continually udate only the online version of the game, make prices astronomical, mission payouts are laughable, and never update the single player portion of the game then ban mods that make the game actually enjoyable still.... youre just a greedy company that doesnt give aabout your customers.Screw Rockstar and TakeTwo Interactive.My playtime is only low because my PC was gone for a while, have a few hundred hours between Xbox1 and PS4
