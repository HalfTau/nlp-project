Ive been a Rockstars fan since GTA San Andreas came out, but Im utterly disappointed on how greedy and anticonsumer they have been with GTA Online.Even though the singleplayer mode in this game is amazing, the online mode has been destroyed over the years by the greed of Rockstar Games and Take 2 Interactive. Dont get me wrong, there is a lot of fun stuff to do online, specially if you have friends to tag along, but most of the content that has been added over the years is blocked behind paywalls that leave the player two choices Either you grind your life away like this is WoW, or you pay for the incredibly overpriced Shark Cards to enjoy the new content. Not to mention that the game is plagued by hackers and griefers that will only make the already tedious task of grinding a living hell.I still recommend the singleplayer, but you should definitely stay away from online.
