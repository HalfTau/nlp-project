Bought this game just to add nice cars and graphics. Modding is part of fair use. So, thanks for violating my rights Take Two, I will never buy another product from you again.EDITRockstar/Take Two have seen the light and lifted the ban, therefore, I will change this to a thumbs up review. Please respect the community, we are more than happy to work with companies like Take Two/Rockstar in resolving issues such as online harrassment, and malicious mods, there is no need to take down a centralized modding tool under suspicion that it is the culprit, we will be more than happy to blow the whistle on the real culprits, the online external trainers and such that never should have existed in the first place.Thank you for resolving this, and have a nice day.
