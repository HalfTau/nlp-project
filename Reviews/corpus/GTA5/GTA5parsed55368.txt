An incredibly fun game, ruined by corporate greed. Take Two Interactive, the publisher of Grand Theft Auto V, has declared an allout war against the modding community of this game, by delivering a Cease and Desist to the creators of OpenIV, a modding tool which allows people to have creative liberty over the singleplayer of the game. Without mods, the singleplayer aspect of the game loses much of its value, which is very much intentional on the part of Take Two. This greedy corporation is destroying the value of single player to force us into GTA Online, which, while fun, is incredibly hard to make progress in. Money making is slow, and every ingame purchase costs many millions of dollars. And the worst bit is the microtransactions, the cost of which is insanely overinflated. They charge US100 for 8 million ingame. Corporate greed has ruined the best aspect of one of my favorite games, and until Take Two backs down on their attack on the modding community, I cannot recommend spending your hardearned money on this game.This review is fully protected under the First Amendment of The United States Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech and of the Press.
