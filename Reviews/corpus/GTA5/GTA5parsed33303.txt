Modders pour their love and time into games and only a handful of developers appreciate them anymore.  Valve, Bohemia, and Bethesda are a few examples of developers that support modding they all have a lot of old games that have healthy communities today.Take Two and Rockstar have repeatedly attempted to hinder modding of GTA as if it has hurt their sales which of course it has only helped sell the game.  Take Two apparently wants to kill modding altogether, which makes me think they also want to kill their game.  Its working.
