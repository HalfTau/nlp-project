Yeah I am just barely slimming through on a no here, I wish I could put yes but this 59.99 is just a bit of a pain.Pros! Top 3!1. The Game Devs keep adding2.The Campaign is GIANT though Iwish it didnt have to be layed to those 3 characters.3. The Multplayer has many players and an active community.Cons! Top 31. Loading.. 50 of my gametime though it definetly is not as much as many. I did play this on PS3 back when it came out But yeah PCLOADING be warned!2. Modders, Hackers, Scripters, all add up for a terrible experiance or a hacked rank, which mind me I dont wish to get banned like so many others for hacking when a modder changes my stuff w/o my permission!3.More  updates, but all of them feel senseless and unimportant. ExpandingMost updates are giant or Fix things than like the butterfly effect spread the effect to make it giant, but in this scenario they add stuff, dont try to fix hackers, dont try to fix cheats or any of that though they have been around since the start.So yeah the Cons outway the Pros, so I have to toss my vote to Down. Great game, fix hackers, modders,and loading, then  this will definetly go to a Recommended game.
