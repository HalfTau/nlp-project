I dont install mods that are useless. But to make the game more immersive, as a developer, its important for me to understand how certain textures and models are made, and OpenIV has definitely helped me understand how a big game like Grand Theft Auto V works. Not to mention that the way that Ive modded the game shows potential on what future Grand Theft Auto titles might look like. Not only that, but it shows how other games might look in the future too. The mods that I use are Redux via Josh Romito, and several others for real logos and billboards. It also has a VR mod to give me better exploration, and to help me with my preplanning for my photography and videography projects I do when in L.A. I simply use it as a part of my workflow and not to slander anyone when online.So you can kinda see my point. Rockstar and TakeTwo should understand that developers like us are trying to shape the future. Not with something like Ironman flying around or silly car mods with jet wings, but to see how real can we get it without losing the aesthetics of the game. I have spent over 300AUD on all three, PS3, PS4, and PC and all I ever wanted was to see more and more detail and modding is the only way to do that. Its not a back latch, but I only ever play single player and I find it a little unfair since Im using the modding for research purposes.If I have to be honest here, my teacher has modded the early GTA titles, and because of that he is pretty successful and that might have actually started his interest in creating models etc. Hes worked on several games including his own. So I honestly dont see anything wrong with modding when it comes down to that. If it helps you understand certain things then it shouldnt be taken down, especially if you are aspiring to be good at modeling.
