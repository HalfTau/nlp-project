Guys this a gta online review!Hey dont listen to the negative reviews ok maybe  but hey the game is great. I honestly like the online mode better than the story mode because i can play with my freinds, own cars, Buy expensive yachts and apartments and a whole bunch of other things like advesary modes and racing. Its a little buggy but ehhh... If you could stop your complaining about it and take in the scene of it all its preeettyyyy amazing. THE MAP IS FRICKING HUGE, so yeahh there are bound to be glitches and,like traditional games there are modders and hackers but cmon you cant blame everyone for that.So in conclusion Gta 5 is one of the funnest games ive played, i wouldnt say its the best, but its been miles of fun with spicy dialouge and punchy graphics.A solid 8.5/10P.S I would put it higher if it wasnt for the modders and the brain dead people in heist lobbies.
