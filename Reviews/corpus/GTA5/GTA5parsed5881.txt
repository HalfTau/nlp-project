Pretty great game. Singleplayer is fun, all around.However, I will be focusing primarily on the online side of this game as thats what the majority of players will be doing.The freeroam aspect of the game is really fun, but you dont really get that much money off of it, and when you first start off you will probably feel very restricted  getting cash isnt easy in this game, so unfortunately a way to circumvent this is to pay up to Rockstar and buy a Shark Card, and if you paid full price for the game its not always worth spending much more if you dont play it that often. You could, of course, do heists, but those arent super fun if you dont have friends to play with, and the payout is...okay. Its better than nothing, though.All in all, Id give it a 7/10 for being really fun, but there comes a lot of work that has to be done before you can really dive deep into the fun things, like flying cars.
