another example of microtransaction ruining a game. If you spend 99 in cash, you get 8 million dollars in game. With that much money, you can buy at most 3 of the new vehicles being relased with the updates. At this rate, you might as well save the money youll spend on Shark Cards and buy actual, physical vehicles. extremely disappointed in this game
