I thought giving this game bad reviews just because Take Two tried to get rid of Open IV was stupid. Its not like a companys poor decision years after the games release made the game itself bad all of a sudden. The game is still an amazing game reguardless of what stupid decisions Take Two makes.BUT NOW they give you winers back your precious Open IV and you guys STILL relentlessly give GTA V bad reviews. That is so beyond dumb I cant even comprehend it.Well anyway, now that the rant is out of the way This game is probably my favorite open world game of all time. I have played all the way through the campaign 3 times almost, first time on PC I was on the last heist, cant remeber why I quit that time. Once on 360 and twice on PC. I cant even compare it with any other open world game. Its fun, hilarious, and never gets old. And it also isnt too ridiculously over the top either like Saints Row. Its certainly a little at times but not enough to break the immersion.GTA V is a superb game in every way. Graphics, sound, characters, story, dialog, there just really is nothing I can think of that I dont like about it. Ive barely touched online still so I dont know yet how much I like or dislike it. But if you have yet to play GTA V, please buy it. Its worth it just for the single player campagin alone.
