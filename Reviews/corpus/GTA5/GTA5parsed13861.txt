It is honestly a good game if you go by the rules and play clean. People have been complaining that they got banned for no reason, but I have had my GTA 5 account since 2013 when the game came out, and that was more than 4 years ago. As long as you play clean and avoid hackers/modders youll be fine.If you suspect your online lobby has a hacker/modder just leave, dont hesitate
