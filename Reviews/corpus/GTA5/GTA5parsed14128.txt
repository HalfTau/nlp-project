I welcome you to the Dark Souls of terrible online gameplay. Lets break it downPros The game mechanics and physics are improved with each iteration of GTATheyve created a whole bunch of neat addons, tons of weapons to choose fromCons Heists are fun, but you can never finish them because one person always quits before youre doneCommunity is toxicModders violate your game experienceYou are often not paired with people who speak your own language Not conducive to completing missionsYou can get blocked from playing altogether by moddersEdit Theyve added all new gameplay, all of which is ruined by modders who destroy you with the most minor of teenage rage, plus your coop experience is now ruined by both Russian and Chinese gamers who probably didnt even pay for the game you busted your balls for. You need to grind for dosh like its your job, plus the drive from most of the  base locations is longer than my daily commute TO MY ACTUAL ING JOB.Final note from Rockstar  you, fans! Were going to ruin Red Dead Redemption 2!
