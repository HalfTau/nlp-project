Everytime i play for more than a half hour, it starts to stutter horribly.  I dont know what the issue is, ive tried basically every fix on youtube, tried DXtory, everything. I just can not get it to stop stuttering. Any tips? I know my computer can run it but just in case anyone wants to see my specsGTX 1060 6gbIntel i5 6550k i believe8 gb of ddr4 3200 ramI think a 750w power supplyAlso cant remember my motherboard but its an MSI somethingIdk i think thats it. If im missing anything let me know. I just dont understand how i can run games like Witcher 3 at 60fps on Ultra but cant even run this on normal settings. So yeah, negative review as of now
