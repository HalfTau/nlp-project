Despite the recently overwhelming negative review bomb over T2s sudden and unpopular choice to stop supporting Open IV single player mods, the game is quite enjoyable and exciting. Be the very best at gang and corporate warfare as you battle other players online to be the best at crime and look fashionably amazing at the same time. Single player story line is cheeky and amazingly engaging in only the best way Rockstar has consistently delivered over the decades. In short, buy this game, have fun with Single player and mod support or play online and dominate your fellow players with creative arsenal of weaponry and vehicles. BUY THIS GAME, you wont regret it.
