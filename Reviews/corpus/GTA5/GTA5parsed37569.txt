I play singleplayer to avoid the cancer fest that is online. not only does online become incredibly boring and repetative, but you need to grind out hours on hours to be able to afford anything. do you like that bike? well that will be 50 real life dollars to have it. seriously, when the cost of an in game item is nearly the same amount as the game itself, it really says something. However, now with the removal of mods, a way that kept the game fresh and enjoyable, allowing offline players access to the new online content as well as customizing the game to their liking, Rockstar has willingly crippled the game.
