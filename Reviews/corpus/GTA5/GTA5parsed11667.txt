Grand Theft Auto V is a game which at this point anyone must have played. While the singleplayer offers tons of hours of classic GTA madness, the multiplayer GTA Online has the ability to steal your life for a longer time than you perhaps wish for. The singleplayer has not changed much since the game was released during the oldergen on PS3 and Xbox 360, except for improvements in the game engine allowing more enhanced graphics and some more ingame customization options, the multiplayer has since had several free major updates, which is great.However, the multiplayer has its downsides, as the Rockstar thinks their GTA Online is an MMO, which has the user heavily restricted opposed to older GTA games like GTA IV, where players could make of the multiplayer as they pleased. This restriction locks content like housing and vehicles behind huge expenses, that has grown exponentially for every update to the game. These obstacles requires a lot of grinding from the user and encourages payment with real life money.All in all a product that is recommended, as there is still a ton of content worth the money, especially from a sale.
