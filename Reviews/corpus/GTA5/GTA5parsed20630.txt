I cannot recommend this game due to the insanely bad optimization this game has.When playing online, my game usually runs 5060 fps, but at times it has some insane fps drops that force me to play the game at 1025 fps.Lately my game has been continuously crashing out of nowhere.Sometimes some objects wont load, etc.Ive tried numerous fixes, some of which help a little, some of which make it way worse, this has been happening for over a year and theres still no patch.And they attempted to ban OpenIV some time ago. Ridiculous.Its quite clear the developers dont really care about the PC gaming community.This AAA game has worse optimization than a lot of survival Early Access indie titles.Id love to recommend this game, since when it works its really fun, but most of the time it barely works.If the numerous problems Ive been having with this game ever get fixed, Ill update this review, but as of right now, I highly doubt it.
