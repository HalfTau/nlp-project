Great game, online is super fun, the singleplayer campaign is incredible, easily one of the best games in the past 10 years. You should seriously play this if you havent already. That being said, I have to leave a negative review because even though this game is awesome, Take Twos idea to shut down mods for the game is unnaceptable. Im not in any way saying that this game is bad, in fact I think most everyone leaving negative reviews likes the game, but this is the best way to get back at Take Two for their decisons.
