Once again, rockstars inept publushers have turned postlaunch support into a posthumous beating just as they did to San Andreas, the precursor to this game, Take Two Interactive has made this steam game inferior to the pirated alternative. By declaring war in the courtroom on the only parts of the modding community that matter for not only this game, but GTA IV, the publisher has chosen to attack one of if not the largest draws to their janky PC ports in the name of microtransactions on their pet freemium MMO, GTA Online. The moment to moment gameplay is both fantastic and totally wasted on theonline component, single player, especially with mods, is where the loving detail and dynamism of this game really shines. But thanks to the publisher, it is now actually a bad idea to attempt to reward them or the people who actually crafted that awesome work. I must reiterate, pirate, do not buy. Youll wind up a few nonsense nonupdates behind, but youll be in the hottest, most underground modding scene around and youll get to mess with a fantastic game that the owners thereof clearly do not appreciate.
