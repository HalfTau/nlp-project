The single player is one of the greatest open world videogames of all time. Los Santos is ginormas and sprawling with each distinct area perfectly flowing into the next creating the most lived in worlds of any videogame.GTA Online however is a completely different game which is utterly flawed by the in game economy. To do literally anything in the game you have to have money, and lots of it. Thats fine by itself, however, when you factor in that you have to do hours of grinding to earn enough to afford any of the cool stuff. To make the matter even worse you can buy in game money with real world money making the game. And finally to top all that off there is the toxic community.So, in conclusion, buy for the single player and not for the multiplayer and you wont be disappointed.
