The game as designed is good, however they dont do enough to prevent modders from altering or damaging your experience. The online sessions are flooded with individuals using tools to not only alter your gaming experience but alter the programing of the game. Recently Ive had ot reinstall the game twice after modders griefed my character in session. Until Rockstar solves the problem of rampant modding the experience will continue to be terrible.
