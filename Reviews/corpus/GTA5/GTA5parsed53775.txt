EDIT post mod fiasco Since Take Two has been willing to back down on their militant stance on mods for now, Im changing my recommendation back to a positive one as long as they remain as such. That being said, I am still disappointed in their actions, and the recommendation remains a tenative one, even though the game is great. The original review will remain below for those who somehow ended up way down hereMods are easily half the fun of GTA, while I honestly dont care about having paid mods, killing the free modding scene for almost any reason makes me not recommend this product. Should this stance continue from the publisher/devs or any others, I will never purchase another of their games.
