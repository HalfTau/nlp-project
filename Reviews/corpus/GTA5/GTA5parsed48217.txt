The game was great... for a while. Then I got bored with it and remembered that back when I had GTA IV there were mods for single player, most notably the ability to change your role in the game and play as a police officer with really cool realistic looking custom police cars and uniforms! And so the game was revived for me once again.Now TakeTwo/Rockstar are taking that away. I regret spending the money on this game now and I will NEVER give another single penny to TakeTwo unless they reverse this immediately!If you were thinking of getting this game whether or not you plan to mod single player dont do it. Dont give these greedy morons anymore money as they dont deserve it. In the end they are screwing themselves because most recent purchases of the game was for the sole purpose of modding single player. Good game TakeTwo, you just shot yourself in the foot dummies!
