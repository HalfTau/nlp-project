Rockstar is the biggest s of the gaming industry. They release very small addtions to their GTA Online and charge millions of dollars that would normally take months to grind out. They press you against the wall to buy their pointless Shark Cards which in my opinion is a huge waste of money. The worst of it is that they discourage the use of mods. They are banning you because you want to have fun and enjoy their game. you Rockstar. I hope someone there wakes up and fixes this
