Do not buy this game.Pretty simple, I actively avoided modders hackers and all types of cheaters. Any word of drop money in lobbies or anythig that look shifty I swapped servers until it was A. an empty one B. people that werent flying around the map or teleporting in tanks. However woke up this morning to see I have been banned, no explaination my account was level 120 all that progress is now gone.You need to be a certain special snowflake to have bans non appealable, dont buy this game not until rockstar make their support system actually support its users.
