I purcheased the collectors edition for the xbox 360 on its release, the 17th of september of 2013. Played the main story, and spent over 200 hours on multiplayer before migrating to the pc version.The story is very compelling. A tale of 3 antiheroes developing in a cleverly crafted and satyrical representation of LA.The world is huge and alive. The gameplay is very fun, and it has improved a lot since those days almost 4 years ago.Its been a best selling game, and i have to admit the level of production is huge. A good improvement.However, i feel the game is stuck. 4 years have passed, and no single player DLC has been released. No news of a new installment. GTA Online has resulted to be a mine of gold, and that has affected both the story, and the future of GTA itself.It is a grind. There are lots of things to do, but it is heavily inclined into making the player purchase online currency. Like a mmo or a f2p. And that has affected both the kind of content and its delivery. I cannot reccomend this game because of what has been done with it
