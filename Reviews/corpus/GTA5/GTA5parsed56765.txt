This game has an absolutely terribe user interface infected with consolitis and the flakiest online experience since my technically illiterate father created his first website on Geocities in the 90s.If thats not bad enough, they sweep up innocent players that just happen to have been in the same session as a random cheater in banwaves that lack any recourse to overturn said ban. They issue cease and desists to legitimate single player mods OpenIV that are the only thing serving to make their game fun.Im done.
