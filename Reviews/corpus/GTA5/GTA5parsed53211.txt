Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody. We are working to figure out how we can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players.What a bold faced lie, they clearly dont know anything about modding tools or care about its users. Stay away from this.
