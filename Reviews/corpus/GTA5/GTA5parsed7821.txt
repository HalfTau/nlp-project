This game favors players with infinite time, a large bank account, and a huge amount of ingame resources. While being very fun, this game only widens the gap between low level and high level players instead of creating new ways to bridge it. Without more than one way of leveling, I find it boring to be forced onto a certain path.We arent in a story based game. Thousands of players shouldnt be doing exactly thisRob stores  Heists  Buy that one cheap garage  Heists  Even more heists  Buy the cheapest company and warehouse  Grind crates and hesists to unlock everything in the game  Ignore motorcycle club because of telephone spamThats the way Ive observed almost everyone Ive met getting to endlevel content. For a good open world economic based mmo, there needs to be more than one way to play the game to the end in around the same time. Add in some variation and I can feel comfortable changing my review.
