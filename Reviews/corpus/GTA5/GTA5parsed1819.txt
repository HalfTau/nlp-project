This review only addresses the GTA V Online mode.Please improve the server system, meaningI wrote this review while loading a session.....make it easier to join specific games full server, almost epmty server, join by ping/latencymake it easier to switch between servers I was put in the same game I just left many timesImprove the economy systemmake earning money easier/faster especially for new players or reduce overall pricesmake earning money less of a grind and more funbecause every fun thing you can buy e.g. good cars, weapons, vehicles,... is too expensive, the only reason I play the game as a new player is to earn money as fast as possible, which is not fun at all  not easy either.Improve the car tuningonly the good/expensive cars can be strongly changed in appearance, while the cheap cars you can snatch from the streets often cant be changed at allgenerally add more appearance modifications to every car, not only the cheap as i mentioned, but even the expensive ones cant be changed enough in my opinionImprove the experience for new players please. Yes I am a new player. Most people I met got their money from early days when many cheaters were present and invested it imediately and even they told me the economy isand they have no way of earning sufficient funds in the future...Please fix thatRockstar, the game has so much potential but not if you just update it for your own good e.g. cash card dlcs etc.. I want to see some more good updates in the future, please 3
