Screw Take Two Interactive. They sent a cease and desist to the creators of OpenIV, which allows STORY MODE single player to be modded with more content than currently in single player. What the hell is wrong with them? This software isnt even what is used to install a mod menu that can be used in online, so are they going to send a cease and desist to Microsoft because you can install a mod menu with File Explorer built into Windows?
