Honestly how many times i got frustrated with this game, it is still very fun, though mainly only with friends that is. Overall Ive been playing GTA V since 2013 and played through every version of it Pc Ps4 Ps3 Xbox One Xbox 360. With every update Im generally excited to see and use the new features ingame.Most people give up and leave because they make no money or get no where generally because they dont try. And bad review the game.Dont be those people,This game is fun, and will continue to be fun. You just gotta make the fun ingame in order for there fun overall.Good review. I highly recommend this game.
