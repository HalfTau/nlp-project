One of the most polished and fun games Ive ever played. The story plays so well and the action makes you feel amazing when you pull it off. One of Trevors missions made me feel as if I was in a movie but with the full interactivity of a game. The world is so big and so realistic. Sometimes its a comfort to just explore it. You should definitely pick it up if youre interested in a big story that weaves missions between multiple points of view seamlessly. Always have a blast when I spend a few hours in this game.
