To those people who control this game just shot them selves in the foot. Most of the players get ban for playing the game the right way with no cheat or mods. It took me forever to get in to a good session without it kicking me out of it and saying lost conection to session i final get in a good lobby and i get a permanit ban. i thought it was the third ban that is permanit but i got in on the first ban. Thanks to taketwo and there bans.
