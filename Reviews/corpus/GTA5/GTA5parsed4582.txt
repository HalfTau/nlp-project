I want to start this review by saying this used to be my favourite game, i preordered it first day it became available on steam, thats how much i loved it.First months were great, i must have put like 600 hours in it by the end of the third month, but then, well, modders came up, so i stopped playing it as much.And now, after years of the same issue, what does rockstar decides to do? they add ing OP vehicles that cost insane amounts of money. Who has this amounts of money you may ask. Let me tell you,players with no skill, brain or common sense that took money from modders. Add occasionally lagging servers and you get the perfect combination.So, what should you do? Well, if you want to play legit dont buy it, its frustrating being killed over and over by a lvl 12 that never leaves his OP tank he got with the help of modders i mean, this players will kill you all over the map, but when you finally blow up their vehicle, they will disconnect from the session or call for it again, time in which they cant kill you once, but if you are a brainless, worthless, pathetic piece ofwho likes taking money from modders, then go ahead and buy it, 90 of the community is just like you!
