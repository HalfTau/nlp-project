Yea, mods menu using assbags number is growing and I dont see they are banned. Oh I know, istead of them, banned are innocent people who use recording or voice Discord programs. Rockstar seems dont give aand Take Two, who I guess never played GTA5O because they have no idea wahts going on, banned OpenIV which is not related with online modding and you cant mod even singleplayer for now. Yea, yea, nice policys, you....
