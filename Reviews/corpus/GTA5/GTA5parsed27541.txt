With Take Two deciding to get rid of mod menus, the gaming experience has decreased and therefore became more boring as a whole. We gamers have bought this game and own this game, meaning that we can do whatever we want with this game, but now Rockstar has been blaming other players who havent been modding by banning them from the game when it was actually another player modding their account. ALSO I would like to state that Rockstar is overpricing their shark cards, and that is what leads other players into modding the game and getting ingame money from money drops. With 8,000,000 ingame money, you are only able to buy limited items, and if you were to purchase EVERYTHING in the game, it will total up to 400 million. SO if you would basically have to pay from 2,500  5,000 REAL LIFE MONEY in order to purchase everything in the game. So here are the changes that I would like ROCKSTAR and TAKE TWO to do if you want me to change my recommendation to YES FIRST, allow all the gamers to use the mod menu because it enables them to be creative and it is more fun when modding with friends. SECOND, lower the prices of the shark cards, and I recommend Rockstar to change it from 8,000,000 to 25,000,000 megalodon shark card because THE ECONOMY HAS CHANGED from 2013 to 2017, especially with all the new DLCs.Also, check out our discord server, if you want to talk further more OR if you just want to chill
