As many of you know, Take 2 has deemed Mods on GTA Iilegal. Now loads of you are MAd and upset about this... But is it worth Blackmailing and Demoting the most popular Franchise they have? Heck no its not. I play GTA V legit without mods. Sure its hard work but Its the payoff that keeps me playing the game. Sure Players will have to think of new ways to do MAchimea but Thats not what gave GTA the thrill is it? No the Thrill was True open World and your own Character with a Backstory you can make up liek a wild Goose! I mean have you seen that Character Creator? It can get pretty messed up all the way to a Zombie or looking liek an Alien! My point is Mods didnt make GTA V what it is. It the Community and the Gameplay, Mods give you everything no work, Wheres the feeling of Reward huh? You dont get it! many players think Mods are the way to go,  But I grew up with Games that had no mods nor did i ever mod a game Iilegally like most of the haters here. Yes I am looking at all of you haters! Now I will not level with you guys like i would normally on other Reviews, No you dont Deserve to get level with the legit and True gamers those who hate on games because they have no mods are not true gamers nor Deserve to be caleld gamers because being a gamer means you earn the right to be called the top! You earned the Achivements legit! Not by way of mods or cheats.The Way of the Gamer is a Sacred thing to me, For players to be hating on a game that I legit beat and topped on Console makes me SICK. Just because PC is the orginal, doesnt mean its the best at Games. You guys thinking of yourselves while Console gamers? they have no choice in mods or not they have the mods pre set. In all honesty you guys should be thankful that PC allows mods and furthermore if a company deems mods iilegal then dont get all Bunched up thinking of only yourselves why not take what you learned and help newbies? Its what I strive to do. As a Gamer.
