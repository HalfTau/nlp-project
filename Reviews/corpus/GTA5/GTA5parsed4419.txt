TLDR You know all those negative reviews about this game? They are right, stay away, dont buy it, even the products name is a scam.Hey, one of the old guys here, coming from an age where you paid for a game to actually get the game.Now, well after the 2 hours limit for refund absolutely insufficient, i understand what many others say about this game.This game GTA is dead, now its only about GTA online, even though i bought GTA 5.Basically, a on of content is exclusive to the online, where you cant mod, for example, so you cant play your mods with the coolest vehicles and outfits, for example. Or you just cant paly the coolest content offline, simple as that.And this is all Rockstars fault, they are the greediest company out there, only interested in creating content you are forced to play online, sold at a crazy price. they even released the gmae 3 times lol, i know of people who bought it 3 times, sbrotfl, slavesSingle player is dead, the fun is over, thx to Rockstar and to whoever buys its cards.Gaming is dead as a whole btw.If you are reading this review and deciding to buy the game, be careful, youre buying GTA online, not GTA 5, and the online is a moneygrabbing machine.
