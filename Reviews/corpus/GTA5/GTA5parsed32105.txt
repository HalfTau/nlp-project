The games complete garbage now, the online is a grindfest and the singleplayer lost one of the most important modding tools of its time, not too mention that rockstar refuses to update singleplayer so if you thought wanted some cool vehicles in singleplayer, you cant not even modding them in is easy, R tried to stop people modding Online vehicles into singleplayer just so that people would go online and buy more shark cards, if think that tells you all you need to know about rockstar as a company
