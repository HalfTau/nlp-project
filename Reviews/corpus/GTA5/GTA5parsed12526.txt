Ive always been a huge fan of GTA V ever since it first came out for the Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, and for the PS4 too. The Story Mode for GTA V is amazing, every time I beat the game, I just have to play it over and over again, just for the thrill of it, lol. GTA Online though, its is kind of a different story for me. Yeah Its fun to pay with your friends online and have a general mess around and have a laugh as well and that, But the amount of griefers that are in the same online session with you and your friends can be really frustrating and annoyimg, also, the loading time for consoles takes way too long to get in an online session, and ive heard that the PC version can take even longer, Yikes!!! And its mostly full of griefers and people who like to kill everyone just for the fun of it anyways, so Ill just be staying away from online mode for the PC. When I also heard that Take2 had decided to ban mods for GTA Story Mode, I was feeling really devastated because Ive wanted to get into making machinima videos for a long time now. Long story short.... Now that ive finally bought this game for my PC, Im not gonna be heading into any online sessions at all,... well.... unless ifr some stuff becomes unlockable for my online character of course, hahaha P But other than that, Im still going to be focusing on my Machinima videos. Hey R..... If you can see this, quick short message for you..... You cant kill mine and my fellow modders  Machinima Video Editors creativities and dreams, hahaha  just saying.
