One of the best games of all time. Great, rich story with good character development, and one of the best open world scenarios you could ask for. The shining gem, and also the games only downfall, is the online. Equally insane open world with immersive missions and heists, special cars, and lots of opportunities. However the antagonistic modding is a huge problem. Either offensive modders need to be permenantly flushed from the mulutiplayer, or players need to not be punished by receiving money from them as a sort of compensation. Additionally, the cost of new DLC is often fairly expensive, and many people dont enjoy grinding the low level missions in order to get to the new content. Thats not to say the new content is lacking, but acquisition can be frustrating. With that being said, the Doomsday update is certainly the best in this games history. If youve seen the commercials, or just see the sale price, this game  or work of programming and cultural art  is worth every penny of 23.99.
