I was first debating getting this game due to the other reviews on steam, but it is atually a really good game. I got this game in 2017, right after the gunrunning dlc, and i still think it was worth getting. Some of the people in the community can be mean, but then there are those like the one that gave me 3 mill in cash drops. I luv this game and cant stop playing it.
