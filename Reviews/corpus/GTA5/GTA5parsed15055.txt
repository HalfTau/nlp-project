Great game if you can deal with people trying to  you over at any opportunity they get. The game is a huge improvement over the Xbox 360 and PS3 counterparts especially since theyve discontinued support for those two, and the story provides the best GTA experience thus far. GTA Online is a blast, once youve saved up enough money to buy a business of sorts. Unfortunately, Rockstar does their best to make it possible, but not easy for you to do this, naturally leading you to the alternative which is to spend actual money for ingame currency to get the things you want. But aside from that, its not a bad game, and Id definitely recommend it if you have friends to play it with. Overall 7/10.
