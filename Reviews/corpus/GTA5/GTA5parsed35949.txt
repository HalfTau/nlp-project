the activation check on this game is mandatory, so without internet your fkcd, shame on you rockstar.like any gta game its fun but hold up, after 3 days offline, the game started to check fo activation again, ok wtf? i paid this game just to play and enjoy, not to verify its original every freaking time i open it, what if we loat internet fo a long time, does rockstar know a fix fo that? i think not, so boo on activation checks.update the cheaters/modders in this game are so common, you dont have a chance fighting them, you cant even use your guns GG.
