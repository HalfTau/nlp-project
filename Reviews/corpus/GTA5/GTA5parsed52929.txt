This is such a shame that TAKE TWO have screwed them selfs in the A with this cease and desist  letter to OPEN IV.OVEN IV is what has kept this game from becoming a distant long forgoten memory as it allowed people to mod the game to make it look more beautiful or to just have inceased fun. But that is over due to some very very very stupid people.I for one hope they read all these negative reviews and retract their decision before they loose customers and money.
