This game is incredibly frustrating, single player is extremely good but I have issues with the online service GTA 5 Online is annoying as a box of chocolates you just never know what you are going to get.Issues are why are all the cars so bloody expensive, I mean I have spent over 100 trying to get the offices and some cars only for me not to be able to play with other players as it keeps kicking people out and also the AI if you are in a online solo server are over powered shotguns and weapons. Rockstar should have a DLC for single player with some new cars and not stick to online DLC that is unrealistic. Believe me I wont be spending any more of my money getting shark cards as that money is for real life bill money not in game crap.I am annoyed as the game doesnt know how fast to take money from you but to be booted out during a mission and not been able to enjoy the benefits of that item you got, rockstar stop making this happen I now know why I stopped playing online games because its pay to win and my god the players are annoying anyone who had flying vehicles should be banned for shooting below rank players who are gaining XP to rank up.Make Single Player DLC rockstar thats where your true money is at!!!!!!!
