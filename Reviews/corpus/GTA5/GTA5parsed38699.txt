Would have recommended this game back in 2015 at its release with an easy 9/10. But after these past years they managed to  the game over by not adding SP dlc and greedily focusing onto online dlc and shark cards. They also shut down multiple modding groups, with the recent one being the OpenIV team.Sincerely,  you R and T2.
