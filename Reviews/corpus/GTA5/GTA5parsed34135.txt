Update seems like Take Two noticed. OpenIV is back in business with an update pending to increase its legitimacy as a SP modding platform. They are working with the devs on this update aparently. Cpt. Hindsight says shoulda done it in the first place. Changing my review back to positive.DONT BUY, DONT SUPPORT!Barely used OpenIV, barely modded GTA5, and yet... I completely understand and support the public outrage regarding the OpenIV cease and desist situation. Why do publishers just end up losing their minds and doing something this moronic is beyond me. Take Two needs to Take two steps back, assess the situation again and fix it!
