It was a hard decision for me to give this game a thumbs down, or a negative review in general. I have always loved the Grand Theft Auto games, and the amazing job that Rockstar and TakeTwo Interactive has done in creating these living and breathing worlds.The addition of online multiplayer was interesting at first, but I came soon to realize that I much prefered to play offline mostly due to the fact that there is always cheating/griefing/trolling online. Im not saying that I didnt enjoy some of my experiences online, but it was always frustrating. Therfore I avoided it for the most part, and focused on offline play.So I am extremely disapointed in Rockstars decision to essentially end modding for Grand Theft Auto V. I was just beginning to learn how to use OpenIV, and a couple of these other mods, to enhance my single player experiences in the game. Its a shame to think that they would do this to the PC gaming community, and I am therefore giving the game a negative review.Besides that, the game is one of the most enjoyable GTA experiences that I have played. Great story and characters, lots of action and comedy. Typical GTA entertainment with amazing visuals and easy controls.
