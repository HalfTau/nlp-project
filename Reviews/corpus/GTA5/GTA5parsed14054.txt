Well, Im very dissapointed with this game.I have had my fun it but I recently got banned for nothing, I came into the game to test my RAM and drove around in circles for a bit and woke up the next day to a ban. I must have had something in my directory it counted as bad news bears, I had not played for months and i get banned for coming on to test my graphics. The customer support was horrible and the completley disregarded my request for information, I acknowledged the no appeal policy but simply asked why it happened. They replied with You were banned instead of answering my actual quesiton. GTA Online is a money grab and they have no care for the users, they may release DLC but in turn its to get people to buy more shark cards!As for GTA Single Player. Amazing game worth the buy.
