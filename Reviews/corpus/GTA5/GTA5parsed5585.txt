I wouldnt advise buying this game at this time,when it first came out it was completely overwheliming, all the stuff you could do was amazing and it was so much fun,even when you got spawn camped by 6yr olds. Now,after a few years,its not worth buying anymore,besides the adversary modes and some missions here and there, rockstar doesnt add any cool content. sure,they are releasing a new heist now,but its the first one in years and its not even that great
