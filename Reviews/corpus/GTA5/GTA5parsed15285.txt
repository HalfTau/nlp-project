After a long time of playing, and thoroughly enjoying the campaign and the online format, I just dont want to support this game anymore. The servers run rampant with a slew of different hackers, there really is no way to safely make money without playing in a solo server with a few friends. And even then the money is miniscule. I dont mind paying a dollar every once in awhile to get some cool customizations or cars, but the designs are nowhere near as awesome as they were originally.
