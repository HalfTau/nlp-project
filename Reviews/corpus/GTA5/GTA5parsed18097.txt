SP is good.Online is boring as Has a lot of really cool ideas dragged down by a job system, repetitive boring missions, feels dead despite there being a big player base, and everyones got lockon missles which entirley defeats the purpose of half the otherwise interesting vehicles in the game.Whoever the lead designer for online is doesnt belong in their position. And ape behind a computer could have made better decisions.
