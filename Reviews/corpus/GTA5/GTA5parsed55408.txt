Modding is the only reason I play GTAV on PC these days. Online is a haven for cheaters and script kiddies, so the singleplayer experience is the best one available for players to experience frustrationfree fun. OpenIV was vital to that fun in many cases and Take Two Interactive have decided to kill off OpenIV because theyre not happy that theyre only the 4th Best Selling Game of All Time.Take Two are only interested in you as a player for as long as you purchase ingame currency. They are anticonsumer and antiPC Gaming.Do not purchase GTAV until they change their stance on modding.
