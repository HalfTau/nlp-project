I have strong on words on what youve done with the moding comuity but i will keep it polite. I say shame on you. I for one have never played gta online because i think its a bunch of bs. I hate the fact that you want me to pay money to make money. Thanks for taking all my fun out of the game. I really enjoyed single player  with mods now i have nothing to do so i will no longer be playing. way to freaking go! !
