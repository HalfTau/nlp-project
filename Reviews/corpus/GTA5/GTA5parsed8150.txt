Even after all this time the Online mode is riddled with bugs, glitches, and modders. Sometimes this can result in 6 or more hours of real time grinding being completely wasted. Furthermore, complaining to Rockstars support service is pointless because their only response is something akin to pics or it didnt happen. Its baffling to me that after all this time since the games initial release they outright refuse to admit there is anything wrong with it. They are however, ironically proficient at patching exploits that may benefit players. If you do not own this game already, do not get it. If you already own this game do not enable Rockstar to continue this outrageous business model by purchasing their shark cards.
