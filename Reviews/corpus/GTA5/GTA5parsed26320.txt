the game started out as a load of fun, and the single player was actually good. i was gone from this game for a long time because it got boring, but when i went back, boy was it a bad choice. the whole of multiplayer if basically full of cheaters, and all you do is grind boring heists you have played a million times. mods made the game fun again, and Take Two just ruined the whole thing. not buying another game from them, probably ever.
