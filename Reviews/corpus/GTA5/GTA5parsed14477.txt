WAY. TOO. MUCH cheaters in GTAOnline.If you have 5peoples in session, its 100 guarantee one of them is a cheater. And Rockstar foes nothing with it. Literally NO. THING. They only ban peoples cheating for money. But when you see your helicopter was hit by a flyby van or sedan? No. Those are not cheaters. Those are modders. Praise for them!I dont believe Rockstar cant figure the improper spawn commands feed to the server. I dont believe they can not track those cheaters. But they dont. This means they dont care. This means We care only for money!You want to be a troll food for your own money? Go get this game.As for the rest  the offline singleplayer version  not a single game so far worth THIS price. The price GTAV have is for the online MMO version also.
