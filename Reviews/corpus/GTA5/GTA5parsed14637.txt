Besides the whole thing with modders/cheaters/hackers and the goofy cucks that try to kill you just because they are dicks irl, its not a bad game after all. I mean, its really grindy, but you will get used to it. You can have a lot of fun by playing with friends, because if you are doing everything alone, it kinda gets really boring. Played it and liked both online and especially singleplayer a lot. Totally worth buying when its on sale.
