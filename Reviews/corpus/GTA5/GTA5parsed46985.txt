First of all i bought this game in 2015 when it was released on pc. I was exited for the game I played theout of this game and online. I have had gotten 1 ban in past for getting hacked money ive had my account reset once and then in 2016 summer i quit playing cause the community was full of cheaters and I was afraid of getting banned. half a year goes by and we are in feb 2017 and i decide hey i should play it again cause new uptades and such. I install Grand Theft Auto 5 again and try to access online features. And what do you know I have been permanently banned. For what I dont really know. I tried asking rockstar support about the specific reason about this ban. I was responded with automatic reply that all bans are final and my question was closed. I did a stupid move and bought the game again Inever played online on that account and rarely used mods. Until a month ago i heavily modded my singleplayer and never went online for the reason of fivem existing and the possibility of playing with mods online. Days go by and i find myself banned again and this time its perma ban for using modded content online. I never went online with the new account and still get banned. Take 2 Interactive and  Rockstar for selling out. This game is good but the people who govern it are total capitalistic s
