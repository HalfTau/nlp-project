This game used to be fun. You wouldnt have to buy any shark cards. Now to do ANY of the fun stuff that you see in those amazing trailers, you NEED to buy shark cards, no question about it. If you are buying this game PURELY for mods or FiveM roleplay, it is amazing. If you arent, dont waste your time with this piece of60 paywall to pay more, go buy it off a CD key website so you dont have to support this company.
