I let them doubledip on me specifically to use single player mods. Since they went out of their way to strip this functionality, after holding back the pc version for 2 years, I would definitely not recommend supporting Rockstar or Take2 in the future. If you dont care about such things, go ahead and ignore my review, the game is still GTAV.
