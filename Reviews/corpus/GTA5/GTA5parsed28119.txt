After 1.400 Hours of Free Roam onlyi think i can do good review....ProsGood Graphics feels like a 2k17 gameBig MapMany VehiclesJobs like DM,Races,Adversary ModesCommunitys like the MC Community i am in or the RnG Community.Its jsut never getting boring....ConsVery bad and lazy devs who do NOTHING and dont care about ANYTHINGTons of Modders/Cheaters who troll, like every 2nd session or Job you get trolled by a god mode guy or kicked out of youre car while racing, and this problem is there since the beginning, and even if a few people get banned from time to time, there are still the same amount of Cheaters....Its not Grand Theft Auto anymore like from 19982016 Actually its a Military Simulator where you get ran over Lazer Tanks,Lazer Jets, Bomber Planes, Minigun Ballistic Outfitts etc.Its basically a TRY HARD waste of Millions game now Prices for everything are insane, so its just a Money Maker and nothing else for RIf GTA 6 will look like this it will be the worst GTA ever
