I had this game on PS3 finished the story line. I figured after a couple year break Id check out the online stuff I heard so much about and let me tell you its trash!!!!!! The load times are outrageous, the game  play isnt fluid. You joined a party people leave cancel the mission. People just do what ever during missions so you cant finish it. But you know what I can deal with all that but here comes the worst part!! HACKERS everywhere.. mofos just runing at super speed, indestructible on their motorcycle with unlimited amout of guns and ammo just blowing you up time after time for no reason... and they are on all sessions... Fix your hacking issues this is the worst 40 bucks Ive spend on steam in a long time!!!
