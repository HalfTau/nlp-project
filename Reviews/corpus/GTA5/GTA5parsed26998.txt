do not buy this game if you got someone else playing this game on the same router. if you still do it one of the 2 will get endless DCs. the reason for this is that their peertopeer system doesnt allow 2 the same IP adresses. and when you contact support you get about 20 fixes that dont work at all. good game butmultiplayer and support. 3/10
