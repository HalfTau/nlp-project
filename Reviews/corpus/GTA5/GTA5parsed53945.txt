If you intend to mod the game the TakeTwo Gestapo will come and get you in the night. Brilliant game, but if you already own it on console then theres virtually no reason to buy it for PC anymore with the whole modding genocide going on. Just to spite TakeTwo I no longer recommend this game.EDIT Taketwo and Rockstar decided to talk with the OpenIV developers which they shouldve done from the beggining and mods are back! The protest payed off big time, good job bois.100 recommended.
