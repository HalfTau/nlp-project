I love the game, like being able to play with friends and everything and its a nice break from other games ive been playing recently, but there are way to many cheaters..... I bought this game when it first came out quit because of how many cheaters there were and thought ill try it out again now maybe its gotten better but its just as bad like almost every game i join and well you know its super fun just randomly being blown up, having to pay for your blown up vehicles because it just combusts out of thin air...... and the best part is you dont even know whos doing it since they can hide their names completely.... feel like the only thing i can actually do in this game is the missions/heists otherwise i have to hide in my house so i dont randomly blow up over and over again
