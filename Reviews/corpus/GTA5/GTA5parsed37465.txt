I love the GTA games due to there fantastic open cities, characters, radio station and the story. All said and done then Mods bring new fun a life to the game. Sadly because of GTA V Online this is coming to an end. Take 2 want to shut off all modding abilitys to try and keep people playing there bullst Online, which is full of overpriced items, you want them? well say good bye to your life as you grind away to get the ingame cash to buy said items, Or you can spend a stupid amount or real money to buy ingame cash so then you can get what you want in a instent. problem being for new people online is not going to be a nice place for you as most people will kill you repeatedly from a distence. So to me GTA has died due to greed in money and lack of care for its fans.
