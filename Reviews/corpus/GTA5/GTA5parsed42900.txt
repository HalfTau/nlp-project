I bought this game for the sole purpose of playing it offline, modding it in singleplayer, using mods like LSPDFR etc.. Banning a tool that we use to mod the singleplayer part of the game is not going to solve anything, cheaters were, are and always will be a pain in theof a normal player, thats why I dont  with no online modes, and TakeTwo has to be out of their minds for banning OpenIV, like thats going to get rid of all the cheaters who have been ruining the game for everbody since its ing release day, what the  have yall done to them? Nothing, all these paid hacks, cheats are still available to dl, its clear to me that TakeTwo wants to force us to play their sad excuse of an online mode and spend our money on their t cards,  that, you s wont see a single penny from me from now on, this game is dead to me, as it would have been if it wasnt for mods,  you TakeTwo!
