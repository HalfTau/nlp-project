Ok well, Ive technically played this game for several months but I will be truthful In saying I got it cracked. 2/1 is my birthday and my wonderful girlfriend gave me this as a gift and I love this game. The single player is super fun. The open world aspect is amazing and high detailed and Im loving mechanics. Guns work similarly to h1z1.I have yet to play online but I have a feeling Itll be fun. After around 10 hours of online play then I will edit this review. Definitely worth sale priceEDIT Ive probably played about 80 hours online and It has become so much more enjoyable, ive been doing missions, challenges races etc. You can do so much online and the possibilities are endless. I would genuinely buy online if it was a standalone game. Definately worth it
