Again another game that doesnt understand its community.If i want to mod this game for single player to just have a fun time, i should be able to do just that.But i guess all the Owners care for is milking money out of its online variant.They want you to swallow what they developed for you, just that, only that, and give them more money, in exchainge for no extra enjoyment.. add saltSo,Do i recommend this game, for what it is Yes.Would i currently recommend the game for anyone who wants to experience a GTA vibe NO. Go play GTA4 instead.
