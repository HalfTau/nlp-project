I enjoyed the offline, hated the online. I was hesitant to post either recommended or not recommended because all my hours playing were due to modding for single player and I had a blast.Well, that has all changed now. Take Two Interactive have absolutely killed the modding scene for this game, ignoring the online problems in favor of shutting down a SINGLE PLAYER mod tool openIV with a cease  desist letter. So, no, I dont recommend this product at all.Take Two, unless you change your actions, I will avoid purchasing any products from you in the future.
