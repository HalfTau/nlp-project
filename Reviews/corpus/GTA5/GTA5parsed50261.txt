Rockstar has turned into one of my most hated companies after the crap they pulled with OpenIV. Completely ditching the PC community to the curb. AGAIN. I loved GTA V, and I just reinstalled it two weeks ago to play with mods. Lo and behold they forced an update to kill the mods and ban OpenIV. Screw you Rockstar.
