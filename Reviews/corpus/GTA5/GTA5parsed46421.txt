I have not been able to play a single minute of this game. The Rockstar Social Club which I dont particularly want to use demands it be loaded before anything else in the game. However, it also refuses to load.That alone would have been enough to give me a negative opinion, but I held off on criticising. SInce it could easily just be a problem with my PC.However, now that I have heard the recent attitudes of the publishers towards modders and their players in general, I feel they deserve all the negativity thrown their way that they can get.
