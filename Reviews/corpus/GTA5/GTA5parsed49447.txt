You could still put off buying this game for another year. Youll pay 60 for the game and then if you dont have the ability to grind 24/7 then you wont get all the fun stuff you want to try. You wont be able to play with the fun cars from gta online in singleplayer. You will grind and grind and grind for months. If you decided to pay for money through shark cards, you will pay 100 dollars, and find that you cant afford 70 of whatever this months DLC is theres been a lot of dlc.
