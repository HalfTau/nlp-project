I recently spent a little over 1200 for a gaming laptop. Why? Because of GTA v and the endless possibilities that modding provided. But now take two decides that it wants to ban mods! Forcing people to play online and making people buy shark cards because they dont make enough money already. I wasnt able to get a refund for the game either. I really dont want to play the vanilla version I beat a few years ago! Let us mod take two!
