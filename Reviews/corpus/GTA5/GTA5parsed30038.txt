The developers of this title obviously worked hard and with passion on this masterpiece, under normal circumstances I would recommend GTA V.TakeTwo has shown us the ugly side of big business in the video game industry by enforcing a strict antimodding policy. This incredibly shortsighted decision will hurt the longterm sales of this title on PC and I hope people stop to think about the OpenIV incident before buying another TakeTwo product.The lack of reasoning behind this change is the most insulting part about it. A toolkit for singleplayer modding is resposible for your own failed attempts to snuff out the rampant cheating in online play?Pathetic.
