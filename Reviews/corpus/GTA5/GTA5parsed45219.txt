The best part of this game by far is the single player campaign.  Though, once it has been played, there is little reason to play it again.  That is where mods stepped in.  Mods allowed for each playthrough to be unique.  Now that mod support has been removed, I will probably not play this game for quite a while.Thanks Rockstar for making a good game, and thank you modders for turning that good game into one of the best games in the past few years.  Without mods, I would not recommend this game for the price that it is listed, especially now that it is a couple years old with little to no updated content for single player.Unless you have excess money to spend, I recommend waiting until this game is closer to 30 before buying.
