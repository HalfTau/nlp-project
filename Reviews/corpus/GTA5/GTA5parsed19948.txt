GTA has become a pay pay game. Pay for the game when bying and pay for the content in the online with your money absurdly large amount of money. 8million for 80 which actually gives you about 20 of the content from the new dlc or alternatively you grind and grind and grind.. I tried to get stuff from the new dlc its like a secondary job for virtual money its absurd. The content has inflated from 10million ingame money to 4045million per dlc and this isnt because there is more content but that it has a higher cost.Tldrtoo time consuming online economy for low reward or pay your self sick for little.Also I recommend not bying rockstar games anymore before they drop this practice its ruining gaming.
