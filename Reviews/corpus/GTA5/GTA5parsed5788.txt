What should start withFull of tryharder hydra or oppressor that ruin every one fun in the game. Lack of optimization and full of crushes in my case. It has good heist and story in them but I can t join them with random because they DC at end just for troll or bad internet. Infinit grinding that take a lot of time even with import/export veicules is difficult and  also areoverprice stuff like car, properties, etc more likely to make you buy shark card that is extremely overprices too. Moders that ruin your work teleporting or explode you. DDOS attack must be ban and to stopt it because is criminal even is some hours whit out it, hacking your internet and you can t use it anymore only if you change you re IP as a method so you can get regain internet but is very rare this type of attack but can happend if someone from online get upset with you.As an overall the game it have bad competitive mecanics because when I start an freeroom mission most of the players will try to destroy your payload but the point is to steal it not to destroy it and hydra tryharder or how I name them s are the wrost thing in GTA online beacuse they attack for no reason most of times and for theyre KDR.The single player is extremely good experience and some aspect from GTA online like game modes, heist if you can play it and some mission can be a good experience. This was a review focus more on online because it is the game future, because in single player you don t need to buy shark card because that in online is more profitable for them to make money and with update more content added people will want to have money so they will have the new future content.
