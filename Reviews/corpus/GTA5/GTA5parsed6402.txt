Great game free dlcs but shark cards are cancer i never brought it once but there is alot of grind things are unreachable if you dont buy shark cards in this game. But still enjoyable just unfair because ypu cant experince but dont you worry because hackers will make it rain on you and you wont get caught  there is a rank system in gta online with levels but honeslty it should be  1.hackers 2. 12 years old with mums credit cards 3. Contorllers.
