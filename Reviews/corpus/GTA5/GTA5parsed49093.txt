Now that Take Two has killed the games modding scene, basically giving the middle finger to everyone who plays the single player, this game is now just a macrotransaction laden piece of garbage.The multiplayer mode is still filled to the brim with bugs, glitches and hackers who Take Two wont do anything about so theres no reason to use it. Without mods the single player is basically Retirment Simulator 2015, so little reason to go there either.Go buy The Witcher or something.
