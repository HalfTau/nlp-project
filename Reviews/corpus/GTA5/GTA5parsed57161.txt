I was enjoying it... UNTIL Rockstar games decided that their 3rd best selling game of all time didnt make enough money, so they took AWAY ALL OF THE MODDING. Yes, you cant mod any longer due to them seizing OpenIV. Seriously, it was a huge mistake that will cost you A LOT. Take it back, otherwise we, the community will continue to leave negative reviews, and will make sure you wont profit from it.
