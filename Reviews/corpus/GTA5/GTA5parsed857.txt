Got this game made a mods which I never released but was fun for the one day the mod worked. Till gta disabled the game till I updated which then meant waiting two weeks to wait for the mod stuff to update. Got to play the game for another few days then another update came out, couldnt do anything and lost interest. Never had so much greif to have fun with a game.
