Singleplayer is great. You can do so many things like add mods and such to enhance your experience for example LSPDFR.Multiplayer is horrible. Toxic community, and it takes litteraly lightyears to make any cash to purchase a 5.5 milliondollar vehicle that is not worth the price. Plus if you run a .EXE program to get money a lot of them dont work or they give you very little money. Im not saying that you should cheat but I shouldnt have to spend my whole life in my moms basement trying to get a virtual car that is not worth a single penny, I would rather get a life. Just buy it for singleplayer and add mods to your game, its endless. Theres even a mod where you can become the Flash or Spidermanno joke. Grand Theft Auto 5 is like the equivelent of Star Wars Battlefront 2 EA Edition except I never owned it nor played it becuase of stupid microtransactions. The same goes for this game.
