GTA single player is alright, but fck GTA OnlineRocstar is helpless against cheaters/moddersCant pick a server, stuck playing with russiansLoading is impossibly long. Its so long you remember the dialup days. Its so long that if it was half as long itd still be ridiculously long. You wait for 20 minutes for the game to load, then you go use the bathroom and get kicked for inactivity.Best part is, you cant even report anyone for cheating.Trying to play with friends is impossible. Loading issues, bugs of all sorts.I spent 2 hours trying to set up a mission with friends and 30 minutes actually playing it.This game is amazing, it is so great but it has issues and these issuescan really ruin the whole experience and the really sad part is that Rockstardoesnt seem to be doing anything about them.
