I recieved this from a friend a while ago, but my laptop couldnt handle it. Now I finally have a rig strong enough to run it and I find out Take Two has banned single player modding? This game has been sitting since early 2016. With the ban and rumors of R forcing this and that it looks like its still going to remain unused.I understand they want to stop MULTIPLAYER modding, but why on earth would Take Two care about SINGLEPLAYER modding?
