Do not recommend. I have bought four copies of this game. 2x Xbox 360, 1x Xbox One and 1x PC. I have given Rockstart and T2 plenty of my money. Instead all I get is a grinding pay to win Online mode that simply isnt fun without all the toys. Now, as a final  you, youre removing OpenIV. Kiss my not buying Red Dead 2.
