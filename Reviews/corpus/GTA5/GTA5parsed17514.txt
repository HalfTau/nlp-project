Singleplayer? Fantastic. not much more needs to be said here, was an great expiriance played trough it 3 times twice on ps3 and once on pc.Online? Grind Grind Grind till you can grind no more then see you balance adjusted and get all the cash you worked yourfor during an 2x cash event off go poof. Becuase they didnt update there fantastic homebrew anicheat to the proper values for the 2x Import Export event, And thus the anticheat sees it as illicit cash.PS dont borther whit there support when u do eventually get shafted one way or the other there TIER 1 army of bots are an goddam joke.Once one of my most respected and beloved game devs, succumbed to pure greed. Now there up there whit EA and UBI for top 3 most hated companies/devs for me.You want to support an actuall company/dev that actully cares for its community? support CD projekt red. There one of the few left that actully still have passion in/for there games.
