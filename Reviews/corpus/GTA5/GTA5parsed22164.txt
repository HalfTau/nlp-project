The amount of work you have to do to get a bit of money is ridiculous. This is a game, not real ing hard poorlife. The only way you can have decent money is by buying it with your hard real life earned cash. And at 60 for 8 million GTA dollars its not worth it at all, youre paying for the game all over again just to have fun without making it a lot of work. I dont have time to spend endless hours on making a several thousand an hour or doing repetetive missions. Another thing is how all your characters carry the same money. I bought the game on sale with a megalodon shark card and I had no idea what i was doing, I spent all my money on stupidnot knowing that if I make another character he wouldnt carry 8 million but only what ever was left from the previous character. This is another reason why people need to mod, because Rockstars  gta money system. I bless the moments a modder is throwing money in the street and I support them. I dont feel Im making any progress in the game. Everyone has cool stuff but I stupidly spent it on the things I thought I needed like a uselessweed farm.   this should have never bought it and just played it on ps3 when ever I felt like it.
