People often say that nothing is perfect. Well GTA 5 proved us all wrong. In fact it makes the saying look so silly,  stupid. Thats because hell yeah, GTA 5 is perfect. The graphics though beautiful, is yet not comparable with newer games like Ghost, or Battlefield 4. I especially liked the switching between characters. The injuries of people are exposed so stunningly that I cannot explain it in mere words. Besides the eye popping environment detailing is worth mentioning. Oh man we are so lucky to have been born at an era where something like this was released. Recommended for all gamers. I usually download games, but for this one, I bet no body will regret buying it.
