Big bad company decides instead of fixing their own game or put in security measures they are going to SUE the mod developers that have supported their game and brought thousands of users on board to purchase this game. They are biting the hand that feeds them and hurting everyone in the process! This is bad move in every way you look at it. Hurts developers, hurts users, hurts the company. They really screwed this one up!
