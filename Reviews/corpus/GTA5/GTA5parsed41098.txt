The game is pretty fun and the port is well done, but its a 4yearold game with heavy microtransactions being sold at full price.3 singleplayer expansions were cancelled in order to focus on the lucrative multiplayer, where new, more expansive items are always being added.  If you want to obtain money in game you can work like hell to grind missions over and over for as many hours as you can stand and hope the cars and ammo you lose are more than the money you are getting.  Or you can hand them a lot of real money and start actually getting the new modes, missions, weapons, cars, and cosmetics.  This game is meant to entice whales and constantly annoy everyone else with what they cant have.The publisher also just crushed the modding community devoted to mods that literally only function in the singleplayer mode because they felt the mods compete with the multiplayer mode.  If you have everything you want in singleplayer, you wont want to give them all your money to get it in multiplayer.  I cant stand by this.
