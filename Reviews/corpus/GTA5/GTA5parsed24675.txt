Fun game, glad theyre finally taking a stance against cheater!Edit well that didnt last long.  As soon as cheaters screamed they reversed decision and within 2 days lobbies were full of cheaters again.Still a great fun game, very well optimized but you basically have to play in solo/friend public lobbies and kick anybody else that joins.
