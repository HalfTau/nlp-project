GTA V was one of the best games I have ever played  back when it released on PC .Since then the game has only been slowly dying and its killers are the once who made it.Here are just two most important things that killed GTA V 1st. The Multiplayer part of the game is not fun and a complete cashgrab.If you are playing alone  without friends  you are going to have hard time and it will become super boring really soon. In addition the community is absurdly toxic which completely kills all the fun. If you are interested you can read other reviews and search the internet for more points on topic.2nd. The fact that they have removed mods.Mods were one of the reasons why people brought this game for PC in the first place. Removing mods completely killed singleplayer as now after finishing the game you will have nothing else to do.In conclusion I want to say that there is no reason to buy GTA V anymore. You can simply pirate it or not play it at all, because you wont lose anything. The game has been murdered by its creators so now the only thing left is to not support them.
