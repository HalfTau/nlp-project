After a while of playing Grand theft auto 5 and GTA online, I give up, there is no hope for this piece of sht that they call a game, the singleplayer is dead, mods are keeping them alive, and... oh boy Gta online... I want you to die so much, I used to enjoy playing online, doing missions, LTS, Deathmatch, races and more. The heists was the last good dlc that they launched, some stuff was still expensive but that ok because you could do heists of course, but after that was just complete sht content, how can we make people happy? Oh I know how! lets make content that will help griefers fck up honest players even more! that will MAKE everyone happy, im sure of it! whats that? you want to do CEO missions in peace? nope, only on public lobbies, btw we send some messages to everyone on the lobby to come and destroy your stuff, dont be mad at us! its because you didnt spent enough money on shark cards! Yeah spent ing 3x more than the standard game!Fck you Rockstar, Fck you too TakeTwoI regret getting this piece of sht
