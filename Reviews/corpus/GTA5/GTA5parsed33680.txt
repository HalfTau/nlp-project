GTAV  As best described here Im leaving this review in regards to T2 and R s decesion to send a cease and desist to OpenIV in a deliberate attempt to kill off modding.In terms of the game itself single player was ok, with mods it was awesome. Online sucks to many micro transactions.Sign this petition, remind T2 and R why most of us bought this game
