Love this game and love every minute of it. Got it for my playstation and it was worth buying it once again to play with friends! 100 recommend this game and any GTA game to be honest 3The only thing I dislike about GTA online is the hackers etc.Besides that.. if you have a large group of friends of 45 players or more it could be fun to make a private server for a better online experience
