Dont buy this game, as you can see Ive played it for hours on end, gta 5 was ONCE a good game and now its ruined, R constantly take away peoples hard earned money that they farmed and expect you to buy shark cards, so basically theyre doing it so that you spend yet even more money on the game, the DLC is way over priced meaning you have to grind for days but even then your money gets taken from you so thered be no point, also the amount of modders is ridiculous now, dont waste your money buying this. They wonder why people cheat online and why modders exist, ha,  you R
