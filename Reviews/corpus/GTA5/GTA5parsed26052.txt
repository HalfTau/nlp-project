feeling a need to write due to the recent Overwhelmingly Negative reviews.Rockstar has a reputation for quality in its games campaigns and GTA V is no slouch. despite this people are throwing in the online mode as the whole game. they are mad because mods are no longer supported ONLINE. you know where other non mod users are and have been complaining... Take 2 has decided that this is the way to go with their game and it is up to you if you even give a  about modding. other than that online is pretty fun. story is great love the trio character switching. defintely worth the summer sale price!
