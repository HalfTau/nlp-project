The greedy billion dollar franchise that is GTA cannot fix the problem with hackers or chooses not to the slimey greasey greedy ers.. Every 12yr old that can read a youtube guide to using mods in an online server is there using them, the servers are riddled with hackers and there is no ing moderation. Its literally impossible to play properly.This game is made to be so grindy that you just buy microtransactions of 5 to 100 of real money to buy ingame money.If you sell something that you bought in the game you get less than half the value of what you paid for so its not even worth buying shark cards because you get diminishing returns.And if you want to use your bunker or your ceo or your motor bike club rockstar thought it would be a great idea to let every single 12yr old on the server blow up your objectives so you never get paid for it. I wonder why they did that? Oh yeah! Microtransactions. Pure luck and a lot of time is how to grind in this game. Its beyond disgusting and not worth it at all.Not worth the grind.Every single server. EVERY single server Ive ever been on has a cheater using money mods or trolling. Without fail.Also everyone has gps and knows where everyone is all the time. Removing any kind of fun gunplay or tactics or skill from the game. Trash.
