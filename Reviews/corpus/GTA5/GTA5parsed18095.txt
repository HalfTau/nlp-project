MP is such a greed fest that in the game called GRAND THEFT AUTO you cant ing save in your garage a car you stole and only should buy overpriced cars  this brakes very core of that GTA used to be and pretty much contradicts single player core mechanics. Also they ruin immersion of SP by adding unrealistic game items, modes and activities and all that crazy stuff that turns GTA online into some sort of Saints Row 4 and they does not bother anymore to implement it realistically into game like you know  explaining that these ar in game world VR games. And worst part  there is nothing to do besides missions, most of them are isolated in small areas, while whole world online part is boring as hell, people just shooting each other for no reason... you can get into bar, cant get into club and other indoor areas, cant spend time with friends like you can in single player or in online games like Second Life. Online is reallly lacking simulation aspect and peaceful activities and when you not on a missions you would prefer ghost mode to preven others from attacking you. Also there is not much of police to punish people for shooting each other without reason.I really expected online to be something like this  you make friends, hang out with them in game, you make gang in game or join one, you try to make agreement with or destroy rival gangs, you protect territories or your business from rivals and do things like this with a sense,,, but no, all you can do just shoot strangers for no reason or be shot. Even idea of crews is ruined by the fact there are public crews like IGN, everyone just join biggest crew and thats it. Crews should be like clans in cybersports  you can join only by invite or by sending request to members of crew and waiting for validation  public crews must be removed as a class, otherewise there is not even point to get on top of leaderboards with your crew, as some big crews like IGN would aways on top because everyone join them same applies to Max Payne 3 as well.Dont get me wron I love Single player its one of the best games ever... but when it comes to Multiplayer and fact that Rockstart does not care to fix single player and core engine issues like black box of cascade shadow maps and low remder distance, lack of PSS shadows at nights and indoors, very low first person FOV, broken Phone Stats app that show MP activities in SP until you are in offline mode and so on, including lack of online DLC content in SP you starting to feel very dissapointed about this game.
