Everything I would say about this game is in this video I found. the game is good but it has a lot of paywalls. one example, if you dont wanna grind to get a 3.8 million dollar tank called khanjali youll need to spend 61.95 worth of shark cards pay real money to get in game money, and no, Im not joking. if you buy the game when not on sale and that tends to be 59.99, so you buy the game at that price then 61.95 in shark cards to buy the tank youve spent 121.94, and you need at least the cheapest facility at 1.25 million dollars, so if you buy all of these things with real money youve spent a total of 141.93. and let me remind you youre spending youre real money. and this is if youre gonna use real money to get the khanjali tank for all the things you need for the stupid thing.
