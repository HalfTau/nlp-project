While I enjoyed the game once, in recent times, the addition of anti modding policies, inflation of gta online asset prices, the time spent earning money vs buying shark cards and the fact that a mate was banned without any consideration for appeal leads me to believe that the developers are no longer acting in the best interests for their players. They would much rather lock assets behind a paywall. Every new update includes new assets which arent attainable from just grinding alone.
