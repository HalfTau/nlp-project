its gta, pretty standard format... once the single player is done its good you go online.Online is complete crap. Open sessions are filled with hackers, completeing missions or heists is a 50/50 because most people are terrible. And the load times... Like.. you have to be kidding me, there is no game out right now on pc that even compares. Mix the load times and  players and over half of you /played online time will be accomplishing absolutely nothing.If you have any sort of IQ, stay away, you will just be frustrated.
