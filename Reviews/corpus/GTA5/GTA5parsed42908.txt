I could care less about mods honestly but I did invest some money into the online which was a HUGE mistake! Errors in the online cost me a crap load of real life currency and the customer service didnt care one bit. The single player is pretty amazing and a great addition to the GTA franchise but do to being ripped off by CROCKstar I cant recommend this game to anyone. Thanks for ripping me off!
