Im gonna review the Story Mode and OnlineSTORY MODEThree good characters that are good in their own way everyone of them has their own power Michael Slow Time when you aiming and you press the power the time will slow down so your shots can be very accurate Franklin Accurate Driving Franklin has a power when you can slow down when driving a car so you wont crash into anything but its not only used for it it can sometimes save your mission. Trevor Unbreakable Trevors power, you can pretty much tell by the name youll be unkillable which is very powerful.Mission some of the mission are very good and the final mission made some people cry if you are intrested in only Story Mode you can click off.ONLINEEvery probably two months there is a new dlc heist although some of the lobbys are toxic you can make your own for free so you dont have to deal with them.For me Online is better  then Story Mode you can Make your own Character make your own clothes and much more
