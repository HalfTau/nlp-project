I just finished the story of GTA V. I bought the game for 30 when it was on sale because I wanted to play a game with a great story with my XBOX controller. Basically, this is what I got.GTA V is a great GTA but it didnt dig me as I was expecting it. I was hoping for a successor to GTA San Andreas and had really high expectations. I missed the feeling to start from the button and work my way up to become rich and so on. In GTA V, the success comes too fast. In my opinion, you get the nice house, car etc. too early. I also didnt identify with the characters as much as in previous GTA titles. The radio stations are good but they also didnt convince me as a legit successor to previous titles. Also, you cant eat in restaurants, you cant buy street food, you cant train your body. It makes no sense for me to buy cars. It makes no sense to me to train the pet of one of the characters. So, all in all, it has all the core elements of a good GTA but it is not the big thing I was hoping for.It is a good game. I am recommending it. It is fun to play. The story is okay. The dialogues are great. The gameplay is super. The graphics are awesome.
