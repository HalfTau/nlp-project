Infinite time consumer loading screens... After a while it gets so boring and hated... It can make you wait just only to enter the game up to 5 minutes. Just to be able to get into the game, 5 minutes!  Maybe less or more but it is approximate time. And also not only while entering the game, you wait on all loading screens, including the finish screens of the mission! Yes, all of them! Consider it before buying!
