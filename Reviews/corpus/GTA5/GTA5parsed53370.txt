Update OpenIV is back. Good thing the protest had worked! Thanks for participating to anyone who cared!Regarding the fact that R and TakeTwo reduce the game and series value by restricting OpenIV as a modding tool, preventing everyone to enjoy the SINGLEPLAYER mode the way they want, I hereby protest with this negative review.The singleplayer is wonderful as all games were that R produced over several years. Kudos for that.Multiplayer on the other hand is a waste of time, waste of money and is overloaded with overpriced t while being buggy and severely screwed with cheating. And dont get me started with loading times.If this wasnt for the singleplayer I would not have bought GTA V.Stop being s, R!
