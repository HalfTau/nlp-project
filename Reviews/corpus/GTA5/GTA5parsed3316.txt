Very good Single player experience fun story and lots of things to do and explore. Very nice graphics and some interactive events and places that makes the world feel alive.However multiplayer is kinda bad. Custom races and heist and other activities are the strong points of this game.But roaming in the big world full with hackers is not much fun.Most of the new content such as houses, cars and other cool stuff can be bought for 1.000.000 of cash so its difficult to afford unless you grind for many hours or pay 15 per 1m of cash u want to spend on stuff.Side note Extremely long loading times between worlds or sessions unless u have 50gb of space on your SSD to save it on. The friend social system to join friends and lobbies are not very smooth.
