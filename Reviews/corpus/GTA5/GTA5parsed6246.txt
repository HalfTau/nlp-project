Not recommended for people under the age of 14.Reason Gta 5 has to much violance and Nudity for young gamers.Why should I buy? For myself I love the game. Yes you need friends to play with, that number 1. For the campaign your fine but when heading online. You want to make sure that you have friends to team with and gain money and buy dank cars and houses DThis game isnt FPS, not a survival. Its more like a open world, third person shooter game.Whats your favorite part about the game? My favorite part of the game is driving. It might seem wierd. But when you get money from robbing other peoples drugs and delivering them and spending that cash on a sick new whip. Having to drive it in the mountains all upgraded is the dream bb.I would not recommend this game for hard COD Players.I will recommend this game for people that have played Farcry, Just caused.If you want to give it a try, then I will say its worth the money. Its a fun game with alot of missions to complete D
