After having played this game between 360, ps4 and now pc for about 2 years, I thought it was time to write out a nice littel F you to rockstar.Ive never had a probelm on the 360 or ps4 when playing this game, probably cause its a little harder to hack the consoles than it is a PC. But what I cant wrap my head around is how one guy can force blowup the entire server populationusing MODS of course snipe everyone within the expanded minimap view, take no damage with 10 people shooting at him and  because he missed a couple shots, can report someone for modding and get them banned for a month just cause i ran around the corner at the right time.Thats right, I got banned from this game because SOMEONE ELSE was modding and gotoff that I escaped just in time. Steady blowing up people , several people, all across the map simultaneously. Rockstar/take two says they are cracking down on hackers/modders when really they are punishing the hacked/modded.Im not even sure Ill play this game anymore when my ban is lifted. If this is how they intend to carry themselves as one of the most popular gaming companies of the time, I dont want to support these F faces anymore.The main problem I have with getting banned when i wasnt modding is that Im not allowed to tell my side of the story. Our legal system revolves in theory of course around innocent until proven guilty. However, Rockstar/taketwo has turned this s into a witch hunt where there is no trial, no questions. You are burned at the stake for what the actual witches hackers/modders in this case say.So F you rockstar and taketwo. Youll never recieve another penny from me. And my few dollars may not be enough to significantly hurt your multihowever many zeros behind the number wallet, it at leasts makes me feel a little better knowing that I stand my ground on this decision.
