The creators of this game have just recently shut down the most essential modding tool, just a few days after the CEO said that they are undermonetizing the players. GTA Online sucks now, every new update only adds vehicles that are the exact same as all the others and cost 1 or 2 million. All they want now is for players to buy shark cards, so no single player dlc coming any time soon. Take Two,  Rockstar,  this game.
