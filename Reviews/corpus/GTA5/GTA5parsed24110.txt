Legit Review The game is fun to  around on with friends. Its trash everywhere else. Its buggy and infested with racist and toxic players 24/7. Its no fun to go online anymore. Story Mode is dead, other than the mods......which is where I come to my Personal Review OpenIV made GTA fun again. Story mode became more fun, it gave new and silly things to do, and it was all around a blast again especially witht the 4K mods for it. Then it all went towhen you were claiming that it allowed players to cheat online, which is completly false considering OpenIV DOESNT allow you to go online with mods at all. So, down to it,  you guys and your games. GTA 4 is the same way now. Bring back OpenIV or youll lose 80 of your community as you already have.
