I dont normaly write reviews so im gonna keep this short and sweet. I absolutly love this game and i have played it since release across three platforms, however i am unable to recomend it. What was once a game of freedom has turned into a giant cash grab, with prices in online becoming increasingly outrageous almost forcing the user to choose between weeks of grinding, modding or buying shark cards. The latest Gunrunning update is a clear example of this, to buy the cheapest Bunker it costs around 1.3 million, however after all the pretty much NECASSARY improvements are purchased, it ends up costing northwards of 2 million. Rockstar is a massive company with 3.3 Billion, yes  Billion, dollars to its name. Unless Rockstar stops being greedy little , i can sadly see my long and enjoyable saga with this game coming to a close soon.
