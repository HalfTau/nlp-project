Tried playing after years and I just gotta say...what a disappointment. Sure the contents there, but when you have to wait an hour to do ANYTHING online then its not worth experiencing.OK, so you have heists that need all players to survive in order to complete, an interesting gameplay mechanic which would otherwise be fine, if you didnt have to sit with your thumb up yourwaiting for the missions to reload for 10 minutes at a time. Task this with the endless ery that people commit in online lobbies and its practically impossible to complete a single heist in one playthrough. Hell, its hard to get a heist going with 2 extra friends, waiting for that extra person to complete heists with you. Imagine running a heist by yourself? You NEED people who you know and are willing to play this for hours on end in a single playthrough, and honestly thats just not viable in this day and age.
