Everyone is leaving negative reviews for a good reason here. Taketwo and Rockstar went full money grab mode and took a massive dump on the modding community which in my honest opinion made Grand Theft Auto a helluva more popular game in the  whole gaming community due to modders marketing this game with their videos Machinimas etc.
