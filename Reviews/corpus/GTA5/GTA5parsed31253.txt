Multiplayer isnt fun, It has really long loading times for almost any action. From joining Freeride to Creating a lobby or changing your freeridelobby. Even with a SSD this is taking ages. This is no problem in Singleplaer though.Singleplayer makes fun, but the BEST reason to play GTA 5 were the mods. And as you are probably well aware by now because every other review tells you now   Modding is effectively dead and got killed by Rockstar and Take 2 since they shut down OpenIV.NOT Recommended due to bad business practices both for Multiplayer Micropayments and Singleplayer killing Mods and bad programming in Multiplayer.
