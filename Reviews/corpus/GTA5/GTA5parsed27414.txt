Come for the Singleplayer, avoid the multiplayer.I brought this game on PC mostly for the multiplayer experience, what I ended up getting was a grindfest full of hackers and kiddies with mummies credit card. I havnt played it in months because anything remotely fun is behind pay to play/win mechanics in the form of shark cards a way of buying ingame currency that you otherwise have to grind for. Anything thats free and fun eventully gets fixed or removed.If you havnt played the amazing singleplayer story yet then MAYBE its worth a buy on sale. but dont do it for the multiplayer, Take 2 just wants your money.
