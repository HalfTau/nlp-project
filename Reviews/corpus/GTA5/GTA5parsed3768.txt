A gorgeous but imperfect beast. Single player is too short, not as engaging as the original San Andreas, but still fun to play.Online, well, yeah, the same thing everyone else says theyre pushing up prices for all the shiny new toys so people will keep giving them real money for shark cards. That being said, if youre patient and have good friends to play with, you can get all you want, eventually, and have fun in the grind. So much grinding. So much you wonder why theres only one strip club hiyoooooo.I love that in a game about playing a criminal, modders have come along to give people free money and rockstar is playing police to stop them. Its meta. You alright! I learned it from watching you!
