The games story is amazing, filled with vibrant and charismatic characters, and lots of things to play around with, including a huge arsenal of weapons and many types of vehicles. You USED to be able to mod it to hell to add even more fun to the experience, but apparently that is illegal now.Dont buy it for the multiplayer unless you have friends. GTA V Online is filled with hackers and whiny kids.EDIT 6/23/17 Modding is back. Thank you for actually coming to your senses, Take Two.
