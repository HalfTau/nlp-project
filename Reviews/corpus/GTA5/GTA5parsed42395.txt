Can no longer mod the single player game. OpenIV was a great tool that allows modding and the devs were forced to shut it down to avoid getting sued by Take2. The ironic part being that modding is the reason a majority of people bought this game in the first place.Due to their greed, I will no longer buy any Take2 or Rockstar games.
