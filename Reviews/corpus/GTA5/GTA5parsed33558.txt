Because TakeTwo has recently shut down OpenIV which is an excellent way to shoot yourself in the foot, there is not a lot of purpose for playing the single player. We play single player so that we can do stuff you cant do in the campaign and online, for example Play as a cop, play as a firefighter, replace vehicles, add new maps, and so much more. But now we have to play the shtty online mode, now i know the DLCs are free but you need a lot of money to buy the content in the dlc which you can do by playing Heists for most money or other modes which is fun but takes a long time or buy shark cards Which are expensive as hell, also i think the secondary reason for shutting down OpenIV is so that more people play online and buy more shark cards. Of course, this is my personal opinion and anyone is free to disagree with me.
