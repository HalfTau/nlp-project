Online play is the only really selling point to this game, and its brutally not fun.When I played GTA 5 on the PS3 when it first came out before SharkCards, the game was far more fun.People spoke the same language, completed missions, and items were within reach of purchase through gameplay.My brother purchased this for me, for 20 somethin dollars, and I still feel that was a ripoff.Having played GTA since their very first release, this game is a huge letdown when it comes to the online play.This game in its current state isnt even worth 5.Heists are impossible to complete even when the reward is only 10000.They constantly group you with Russians, Asians, Spanish, you name it, youll be playing with them.Sure this is diverse, issue here is the inability to communicate with your team, which means, youll be repeating missions 10 time before completing them, and never completing heists.Second, the controlls are horrible.There is a keybind page, though thats a lie.The keys thatll you want to rebind, cant be rebound. The keys that are just fine, you can rebind of course.Third, the load screens.Even with the fastest hardrives on the market this game takes forever too load.Sure, the map is huge and will require a load screen, but why do I have to reload EVERY DAMN MISSION?!?!?!?! ?This is beyond frustrating, as well as just poor design choice.Ive already loaded the world, dont make me reload it a thousand times, because my team keeps dying then ragequiting,Last and not least, only way to earn money, is to buy SharkCards.This game is pointless unless you have hundreds of dollars to spend.DO NOT BUY as long as they have SharkCards in their current format, as well as matchmaking.The matchmaking is horrible and a sad excuse for an AAA game.I have no problem with purchasable ingame currency, my problem is making SharkCards the only real way to gain ingame currency.Thank you for letting me know not to spend money on Rockstar games in the future.Youve lost a 20 year long fan.Still, I give this game 3 out of 5 stars, because it is still a half decent game.
