Seems like, regardless of their past thirst for money, Take 2 and Rockstar have decided to pss away their future profits with this game. As Im sure youve heard, T2 has removed OpenIV which was the predominant if not only modding structure for the game  this essentially removes all modability from the singleplayer  which, by Rockstars ToS is was perfectly fine. This harsh update to the game, if not reversed, will utterly annihilate Rockstars and T2s profits  they will suffer major consequences for their poorly planned and greedy business strategy.
