GTA5game that everyone should have forgotten in 2015, but somehow unknown in this pasty regret of consoles are played and donaty even now.The first sin of this game is that it was created for toxic schoolchildren, because all the tasks to kill someone, beat, steal, undermine and so on.The second sin of this game is that it does not evolve as there were bugs with consoles on consoles in 2014 so they stayed in 2018, eventually you passed the mission, you were paid 100,000 then someone killed you and you lost everything, and at the bottom you wrote failed to make cloud preservation.And the third and most important sin is graphics, I have GTX 1050 TI  Rysen 7 and can you please tell me why I everywhere have soap and smoothing on the maximum graphics settings, no penumbraes, no anisotropy, no postproceesing antialiasing, but in watch dogs the worst graphics, you know that if you compare the schedule of GTA 5 and WATCH DOGS then GTA will lose.Result GTA 5 eructation console console gaming ported to the PC to weld on those who do not have a console, 10/10 and a witcher from the world of thirdperson shooters
