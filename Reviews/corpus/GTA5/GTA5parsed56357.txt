I love this game, both the SP and MP are incredible in their own aspects. But then TakeTwo decided to shut down one of the most important aspects of the GTA series, modding. They decided to shut down OpenIV, a popular tool that lets users interact with GTA 5 in a new way. It never hurt anyone, infact it actually helped boost the game sales. But TakeTwo decided to file a cease and desist because they probably believed that OpenIV breached security. I hope TakeTwo learns from its mistake and fixes it.
