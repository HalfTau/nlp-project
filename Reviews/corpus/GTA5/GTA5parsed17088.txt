Story is great, Multiplayer is trash.On PC there is just too many modders online and Rockstar doesnt seem to have enough creativity in the online field to create something other than stock up! and now deliver without being destroyed!. and even with that, they manage to create the most boring scenarios such as literally driving a FedEx truck across the map at a top speed of 60kmh for about 40 min to put boxes on doorsteps. There just arent too many ways to generate cash in the game while actually having genuine fun. Its at its best when you find that 1 out of 1000 lobbies where everyone is just messing around and you get a truly fun experience with randoms.That being said, the story mode is great. Lovable characters, interesting conflicts, great gameplay, and an overall story that is just easy to be able to get into. They nailed the visuals as well and even if you arent impressed with that, there are more than a handful of ENB and visual mods that you can install to get the game to your liking.
