Game itself is fine, my BIG problem is the corporate mentality, I mean it took R THAT long to have a PC version which is nothing more than a port, sad I know. and then the focus is GTA online and not GTA V. GTA online is bad, to put it lightly. If you mod your game and try to play GTA online, you will be instaban, no for using the mods but for having them installed.Nonetheless, GTA V story mode is an enjoyable experience.
