Updated Review after R statementIts good that R realized their mistake  are starting discussions.Im still going to keep my review as a Negative though, because this whole mindset has left a bad taste in my mouth.GTAV is a pretty good game.  Ive always been a fan of the GTA series.The singleplayer missions are pretty fun to play through, keep the experience going for literally an infinite amount of hours.If youre buying this game for GTAOnline, be aware that it has a lot of issues since its release that   a TON of hackers roaming about.Rs policy about banning hackers is basically that you can hack as much as you want,you hack cash.  So keep that in mind.
