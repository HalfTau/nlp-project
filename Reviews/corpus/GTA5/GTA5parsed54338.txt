This was a pretty fun sandbox game, a huge step up from its predecessors in term of graphics. Until today, you could mod the game enable it to look like it wasnt released in 2013, give yourself a bunch of fun vehicles and weapons, and change what your character look like even play as an animal and much much more fun, wacky stuff. But now, Take Two and Rockstar have decided to go one step further in milking every last atom of currency from your bank account and ensure you have as little fun as possible unless you pay them even more money. Theyve ordered the creator of one of the largest third party modding programs to cease development and distribution of OpenIV, a program that let your single player experience be what GTA Online could have been, had Rockstar and Take Two not been so greedy and outright hostile to their paying customers and longtime fans of the series. As such, I can only recommend you pirate this game and download it illegally so that you one day may be able to enjoy the truely great experience this game could have been, once pirates and modders find a way to fix this deeply exploitative and broken game. Shame on Rockstar and Take Two.
