Im not giving this a bad reccomendation because of the online stuff, I genuinely dont think this game is worth 60 dollars, which it probably wont drop from for a couple of years. Yeah the story is great, but for a game that markets itself as an open world game there really arent any sidequests or any real endgame. Yeah you can go on a murder spree but playing without a goal really is not any fun
