I bought it for the mods. Now mods are being banned.Useless game.Another good reason for not buying it is that it is not voice translated to Spanish. A big game like this. A publisher with a lot of money. The second most talked language in the world. And they dont translate it.Games less famous, indie publishers translate them. Rockstar not. It is so difficult to drive while you read subtitles while you look to the minimapGPS instead of see gps route on the road, like other games
