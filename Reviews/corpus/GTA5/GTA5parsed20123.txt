Arguably the best game Ive played, considering that I have completed almost every heist and mission and have purchased almost every desirable business, car, or anything of that sort.Its constant fun factor, of being in a random lobby, or one with friends and crew to just troll others or do other adventurous and exhilarating stuff. That can range from something as short as a stunt or race, to a deathmatch, heist, mission, and even a road trip or roleplay.Ive had some of the most fun times playing and just driving around GTA, and I also know that there are many people who think of Rockstar as money hungry, but I wouldnt care and you shouldnt either. Yall are enjoying and screwing around and thats what this game is, a fun game meant for just chilling and sometimes, doing some serious stuff.This game is an easy 9.5/10, and Id recommend everyone to try it out, especially if your friends own the game. Its a grind to get up to a high rank and to be rich and afford the best vehicles and upgrades, but its worth it.Update  OpenIV may have shut down, but now that its back, dont let the ratings fool you. The modding community is back and thats what the game offers. The ratings are now invalid, Id say this game would be a 75 or 85 positive game, considering how many people have bought it already, so thats incredible.TLDR  9.5/10 game, worth the time to grind out money and have fun. Lots of fun stuff to do  Heists, missions, road trips, deathmatches and races, photoshoots and even roleplay, and just driving/flying with friends and crew. Recommend to do so with friends, and crew, as it may not be as fun alone. Thanks for reading, dont let ratings fool you, this is a 80 positive game, now that OpenIV is back. The only 0.5/10 bad thing about this game is the community at times, and the trolling.Thank you, and please do vote my review as helpful.
