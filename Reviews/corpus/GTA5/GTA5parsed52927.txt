The single Player side of the game used to be fun with mods. until Take 2all over the single player side of the game.The Online side of the game god awful the mission that low level gives you 49k cash while at level 30 you get 1219k cash so takes a long time to get anything good unless you throw tons of real money into the game to get anything.Online side has good deal of hackers stealing your cash and weapons.Online car selling is really bad with highest you can get is 9.5k cash from every 40 mintues so another way making tiny cash.Online Biker or CEO side is bad with mission to sell items with plane where high level players with fighter jets try to kill you all the time or cars where players can wait next to your lock up and kill you after the 3 second count down and everyone can kill because you become a hugh marker on the map. so if want to make anything being a biker or CEO. just focus the game to make go in solo sessions to get little money.
