GTA is still one of the best immersive games there is, especially in Singleplayer mode.Story is also very good, but in my opinion not that good as the Story from GTA 4.Whats realy bad about this game is the Online payment system and 1851851757 microtransactions stuff is realy ridiculous.GTA was always a game you enjoyed playing with your friends not grinding it to the top.Also they only add stuff which you dont realy need,  all the 185175185 diffrent super cars for 4 million ingame cash, which you can farm days and days for to buy one.They give you an option to buy a sharkcard for 50 which gives you a lousy 8 million ingame cash, which is literally nothing.I just wanna do funny stuff with my friends and this is the first GTA which puts me infront of a paywall or 158185 hours of grinding to realy get the most of it.Guess these are saaad times. /
