Ever since Take2 made modding ILLEGALas in you will go to jail or face a heavy fine this game sucks. mods are fun, you dont change the story mode anyways... whats it to you? That sweet ass MONEYYYY. you arent going to make more by forcing players to go online to be able to have fun now that its banned. You guys are ridiculous and Rockstar should stand up to themselves and say NO. As a player I mainly bought GTA V for the freedom you had. You can do anything, change anything, etc. this... this is just a dick move. We cant do anything! Rockstar please be our voice and show Take2 what a bad choice they made
