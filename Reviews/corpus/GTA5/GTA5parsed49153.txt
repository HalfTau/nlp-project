Not only are the publishers of this game pandering to continuously paying audiences, by making every single thing they release in terms of updates ridiculously expensive so that you either have to grind for hours on end for cash or PURCHASE it with real money.They have on multiple occasions and for lack of better wording, taken things from me ingame. I purchased the Tornado Rat Rod once and didnt receive it. I also purchased specific renovations for my Motorcycle Club and ALSO didnt receive them.What theyre doing to this game is a bloody disgrace. Sly, greasy palmed corporate  stains are squeezing every last penny from us.DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT ROCKSTAR.EDIT  While I do still play the game, I purchased at release expecting a game that fulfilled its promises. I would not reccomend paying a whole 40 pounds or 50 dollars for a twice released game.
