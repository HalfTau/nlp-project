Grand Theft Auto V is a very nice game, and I was thinking about getting into modding, but the situation was already a bit precarious because I would likely have my account banned should I accidentally go online with mods, from my understanding.Then the ceaseanddesist order against OpenIV. Really guys? You should have been supporting the modders and shouldntve suddenly struck them down.Also, blame mods for people cheating on Online? No! Rockstar, you were the ones who trusted the clients in the first place. DONT TRUST THE CLIENTHeres a Save OpenIV petition
