Banning mods is bad, mmmkay!But seriously take two, here is a big FU to ya.... Should you ever consider unbanning mods I may reconsider changing this review.EDITReview changed to recommend.And so they brought mods back o/  power to the people.This is actually a very good game, but you big wigs need to leave the modding community be. Modding is a good thing, like your game, plain and simple.
