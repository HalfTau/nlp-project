So, after so many years, GTA V is still a game that I play as if its a new game. The game has been Amazing since ps3/Xbox360 and it just gets better and better. Owning it for ps3 and ps4 wasnt enough and I had to get it on Pc too. Yes, a lot of the things ingame require A TON of grinding which you can skip with some micro transactions, but from my experience, its not the hardest to grind for something you really want ingame. Most are here for the Online part of the game, but if you arent or even if you are, the Single Player is worth playing, and more than once too, and your choice of First or Third person. New content gets frequently released for online and the game doesnt feel abandoned even by the slightest.If you wanna mess around with friends, there are tons of things to do, keep your friends close and your enemies closer and if you dont have any friends, Trevor will help you out XD
