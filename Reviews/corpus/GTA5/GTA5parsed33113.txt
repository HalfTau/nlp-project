Banned online for being in a hacked game which was pretty much all of them when I was able to play as I was given money whilst still in my own apartment and random peoples names were being shown as killing others via the mod and making people submit false hacker reports. Contacted R via official channels with proof of my account being abused and an unfair ban and was I outright ignored.Since they falsely ban people rather than fixing their game or looking into reports, Id imagine that hacking is still rampant so save yourself time and money.
