Singleplayer is fantastic and this game is worth getting just for that alone. Multiplayer is still getting big updates which are for the most part very fun to play and adds intersting content, but theyre a few problems with this game however. In multiplayer the cost of buying a single new car is incredibly costly and while it is doable with the businesses, it gets super grindy and will take hours to afford. Another problem is that singleplayer hasnt gotten any updates for years and the updates it did get were just new cars and clothes and stuff, no new campaigns or anything like that even though rockstar did promise singleplayer DLC. I do absolutly recommend the singleplayer and while the multiplayer is flawed, I recommend it as well and I think a lot of the complaints about it are valid but often exaggerated.Also, the hours it says I have for this game on steam is not very accurate because I almost exclusively play this game on Xbox and have hundreds of hours on there.
