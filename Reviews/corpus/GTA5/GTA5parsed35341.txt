i wasted my money and i suggest you do not waste yours. This is by far the most stupidest move Rockstar games  Take Two has done, and i really hope they go down hill from here. You will not get any respect until its earned. There is 1 of the people who play this game to just cheat on GTA Online.  no matter what you do your not going to stop them because they will find a way to cheat no matter what. But you runied for everyone who enjoyed OpenIV and others who like to play mods in SINGLE PLAYER. But Take my word on this there will be a game that comes out that is 10x better then this game and will be able to do so much cooler stuff then your little brians could ever think of. i hope you enjoy your company for what its worth at the moment, because soon it will not be nothing expect for a memory.
