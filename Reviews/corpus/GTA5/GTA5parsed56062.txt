Well looks like the Grand Theft Auto series ends here with greed from Take Two and the CEO treating customers like his personal piggy bank, all whilst whining that he could monitise GTA V even more and that if he did the customer might start to notice.I never did like GTA Online with its pay to win microtransactions and sending OpenIV a cease and desist sealed the series death for me.Goodbye it was a grand old time and FYOU TAKE TWO.
