The game itself is fun, however Take Two has ruined the online portion AND the single player by ruining the modding community and forcing people to either buy shark cards or get banned because another cheater joins your server and gets you nuked in the process, forcing you to buy the game again. Stick to friend only games, have fun spending an eternity grinding for money, and watch your back 24/7 in public lobbies. 7/10 gameplay because bugs and terrible grinding process, 2/10 customer service.
