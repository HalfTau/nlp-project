Even with the whole taketwo/ openIV fiasco over with my review will stay the same.Why? because it honestly isnt worth the trouble anymore.Beyond the wonderfully orchestrated singleplayer lies the sht show known as GTAonline.Where the same credit card jokey who spent hundreds of real fcking dollars can hunt you down mercilessly and spawn camp you before he has to go to bed for the night.Where you willhave enough money to afford the new content that rockstar keeps throwing at the online community, accepting praise for Well orchestrated online play and fantastic content instead of fixing the broken and overpowered sht.Where you will have to grind ingame money for bDAYS/b at a time just to REACH anything remotely cool.So if youve stuck with me this far, take off the rosetinted goggles and realize that GTAOnline is awful now, and though the singleplayer is fantastic and if you want a good story, be my guest.60 for a decent story and shtty online, sure rockstar. be my guest.
