This game is overall fun, ovce you spend over 1000 on shark cards just to get a couple vehicles, other than that its just not fun to grind for hundreds of hours for and then they took away modding thats used mainly for singleplayer, and managed to ruin their reputaion in less than a week. all im gona say, even trump didnt fuvk up this bad. GG rockstar, GG.
