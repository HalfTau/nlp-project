Pretty simple review. I am okay with the single player mode story, it is really just okay. Online, tried playing once, got flagged as a hacker. All because I have many mods for a lot of other games that are not run by crazy people. Also, it might have been triggered by my custom PC. Leave OpenIV alone Rockstar!!
