This game isnt very good in my opinion, yes they update the online game alot but in order to access that content you need insane amounts of money and therefore you need to farm for a long long time.The farming process in GTA V is extremely boring and annoying, but lets say you enjoy that process unlike me your game time will ALWAYS be interrupted by, wait for it... LOADING SCREENS.The loading screens in GTA V are annoying for two reasonsOne being they are simply boring, I mean just watching half naked girls isnt enough for some people you know?The second reason is the length of the loading screens, I mean I get it its a big game that has a big world with alot of content and I respect that I really do, but that crossed the line.For example I was playing GTA V online for about 3 hours I was playing missions, races and plain old PVP Deathmatches and so on, 1 whole hour of those 3 hours was loading screens, now some people say its worth it, being able to have a good time for the sacrifice of an hour of your time.But they are simply mistaken I payed a full price of this game 60, and when I bought it I didnt expect to have my time wasted by long loading screens, I could have spent time with my loved ones during that hour or focus on my job, which is a much better use of your time then playing this waste of a time game.Sorry for long review heres nothing
