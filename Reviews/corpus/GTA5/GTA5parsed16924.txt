There are going to be modders because of how ridiculous the prices are, but with the new DLCs its much easier to earn money before the huge blast of DLCs between 20162017. Its an amazing game and i am currently lvl 341 with plenty of money to spend that i recently earned from the new DLCs. You can drive cars, fly planes, shoot a random person on the street, and can become a CEO or/and Motercycle crew. There is just so much you can do! Rockstar is always coming out with more DLCs too, so if you get bored, just wait for the next DLC i believe they come out almost every 2 months?. If you love most of the things i have said here, this is the game for you! BUY IT NOW!!! !
