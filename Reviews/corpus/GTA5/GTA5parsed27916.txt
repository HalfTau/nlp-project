It really is sad to give a negative review to this amazing game but if you arent aware yet Take Two took down a modding program OpenIV which really sucks and if they continue taking down mods, it will get nasty. I think its really cool that people can create anything using mods in singleplayer and as long as it does not affect online it shouldnt be a problem but for some reason Take Two decided that SP mods are bad... Unless they reverse this decision ill keep this review negative.EDIT Mods are back bois time to change the review as promised thank god...
