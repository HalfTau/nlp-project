This game used to be a lot more fun, and with friends just messing around it can be a great time. But over time Rockstar has added a lot of t in this game that is so expensive you would either have to grind for days or get money from a modderor mod yourself. Public sessions in this game can be complete cancer, but the singleplayer story is great fun and if you like mods there are plenty to fool around with. I would say get this game on sale if you would just be messing around with friends or for the singleplayer, but if you are there for the pure multiplayer experience, prepare for a tainted experience with modders and greifers everywhere and the long grind for the cool stuff.
