I love the fundamentals of playing the GTA series, but I have to give a big thumbs down to V. Although the storyline was great, I feel it wasnt as fun as San Andreas. I was surprised it could be runned on a laptop without special graphics card, only to a certain point. Luckily got a refund and spent it elsewhere.
