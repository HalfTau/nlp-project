Sometime in the past, this game was actually fantastic. I loved it more than any other game I ever played. Especially the multiplayer which was every gamers dream. But nowadays, if you are a lonely player you have no chance. None. Thats it, if you dont have friends to play this game with just dont even bother opening the multiplayer. Apart from the fact that any mission done in the open session is nearly impossible to do because other players are REWARDED to kill you, you get the occassional griefer, someone who will follow you around for no reason at all and kill you over and over again until you quit the game and uninstall it. Unless you have a fleet of friends who are always up for playing dont bother with GTA 5 anymore. Its dead.
