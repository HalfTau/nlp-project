Everybody pays for your DLC in a roundabout way via Shark Cards, most people bought the game 3 times, and most people sing praise for R, as some of the most memorable games of all time are your creations, but when you go after your modding scene and essentially end a lot of peoples fun just because you arent milking your customers enough, youve ended anyone with a brains interest.I was gonna buy a 75Euro Shark Card for Gunrunning, not a hope now. I was gonna dust off the PS4 for Red Dead Redemption 2 thats a whole other issue that youre restricting it to console only, but now Im bailing on your games forever unless you change your attitude towards consumers and fans.We love your games, but you are ruining your fanbase via lazy and poorly thought out content for GTAOnline, and now youve lost the support of diehard fans because of money grabbing stupidity and a terrible outlook on your fans.How about you go after hackers online who essentially rob your money via giving themselves and others billions, basically stealing your ingame cash, and leave the people who like to have a fun sandbox to explore in singleplayer alone.You clearly dont understand your fanbase and think of gamers as mindless money farms.EDIT After Smugglers Run, I realised how little R care about their playerbase. It was tolerable for me at least the grind and need for the occasional Shark Card to buy some cool stuff to have fun with friends, but the only good thing about DLC is the aesthetic and idea of it, but when you boil it down, its just the same system theyve had since the import/export crate stuff. I enjoy the biker gameplay but its gotten old and my problem is that they seem to think that new vehicles outweighs new gameplay. The old term an ocean as deep as a puddle doesnt even apply. Its more like theyre adding so much new content that lacks any depth, that were in a landfill of old, under developed content that gives you no freedom to play the game for the missions. I would have loved to run my MC for many years into the future, but I would assume that there will never be any add on content for biker gangs, so my time in GTA is over. I think R think that we all like new vehicles and guns, but any GTA fan will tell you that there favourite thing about the classics like Vice City or San Andreas, wasnt vehicles in fact, but it was the stories, the freedom, the feel and depth the games presented. Wheres the gang wars and turf holding stuff that Bikers have been crying out for, and the gangster Ballas/Vagos/Grove Street style DLC weve been hoping for.Sorry GTAO, San Andreas Multiplayer SAMP is still 10 times better.
