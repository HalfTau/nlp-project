OpenIV is back and you can now download it now, and it is time to change my review. Grand Theft Auto has always been a great game, and GTA V is no different. You can mod it, you can play with your friends, and you can kill countless of innocent people if you feel like. Its a virtual playground for the raging psychopath. There are problems with online, as it seems like a microtransaction minefield and the servers can be buggy, namely the anticheat that goes on raging rampages of its own, which rockstar will not reverse, but overall its pretty good. Worth a check out.
