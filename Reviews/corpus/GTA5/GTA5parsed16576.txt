fun game but sometimes modders are too much, some people hate modders some love them becouse they give you sometimes money. If u dont like modders just find a new lobby. i have 1700h on ps4 lv 290 2 mounts ago me and my friend bought the game and sadly i realized that they removed character transfer. i farmed 70mil on my ps4 acc, but just after 112 hours i found a rly good modder that ranked me to lv 140 still not 290 but i dont rly needed more.and he gived me 27mil  that got me evrything i had in my other acc without the cars, and i had 6 mil left for some cars,planes,bikes and boats. i rly like this game one of my favorite its not stressful like csgo where you can lose rank or something like that its a game to have fun solo or with your friends
