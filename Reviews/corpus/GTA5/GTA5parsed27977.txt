You cant get anything from Multiplayer into singleplayer without the use of modding your game. This is now illegal to do as the modding tool is no longer available due to Take Twos Cease and Desist letter to the staff of OpenIV.Multiplayer is the only thing they are adding content to, so once youre done with singleplayer, thats it, the ride is over, unless you desire to grind for weeks on multiplayer just to make a little money.
