I have played GTA V since 2014 from Xbox 360 to Xbox one and then pc and I still continue to play to date. I will have to say that this game is a grind and griefers are a big problem same goes to how rockstar supports shark cards but the experiences you have with others and friends in this game are worth all the time you put in to this game, the amount of content and stuff this game has to offer is amazing theres always something to do. 10/10
