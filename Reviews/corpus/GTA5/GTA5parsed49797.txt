The below was my original review. Now that the OpenIV modding community is back, for the time being, I am updating my reivew to a positive one. Rockstar has always been amazing as well as their games! If you dont have GTAV, youre missing out!!!, and Im glad to see they ACTUALLY pay attention to what their community asks of them.Avoid   This is yet another game in which youll be punished for creating custom content for the community. If you want more information, simply google TakeTwo serves CD to OpenIV.
