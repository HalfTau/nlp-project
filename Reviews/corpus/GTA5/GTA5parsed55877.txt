I cant beileve this company tells gamers as a whole they support the mod Community then with there third grade lawyer they send a ceste and disistis to one of the best mod engines out there, that made sure to do all the hoops to keep it so this wouldnt be used for cheating and even was praised by the comany, and this is how they sold out. They were riding high on openIV for years on this game, now that sales might dip they do this.... Sad. Please take my copy from me, If you want to credit me for it that would be great, or not I will never install any of your projects again.
