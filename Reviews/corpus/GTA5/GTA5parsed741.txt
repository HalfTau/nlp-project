Story mode is enjoyable, but storyline mission list is veryvery short  not anywhere near you would expect from a virtual freeroam World of this size. Takes around 34 days to complete... petty much the same amount of time agesold GTA San Andreas would require.Now, why only 1 star and Do not recommend after you will pass rather disappointingly short storyline mode, you will want to see the Online mode.Do not rush to It takes ages to load from 5 minutes like once in 10 times till 3040 minutes 1520 minutes is closer to average. After waiting for half an hour, it sometimes surprises you with session initiation error Sometimes after connecting, starting up a session and before starting up a round, it may still freeze for no reason and subsequently  crash in a few seconds Toxic community A lot of all I wanna do is play day and night skilled teenagers, with superskills that will be your rivals could use some sort of primitive balancing or antiPvP feature when in freeroam mode Oh, and did I mention it takes forever to load and you are likely to shut down your PC before the Online mode loads because you cant just sit and wait all day and night?Ive read somewhere it is due to GTA Onlines specific p2p network layer implementation.But the game is far from new. Developer had like YEARS to fix the problem... Its obvious  THEY DONT CARE.And you should not expect more from them after superLAZYshort storyline.Ive been a series fan since GTA 1, GTA London, etc... A bit old for those games now, but still, GTA V is a HUGE disappointment.
