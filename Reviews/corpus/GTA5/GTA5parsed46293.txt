After about 300 hours combined on the playstation and the computer, several replays of the main mission and quiet some time in the online mode I can only say that this game itself is awesome.The story is intriguing with more than the lame onedimensional character, the graphics are beautiful, the engine works perfectly, the sound is really good and I love the open world of San Andreas.So why am I NOT recommending this game?Well first off because of the fact, that R is only focusing on the online mode now as it is its easiest cash cow so far.Seriously you have to either grind for way too much monotonous hours to get to the fun parts of the mode cars, places, the whole CEO part etc. or have to pay nearly the same amount of money you already spent on the game for CashCards.The community is pretty much done at this point. There are way too many modders and hackers, while innocent people who got money running away from a modder get banned for over a month?Then there are a lot of annoying people outside of the hackers/modders, who just drive around mindlessly in their nearly indestructible car, chasing you just for fun and killing you over and over again.Yes you could go into passive mode, but this will disable a lot of main parts of the game or you could switch the session youre in, which will then take way too long just to load into next lobby where you finally realize there are even more of those kids.One of the worst things about this game at this very moment is the policy of Take Two Interactive. I get that you dont want people to mess with your code or your game but seriously, stop some modder who actually does something good to the game? This is some 2006 Were in 2017 now, you should be greatful that there are people still enhancing the gameplay expierence of the singleplayer mode, because you clearly stopped caring about it, no matter how many times youve promised us more content for the SP.To make it easy Singleplayer Online mode Take Twos policy the whole focus on the online mode the left alone singleplayer which promised so much more
