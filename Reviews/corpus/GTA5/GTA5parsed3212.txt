I will be giving this review a postive rating but there are some major issues that really need to beed looked at.Pros Amazing story line. Tons of stuff to do in online. Fun online progression system. Playing with friends is best. Tons of sweet mods for single player!Cons Hackers/Modders/Cheaters, there is usually one on every server, some are nice and just fly around, most are s. Connecting takes a long time to online. Youre not paired with players of your same ranking, so some servers you will get demolished because there is a clan of level 300 destroying you with flying vehicles and lockon missiles. Online houses/bunkers/businesses/etc cost WAY TOO MUCH money! For casual players it is almost impossible to gain that much money so quickly unless you buy Shark Card which is a huge money grab! Shark Card pay to win essentially...pay a bunch of real cash, get all the best houses and vehicles instantly!Not many cons, but they are huge issues. All in all, its a fantastic game, bought it for me and all my friends.
