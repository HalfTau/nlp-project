Rockstar/TakeTwo is a scummy company.  They sent a CD to OpenIV Devs because they were promoting online modding. The thing however is any modification of files on OpenIV prevents the player from accessing GTA Online and causes the game to crash. All the hackers who give people money in GTA Online inject trainers into the game which cant be done with OpenIV.Rockstar/TakeTwo has made GTA Online too grindy. One cannot even purchase DLC stuff without Shark Cards/hacking. Of course hacking is cheaper. You could get a hacker to give you 100 Mill for like 5 while Rockstar is selling their  shark cards for 40 .Rockstar/TakeTwo has became very greedy and hadnt been giving a crap about singleplayer/ singleplayerDLC. They dont even provide Online DLC Cars/guns to Singeplayer! Forcing players to use Online else mod the game to get new content.What a despicable company.
