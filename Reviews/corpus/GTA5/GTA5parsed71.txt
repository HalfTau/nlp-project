So... if you are thinking about getting this game...dont its a complete waste of your time and money, if you really want the game just to check it out buy it when its on a good sale. But 70 bucks In Canada for a game that has way to many hackers, modders. There are even people who will just go out and look for you for no absolute reason and just keep on killing you over and over again. You will even get banned for no reason as well. The bounty system if a pile of You will literally go onto a session/online and you will instantly get a high bounty for no reason. Once i got a bounty for hijackin an AI vehicle and no cops were called as well, which is complete t and i was the only one on the session as well. The Shark Cards are a complete scam, all you have to do is just keep on doing CEO and VIP missions non stop on a session by yourself or on a private session with friends you will get aton of money extremely fast. My rating for this game would be a 6.5/10 since the story mode is good but the online is just complete trash and broken as , you will just keep on getting an error everytime you finish a job and head to freemode.
