Never modded it, although the option to do so was always there. Until now. Fun to play the singleplayer campaign, Online play is hitormiss  public lobbys are often riddles with hacks, cheats and people just being random. Closedcrew sessions are safer, but much of the Online content only works if youre in a Public lobby, which, as mentioned, is a rather iffy proposition. Firstperson shooting is kinda iffy this isnt really supposed to be a shooter, although youll be doing lots of it. Driving isnt as polished as racing simulators this isnt a racing simulator either, but youll be doing lots of that also.The Online content is very much a cashcow, in that you can earn ingame money slowly and carefully, addons feature tremendous pricetags for the newcontentofthemonth and you might be tempted to shell out some money for Shark Cards. This is why Rockstar has garnered huge sums of money  from players that need to have the latest content now and simply pay up to get the ingame funds to do it. You can earn plenty of money by doing highrisk missions, but failing them means youve wasted your time and have to try it again. The sporting minigames are hitormiss, I find Golf to be easy to play while my roommate hates it to death  I dislike Tennis but he likes it. So it goes.So while the storymode has some superb voiceacting talent and spins a good tale, the Online component is iffy, but your mileage may vary. Id recommend it if you like singleplayer only. Online is a only with reservations.
