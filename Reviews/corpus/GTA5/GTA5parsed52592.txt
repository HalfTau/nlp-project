Ive bought this game on Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC. I only bought the PC version to play mods including LSPDFR. Many mods that make this original mod great require Open IV. I have invested 180 into this game and this is how TakeTwo treats the customer base. Ive owned every GTA since 3 and Ive modded countless times. It makes the game much more replayable. Take Two you suck and the CEO should be ashamed.UPDATE Rockstar has renigged on the modding policy. Good work mod community!
