Game doesnt show up in my library, cause I bought fromThis game is horrible for the amount of players on right now, T2 has absolutely screwed up this game when these unnecessary DLCs, Modders and hackers are always in lobbies. 1st account got banned for no damn reason. Single player is ok I guess but there isnt that much to do. The only thing I can say good about this game is that GSync works pretty damn well with GTA 5
