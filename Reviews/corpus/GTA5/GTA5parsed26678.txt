game is pretty good. atleast the most fun Ive ever had in an open world game. however. seeing the communitys reaction to the whole mod issue that happend lately I cant help but say woaw, people need to grow up. guys are acting like a bunch of 5 year olds you guys are seriously giving the whole game a negative? a ing negative over games out there at the store that would deserve that more then this game. that in itself is just sad.
