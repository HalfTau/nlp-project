The modding scene has been violated for micro transactions . Oh how the mighty have fallen.The well of micro transaction money has finnaly began to dry up for rockstar so they decided oh how can we take people from single player to GTA online, I know take the mods away from the consumers, thatll work.So now single player is dead after the campaign is finished. multi player is one big money grab. There is no point buying or even playing this. Well done Rockstar also well played hiding this facarde behind E3 coverage, you snakes.
