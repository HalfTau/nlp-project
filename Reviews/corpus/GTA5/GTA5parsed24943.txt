I have played this game since 2014 on ps3 and never got boring.Is a great game...for the strory mode.I can recommend story mode 8/10, but i cant recomend multiplayer. Because all the multiplayer game is based on the cash, that is easy to buy with real monay, but hard to get in game.3/10 for multiplayer. The only reason that im recommending this game is the story mode, because i had so much fun in story mode.
