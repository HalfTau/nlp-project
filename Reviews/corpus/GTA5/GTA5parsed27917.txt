Having completed the campaign for the Third time, each on a seperate machine, I no longer have an incentinve to play GTA any more.The multiplayer is slow, tedious, grindy and just downright not enjoyable. Its blatant that its geared towards you purchasing shark cards, and with the recent announcement of Open IV having a cease and desist, I completely have no interest in playing GTA titles in the future.
