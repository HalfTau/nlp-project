Definitely do NOT buy if youre interested in the Multiplayer function  Rockstar probably wont bother to fix it ever.In terms of the single player its fun and the missions have more variety than previous games, but in terms of the depth of the story, I would say GTA IV would be superior. Not to say this game isnt fantastic and deserving of praise! Its just GTA IV is much cheaper and may be more rewarding for you to experience.
