One of my favorite games because I can express my repressed psychotic feelings while bumping three 6 mafia. But this is probably the laggiest and buggiest game I have ever played, infact its almost unplayable. From large chunks of the map missing, nonstop rubberbanding, and getting killed by people who arent even in the same dimensional plane as you. Rockstar cares so much about people who want easy dough. They care so much that they spend all their time banning people and dont solve the real problems. I like how rockstar pumps out DLC all the time which is actually halfway decent, but they fail to realize the only people who come back to buy their new content is the people who cheat their money in because nobody can ing afford that overpriced t. Does rockstar really believe their  yacht is worth 100USD? Its a mystery.
