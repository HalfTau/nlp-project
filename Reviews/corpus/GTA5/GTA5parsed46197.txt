For a while, Grand Theft Auto Five was fantastic. There was a singleplayer campaign that could stretch over fifty hours and we were happy with that we were happy with next to nothing. When Rockstar released GTA Online, the grindfest multiplayer mode on a paid game that operated under a F2P model, we accepted that it could be better. Between the cease and desists on singleplayer mods and a lack of any interesting content for either multiplayer or singleplayer over the course of the games life, its obvious this game wont be getting any better. The Online will become harder to breach if you cant buy shark cards, and youll lose any chance to experiment with the game when the modding scene is gone.In its current state, GTA V for PC is a let down if you expect any more interesting content than on consoles, by Rockstar or otherwise
