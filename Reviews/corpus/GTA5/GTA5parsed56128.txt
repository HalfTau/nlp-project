In the latest update theyve added the exactly same business as moto clubs, except you will pay 10 000 tax every day for owning a Bunker base, the product and delivery system sucks, 10m into research and I only got to deliver goods for 270k.Not to note R is now releasing the update content partially, starting with useless sh!t and making people wait 3 months to add 6 beautiful cars that were found in game files.Banning mods? Phone calls every 3 minutes in game without an ability to put on airplane mode? Taking away innocent players money? Advertising SHARK cards everywhere? 8 millions for 40 euro? Seriously this game became pure I wish I could return it and all my time spent on xbox and later in PC version.
