Removing mods? Thats the only reason people played singleplayer. Very few if any multiplayer mods are affected by the takedown of OpenIV. OpenIV is solely singleplayer based and by taking it down TT has done nothing but ruin singleplayer. TT is just a bunch of idiots wanting money but not realizing how that money comes in and works.
