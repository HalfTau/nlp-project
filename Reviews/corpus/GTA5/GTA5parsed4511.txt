modders and cheaters left and right. insane grind to get nice stuff i dont mind but some do . moneyhungry devs trying to shove sharkcards down your throat. and devs ban innocent people sometimes. other then that its a masterpiece. cant recommend it because of the negatives tho.servers are also very spotty sometimes
