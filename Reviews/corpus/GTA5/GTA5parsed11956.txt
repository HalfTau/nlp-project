Dispite the single player is great and feels like it was made by people who were passionate with, it feels very limited with how heavily marketed multiplayer is. Singleplayer feels very abandoned without using mods...Unfortuantly, multiplayer is poorly made once made, with many characters feel very out of characters outside some jokes but instead they are trying to boast about if you got rich which is annoying and makes pacing feel weird, which you have to grind for or pay up for with shark cards, and with moves by take two in the current and past, it feels like they want you to perchase shark cards over playing the game.This really breaks the idea of grand theft auto by making the user to use money to get their way up in the game instead of giving the option of doing robberies, with many rules like fancy cars cannot be stored and police will automatically notice stolen cars.Also, not to mention the poor anticheat system in place, that looks out for instead of who places things, more who uses them causing hacking greifers spawning objects to ban or annoy people, trust me, they are around.Oh, not to forget, you require to be online to start up the game because the drm... dispite that rarley stops a game from being pirated.
