This game is best defined as a GREAT GAME YOU SHOULDNT PLAYIts a game that is pay to win at the same time it is a game not pay to winI mean that winning is feeling good about yourselfYou can do that by getting yourself an apartment and a carBut to get there you need either to grind 100 hours  or to just buy some sharkcards which is what they wantand try soo ing hard to do.At the current state of the game i cannot recommend the gameThe whole t with the modding community which by me is a total disgrace to the community made byTAKE2 or A BUNCH OF INGTHAT DO NOT KNOW THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE PLAYERBASEproofSTEAM REVIEWSIf you want to just play online and SP without any mods just watch some1 on YTB if you want to play some modsjust PIRATE the game!
