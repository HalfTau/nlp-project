Great game if you have some modder friends. LolWith that said, Almost all the items ingame are overpriced and it takes a hell lot of a time to make money. Its like Rockstar indirectly wants you to mod in this game.But ofcource, you can play this game legitly and buy some shark cards if you want some stuff.GTA v gets boring really quickly! There are the same money making processes which becomes repetetive.Just wanted to know I do not hack/mod in this game
