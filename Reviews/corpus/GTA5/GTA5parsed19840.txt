Everything all the other negative reviews said about online and then some. Also still cant do anything without meeting a hacker/modder either.Edit for Dec 25th 2017 During their online Christmas event R labeled a car as Free but when everyone tried to get it as a gift for their account it charged you over 500k ingame dollars regardless. A major kick in the teeth to consumers who had to grind for their earnings and especially the people who actually gave them money for a shark card to play with any of their overpriced ingame vehicles or bases, as they got conned into giving up realworld cash for a virtual car labeled as a gift for returning players on the holidays. If I could thumbs down twice, I would.
