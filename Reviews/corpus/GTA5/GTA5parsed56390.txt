So, after the recent events of mods being royally screwed over, this game is no longer entertaining. Single player was basically good because of mods, much like earlier GTA games. The online is not even close to worth, as youre met with a microtransaction ridden hell hole as soon as you enter. Being met with an instant paywall is not fun, especially when youve payed for the game already. Therefore, this is definitely a negative review untill either mods are allowed in single player again, or untill the paywall is demolished, preferrably both.EDIT OpenIV, the modding tool in question, has officially been reopened, and as promised Ill change the review to recommended. This does not mean that the online is still infested with microtransactions and a pay to win hellhole, but at least modding in the single player campaign is now posssible again! Thanks for listening TakeTwo and Rockstar!
