The single player is pretty good. The multiplayer offering though, holy balls. Lets ignore the sheer hell that is free roam, with hackers, FFA k/d bros and people broadcasting over open mics. We can even ignore that there is no real way to lobby up with friends, not one that reliably works anyway.What you cannot ignore is the fact that every new DLC that comes out is basically a reskin of the previous DLC, albeit with some cosmetic changes. But hey, you get new vehicles, right? I mean sure, if you dont mind paying for them.Lets break this down. A megalodon Card costs 100 USD for 8 million GTA bux. Its now to a point where you cannot get everything in a DLC for that amount of money.So ask yourself this. If you paid 100 for a DLC, and did not get access to everything that DLC had to offer, would you consider that a good purchase? this game and everything it stands for.
