I think the reviews are full of GTA 5 is the best MOBA Ive ever played.Youve got the best intergalactic space travel to boot.Youve got some Star Wars, some Lord of the Rings, even some 2017 Assassins Creed movie in here somewhere.Who gives aabout a fun community function that just got cancelled and was pretty much half the reason for people liking the game? Cmon guys, lets face the facts.GTA is a cool game. 11/10
