The Game is fun, the missions and heists and all the different game modes make it so there is never any shortage of stuff to do.The game is RIFE with hackers though.The reason for my negative review is cause all my money was STOLEN off me by ROCKSTAR GAMES THEMSELVES!!Some hackers do server wide cash drops you literally have no choice in it as the server itself hands out the cash for them straight to the accounts of EVERYONE, when detected by rockstar they will remove the amount these hackers have given you from your account when detected, which is fair call.But even before the cash drops I had 60 Million which i BOUGHT, log in this morning to a notice from rockstar saying they corrected the amount of cash i had removed the hackers cash, fair call, i still should have 60 Mil.... But noooooooo, i was left with apoor amount of cash that wouldnt buy the weakest ing gun!!They want to remove hacked content then i have no problems but they even took my ownthat I worked hard for...gameplay good, but the hackers and rockstar really  you around.
