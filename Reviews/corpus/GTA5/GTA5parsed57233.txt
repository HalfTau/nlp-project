Rockstar have made modding illegal, so literally no point in buying this game unless you want to play the story over and over or play online which gets boring pretty quick. The only reason I bought this game was for modding as it is a great game for storymode modding. But now that you cant mod offline any more. The game is extremely boring. Wish I had the option to refund it.
