Up until about 2 weeks ago, I would have had positive things to say for GTA. The SP campaign is fun, theres cool easter eggs, and despite godawful loading times, a terrible p2p design, and hackers galore due to a fairly shoddy anticheat zeroing your bank accounts and seizing all your ammunition, Online was still a pretty fun way to spend an evening with your buds.However, in light of this OpenIV debacle, which struck me as a poorly thoughtout attempt to fix the hacker issue, and the massive banwave on the 25th which resulted in a lot of unmerited bans, suspensions, and account resets myself included in the latter, despite having never modded my install and having bought over 16M in shark cards, it is painfully obvious that the team behind this game has management that would make Pierre Beaudoin look good in comparison.TLDR buy the game for its singleplayer if anything  you can sink countless hours into it and still find new stuff. Online mode is an absolute trainwreck, and it now appears that Rockstar will ban you for landing in the same lobby as an active hacker  as such, definitely make sure you dont pay full retail if you do buy it for multiplayer, and be ready to get destroyed by teleporting and aimbotting godmode hackers...
