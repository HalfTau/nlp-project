Big fan of Grand Theft Auto, and I must say that this is a good game, but if you want a good single player story experience, this is not for you. Grand Theft Auto 4 is an amazing story experience and one of the best games ever created. GTA 5 has a decent story, but the multiplayer has been emphasized more recently. They have risen the prices of everything and gives you the choice of grinding, or paying a lot of money on shark cards. Pretty fun multiplauer experience though. I would recommend this game and the 4th.
