single player wise if you played this on console dont even bother trying it out, dont get me wrong story is great but its just the same, nothing new. Online if you have friends best recommend but if u plan on playing alone just skip it, grind is just rediculous, toxic community and dont get me started with modders. overall i recommend it if you have friends who plays this, or who havent played singleplayer yet
