I first played GTA V on my friends Xbox 360 in 2013 since it was too expensive  for me to buy, I thought it was just like any ordinary game until I got to play it and boy were I wrong. I never saw such a big world packed into one disc full of different activities and missions to do and play, I know I sound dramatic but those were my thoughts back then.Now I am still very impressed with the game and has aged well, you cant really tell that its almost 4 years old now. I have found that on PC weve only just managed to get cards that can push this game at ultra settings by that I mean cheaper cards not super high endThis game istoo expensive today, I know there was recently a steam sale where it was reduced to around 20 but man 50 is a lot for a game released 4 years ago. Ive only just bought this game now on PC because I didnt want to pay so much for one game, I mean at least include money for online or something xd.This game took a lot of hard work and time to create and I think that it paid off very well be the most bought game on the Xbox 360 and the PS3, I am sure Rockstar are happy with their profits.I cant wait for GTA VI.This mode was alright at first, the servers were laggy when it was first released probably due to the massive wave of people joining  but now its awful, likebad. Its ok if you play with friends but if you do not then dont bother. the game is full of hackers and cheats which causes rockstar to do ban waves which cause innocent people to get banned for no reason.
