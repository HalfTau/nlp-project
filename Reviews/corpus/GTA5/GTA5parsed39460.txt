ermm, so yeah. i bought this game when it came out a looooong ime ago, played the story bit and stoped playing. i started getting back to it about a few weeks ago. im doing the story, have just started the gta online thingy, and now this moding thing happened. althoug the story so far is pretty fun and the gameplay is good, ima give the game bad review because of the anti moding things take 2 is doing, not a good idea, we bought the game, we are alowed to do what we want with it. i can understand that it is not alowed online, but that dosent seem like the majority is doing, they are doing it in story mode, not online, so that is very rude of them to do.
