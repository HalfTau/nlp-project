Ive played the game for some hours now and feel like its enough to form an opinion on it. Overall, the games plenty fun, great story with interesting characters, fun, well made, online mode with a lot of different fun modes, which make the game so much more than what GTA 4 was, the mode I liked the most was Slasher, which is like a horror multiplayer mode.The hackers in some lobbies were annoying sometimes, killing me over and over again.Of course free DLCs are nice. The only thing that reallyme off was spending thousands on a car and later finding its completely gone forever,because of a glitch, luckily it was only in story mode, annoying nonetheless. All in all, I totally recommend the game.
