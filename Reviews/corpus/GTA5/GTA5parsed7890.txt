Youll be hard pressed to find a game as detailed and nuanced as GTA V. Ive played since June 2017, so I cant attest to how the game has changed over the years. However, from the time Ive spent, I can say that GTA V is most definitely a worthwhile purchase whether its on sale or not. Ive spent the vast majority of time in Online, so thats what this review will be focussed on.All in all, GTA V does have its flaws but there are ways to minimise said flaws. Besides, in my opinion, all the things that make the game great still outweigh the problems that plague it. Pick it up on a sale if youre still unsure. If GTA Online doesnt suit you, the singleplayer is still worth getting the game for.
