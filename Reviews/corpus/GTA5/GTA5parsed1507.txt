The game used to be fun and I thoroughly enjoyed the game but as time passed on the fun faded away replaced with unhappiness. The game has become more and more unplayable throughout the years through the adding of new vehicles and weapons being released at ridiculous prices that force you to purchase shark cards which shouldnt even exist, however as many others think this they have resorted to the next best thing, modding, I without fail will see at least one  two modders per play session. These modders come in all shapes and forms but the most common and the most rampant is the Game Ruiner their purpose for playing with mods is to solely to ruin the game for others this has been going on for some time now, however I have come to realise it will not get better but only continue to get worse. This is why I do not recommend this game to others.
