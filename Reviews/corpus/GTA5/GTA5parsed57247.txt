The future and vast potential/fun for a game like this is its potential for modding. Lets face it, official online stinks. Modders have extended the ejoyment for the extended players using OpenIV. Rockstar and TakeTwo have now bullied the creators to the point the are going to stop.Rockstar and TakeTwo, there is no excuse for this. Other companies allow and encourage, and many live on through, modding see ARMABad move....really bad move....EDIT Although T2/Rpckstar have altered / lifted their CD at this time, as far as Im concerned negative reviews remain as a snapshot in time, historical record. Also, their obvious false narrative that it was to stop hacking/cheating makes little sense, and if they were serious about that they would be truly working on the MP/server end, not attacking what is a single player modding tool. I firmly believe it was just an attempt to force people into their MP/pay to win GTAOnline.It was silly, and backfired on them. So judge for yourself, the game is great, the dev is suspect...
