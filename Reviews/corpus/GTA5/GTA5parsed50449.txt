Yes, yes, we get it, Take Two killed mods and stuff.Ive never tried playing this game with mods because, Ill be honest, I was afraid that Ill get banned from GTA Online. But, would I even bother? At first having an official Online multiplayer mode for GTA was an awesome idea. Too bad it became a Pay2Win, repetitive mess of a game. Wanna have an awesome car? Grind side missions or heists, or pay with real money. Wanna look good? Grind or pay up. This is why everything cost way too much than they should. Like, come on, who pays 2409 bucks for a plain Tshirt which you could buy in any regular clothing shop around the world? Pricing in Saints Row games is way more fair.Not to mention they dont even care about the community Just like Valve doesnt care about anything with Team Fortress 2. Also track editor for stunt races is broken as hell My PC crashed twice, imprecise and not comfortable to use. And they didnt even thought about fixing it. Because, you know, moneys an issue, we gotta milk the hell out of players.And now, removing mods just shows how hostile to modders they can be. Sure, it floods GTA online with cheaters, but that hurts mostly innocent single player mods. Its possible that when they bring back mods, theyll put it behind a paywall just like Valve wanted to do with Skyrim mods and probably they still want to cash on mods. So if you really want to stop cheaters, think about single player mods.I suggest spending your money on better GTA clones such as Saints Row TT/4 or Just Cause 3. If you wanna make awesome and twisted race tracks, get TrackManiadoesnt matter which one. Do not support bad developers.
