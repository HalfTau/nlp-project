As a guy who loathes online versions of games especially ones with pay to win content, GTA5 has a fair amount of single player content.What bugs me is that the missions is ridicously designed where one has to shoot 50 guys for a simple bank job. A little bit more realism wouldnt hurt the game. I would also like to see a career mode where one really start at the bottom of the criminal career, needing to perhaps starting life as a simple burglar. That would make it more interesting.Do I recommend the game? No, not really. Its a good game, no more.
