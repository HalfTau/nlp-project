So I played this on PS3 when it first came out and was not sure if I would be interested to dive back into this game. Well what they have done in the past 4 years with this game and the graphical improvemets is amazing. It is not even the same game. In addition GTA online is much imporved for when the game was first released. At this time my opinion is that this game sets the standard for a franchise installment and this is one of the greatest games of all time.
