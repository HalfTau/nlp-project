Way too many cheaters and modders Rockstars doesnt bother to stop. Not that I mind simple useful mods, obviously.Otherwise not a bad game at all, pretty entertaining both storywise and in online gameplay. Last one is nowdays a bit grindy and many people seem to hack money for themselves, leaving fair players far behind..So sadly Steam has only Yes or No to vote for, Id vote the game itself ca 7/10, but as for the online gameplay issues with long loading screens and cheaters, its a NO.
