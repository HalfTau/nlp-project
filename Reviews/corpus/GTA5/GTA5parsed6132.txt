Cant play the damn game without being forced to change everything to low settings otherwise i get lag spikes. for a game thats been out for so long i thought it would be better optimized. this is on single player as well. im not gonna bother with the game if i have to play with polygons on my screen.couldnt even go into gta online.its not a spec problem as well.my pc is pretty good
