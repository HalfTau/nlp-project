Moddershackers are ruining this game. For me, the online part of it is just a waste of time and money when someone can destroy all progress and grief so easily.As for the single player of this game, i love it. But there are serious problems in multiplayer, if people wouldnt grief and use exploits to grief others, then i would give it a thumbs up. Maybe in the future.I hope rockstar can find ways to really stop people from hackingmodding, for me it seems they just bypass the bans to do it all over.
