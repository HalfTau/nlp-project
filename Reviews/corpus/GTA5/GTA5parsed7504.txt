Even though after T2 closed OPENIV, the game still rocks and is very good for an open world action game. Though there are some things which R could do such as1. Make Story Mode DLC.2. Launch Gunrunning and Smuggler run cars in story mode3. Make updtates for Online which make the place better with the help of COMMUNITY IDEAS i am not a hipster pt2 and Nightclubs and Gang territories like GTA SAOverall the game is good and I WOULD SAY U SHOULD BUT IT!! !or wait for 2 more years and buy the next GTA!! !
