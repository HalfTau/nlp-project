I dont know what the hell these people are talking about seeing modders in just about every lobby they go to in Online, cause Ive only seen about one or two of them in the multiple lobbies Ive been in. However, Online is still a grindfest hidden behind a loading screen simulator, but its not entirely a dealbreaker. I just really wish TakeTwo would bite the bullet and do some singleplayer DLC already, but whatever.
