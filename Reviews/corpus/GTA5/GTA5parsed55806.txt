A while ago, I was banned and reset for no reason on GTA Online, at this point I uninstalled the game, I was done with Rockstar/Take2 and their practices. I was happy to leave it at that, my own little protest to the game.Now though, the news has broken that they have issued a CD Order to the creators of the OpenIV mod, all but killing the GTA modding scene. I like many people, only really rebought the game on PC for the mods, so for that to be deemed illegal is a scummy move.If, by chance, you are reading these reviews and considering getting the game for the first time, or rebuying for the PC, I urge you, dont. Dont line their greedy pockets with more of your hard earned cash when they clearly cannot be trusted with the consumers interests.
