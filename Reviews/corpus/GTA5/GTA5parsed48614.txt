The singleplayer is superb. I would 100 recommend the singleplayer if youre into singleplayer games. Online on the other hand is on a grey thin line. I would not recommend the Online portion fo GTA V unless you are willing to grind your life into getting your dream car or want to make more money to grind even more money. And half the time its not even worth it speaking to you Smugglers Run.Update I voted this game for This game haunts my dreams reward because how grindy it is.
