IGN 10/10But for me 3/10Dont let rockstar eat ur money with GTA V. Absolutely not worth it.At least dont buy it,borrow your friends account insteadHeres the storyAt the very start,I expected GTA V to be a very good game as IGN rated 10/10 for it.The game engine and graphic of this game is rlly rlly rlly good,but i guess rockstar chose to ruin this game engine just by how boring this game actually is and how  the story rlly is.First,the story part,at the very beginning,the overall story is actually pretty good and has a flow of development.But after that,the story just gets ier and ier and starting to make no sense.The ending is the worst,the 3 main characters of GTA V just killed the 3 bosses very easily.They just killed them by shooting and then got away from police very easily.Like,Rockstar,are you even ing serious???This  ending is the worst ending ive ever seen in all the game ive played.I didnt even feel like an ending when i was doing that ending mission.I was so disappointed about Rockstar for the ending.Thats not all,the online mode is even worse,doing heist and having a rich life on online GTA V?Might sounds pretty fun to you at the start,but not after a few days of this same process.The heistmaking system is absolutely t.Pretty much very difficult to have 4 players in your lobby.One single player leaving in the middle of a heist would cause all other players to have no reward and wasted their time.Rockstar,I know you want to ensure that we players would be able to have the best experience during a heist,but could you just please think of a better method other than this one???Lastly,I found the online mode is actually horrendously horrible and boring.Doing heist repeatedly and doing CEO job to get money?Getting money and then buy a bunch of cool cars and buildings?Just after a few rounds of doing it,youll find that its just a system of a repeated process.And yes,you can almost do nothing other than this on online mode.Youll also have some rich playerplayers that do heist a lot like walking deads kill you with their super op tanks and weapons during your CEO jobs.Its just annoying that youll have these players ing you up over and over,ended up keep losing money and wasting time.Overall,Rockstar,i think your GTA V is overpriced even if you sold it with only 1.Dont let Rockstar eat your dollar.They make money for their investors but not make games for their customers.Put your dollar onto those indie game developers.They have passion for making games while Rockstar is just a dead dollar sucker.
