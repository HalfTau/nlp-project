I have a lovehate relationship with this game.The story mode is ing amazing and is like being a part of a movie. I absolutely loved it.GTA Online is a different story. The community is as toxic as it is friendly and its a gamble whether or not you get to play wth competent people. Thats not the games fault though. I havent had too many interactions with modders/hackers although I dont play a ton. You definitely have to grid to get what you want but part of me loves that aspect since you actualy get a feeling of accomplishment even though it does get tedious at times.Final summation Story mode is a masterpiece and Online could use some work. I do reccomend this game especially if it is on sale.
