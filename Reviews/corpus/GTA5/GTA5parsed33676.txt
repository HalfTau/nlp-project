Rockstar and TakeTwo suddenly decided to ban all mods from the game. While I dont play the game with mods myself, this is definately NOT okay and should be considered a very ominous move on the developers behalf. Mods keeps games alive and interesting and good modsupport, as the biggest strength of countless games.Would Skyrim still be played as much, if not because of the countless mods it has? Definately not. Rockstar is moving on risky ground here and we should do what we can to make them realize their stupidity and force them back onto the right track.Also, the mod was banned on false grounds. The statement says it allowed players to mod the online experience, while the mod never supported online features and actively BLOCKS you from entering online mode if the mod is installed. And the online servers are still full of hackers, just like always, so this did exactly NOTHING to reduce the amount of cheating in online, and thus, the only people losing here, are the modders and the users of them.Rockstar, you greatly dissappoint me
