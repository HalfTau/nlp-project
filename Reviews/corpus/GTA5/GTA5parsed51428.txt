I purchased the Steam verion of GTA V specifically for modding, even though Ive owned the PS4 version for years. With the sudden issuing of a CeaseandDesist letter from TakeTwo Interactive to the OpenIV developers, I have to say that I am no longer going to financially support anything that they produce or offer from here on out. This includes no longer following or watching big YouTubers who benefit from or are supported directly or indirectly by TakeTwo Interactive.I understand that TakeTwo Interactive is free to do anything that they see fit when protecting their properties, and what they have done is completely within their rights. But, at the same time, it is completely within our rights as consumers to no longer support them.
