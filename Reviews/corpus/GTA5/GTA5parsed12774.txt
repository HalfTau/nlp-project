GTA V is an amazing game but is riddled with modders online and Rockstar doesnt seem to do anything about it. Ive reported and blocked many modders but continue to see the same ones. I was minding my own business the other day in passive mode doing stunt jumps and a modder killed me, destroyed my personal vehicle, and crashed my game to the desktop. Its infuriating having to constantly make insurance claims after a modder destroys your personal vehicle while youre in passive mode, and even more infuriating having to constantly find a new session because every lobby seems to have at least one modder at all times.Until they crackdown on modding, I will not recommend this game to anyone looking to play it online.
