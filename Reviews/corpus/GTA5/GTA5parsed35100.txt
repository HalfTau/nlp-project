Game WAS great and fun! When I finished the story I started modding and it really made me like the game. Now the s at Take Two are gonna ban modding!? Modding is what more than half of use PC GTA players do! All the work the mod developers put into their mods now just wasted! And then especially all the work the makers of Open IV put into modding is just ruined! Imso are the other 50,000 people and counting!  T2
