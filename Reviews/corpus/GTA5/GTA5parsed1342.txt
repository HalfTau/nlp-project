If youre buying this to play online solo DONT!Its not fun, just a huge grind while getting killed by fighter jets and annoyed by hackers.If youre buying this to play online with friends Buy it!Messing around and having fun with friends is really great but also the only consistant way to have fun playing GTA Online.If youre buying this for story modeReally? Now? In 2018? Sure... go ahead... I guess...I recommend that you have a friend to play Online with before buying. I just dont know if I would recommend GTA V just for SP nowadays... Maybe thats just because ive played it on PS3 back in 2013If youre buying this for modsLots of fun, just not worth 60 euros. Make sure you have a friend to play online with.
