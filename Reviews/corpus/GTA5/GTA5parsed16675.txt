The perfect loading simulator, works best on sht computers! 11/10 IGNEdit At the time of writing the first review it still did at least open. Now it doesnt even open anymore. Missing files, broken files, verified like 4 times, reinstalled 3 times, wasted about 300gb of data on this game in the last few days.My decision is final....uninstall for good.0/10
