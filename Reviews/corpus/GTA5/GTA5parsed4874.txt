Great game. Single player story is fantastic. Even if it was released years ago, it doesnt feel like it at all. However, the online multiplayer aspect is a huge joke. It used to be good and reasonable but now everything is expensive and unless you got the patience to grind for money or you have a lot of real cash to burn for some bs microtransaction thats way overpriced, youre not gonna be able to experience around 5060 of the content anytime soon. Not to mention the amount of griefers and modders nowadays.Id still recommend it but you have to keep in mind what I just said above or else youre in for frustration and a bad time online.
