Gta 5 story mode, Love it, great story, nice characters, not too hard missions.my experience with Gta online Ok, you start out with a gun so you can rob banks and play easy missions. If you dont want to grind for about 2 months for 1 million dollar, youll have to pay or mod. All new dlcs just focus on the players with cash. Like the CEO update, me and my friend wouldnt be able to play if our friend didnt mod.With this i want to say, if Rockstar wouldve add dlcs that focus on poor players, it wouldve maybe brought me back. But if you have money to spend on the game and shark cards and want to do it, or if you like to grind.As i said this is my experience
