Well I did love this game for a long time and even dabbled in the online a bit but I really loved the LSPDFR modifications and a lot of the addons from many wonderful content creators but Take twos recent actions that targeted a modding tool that so many people used for great things to make their game what they wanted is just a blatant and intolerable attack on the GTA community as a whole.
