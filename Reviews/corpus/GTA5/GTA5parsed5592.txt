Great Game, spoilt by the microtransactions that every developer seems to want to force down players throats. Its either pay to win, or grind forever.That said, there is plenty of original content here, in both single and multi player modes. Single player is amazing from start to finish. Multi player is better with friends, as public lobbies quickly turn toxic and most recently hackers have become a problem again. The multi player heists are the best part of the game in my opinion.Some of the missions are very grindy, but given the choice Rockstar made to turn everything in microtransactions, thats pretty much a given.Know what youre getting into, and the game is alot of fun.
