Great game, bad publishers! How can you just punish the whole community because of a few rotten eggs? Why not work proactively work with the people who create the mods for the community to enjoy them? Both companies have gone down in my estimations! Not recommended in its current form!For the record this game has got to be my all time favourite, along with all of the other games in the grand theft auto series. The singleplayer has a depth and structure that is rivalled by no other game in the same genre. And then there is the multiplayer where most people spend there time on GTA nowadays. The multiplayer is just outstanding, the fact that it is continually updated free of charge is great and keeps it fresh, although you can clearly see this business model is done to gain extra cash through the shark cards. But it works! I enjoy the grind to earn the cash for all of the new gadgets and gear. Dont let my playtime of this game on steam fool you, I have played over 600 hours on the PS4 excluding singleplayer and then the time I put into it on the PS3. Once I am confident that the publisher TakeTwo will not interfere with the positive modding community I will of course say that this is a game that you must have in your collection.
