if you can get passed all the modders and griefers in the online portion of gta then you should get the game for a great online mmo type experience.     6/10 imosingle player campaign is really good and if you have a mod menu then there are some really good mods you can do for single player such as 2017 graphics mod that makes it look realistic asfuq.    10/10 imo for single player
