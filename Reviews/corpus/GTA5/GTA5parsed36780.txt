Oh no, all these negative reviews will stop the last 2 of the population that doesnt already own GTA V from buying it! Guys. Really?Anyway, I never posted a review for GTA V though I beat it on the PS3 originally and then played a lot of multiplayer and some of the story on the PC and found the experience to be very smooth and enjoyable. Actually, now that Im typing this up I realized Ive gotten a nicer monitor and a higher end video card since I installed and played this, maybe its time to give it another spin...
