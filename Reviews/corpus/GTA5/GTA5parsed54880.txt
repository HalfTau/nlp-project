I own 3 copies of this game. Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Take 2 have forced so many microtransactions into this game the multiplayer is more grindy than a free to play game. Now they are forbiding us from using Mods in single player so that we will end up playing the multiplayer as lots of the new content is LOCKED in multiplayer only!!! WTF
