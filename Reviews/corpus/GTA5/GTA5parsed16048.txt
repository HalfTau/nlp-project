Ive been on the fence with Steam for about a month now trying to get my money back for this game.Ive been trying for almost a year now to get this game to run on my laptop and keep getting error message after error message. Steam is no Help either is Rockstar.I can not write a positive review of this game as I have only played it for 30 seconds before it crashes.
