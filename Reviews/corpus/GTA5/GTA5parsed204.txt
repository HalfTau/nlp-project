ING WANK GAME DO NOT BUY!If you treat yourself to a what seems to be a fun game of heists, the  checkpoints basically make you start the ENTIRE ING MISSION AGAIN when you die 0.00078 seconds before the end. If you buy this game, the most logical thing to do is hack otherwise you will be starting missions again and again and again, which is Rockstar trying to make more people spend time on their ING ABYSMAL game. God mode wil save lots of problems, and hopefully also anger Rockstar because they CANT MAKE CHECKPOINTS properly. Also to make matter work, Steam needs to fix its  CRASHING ISSUES and when I was trying to write this review, the ING APPLICATION CRASHED, causing the salt in my veins to leak causing a HUGE contraction in my shoulder muscle, producing a very large BANG at midnight.Anyway, save yourself the money and DONT BUY THIS GAME!
