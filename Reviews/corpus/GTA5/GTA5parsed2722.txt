Multiplayer is 100 locked behind insane paywalls that all but mandate you spend actual money on the game to have fun. Doomsday heist is most egregious with something like 12 multipart setup missions that are just fetch quests other players can interfere with, but you can pay to skip them!Everything in the multiplayer costs money to do. Literally everything. You will not have fun unless you spend actual money on this game.Also every lobby is full of a combination of children and hackers who will shoot everything that moves in vehicles that cost 50 in real money, most of the game modes are dead, and maybe 2 of the original 5 heists are actually fun to do. Dont play without friends, dont waste money, go play Payday if you want fun heisting and TrackMania or BeamNG if you want fun racing.
