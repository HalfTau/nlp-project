As much as I love GTA V and Rockstar Games, I cannot condone TakeTwos stifling of OpenIV. For those who dont know, TakeTwo, the publisher of GTA V, sent a cease and desist letter to the developers of the modding application OpenIV. TakeTwo forced the OpenIV developers to completely stop any distribution or development of the OpenIV application. This removes any modding capabilities for anyone unlucky enough to not have OpenIV already downloaded. In addition, as the OpenIV creators have stated, even using OpenIV puts you in potential legal jeopardy against TakeTwos legal team.I just dont see the reasoning behind this move from TakeTwo. Shutting down the modding of a game, two years after its PC release mind you, is both unprecedented and nonsensical. The modding community continually and faithfully breathes new life into GTA V. It allows millions of gamers to tailor GTA V to get the exact experience that they want. And they do it without ever charging a dime, only asking in return that the user gets the same amount of enjoyment that the modders do. Modding was the exact reason why I bought GTA V for PC despite already owning it on the PS3. On the PS3, GTA V was a good, but in my opinion, inferior game to GTA IV. On PC with mods, GTA V to me became the best GTA title by far. With the removal of OpenIV, GTA V is effectively downgraded from an alltime great game to something far more pedestrian a solid but ultimately forgettable GTA game plagued by a short singleplayer mode and a microtransaction infested multiplayer mode.Please, TakeTwo, let OpenIV operate freely once again. Modding drives more people to buy your games, not less. I think I speak for everyone when I say that by taking down OpenIV, youre only hurting yourselves.
