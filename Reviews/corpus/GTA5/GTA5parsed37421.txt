This is the first I ever seen a company go full retard into modding with out looking up the facts. OpenIV was just a viewer and yet you could NOT play GTA V Online after using OpenIV to change stuff. If I want to Play a CRAPPY game I could of just shelled out tons of dollars Electronic Arts for one crappy game. Monetizing is ok. But Take Two has took it to a new level of making it so you HAVE to pay or hack for it. GTA V Online was a let down from the start when it started on the Xbox360 and Playstation3. Yes, GTA V Online needs to be protected from harmful players but players that are not being harmful are being harmed, not by the harmful players but from how the money system works in GTA V Online. I never had high hopes for GTA V Online and now the player community is more heart broken as ever. The only reason I build a gaming computer was to play GTA V... now I want all the money I spent back. Great going Take Two, you earn the lowest of the low reward, your grave has been set.
