After my many hours of gta online game play i can say that i have had fun. I even supported rockstar with some shark card cash. But now with the CD sent to OpenIV and the modding community. i dident play the story on PC and i could have played online on my PS3. I was safe and the mods were the code, and until the CD is formly retracted consider your safe code changed.
