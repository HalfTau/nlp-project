Rockstar should do something about the mod/hacker in the online session. You cant go into online session without being get in risk of getting banned Which I was once. Never used mod or hack, However I still got 7 days ban. Also its get pretty much boring now, dont play unless you have a group of friends to play with you or you prefer to play on singleplayer.
