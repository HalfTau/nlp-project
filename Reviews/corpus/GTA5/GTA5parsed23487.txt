Incredibly . Was banned for beeing in a session with a cheater that gave everyone money. This is not my problem if i exit the session as soon as possible so as to not beeing associated with the person, but to get banned for it is just idiotic. Do NOT recommend. Rockstar is also a money hungry tain on the internet that pumps out stuff that costs millions, while new players like me who enjoyed all the previous installments get into the game late are going to have a  time getting steamrolled by tanks, hydras, valkyries and all other veichles of mass destruction while trying to scrounge for a few dollars. Honestly the idea that players can not have free control over a server is also moronic! We should be able to have our own servers where we mod/cheat/grind or what ever you feel like such as the previous games. Do NOT buy, it is NOT worth your money.
