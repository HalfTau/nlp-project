Well done Rockstar. After 10 yeasr tolerating OpenIV with great mods etc. and thus benefiting from them since more any more poeple buy the games to play crazy mod stuff with friends etc. NOW you mention that this could give a bad experience for the online part of the game but you just could not be othered to invest money in getting rid of cheaters in other ways...You did not even try to find better ways WITH them to still get the modding supported but do efectively something agains the Cheating idiots. I bet they could have helped....Now hopefully less people will buy it since it doent even support 2/3 rds of all youtube videos they can watch and wanted to try themselves...I personally CANNOT recommend this game any more since the SP is already through and meeting with friends and doein crazywith mods has been stabbed in the herat by Rockstar themselves.
