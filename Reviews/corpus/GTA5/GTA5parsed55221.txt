The publisher has recently sent a cease and desist letter to modders who run one of the most instrumental mods to GTA modding since 97. Given that the primary reason to buy this game on PC at all is to mod it I cant begin to recommend this title in light of these recent actions. Declaring modding illegal use of software is a step much too far as modders are the lifeblood of these games post launch window.
