I really love the Grand Theft Auto series, however since they took down OpenIV i cannot give this game a good review. The whole online mod for this game is based around either grinding your balls off or spending your hard earned money on  shark cards. I have always loved GTA for the single player content and they seem to have really left something to be desired this time around. Being that the online mode is full of content you can conclude that  they are trying to manipule their playerbase to spend all of there time playing online to increase there online cash sales. OpenIV allowed players to not only mod singleplayer content but also enjoy the singleplayer mode of this game with as much content as you want without playing online. Rockstar really did shoot themselves in the foot by putting an end to OpenIV. Its a shame that this company had to stoop to these levels by trying to manipulate players into spending money on ridiculously exspensive online content and also take a core feature such as the ability to mod games. I honestly find this ing ridiculous and will not be supporting rockstar in the future because of this.
