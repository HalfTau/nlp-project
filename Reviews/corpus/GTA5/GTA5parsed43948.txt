EDIT We did it. OpenIV is back, and as of  6/29/17 the OpenIV team is prepping to make an announcement, but there is an update on the site. I will keep the statement I wrote when OpenIV had to shut down. But I will recommend this game again.Before 6/29/17All 207 hours on this game are SP. I lived by the mods. They were the only thing keeping the game alive and interesting.After playing the 360 version since launch, I learned that GTA Online is not somewhere you want to be. This has been one of my favorite games to play whenever Im bored. But now its uninstalled. I wont ever play it again unless this situation is fixed.Too bad.
