Im a GTA gamer since Grand Theft Auto 3. GTA V is good game but developer filtered too much. Removing excitement of other players. They removed the mods but they cant remove all cheaters. They put on 60 on sale to cover all negative feedbacks and keep the game on trending.Im not a modder btw. And pls R, pls fix the always error signin directly to online and always stuck at loading screen!
