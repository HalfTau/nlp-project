Oh lord where do I start. Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best selling video games of all time, people love it so much than when it finally released on PC many people who already owned it on consoles rebought it. The game provides and endless amount of opportunity and stunning visuals. You can be a executive sitting on smoking a cuban in a golden private jet on your way to your yacht, or be a criminal and do the exact same thing. Who am I kidding, you all already what the damn game is so lets get to the juicy stuff. The game is full of hackers, I have literally never entered a server without one, some are harmlessly spawing themselves in money, while others are getting others banned. It is an awesome game and I love it, but the hacker aspect of it literally almost made me press does not reccomend.
