Does not deserve all these bad reviews. This game online is litterally unplayable becuase of how easy it is to hack, Theres people complaining about the hackers and how its unplayable, soon as they take action people complain about them stopping modding. Blame the kids that use the mods in the wrong way. Theres plenty of games that dont have mods that have good reviews this doesnt deserve bad ones becuase of Take Two.This is a really good strong game, with more content than most others of its genre and more being added every month.The only downside is the amount of money you need to buy new vehicles, but thats mainly because of the amount of people running around with 90 billion dollars.Buy the game if you want a good game to play, Dont buy the game if you want to mod it.
