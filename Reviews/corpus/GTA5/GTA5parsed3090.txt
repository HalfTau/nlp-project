Great freaking game...if you stick to Singleplayer. Horrible rageinducing mess if you try multiplayer.Play for the story mode and you will see why this game is an alltime classic. Play for the online modeand you will either be grinding your goolies off for enough money just for a cheap apartment or payingout theto get anything remotely useful and cool. All the while youre at the mercy of several childrenwho are always going after you with their expensive toys so they can gank you again and again for funsies.Story mode, youll be planning and executing very engaging heists. Online mode, youll be coughing upingame and real money left and right, paying for vehicles and then the insurance costs for said vehiclesbecause every time you go outside your garage, some tosser with a doubledigit IQ and a modding tool thathe downloaded from some Russian website spawns several explosions directly on you. Then when you respawn,hell teleport you to some faroff location, surround you with fences and spawn a UFO on you.Grand Theft Auto V Proof that there is a contest to produce the most genetically repressed child.
