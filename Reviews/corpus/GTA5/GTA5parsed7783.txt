I only play the online part of the game and its actually really fun, but rockstar has to deal with these modders that is ruining the gameplay for others, like I had to spend aton of money for ammos just cause a modder decided to take all of my ammos. Like come on, its been 5 years since this game has been released and theres still modders walking around and instead of them being banned they just get to be youtubers.
