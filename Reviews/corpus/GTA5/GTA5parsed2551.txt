this game is full of hackers and modders that ruin the gameplay for other and not only that,but those people also get people like me banned because they just dont care and they just want to ruin everyone elses life.Its hard to believe how large the consequence for me was because now im banned until the 14th of february and all online data is reset.I wont forgive those who cheat the system and make others suffer for their actions and not only that but pointing at Rockstar for not giving aabout putting in an anticheat and a better detector.I hope other people understand my pain.AND Rockstar, I hope you dont screw up Gta 6 like you did this one.
