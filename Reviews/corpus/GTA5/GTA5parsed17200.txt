My PC is outstanding and both my game and drivers are all up to date. Game does not open. Upon trying to log in to Rockstar Games and synchronize my saves with the cloud, the game fails to open. I am hearing reports of multiple other users having the same issues. It had worked enough in the past to allow me to play through the storyline and even purchase a few shark cards. Cant recommend buying until this issue is resolved. 8/29/2017
