This game has become a blatant cash grab. I have lost all of my respect for Rockstar and will never purchase one of their games again as long as they continue this microtransaction infestation of good games. Rockstar is dead to me in the same way EA died long ago. Stop being so damned stupid Rockstar and get your sht together.
