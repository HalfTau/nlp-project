so, Grand Theft Auto 5. It is a really good game, open area to do what you want to do, like drive a car in 100 MPH in full stocked traffic, to flying planes in the highway.It has alot of mission to do, big and small.It is a big game i agree on that  6070 GBBut that just means more good stuff,exampleGood graphic, really detailed.Good mechanics.Good OnlineGood rulesGood missionsGood and pretty cars.Good and dangerous cars.yeah and along with 500 other stuff.Yes it is true that if you mod like money  WITCH IS HACKING! You will be banned from online for a month.But that is good! Who wants hackers with infinite lives and money to ruin your gameplay? NO ONE!So, yes you can mod on singleplayer, but just deactivate them and get on online.Yes it is a bit expensive, but that is because they spent alot to make it, and also alot of stuff in it so it makes sense.If you have actually  had the time to read all this, Thanks!By the way if you are a hacker on GTA V...please dont ever play online with mods. please dont.
