Flying cars and bikes are cool, but it would be more cool if I didnt have to go through 2 pay walls just to customize my oppressor Online Is trash now, DLCs just add more pay walls and they are charging 6.5 million for the lazer. YES A LAZER, you can get a lazer for FREE if you steal one from a military base... A hydra which is almost the EXACT same as a lazer will cost you 3.5 million less. Dont even get me started on the over priced Super cars. Dont waste your money, there are plenty more great games that wont set you back a couple hundred dollars just so you dont have to spend a week grinding just so you can afford ONE Super car. If I have to spend 40 just to get a T20, I would atleast expect it to have atleast some additions to it. The only thing youre paying for is the convenience of not having to waste an extra 2 minutes to drive across the map. Its just a waste of money, all youre paying for is another paywall.
