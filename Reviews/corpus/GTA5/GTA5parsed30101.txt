Rockstar doesnt care to fix the horrible hacking problem in the multiplayer. Constantly getting blown up by a modder every single time you spawn? Lol who cares. Got someone running around with infinite health and can kill you in one hit? Who cares. Someone dropped you one million dollars? OK NOW LISTEN HERE YOU LITTLEGET YOUR ACCOUNT WIPED EVEN THOUGH IT WASNT EVEN YOUR FAULT. WE DONT CARE ABOUT ALL THE OTHER HACKERS WE ONLY CARE ABOUT THE ONES THAT GIVE YOU MONEY BECAUSE IT DIPS INTO OUR SHARK CARD SALES. Honestly Rockstar, go kill yourself. So annoying when every time you join a server theres someone cheating. How long have you had to fix this? 3 years? They wont fix it, because they simply dont care, because weve already bought the game, and thats all theyve used us for.
