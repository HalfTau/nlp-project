Well Its been 10 years that im playing games and right before the 13th june of 2017 it was the best game i ever played in my life including Online  Story   Developer Support team Content added to the open source online  gtao  too many cool easter eggs ...also this game contains an easter egg  mystery  that havent been solved and its ranked as biggest gaming mystery in history  M.t Chiliad mystery  and too many stuff which makes this game one of the best games of all the time....unlike every DLC in Rockstar games past this DLC was worst DLC or Update while it was expected to be the best and it was the most waited dlc ever till 13th june/2017 ...........Thats how kept me hooked to this game for 2027 hours playing this game ...but now ...let me tell you something  this new DLC changed my mind ...its the worst online game ive ever played WHY????? because SKILL is DEADbecause Rockstar added Explosive Rounds for aWHAT THE  DUDE ?????? OO Rockstar already added railgun which fires HE roundsTRUST ME IF you complain about Hydra griefers ...please shut the  up WHY???!!!! because  1The player who flies the Hydra is definatly skilled enough to handle the fastest stuff to kill a little point  you  on the ground and it needs skills...to handle ..but what about HE rounds on sniper ...No skills...no talent ..just shoot and youre good Tank which has 60tons of armor is useless a Military jet which costs 3.000.000 is useless 2 Their modded money fixing machine which fixed and removed modded cash removed my own earned money I had total 25.500.000 and a modder droped me 8.000.000 when i was in loading screen so ...Yeah they removed all my money ..my 3months of hard gta work...ive sent Email to Rockstar support about the modded money and they replied  oh yeah yeah sure well fix it...after the update they took 24.000.000 gta cash out of my account in the other hand i had a friend who was paid by modders 3.000.000.000 GTA dollars and before the update he had something like 300.000.000 so ..yeah after the DLC came he still had 70.000.000 WOW D i love you and your computer devices Rockstar...Please check this video from  fellow YouTuber  Shuffle Gamer and watch the video from 600 ...now i got my answer Thanks tp YouTuber SG Channel by this way....and another thing that i want to tell is I was a serious hater of GTAO Modders ...but now ...i say they were our friends rather than Rockstar because they gived us money while Rockstar blocks the ways to make money in GTAO like  it encourages players to attack other players shipments...stuff and they ruin some ways to make money like Kuruma method in Pacific Standard Job heist that wasnt realy a glitch...i got a hell out of stuff to proove you why...yeah come and PM me if you wanna know....the last thing is they forced OpenIV to close the bussiness and no modding are legal...it means if you mod and byby you go to jail ???? lol The OpenIV provides Windows softwares so its not cool to do this....if they want to play tough just play with modders themselvs ...anyways lets pray for Rockstars future...This game is ruined this game is dead ...13th of june 2017 is the death of GTA Online ...Rest in peace gta ...rest in peace Rockstar games....you lost one of your biggest fans who was a wrangler to his many friends to say gtao is best...but...............dear players dont buy this game and dont play it anymore....GOOD BYE Rockstar games !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
