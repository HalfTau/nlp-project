This will be a single player review only because my  PC cant handle the online portion of the game.Grand Theft Auto V is an amazing game simply said, the story, charachters and the world itself will nail you to your chair and you will want to see it through ASAP, this really is one of the best open world games of all times.Sadly, publisher of GTA V Take Two Interactive  decided it would be a good idea to shut down single player mods, content that gratly expands the lifetime of the game and in no way affects the online portion.While you have a lot to do in this gameworld after completing the game that ammount of content cant be measured with the work modding community has done over the years.In conlusion this is a great game but the greed of the publisher is causing it troubles now, a few years after its release, I will recommend this game because I had a lot of fun for my money but I am hoping they will bring back mods so I can continue enjoying this masterpiece.
