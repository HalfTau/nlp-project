What I liked about having this game on PC? BEING ABLE TO USE MODS LIKE MENYOO!Rockstar Editor is absolute garbage, you cant do anything useful with it apart from changing camera angle, and now I cant use mods to make decent videos.Take Two claim theyve pulled mods to stop hackers, but what theyve actually done is crushed the GTA community and slit the throats of the fandom who hunger for new content in the form of pictures and videos.These mods have been active for years, why pull them now? It makes no sense and its killed the creativity of hundreds if not thousands of people who have produced these mods in the first place or use them to create content for GTA fans. Mods are literally the only thing giving this game life, and they just pulled the plug on them!Take Two suck. I dont care how good RDR2 will be, GTA 6 may as well never happen for me, because unless something is done to reinstate the existing mods I will never buy another game associated with T2, and if it were possible Id be taking action against them to claim money back for downloading GTA5 from Steam AND buying the damn disks and getting a gaming PC specifically for modding to make videos.Take Two are either too lazy, or too stupid to find a way to block hackers and instead theyve just crushed a community of people who just want to have fun offline/in story mode. We werent hurting anyone, least of all Take Two and now years of peoples hard work and investment have gone down the drain because of T2s greed and stupidity.Take Two, youre a disgrace. I hope you never make another penny until you do something to correct this mess.
