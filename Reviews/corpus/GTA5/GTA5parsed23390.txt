Its really a good game, but they dont know how to make it better.I dont care about OPEN IV because I never gonna play this game again until they make story DLC, but when I heard about blocking mod, I knew what they want.Rockstar doesnt want us to play story mod. They dont want to develop this game.They just want us to buy BigSharks, over and over.I know this problem was exsist long ago. GTA online is keep making expensive contents, and too hard to afford sowe should buy shark to buy it or doing pacific heist over and over again.Doing CEO work can get lots of money, but you know it get tones of money cant afford for playerBut blocking mod was disgust me. They literally shout Dont play single, play online and keep buying damn card! at our face.If you gonna buy this game for playing single campaign, go ahead. Its fun.But if you gonna buy this for playing online, dont. you gonna regret. ITS NOT GONNA BE FUN.unless you have sht tons of money for buying sharks.NEVER BUY IT,  except you gonna buy this only for single play.Really hope that Rockstar dont make red dead redemption like this.
