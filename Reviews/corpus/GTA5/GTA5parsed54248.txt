This game causes nothing but stress. Since it came out on the first consoles, the menus, the dropouts, the lack of efficiency has ruined the game.it is sad because it is such a great game, but rockstar puts not effort into fixing what needs to be fixed. They just keep releasing new content.And now they crack down completely on all modding because they did not put enough resources into keeping online safe from modding. They even took away money tha was not modded from players and people still accepted it and were ready to continue to play, but they took it too far.Fix your menus, fix starting jobs, fix the stupid grind of the game. and then worry about modders. Modders exist because the game lacks in so many ways.
