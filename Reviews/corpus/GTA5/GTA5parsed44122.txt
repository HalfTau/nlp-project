On the behalf of OpenIV and the whole modding community, down with Take2.The game itself isnt bad, used to be better but greed ultimately destroyed the experience, GTA Online is currently a 60 gateway into a pay2win grindfest comparable to the worst of the worst mobile F2P games.It also isnt technically perfect, mouse support to day still remains very basic and even whats there isnt done right.Its not a game worth getting anymore, GTA Online was never worth it, campaign is solid but what sold the game was modding potential which has been killed by Take2.
