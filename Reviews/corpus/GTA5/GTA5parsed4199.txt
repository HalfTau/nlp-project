Summary  Single Player is okay, Online is full of trolls and aholes, and its more grindy than hardcore mmo raid guilds.I dont even slightly recommend the online version of this game. That seems harsh, but its true. Single player is okay, but very short. Heres a summary of my online experience Spend a lot of time getting killed at low levels by people in helicopters, jets, armored cars, basically anything because I cant afford better stuff.dont understand how the companies / warehouses work, so I didnt get a good warehouse and gaining money is slow.making money takes a stupid long time.. spend like 10 hours of grinding at least for one car or gun.community is full of trolls and aholes.open lobbies are mediocre at best... just sort of an annoying way to get from one job to the next or do sidemissions.
