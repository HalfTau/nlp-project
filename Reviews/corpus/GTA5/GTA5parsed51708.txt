I originally would have wholeheartedly recommended this game before take two decided to attempt an assassination on the GTA 5 modding community. They have recently released a statement saying that they are trying to support the modding comunity whilst fixing an issue that they had with open 4, but as they say this they have almost over night obliterated 60 of the mods for GTA5, as most of them use open 4 and there fore have been discontinued as well.In conclusion I have to give it a negative review because we as a comunity need to stand up for the little guys, that love this game and there fore spend thousands of their own hours, creating single player mods to keep the GTA community interested in the game whilst not messing with the online side of things only to get crushed and spat on by the company that they look up to. Such a shame that the big companies are all ran money men. Hopefully though this issues will be sorted by the devs and the creative community can have their fn again.
