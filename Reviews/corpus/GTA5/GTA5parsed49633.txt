This whole OpenIV shutdown is Take Two Interactive/Rockstars fault for not preventing mods ONLINE.  Take Two and Rockstar has NO ONE to blame but THEMSELVES.  Modding is what keeps this game popular.  Without mods, this game would get boring as fk after replaying the story over and over and doing the same thing evertime.FK YOU TAKE TWO AND ROCKSTAR!
