Rockstar must love ing things up by allowing modder to mod. But they are ing things up even more by banning mods instead of banning the modders online. Dont buy this game in its current state. Random innocent individuals are getting banned for no valid reason and fckstar takes GTA Online money away from innocent people like me and you too. Today I lost 1,300,000 online because of this ttery. Go  yourself rockstar or star
