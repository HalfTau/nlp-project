Honestly the game is going down hill. First every new update that add cool weapons cost more than the last one. Second they dont have any real means of getting money besides months of gameplay or over priced shark cards. Last but not least selling your product gets really annoying. Consider either removing the time limit on every god dam mission or stop forcing people whos friends are offline to play with others. lets face it you dont gain anything by helpping out another person. At least not enough to make some profit off of it. Then again im sure someone will say you can make a profit after hundreds of hours of gameplay.
