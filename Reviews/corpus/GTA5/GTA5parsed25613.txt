The content releases have been GREAT! The downside is that Rockstar / TakeTwo are massively cashing in on ingame micro transactions. This has made all the new, fun, content nearly inaccessible. Its a shame that they seemingly designed the game around those shark cards.With the addition of the recent backlash from the modding community it has brought this game down from an alltime favorite to something rather dissapointing. The game could have still been great... but it left me with a bitter taste and I wouldnt recommend it anymore.
