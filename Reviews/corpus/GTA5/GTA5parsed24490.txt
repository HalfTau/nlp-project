GTA5 the most fascinating is that its shape lo st this virtual city, excellent animation making lo st this virtual city seemed so real, natural environment, geological features are impressive. And not only is it big, but the GTA5 is also giving a lesson to other open world games in terms of filling sanddish content. In addition to the plotline, the abundance of strangers and weirdos, random tasks, hobbies, and pastimes can be a lasting obsession in this open world of sand. Its fair to say that you only feel like you have too much fun to play in the game and you dont know where to start, and you dont feel like you have to repeat or have nothing to do. The game is very rich and I dont want to take the game out of my PS3.What I like most about the story is trev, his dare to hate, his straightforward personality makes me very much looking forward to it, even though he has a lot of craziness, but it also highlights the charm of the character. Game has three end, and I do but I think most people should choose the third way the ending, Steve, DE all these story for us to hate guy kill, feeling really very few.GTA5, of course, is not perfect, too few pedestrians on the road that its a pity, for lo st is set in Los Angeles, the bustling downtown pedestrian is really strange. It is also regrettable that the existence of the GTAOL has led to the absence of a single scenario, DLC.Overall, its fair to say that GTA5 is a great thing to say, not a decade, or at least one of the most difficult things to do in five years. Hope Rockstar can bring more surprises to us in GTA6! As for me, after GTA5, I intend to continue to explore luoshengdu, and take the series of old works out and play with them again, and fall in love with this series.
