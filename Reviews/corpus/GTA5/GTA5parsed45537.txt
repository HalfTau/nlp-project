This game in its current state is more wrecked than Syria right now.Before the Gun Running update, me and a few friends were playing gta online for a bit, doing CEO missions because one of us could actually get an office. One of my friends tells us about an injector script that gives you 5 million every second. I downloaded it, reluctantly, thinking this was another virus or shutdown script prank to my surprise it worked, and before I knew it I had the maze bank tower and 30 x80s in case they did a money purge, it was only a rumor at the time, but I hardly believed it would happen. About a week after using it were playing around with the newI got. going around either killing random players we come across or doing pvp fights with eachother. One of my friends buys an OPENIV mod menu the day before the cease and desist, and we were all on a flying yacht for the next 20 minutes.The next day, back on online mode, I spawn in my office, and get on a call with friends, only to hear that they were all perma banned everyone but me and the guy with the now useless mod menu  he got banned a few hours later. What the  rockstar? I am still not banned, and I still have about 5 x80s left they even patched the injector script, so dont get any ideas but the point is that I hacked money in game and Im still not banned yet, while my friends that havent modded or gotten any large sums of money from drops.Now Im going to touch on something else overpriced DLC items.Im going to be really brief, but unless you are able to shell up 100 to buy the cheapest hangar with one of the new 50 planes, your out of luck. Go play some other good game, like one of the Fallout games, or maybe KSP before its destroyed by T2.Fix yourRockstar/Take Two. Unless you fix your game, Im not planning on changing this review or playing your  games.
