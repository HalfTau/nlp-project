What can I say? Its packed with a vast ton of activities and customization options for your character. Plus, the Online part is a ton of fun two. Minus the hackers, that is. And the complete grind for money. Still, single player mode is an actionpacked ride of thrilling and epic proportions. GTA Online is fun, too. If you have friends to play with. Playing by yourself is a guaranteed way you probably wont achieve most Heists since pickupgroups tend to be idiots who wipe more than they simply disconnect for no reason. Tldr Buy and try during the sale. Also, Shark Cards? No. Just...no. You paid enough as it is.
