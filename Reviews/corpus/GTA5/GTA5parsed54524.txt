Microtransactions already kinda ruined GTA but I was willing to look past it and just enjoy the game without buying any. But banning single player mods OpenIV who had bedn used for the last 10 years is horrible and Rockstar and Take Two should be ashamed of themselves.Edit This issue has now been fixed but it still doesnt change the fact that this should not be forgottenIm keeping the review negative because of their microtransactions being pushed down everyones throat. If youre buying the game for the single player, its great... Just dont expect much of GTA Online
