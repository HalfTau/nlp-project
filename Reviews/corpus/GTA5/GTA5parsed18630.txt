For all the trash culture GTA gets slammed with, GTA V is probably one of the most amazing stories and well produced things out there. Yes its trashy, but in actuality GTA gets less trashy with each new game. This is more like a crime drama with bits of absurdity, somewhere around the realm of Fight Club. Yeah its a video game, but its a serious tale of people unhappy with their lot in life, or just too crazy to care and they do what they do. The stupidest stuff in the game is really just satire about how ridiculous our real world is and how fake reality has become. Theres little point in reviewing the game part funny enough, either you know what GTA is or you dont at this point. Its 3rd person, its a shooting and driving game. It can also be played in 1st person, which is pretty interesting and not as gimmicky as you might think. Expect to dump hours into this, if you also get into the online play you can pretty much disappear from society.
