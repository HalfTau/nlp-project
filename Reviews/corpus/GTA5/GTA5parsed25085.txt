i do not recomend for now, Rockstar is banning peoples for having modded money droped or given to you, even if you are a poor victime of it,they will ban entire session if ther is a single modder in that session resulting in a  23 innocent and 1 modder bannedeven if you are a day one player with 4 years of games time and experiance, you will lose all that time,someone on reddit got banned because a modder , and has lost his 45 years of gaming for being innocentin the end, ROCKSTAR will ban legit and innocent players , but wil do absolutly nothing to cheater/hacker/modderto avoid this game absolutly !
