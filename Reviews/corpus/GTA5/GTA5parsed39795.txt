On behalf of everyone who was tired of mod menus in online, thank you rockstar.On behalf of all modders out there, you are arockstar, but thats your usual MO as far as mods go.On my own behalf, I dont give aso long as the cheaters stop.GTAIV has had rampant cheaters for far to long, and sadly, people should realize, OpenIV and ScripthookIV were the first to break the lamesecurity rockstar put in. It wasnt until people started getting dropped that they made the single player only requirement, and even then, theres tutorials to get AROUND that and still use scripthookIV to load your stuff. Hell, menyoo used a modified or nearly identical DLL to scripthookIV to load.
