Dirty corporate swine. Take 2 and Rockstar There subsidiary in case people forgot. Have ruined there reputation as an overwhelmingly positive company recently with there terrible PR moves.Theyve taken the standpoint of we are mega rich therefor  being consumer friendly or pro gamer. Its all about that  bill and Take 2/Rockstar have lost a lot of respect.Worth mentioning that Rockstar had multiple single player expansions ready for this game. They chose to drop it in favour of there largest net income dlc. Shark Cards, which is what all this mod take down is all about.Multiplayer paid content. Modders cannot be allowed to interfere or offer insentive to play the game. That they cannot monetise.
