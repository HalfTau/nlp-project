The singleplayer was great for a while, but eventually there was just nothing fun left to do. So, I then got online. And its just impossible to do anything on there. I have a great system to play on, I have full internet connection, but I cant play a full heist without being taken out of thelobby for no reason. The game would freeze while loading me into singleplayer and online. The game was just repetitive. The biggest problem of all online? Money. Unless you have beeen playing online for a while you cant get enough money fast enough to have fun without using shark cards. So I do not recommend this game.
