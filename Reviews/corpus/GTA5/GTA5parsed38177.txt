I do not support Rockstar  Take Twos latest decision to outright ban mods. I kind of see their perspective and how they wish to crack down on Online modding, but banning mods as a whole shows how little they care about the community and how much they care about the integrity of their income, and lets be honest They make more money in a week than most of us make in a month.Rockstar  Take Two has been silent so far, and I cant blame them. Good luck trying to fix this PR nightmare.If youre still confused, GTA Series Videos does a wonderful job on explaining the situation
