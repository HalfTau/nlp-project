Want my money back. So after spending many hours and becoming a legit billionaire twice playing GTA Xbox I decided to purchase GTA PC. My thought was the single player sucked and was boring so using mods I can make single player fun and having a monster PC I could use the high end graphics mods.Thanks for ruining that TakeTwo. Guess I will go back to Skyrim and Fallout.
