This is a great singleplayer game with some okay multiplayer, but unfortunately the multiplayer has taken it over. I had to uninstall just because there are constant patches and ballooning install size all to add content to a multiplayer mode I dont play. The single player experience has not changed in literally years, but over 10 additional gigabytes of my hard drive have become inaccessible due to content I will never see. I wish Rockstar would break up the single and multi player so I could install only what I want, or I wish Steam would allow me to install previous versions. Right now Im tempted to pirate the game just so I have an older, smaller game with fully functioning single player.
