SingleplayerThe singleplayer is very fun. Characters are all interesting and have a great group dynamic. Story is a little shakey but interesting to follow.OnlineWay too many modders with no sign of them going away any time soon. Very grindy and abundant microtransactions. Only fun to play with a bunch of friends in private sessions.OverallIf youre going to pick up this game, I would highly recommend that you avoid playing online because of the forementioned modders and microtransaction. The online is really what ruins the game, and its sad to see all of the focus on online now rather than singleplayer getting any love. For this reason, I do not recommend the game.
