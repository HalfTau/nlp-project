The online can be fun for a while with some of the new game modes you get some good gameplay hours out of it, but it wasnt really for me . Modding is gone due OpenIV being shutdown, but more than likely will not stop hakers and cheaters online. GTA modding is my reason for buying and  Im not the only one if you look at other recent reviews.Mods will be missed  , this game was fun while it lasted. Last gta for me and Modders thanks for all your work! haha
