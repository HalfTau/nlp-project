I was already pretty annoyed with how Online was being handled, so the recent fiasco with mods really killed this game for me. Lets be honest  this game has been out for a few years now on multiple platforms, so there is a good chance youve played the singleplayer. As fantastic as that is, there isnt a need to buy the game just to play it again, and with mods gone, the only thing to really do is online, which is garbage.
