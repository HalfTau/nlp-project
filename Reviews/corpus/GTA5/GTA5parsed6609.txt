I started playing this game with mods and OpenIV, and if there was something wrong I uninstall it and install it back and my mods are gone and I download them back. Well I messed up on one of my files and uninstalled it and installed it back, and youre probably wondering that my files reseted, no they ing didnt, I reuninstalled it 2 more times and I still got a ing error on my game and now I cant even open my god damn game. Please fix this
