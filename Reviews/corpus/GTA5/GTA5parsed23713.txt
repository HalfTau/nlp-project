Well, To start, Cuckstar is acompany. They will ban anyone and take anyones even if its not your fault. 250 hours, level 231, tons of cars, garadges, and money Legit money, and i happend to join and online lobby with a modder, throwing moneybags on EVERYONE, Dev comes in, bans the whole server, and resets everyones account to defualt. And you cant even dispute it if its a mistake. So basicly, 250 hours of my life, playing legit. GONE, to cuckstar. And again ,with all this modding communitywith take two, they just cant let you have fun. Both companies just want your money, then they will happily ban your even if you wouldnt do nothing about it. Dont waste 60, or even 30 since its on sale at the time of me writing this, because its just gonna go to some fat money hungry european in an office.
