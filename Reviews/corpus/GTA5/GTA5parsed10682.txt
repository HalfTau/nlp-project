Fantastic game, could use a bit more of the small details even though it has many of them but in my opinion that would prove it even moreOne thing I hate about the online is facing other players who are much higher and have much better vehicles and equipment and they just bulley all low levels so maybe servers that arent PVP or level limited ones would be a nice additionOtherwise it is a really great game and that includes the single player as well
