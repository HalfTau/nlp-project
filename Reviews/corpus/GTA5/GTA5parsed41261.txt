The single player gameplay was a masterpiece an absolute blast.Online gameplay is buggy as hell and sucked.But the mods, the mods were glorious.Then TakeTwo decided to make a stronlgy anticonsumer, anticommunity move in essentially disallowing modding.TakeTwo is the scum of the earth and screw R too, just for good measure.They decided, years after release, to ruin what was one of the best games, and what was among my personal favorites.
