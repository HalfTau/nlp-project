Review based soley on the singleplayerI spent years waiting to play this and, I think Im disappointed with it. Not majorly, but it is a bit lacking. Its got the weakest characters and the weakest story Ive played in a GTA game. Im also not a big fan of the atmosphere.The first 15 or so hours are a blast though. My main issue with the game is that theres nothing to do in the world besides the missions. The open world itself is dull.The game length is incredibly long in a good way. I have 54 hours or so and 50 completion. Thats slightly more than an hour per percent. Not bad at all.Firstperson is an awesome, huge addition to the seriesPresentation is top knotchLots of vehicles and every different type of vehicleRadio stations are awesomeVoice acting is amazing for the most partThe world looks and feels aliveThe map is way better than GTA IVArtstyle is a huge improvement from GTA IVOptimization is a gigantic improvement from GTA IV. I get far more consistent framerates than GTA IV.Changing your car is awesomeWeapon modifying is hell awesomeCheats are coolVehicle physics arent great. Worse than GTA SA, and I personally preferred GTA IVs. Not bad though.Soundtrack sounds 80s and yet it isnt 80s?Sound design severely lacksGame is graphically showing ageNot a lot of music in the stations, and the picks are trashThe main characters are pretty 2DWhats the point in upgrading and fancying up vehicles if when you destroy them theyre gone forever? Besides the impound, but theres no picture of the vehicle youre picking.Whats the point in dressing up your character if they keep changing every time I swap to them?Game takes forever to start offEarning money is so goddamn boring and tediousThe game and its world is so empty and boring, no matter how real it looksThe characters in this are easily the worst in the series. Theyre uninteresting and unoriginal.I actually dont like Trevor, at all. He has no layers and his psychopathic tendencies and overacting get tiring quickly.Fire fights are easily the greatest aspect of this game, and a big improvement from GTA IV or any other game in the series. And yet, theyre so rare in the missions.Missions are sooo repetitive. All you do is drive from point to point in this game. Not a lot else.Cops get on you way too easy and whats the point in fighting them if theres practically no way of winning besides running away? And running away from them is so annoying and goes away from where youre trying to go. Cops suck.Sound 2.5/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 8/10Content/Replayability 8/10Overall 7.5/10All there really is to do are the missions. Theres no real side quests or anything to do in the world, and the missions are lacklustre. Great gameplay otherwise though.
