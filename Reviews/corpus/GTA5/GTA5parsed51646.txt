Even though Take two brung back openIV, it just makes them look greedier. judging by how they treat the commuity, they obviously didnt bring back modding to be nice towards us, but beacuse of all the bad reviews avoiding people from buying the game.GTA online is getting more and more grindy by every patch, and from this day, i say enough.If you want to buy the game beacuse of the singleplayer story, go ahead, if you want to buy the game beacuse of the online, stay away. Theres only so much you can do until it starts getting repetitive and grindy beacuse of the latest 5 patches, none of them has added any particluar gameplay, just more veichle work and overpriced toys.
