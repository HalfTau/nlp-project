Well I might as well join the bandwagon. I have the game on both pc and console. I mostly play it on console so I have a lot more hours then my record shows. I have been noticing a decline in how much fun this game is for a while. Every DLC has made the game a bit more annoying for the average player. The problem is someone buys all the new op stuff with a shark card and then runs around and trolls everyone. This wasnt a big deal in the early game because all players had basically equal footing. But now lets say a new player joins how are they going to defeat an  in an apc driving in circles around them and blowing them up every time they respawn?All I do in this game these days is just fly around in planes. I dont even do missions anymore or races because people dont want to anymore. Its just buy money through microtransactions. Because its much simpler.The game also admittedly has a huge problem with online hackers. But instead of doing anything real about it the publisher used this as a chance to try and make more money. The essentially blanket banned mods on pc largely hitting the single player base. They made this action trying to say it had to do with getting rid of hackers. However the real reason they did this was to effect their bottom line. Force people not to use their single player mods so the only way they can get new stuff is through online dlc.Unfortunately recent events have been the straw that broke the camels back for me.... That is if this was straw. Its more like a 50 pound weight dropped from a couple feet above a dehydrated, slowly dying camel.
