Single player GoodOnline mixed got a team of friends that arent braindead and know how to do a heist and can communicate well so thats not too much of a problem, also modders are on every second lobby i go on man gta online has no gameguard or anti cheat  unless the modder gives himself money you guys dont even have ing moderators get some kind of anti cheat man, and shark cards ing shark cards what you s need to do is either A make shark cards give more money or B make everything in the game less not too much to be fair i have to give you props for the current prices of the stuff in gta online cause for like 99 of the prices for the exotic cars and planes and tanks andthey are a realistic price same goes with the facilities so i think you should go with Option A Make shark cards give more without upping the price of them
