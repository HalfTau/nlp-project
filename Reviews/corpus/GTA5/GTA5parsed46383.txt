The base game on the consoles was great and I couldnt wait for the definative version on PC. The game looks and runs amazing provided you have a pretty decent rig. I only brought the game to mod its single player portion, no interest in the multiplayer but Rockstars pain in thesocial club wrecks my fun with its constant updates and checks.  Now with Take Two shutting down the mod tools that dream is over. I just want to mod it damn it! Its my game I can do what I want with it, or not aparently. Let the people have a non social club version for single player to mod and save it for the multiplayer to restore some good will. Until then this game and all other Rockstar games gets buoycotted, its not like we dont have a million other games to play. Sorry about the whiny self entitled rant but this stuff is important for the preservation of the best element of pc gaming modding.
