dont buy this game. simple. this is a great game and it does deserve your money, but with the stuff that take two pulled with their cease and desist on the modding of the game the same week E3 is happening, which woulldve burried this news under all the E3 news, they deserve all the negative press theyre getting until they do something good about it. Dont buy this game on PC until further notice.
