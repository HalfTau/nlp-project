This game has the potental to be very good. Rockstar, however has shown that they dont give aabout the playerbase. They tried to stop modding. They allow hackers to roam in online and ruin everyones good time. The sad thing though, is that I honestly love this game so much. The single player is great, the graphics are great, the setting is great, the amount of things you can do in singleplayer and multiplayer is staggering and great again. The decision to include first person mode was such a right move, and the free dlc they have launched over the games lifetime is something every developer should pay attention to. It just doesnt make sense to me why they wouldon its playerbase like this. It is for that reason why I can only recommend this game to people who dont care about Rockstar and their terrible policies on modding, and if they only want to play singleplayer. I cannot recommend multiplayer in its current state with the hackers right now. It is unplayable.
