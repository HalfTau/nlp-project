Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines. Sorry Valve but you should ehh... You should look away.Dear Rockstar Studios, I know you say this wasnt your fault but...Nah, nah  you guys. You pinned the blame on another company, this wasnt an action Take Two just decided on independently. You cant just sit back and raise your hands like Wasnt us. Fannies.The online is trash  that much is obvious  and even though you apologised it doesnt change the fact you dip tried to squeeze more god damn money out of us.Oh and R.I.P Liberty City mod.Your idea of fixing things is this  Lets  it, abuse it and kill it stone dead.Then resurrect it so we can  it again.And again.Well make profit off of it anyway.The publishers killed modding to enforce their insane prices to continue enjoying the online game, and frankly if the game is this old and its still getting treated like a cash cow, Id keep my wallet far away from take two and their games.I mean, outside of take twos short lived decision, its a pretty fun game, of course it has itsConswallet gouging micro transactions just to save 13 hrs grinding but its still a blast to play with friends, unless your friends are aholes.
