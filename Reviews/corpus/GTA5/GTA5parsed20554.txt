I love how many negative reviews Im seeing that initially solely reference openiv for the neg review then have an edit acknowledging its back up but wont change the review because they have so many other problems. No you dont. Stop lying. Sure you may have criticisms, no sp dlc, grinding vs shark cards,  cheatersok Ill agree 100 on that. Fair point. But the initial review shows that the only problem you had that was big enough to make you post a review was openiv, and to refuse to change your review when your sole objection was rectified is childish plain and simple. You are showing take two exactly why they dont have to take you seriously.Also, love the game. Play whenever I get the chance online. Havent even started spans have 100 hours online. And all I ever had to say was online modding needed to be fixed. And then it was, or at least it was addressed and steps were taken.And come on people. Its not like its umbrella chronicles. Remember that! ?
