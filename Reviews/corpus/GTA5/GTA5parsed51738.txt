People are finding out that TakeTwo sent the ceaseanddesist order to OpenIV, which is wellknown, and is BS. What I JUST found out makes me even more mad.The closing of OpenIV subsequently shut down various major modding projects. Some of these projects include mods that were bringing Liberty City, and its entirety, to Grand Theft Auto V.TakeTwo also didnt only shut down OpenIV, theydevelopment of the GTAV Liberty City mod after YEARS of hard work on a mod that they wanted to roll out.. Sadly, while I do not think this petition will change anything regardless of the backer count, it still never hurt to try.Id kill for Red Dead Redemptions New Austin/West Elizabeth map to be ported over to Grand Theft Auto V, but sadly, it doesnt look like its going to happen.
