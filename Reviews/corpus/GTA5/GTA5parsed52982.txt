I normally dont write reviews but after what TakeTwo did recently in their open letter, I cannot support their decision or what they are doing to this game. I love this game. I spent hours in single player and multiplayer. I was mainly excited for multiplayer because of potential mods that could add many more fun game modes and add more replayability to the game. The community in any game has always been able to push out more creative mods and fun game modes than a publisher or developer can simply because and at no cost. If this is the direction theyre headed, I wont be buying anymore games from them.
