Not only are Rockstar arbitrarily punishing their entire player base by essentially taking away their ingame currency earnings because of possible hackers tinkering with them whether you actually did it yourself or not even though they never bothered developing actual anticheat measures that may target the problem more efficiently, probably thinking that they could make more dosh through shark cards this way, but now Take Two Rockstars parent company have threatened to sue the guys responsible for OpenIV thereby causing them to drop the project, which never touched the multiplayer part of the game thus not affecting the online environment.So, we cannot mod the games we bought anymore at this point. And soon we may even begin to pay for them thanks Bethesda. Also, as it appears, taking care of lawyer fees in order to drag people to court over little modding instances of the game is no issue, but coming up with decent anticheat structures that may better online play is not worth the money?This is abusively restrictive and morally bankrupt. What a disgrace. Shame on me for ever buying this failure of a piece of software published by such destructive fools. Never again.
