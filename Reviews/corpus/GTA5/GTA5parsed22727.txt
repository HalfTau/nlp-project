Im a little split down the middle weather I recommend this game of not Yes even if I have over 600 hours of gameplayGTA StorymodeStorymode is amazing, I love all the characters, the character shifting keeps it fast paced, and its a big map full of dumbto do. Though it was t that they got rid of offline modding, at least OpenIV is back. Story mode is top notch.GTA OnlineOnline is where I spent the majority of my 600 hours, theres plenty to do and, with friends, you can spend a long time of having fun on this. The problem though is that fact that everything simply costs too much money and anytime players find a good way to make money in game that doesnt make you want to pull your hair out, Rockstar nerfs it cough the kuruma method in PS heist cough. The lack of being able to do the heist different non hack/mod/exploits ways makes getting money a chore and usually more annoying than what its worth. Though, of course, its like this to get players to spend REAL money on shark cards, a very  and greedy move.Not only that, but I find innocent non hackers/modders getting banned and punished more often than the actual hackers/modders. Hackers/Modders run rampant, more so lately than usualy, which if you run into the douchey ones, can make the game crappy to play.The story mode itself is a great and fun experiance but with online in the state that it is, I just cant bring myself to recommend the game to someone unless you get it for cheap or something.
