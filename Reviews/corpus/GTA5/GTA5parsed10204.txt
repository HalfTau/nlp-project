Purchased this game on PS3, Xbox 360, PS4, Xbox One and PC Purchased PC Version Twice, once for Steam and a Pshysical Copy, needed them steam hours. Clocked over 2,000 hours on both my Social Club Accounts, the real question though is was it worth it, purchasing the same game six times? Sure, i may be out of pocket for games i dont play anymore on console but some of my greatest memories were though GTA V... Its even better with a powerful PC and mates to play with. When it comes to money in GTA V i just used my Modded PS3 for cash as Rockstar are money hungry s who need every cent they can get, but kinda understandable as they are constantly releasing still to this day DLC for free. In Conslusion, just get the game because its an experience that no other game can provide.
