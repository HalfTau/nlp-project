Im recommending and not recommending this game at the same time. If you dont care about the multiplayer and you go in for the mods, youll have a blast with this game. This game is amazing with mods and good thing I decided to review this after the whole OpenIV catastrophe happened. Anyway, I like the whole open world, sandbox aspect. It can be fun if you approach right.However, dont bother with the multiplayer if youre just getting in unless you want to put down some real life money to basically catch up. Otherwise, youll be shot by orbital canons, which are basically cheats that Rockstar is selling to people now. GTA Online is trash and I dont want to support their practices.The singleplayer story isnt even good in my opinion. All the characters are boring and uninteresting except for Trevor. At least he has a unique personality. To me, the only things good about GTA V are the gunplay, the open world, and the mods. Other than that, its not all that fun to me.
