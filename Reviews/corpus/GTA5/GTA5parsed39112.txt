So I bought this for the single player because apparently the online multiplayer is so badly developed that kids can get you banned for fun, and its essentially designed for people to troll, and now I find that the people who were developing the single player experience for free have had lawyers thrown at them. I guess even on sale this was a bad buy. Games are supposed to be fun. This sounds exactly the opposite.Edit So apparently the ban is on hacking tools, the very reason the game was rubbish online. It might be shutting the door aftet the horse has bolted, but surely the ban is a good thing. I just hope a reasonable dialogue was had first.
