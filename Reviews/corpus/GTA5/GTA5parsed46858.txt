Modding can prolong a games lifespan massively. For example, mods for older, 3d universe GTA titles are still being released today. To say that modding was outlawed due to players exploiting GTA Online is complete nonsense, as you are automatically denied the entrance to a server if the game detects you have an altered copy of the game.It was simply to make the story/singleplayer mode irrelevant, thus promoting Online in order to generate more profit from Shark cards. Which is, considering GTA V was one of its quickest grossing and most preordered games, highly despicable and greedy.As much as I enjoyed the game, I must say Im extremely disappointed in Take twos decision. If you, like me, want to purchase the game a second time on PC just to be able to play singleplayer with mods, then you should reconsider. At least until further notice, hopefully.It is true, you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
