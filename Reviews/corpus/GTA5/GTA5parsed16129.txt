The games terrible and not worth your hardearned money. Online is the main thing Im gonna talk about since story mode isnt really that fun.Story mode is pretty boring, the missions dont feel worthwhile and once youre done theres not anything else for you to do except get a mod menu, and even though its fun to see what you can do with it, it gets pretty monotonous. So basically when youve completed all of the missions youre never going back to story mode ever again. The story is actually quite confusing, trying to combine 3 characters into one main plot isnt a good way to go. They shouldve stuck with one main character. The things you can do in story mode are what make it better, youre rich after completing the last heist so you can pretty much do anything you want after that, UNLIKE what I am going to be talking about below.The only other option left for you after story mode would be GTA Onlne. Im only rank 20, so there are VERY MANY limitations and options for you to do. Online is mostly a grind, really, because the only thing youre going to be doing is jobs, and youre going to be paid 20k for each half an hour job when a car you really want costs 2 million. Its pretty much a paytoplay game, shark cards are the only way you can get everything you want.The problem is they keep releasing update after update in an annoying way where they release a new car or event every week and theres no way possible to actually get all of it without paying! And if you dont buy the new things coming out, Ron or Agent 14 will keep pestering you about it every time you log on to Online!!  THEM! Maybe some people just dont want to pay 100 bucks for 8 million ingame cash that will probably be used to buy ONE FREAKING CAR!!!And the player base is absolutely terrible! If somebody that has friends with them doesnt want you in their session, they can just kick you out even if youre not even bothering them! If you and your friend just want to have fun delivering an import/export car to a dealer, there will not be any more fun when they BOMB YOU WITH A TULA AND DESTROY ALL THAT HARD WORK THAT YOU PUT SO MUCH EFFORT INTO TO GET!!! This is the only thing those types of players want to do in this game, just ruin other peoples time.OH BUT JUST YOU WAIT!!! IM NOT FINISHED YET!!! REMEMBER THE MODDERS?!?!? YEAH I THOUGHT YOU WOULD!!! THEY ARE THE IEST THING I HAVE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH!!! They teleport you all over the place so you can never get anything done, they display FAKE BAN MESSAGES ON MY SCREEN, THEY MAKE MY CAR DISAPPEAR, AND THEY can make it say that you killed everybody in the session to MAKE IT LOOK LIKE YOU ARE THE MODDER!!! WHAT THE , ROCKSTAR?!?!? I THOUGHT YOU WERE BETTER THAN THIS!!!Oh, and the LOADING TIMES!!! ITs like Im playing Loading Screen Simulator V instead of the actual game. Yes, you heard me. You will be spending more time looking at a loading screen than actually playing the damn game. To get onto GTA Online, you will spend 15 minutes looking at a screen that displays 4 different messages about new things coming out. If you want to do a heist or an adversary mode, theres always that one player that you cant kick who is stuck on a loading screen and you cant start the game.Please, for the love of everything that you love and care about, just DONT BUY THIS GAME!!! PLEASE!!!!
