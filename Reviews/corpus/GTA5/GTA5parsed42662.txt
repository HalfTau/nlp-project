I negatively reviewed this game when TakeTwo messed with moddability, and at that time I also uninstalled it.On a completely notTakeTworelated tangent, since having this game uninstalled, I have had zero desire to reinstall it. Whenever I thought to play a game, Ive always been thinking of other games rather than this. I enjoyed GTA V as a singleplayer experience, and as a sandbox with mods. However, it had an eventual death point in my interest. I imagine it will for many people.At this absolutely ridiculous price, I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anybody at this point. Id say wait for whatever comes next, and hope the modding capability is as open on the next one as well.
