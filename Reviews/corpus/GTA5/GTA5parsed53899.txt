bought this game on day one. single player was amazing, but i have always wondered why there has been no single player updates. i found out recently that this ws because of taketwo. they scrapped it to relese online updates, too make money. if they chared 20 for a decent single player DLC id buy it. but no, they want to manipulate players to spend money. the way they talk about players as cash cows that need to be milked for everything they can give hurts me. when i was young i grew up loving games. these days not so much and its because of this now they have basically destroyed single player MODs. why!? to push people to online? so you can milk more cash cows? who the  knows.  taketwo. seriously  its
