Wish there was a middle of the road option here.Great game, lots of detail, worthwhile, but when online... Oh man, the cancer and the hackers... Hackers will actively try to get you banned. Cancer givers tend to be salty as chefs chocolate balls.All in all, fun to play with friends if you dont have the misfortune of having hackers and cancer on the same session as you. Fun to play alone aswell.
