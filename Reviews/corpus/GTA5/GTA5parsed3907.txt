This game has provided me enjoyment since release, owning it on every single platform available! This game has always been a huge part of my life, its amazing. Online is amazing, so much to do, so many vehicles, yes you can argue its p2w but if you actually care you can get it all with just a little bit of work. Some things are, yes, over priced for what it is. But content wise, online is jam packed with tons to do! For the lone wolf or the huge group of friends, theres loads to do.The story is amazing, Ill never forget it, probably one of my favourite games ever, I truly do recommend this game!
