3rd party registration required and forced online required even for single player instead of pushing DLC they just push in game currency by making money much slower and harder to get, while increasing the price of everything in the game. removed staples of the franchise like taxi, police and ambulance missionsvery limited property options to buy the stand out mechanic, which is a lot of fun, is hiests... of which you do 4 of in the game many more missions and vehicles are locked up in online multiplayer only mode which is a crapshoot of people doing missions nearly by themselves in flying cars shooting rockets or failing missions by shooting the wrong thing with rockets, or people killing you the second the mission is over and steeling your money before you can deposit itexcept for the graphics the game chases everything that Vice city did, but doesnt do it nearly as well. the one interesting mechanic is switching between characters in the story, and during hiestssingle player is not worth replaying, and online is not worth playing due to the other people
