No sense of this being on PC unless your the casual antimodder. If your looking to mod I would avoid this. As it gets nonstop GTA Online updates that constantly increase the security so you cannot mod the SP game without hassles. Im talking about singleplayer here not online multiplayer. I fully condone cheating in multiplayer games when it negatively effects other players.
