Posting this review in response to the issuance of a CaD upon OpenIV. As a single player, LSPDFR player, I believe that myself and people should continue to enjoy the software they paid for, in manners which do not interfier with others as single player modifications mantain. I am furthermore against any potential monopolization of GTA5 modifications by corporate ownes, and do support the continued efforts of creators both through modifications and youtube videos.
