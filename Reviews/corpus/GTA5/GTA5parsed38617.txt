The publisher, Take Two, is issuing cease and desist notices for single player mods. This pisses people off, because most modding online is still going on.Another thing is the new update. The player base is honestly really annoying, so they mess with what you are trying to do a lot. Originally, there was a way to play online solo, which was removed.Along with the update, is the content. Ingame, to get everything in the free DLC costs 40 million ingame. To purchase that money is 100 irl for 8 million in game. This means they think that the content is worth 500 to be accessible to players. You can access it all for free, but you would need to grind for over 700 hours.Finally comes the minor things that people have become fed up with. There are glitches and bugs that havent been fixed for years. Rockstars anticheat has been wrongly taking in game money from people for no reason, they overprice everything to make sure you have to spend to get things, and other small things.TLDR Cease and desist to harmless single player modders, and genuinely acting like they dont care about the playerbase.
