I will say this much on GTA while i have the Xbox 360 version, this game will probably go down in history as one of the biggest Mod Contravertesiors for the OpenIV Takedown which has been succusfully resovled by the community, i thank the community for reaching out to the company of Rockstar and 4 company to save this game from being an absolute disaster when they took down the mods. This game is just tons of fun off and online mod even when it comes to single player, it just wouldnt be right that they took it down but im glad they resolved the situation and brought the mods back. Otherwise where would youtubers go for fun on Gta. So thank you Critics and fans for resovling this situation
