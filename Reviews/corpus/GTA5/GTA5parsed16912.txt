I didnt want to do this, but Rockstar has forced my hand. Im one of the many players that have had legitimate money taken in the recent sweep, 1,671,220 to be exact. Granted, I only had 2.3M before that was taken, but that was money I had earned myself. Ive only encountered one mod user in all my time because I spent half of it by myself in inviteonly. Ive never had modded money dropped or injected into my account. My stats are public. Everything Ive earned, Ive earned through time invested into the game.I opened a support ticket about this and the next day it was moved to Cheat/Exploit Report or Banning Issue. It was closed after I was given the standard copy/paste response everyone else is getting Your shared bank account in GTA Online was adjusted to remove illegitimately gained ingame money. I was put in the cheater pool just like that, even after Ive done everything in my power to avoid mod users. I opened a second one, but I dont expect anything. Im just not going to keep quiet about it like they want me to.Dont bother calling their support numbers either. In the US, youll get an automated message telling you to file a ticket online. Well, isnt that helpful?Frankly, Rockstar and their skeleton crew of monkeys can kiss mywhether they fix this or not. The damage has already been done. Never before has my love for a game turned so sour, so quickly. For now, I can officially say that I wont be returning to Online. Maybe some day to go through my garage or play with the Editor, but never to play or grind.Do NOT buy this game for Online. Only buy it for the Story Mode, which is one of the best in the series. Its just such a shame that Online has made people forget that. At this time, I know I wont be getting Red Dead Redemption 2 or any other Rockstar game in the future.
