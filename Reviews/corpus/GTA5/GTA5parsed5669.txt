The most recent update basically confirmed the death of this game. You now have an instantkill orbital cannon which can be triggered for just a measily 500,000750,000 dollars. Not to mention theyre giving us a free handout of 250k and a  revolver to promote their next title. ing ridiculous. Do NOT buy this game unless youre willing to pay an extra 70 to get anywhere, or run the risks of getting banned for modding in money. Its not worth it anymore.
