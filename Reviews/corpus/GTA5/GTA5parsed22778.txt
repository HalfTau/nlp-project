This game is like a  you will enjoy it more the more you spend real money in for the ingame currency.I bet you will be more happier if you just put it on the bank so it generates money instead spending it for like a car and never drive in it.P.S. Why did they get rid of the OpenIV, now the community is and it is even worse than what Bethesda is going to do with the mods in Fallout 4 with their payed mods especially with the console communitythey do this only to get people play the Vanilla game so more and more people have the same expirience playing the game. Ok now there are less hackers but if you dont like hackers then go play on private servers. Now the community is We will not be controlled by some s in suits who can determin what we can and what we cant do!I amoff!
