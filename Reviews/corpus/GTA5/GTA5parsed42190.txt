I used to love being able to hop into GTA and do whatever I wanted in single play. It used to be awesome... Until TakeTwo Interactive decided to  over the entire modding community. RIP to OpenIV, and all of the modding communities that were there, and a huge thank you to LSPDFR for letting me do what every one of us has wanted to do and be a cop in GTA.
