 you rockstar  you take two. This game is useless now. On behalf of the openiV Teamt policies on modding! RIP OpenIV!Take Two have lost my trust as a publisher with their recent undermonetization talk and the takedown of OpenIV for no good reason. Im hestiant to put the blame on Rockstar as they are most likely being controlled by the heads at TakeTwo. Never thought Id see the day where EA wasnt the most hated games company.If youre looking for a game with anticonsumer policies, thats leadership prides itself on extracting as much from your wallet as possible without you noticing, who is seemingly incapable of fixing the issues present in the game. This may be for you.Single player ruined by essentially banning mods. Online ruined by micro transactions and modders.I completely disagree with the shark cards, and everything that happened with OpenIV is probably enough to keep me from being very receptive to TakeTwos future projects.Lets remove legitimate mods for singleplayer that follow all imaginable guidelines in a pathetic atempt to stop the cheating online, even though it has nothing to do with each other.Lack of modding makes this game boring and dry do not buy
