I purchased this game around March of 2016. Since then I had a great time playing GTA Online as well as the storymode. It easily became my most favorite game in my library.Unfortunately, Rockstar royally screwed up because I, in addition to several other players apparently, had legitimate money removed from my account that I know for a fact wasnt hacked or modded into the game. Ive never recieved any money drops from any modder or hacker, and I monitor my bank account constantly, ESPECIALLY as of recent because I was saving up for the MOC in gunrunning. A couple of days ago I come to find that my bank account is cut in half when they removed 687K dollars from around 1.31.4 million dollars. Whats the point of playing if any money earned can be taken away without a second thought?Its a shame because now I can no longer play in peace. It is a bit comforting to know that this isnt just an isolated incident too, because then Rockstar might actually pay attention to their utter screw up. I definitely cant recommend anyone getting this game because of this huge issue in GTA Online. You could still buy it for the singleplayer campaign, and its a great game in that respect, but Rockstar screwed up big time, and I hope they correct themselves from here on out.
