Such a fun game. The story mode is great and one of the funnest gaming experiences Ive ever had.Online is pretty cancer. Playing with friends is really great but the unbelievable grind you go through seems unnecessary. The amount of hackers and kids who go around blowing people up are really annoying.The game has lots of mods that are fun.obviously not worth retail. Buy it for 35 or lower on sale.
