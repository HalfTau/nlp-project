This is my favorite game. I love the variety of things to do in the massive open world. The story is great and creative. While online is also great and fun, and probabaly stays that way because the amount  of FREE DLCs released each year. You can basically do anything in this game. If you have friends it is the game you should play with them. Although there are a lot of modders so watch out, and I recomend being good because if you  get this game from steam and get banned, then you cant change your account to play without the ban.
