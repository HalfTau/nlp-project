This was a great game. WAS. Stating that modding GTA V is illegal just restates the fact that Take Two and Rockstar dont actually pay attention to anything their consumers have to say. The creators of OpenIV worked on it for ten years, they werent specifically targeting GTA online. There are ways to ban online modding without affecting single player. I wouldve recommended this game a week ago, but since Take Two is giving me and basically EVERYONE who plays single player on PC a big  you, Im going to give them one, as well.While I stated I dont think Take Two nor Rockstar will listen,sign this petition for good measure.Thats all I have to say.
