GTA 5 single player story is great and loads of fun even after you have done the story and side missions you can still have alot of fun. But the negetive I have found with the game is the online part GTA Online to be exact its probably the worst online experience I have ever witnessed and I do play a few online games. The worst is the cheaters and the game is full of them and it seems the devs do nothing against them, its hard to get anywhere when these cheaters are bullying you for not only being a new player but just to be a giant They do things that are not able to be done like shooting you though walls or surviving being shot in the head with a hard hitting weapon or surviving a rpg stike on them. The ability to play without emptying your wallet it is in no way free to play its more like pay for progress and win. I even got some money for GTA online free along with cash with Franklin in story mode when I preordered the PC release of the game back years ago and even still I cannot get a decent foothold to were I can go from extreme anger to actually enjoying the game it cannot be done. If this had been a online only type of game I would of never bought it, it is that bad. Along with that it is impossible to make money needed to buy properties and items like cars planes and such as well as weapons, everything is multiplayer you have to have a group to play most is competitive some coop and in the coop aspect it is impossible for new players to get anywhere because nobody wants a lvl 1 character in their group for heist or setups to them, no missions for just the player to do on their own early years of GTA Online I saw did have this but is absent and I believe it was removed. Buy it for the story mode ignore the online part if you want to keep your sanity.
