So if you were looking for a review on GTA V, You have come to the right place but the wrong review. I am actually reviewing Fortnite. Why am I writing a Fortnite review for Grand Theft Auto V, you ask? Because I dont know where else to right it. Anyways, what are my thoughts on Fortnite? I dont really get why so many people like the game so much? I mean, I got it to play with my friends. I made an account with the username SniffThatBussy43, and installed the game, and before I knew it all my friends had gotten off, and left me to roam arround in this sad little game all by myself. I played for about five minutes and then got killed. So yeah, those are my thoughts on the game. I suggest better titles like Garfield Kart or maybe Wild Animal Racing if you are in to that type of stuff. Oh yeah, and my thoughts on Grand Theft Auto? Its alright.
