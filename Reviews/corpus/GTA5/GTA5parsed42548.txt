Game has been buggy since I bought it. First the audio wouldnt play, then the frame rate would dip despite playing on a high end gaming pc and now it wont even run. Add in the fact that Take Two just killed OpenIV and dislikes modding in general, this game gets a very negative review. The game is fun and is worth playing perhaps on a different console but the PC version was poorly optimized and doesnt even run after a recent Windows 10 update.
