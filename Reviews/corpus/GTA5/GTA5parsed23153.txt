Good game, but the online performance and overall loading times are obnoctious.... With my setup, ANY game starts within 10 seconds, i was waiting 5 minutes for GTA 5 to load... 5 MINUTES! and then guess what? i was in my garage and wanted to go out 2 more minutes, unacceptable...Every 2 months i come back hoping it would be better, its worse each time i come back.... horrible experience
