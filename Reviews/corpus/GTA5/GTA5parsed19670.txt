love this game, but now every time i play, the controls sre glitching out like crazy! i drive forward, and i dont move for like ten seconds, and then i dont stop for 30 seconds, even if i only held w for 1 second. is anyone else having this problem? i have uninstalled and reinstalled it three times, and it doesnt fix it at all. my graphics are well within the parameters, and i never changed any settings prior to this. i have lost all progress in the game as a result, and can honestly say i am very disappointed in the PC version as compared to the Xbox version now. this game worked wonderful for my first 280 or so hours of gameplay, but now i cant even play the game because it is so glitchy
