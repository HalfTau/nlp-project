i have been playing this game sence its releace on the xbox 360 i dont care how boring the storie mode gets i find new ways to get away from the cops me and my freinds use to take turns seeing who could steal a jet from fort zancudo and survive then i have only played a littlebit of online but  i like it all the same the only problem i had was that i couldnt pay to play so i got the game on my laptop and my laptop couldnt run it but i have a ne laptop now so hopefully i can play it on my laptop and i would very much recommend this game to anyone
