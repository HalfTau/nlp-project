I love the story line of GTA, and at first I was going to play online.  But I soon found most things are way too expensive and it would take weeks for me to grind up which I dont want to.  I got into LSPDFR and modding gameplay and found the endless possibilities of gameplay in GTA.  It was the best 60 dollar I spend in a long time.  I was going to buy GTA 4 and its expansions, but that changed when Take 2 and Rockstar killed OpenIv.  I found myself not wanting to play GTA anymore and going to play game like League of Legend or Star war battlefront
