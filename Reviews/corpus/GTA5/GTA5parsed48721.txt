This used to be a fun and imaginative game.  Now its become exactly like the city after which it is modeled.  Full of heartless haters and uncontrolled cheating, its become a contest to see who has the biggest wallet and the smallest heart.  Single player was good until they banned OpenIV, now we cant even customize single player.
