Im sad that this game with so many dedicated players got shafted by Take 2 after so mush dedication went into the entire community to expand the game in the single player perspective, hopefully they can take down cheaters aswell in the multiplayer environment with this sudden change of heart. otherwise its just like they took a big fat dump on the community and flipped them off.
