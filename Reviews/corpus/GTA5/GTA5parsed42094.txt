I dont want to know how many people got the incentive to buy this game from watching a video showcasing some mod and then wanting to try it our themselves. Now you take2 or Rockstar just went and disappointed a lot of people. This takes a big chunk of the community and the game away. DONT BUY SHARK CARDS to support their wrongdoings furthermore.EDIT Thank you for bringing the MODS BACK
