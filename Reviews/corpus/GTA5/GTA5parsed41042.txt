The game is good at least singleplayer. The problem is with greed and manipulation.Theyve tried to trick people during the summer sale to buy the game at a discounted price, while not actually providing any discount at all. They did it by raising the price before the sale.They ban innocent people in multiplayer.And now theyre messing with the modding community by banning OpenIV.Im not sure Ill be spending any money on future Rockstar games and I cant recommend their games to anyone anymore because of their business practices.
