All of these reviews are giving this game Not Recommended because of the state of Multiplayer, which maybe is fair. But Id like to chime in and say that the single player is one of the best campaigns Ive ever played in any game. The characters are super cool, the heists are awesome, and the story is rocksolid. It sucks that the multiplayer still has bugs nearly 3 years later, but its also cool that Rockstar continues to add new features and whatnot, including heists in MP, completely free.I hope they fix up the MP, but what other 34 year old games especially AAA are still delivering free updates and at least attempting to give a damn about the community?Allinall, I recommend this game, although not for 60. Get it on sale. Even if you just play the SP, you wont regret it one bit.
