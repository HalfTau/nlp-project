You removed our mods, whats the point of still selling this game on steam?Imagine skyrim, fallout or the arma series without mods, but worse.All the prices in this game are steep. Its all a grind.You cant steal good cars, in a game about stealing, run by a money hungry company.If you dont connect online for a good amount of time, your money suddenly vanishes.I know the lyrics to the amazing song for the loading screen...doesnt have lyrics.
