When I got this game I was worried about the community, people leaving in the middle of the heists and modders but after playing it for a little I didnt find any of those to be a problem. Yes, this game will sometimes make you bang your head against the desk but its fun. Storymode is incredible even if I have completed it a couple of times. Online is constant grinding but after you get the basic stuff, the MC Clubhouse, CEO Office, Import Export, youre ready to go, you can easily make money with heists aswell if you got 12 friends so you wont wake up with someone leaving right before you finish. There are some sessions which are ruined by modders/hackers but you can always find a new session if anything happens. The only thing that pisses me off is the new update which brought flying cars but the Import/Export is incredibly fun and brings lots of money if time is on your side.After all the raging and infinite loading screens, I still love this game.
