I loved Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. Played it on Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC. Over 800 hours payed via Steam, a few hundred more from console. I enjoyed the gameplay and free updates, and endured the bugs and exploits for the three years its been out. But as of August 25th 2017, I cant give any more play time to this game as Rockstar has removed all my in game money roughly 12 million. Almost none of my money was hacked, and the small portion that was 500K  had not been generated by me nor asked for. I believe this is an oversight on Rockstars part, but unless they reimburse me for my time spent, I cannot give them anymore support.
