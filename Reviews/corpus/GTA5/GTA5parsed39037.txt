R had to  make a couple extra bucks from their shark cards with this trash new update but they realized no one cared about the stuff they put in the game because mods are more enjoyable so they went ahead and sent cease and desists to a bunch of modders/ moding program devs. They should realize that instead of trying to prevent modding they should support it like Arma 3 and then their games would have much stronger communities. They should have quit updating GTA online ages ago and started working on new games and allowed modders to change GTA for the better because modders do it much better than theirdevs. you R  Gta online never buy sharkcards from these s instead get a modder to drop you money.
