First of all, I like single player. Its just perfect. Very well optimised and graphics are exquisite. However, GTA Online has been built basically into same game as single player which causes issues. It doesnt support mods, because every time I try install mods, game replaces them to original files. There are ways to install successfully mods, but it takes so much time and space in my hard drive. And thats not all, you need to log in Social Club at least every second time when you play so your game would be scanned again.All of these plus awful antihack system because Rockstar didnt make GTA Online as independent game. Don get me wrong, Im still grateful that Rockstar made PC version. But Im not happy how at the same time they abuse mods and they dont do a thing in GTA Onlines antihack.
