Stop reading right now, BUY IT! This games deserves a lot more than full price, if it is on sale, dont lose any time, it IS more than worth it. I just got it, I had forgot how great GTA games were, may have been because Im older now, but this game really got to me! It is beautiful, everything screams how much effort was put into it.That without even mention the online gameplay, which is everything you imagine it to be, but if you prefers to not end up meeting some freaks and new people, you can still play a closed server with your friends and put the fun up to 11!My recomendations areIf you ever fell without things to do, try progressing on the stoyline, as every other GTA, the game is not fully interactable at the begining and some buildings, stores, actions are only possible during missions or are unlocked after missions.Try to bring as many friends as you can to this game, even though playing alone is REALLY good, playing GTA with friends is a onetime experience!
