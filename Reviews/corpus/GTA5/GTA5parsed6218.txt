I have finished this game twice, once on my ps3 and now on my pc. Iam playing it again so i can play GTA V Online. So, if the game was just the single player i would definitely recommend it, its AMAZING, but it isnt only the single player that matters. One big part of the game is GTA V Online, and because of it i cant recommend the game at all! The loading screens take forever, errors happening all the time, server crashes countless times, crazy amout of hackers playing the game. It could be an awesome experience, but unfortunately it isnt. Its horrible...
