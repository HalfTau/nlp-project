Single player is fun and engaging.  Memorable characters.  Rockstar has too many dollar signs in their eyes from the online portion of the game to further support the singleplayer portion of the game.Online is a whole nother story.  Plagued with people out to ruin your experience.  Not to say that you cant get into decent game with some decent people but even then the game keeps reminding you how much grinding you need to do to be able to afford the prices on the vehicles and apartments and other items.  Then Rockstar comes to the rescue with their Sharkcards that conveniently let you spend your own cash to buy these cards with ingame cash on them.  So thoughtful on their part.Do yourself a favor and if you want to play a game where the developer actually cares and appreciates their customers, go buy Witcher 3.
