The game is great fun to play, until you have to do anything on foot. The movement system in this game is by far the worst thing I have ever experienced. Your character is other moving at full speed, or not at all. You can not side step, you can not turn on the spot, you cant jump over anything honstely the jump feels like it was added just because they had a free button to press, its literally useless  note not including vaulting/climbing, just the jump mechanic.The newest heist Doomsday is made difficult not by any decent design its mostly just endless waves of never ending bots that spray you dead through your papermache armour and kill you the instant you try to relocate, but because you can physically not enter cover without running into some randomly placed chair, or by getting killed by one of the previously mentioned endless spawning bots spawning behind you 3 seconds after you just killed him.If you want a game to play that is just for asthetics and driving a car around, then it is very enjoyable to do that. If you want to make money and play through the engaging content added, do not buy this game. Its honestly a pathetic effort from a company that earns as much as Rockstar does. If the developers went outside and excersised once or at least watched a normal human being walk and redid the movement system, it would be worth it, but purely for the reason they havent, the game is horrific to play.
