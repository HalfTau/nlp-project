Do not buy this game!Rockstar has a trackrecord when it comes to removing in game money. Most of the times just before a big upate is due.Unfortunatly, it doesnt matter to Rockstar if you earned this money legit by spending time in games doing repetitive jobs, or if you got that money from modding or using hacks. They will and have removed in game money from many players that did not mod in this game, and they will continue to do so in the future.Rockstar and 2K are only interested in making money of the Sharkcards and will stop at nothing to manipulate players to spend real cash.Think twice about buying this game, all your efforts grinding for in game money may go up in smokes, Rockstar will laugh at you when you ask for your in game money back.
