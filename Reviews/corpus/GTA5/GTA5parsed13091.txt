I said it before and I will say it again, DO NOT BUY SHARK CARDS. Not when Rockstar can arbitrarily suspend and ban you without explanation. Their Rockstar Support is nothing but automated responses. Once they decide to ban you, you lose. Game over. No chance for a refund. I had no mods. No exploits and theyve banned me even though I have bought multiple copies of this game across multiple systems, for friends and bought Shark Cards. I completely regret giving even a penny to this company.
