Paid hard cash for this game for the sake of a nostalgia trip. Yet here I am unable to purchase anything online as the prices are just ridiculous. At the start it was fun and competitive but now its pay2win on top of a full price game. You will have a hard time getting anywhere or having a good time if you arent willing to sink even more cash into this wishing well of empty promises.Banning mods was the straw that pushed me to writing this review. I havent personally tried them but I was hoping to soon and know plenty of people who have put literal years of time and effort into them for nothing but the amusement of the community and most probably many of the Rockstar and TakeTwo staff themselves.Tldr this game has been hanging on for a good while, noobs have no hope of doing anything online without spending mad , only thing keeping it alive were mods but now theyre gone I dont think I will have a reason for booting up again.
