despite the issue with the removal of OpenIV, this is actually a fun game. Without mods, it has enough single player content to last you a while. If you decide to dive into GTA Online, I learned that the best way to make money is to play with friends and play normally. Dont focus on buying multiple houses, as you will learn fast that you can live out of a CEO Office. People claim that its hard to make money, but when youre playing with friends, running missions, and laughing at the stupid ways your friends died in game, you dont realize how much youre making.Those giving negative ratings are following the mindset that OpenIV becoming illegal are doing so because its their main source of fun. People like to be creative with what the game can do with mods, but you cant change the mind of a multibillion dollar company by sinply saying We dont like you anymore.I recommend you get this game. Have fun with it, make some friends, and dont stress over other players. Someone killing you constantly, you can become ghosted to them, preventing you from killing them and vice versa for a few minutes. Giving you time to find a different lobby or leave the area
