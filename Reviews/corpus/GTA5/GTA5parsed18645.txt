 Played nearly 900 hours Never got banned Never received money from any hacker Never had any similar problem with RockstarWhy is it a thumbs down? Multiplayer its still infested with hackers, modders, people begging for money, kids cursing for no reason etc You will get banned? 50 sure Will it be your fault? 100 not The hackers are giving you money just because they can, and they want to, not because you will ask them to How do you stay away from hackers? Maybe youre asking..well, you create empty sessions, but thats not how a multiplayer experience should work on a triple A title If you dont have friends, dont bother buying it, unless you wanna play singleplayer Oh..one more important thing, Rockstar is even trying to solve the methods of creating empty sessions, they already patched some of them, so you gonna be forced to stay on sessions full of people i mentioned above, but dont worry..your boy got your back, heres the last single method i know that works if you want to create an empty session AltCtrlDeleteTask ManagerPerformanceOpen Resource MonitorRight Click on Grand Theft Auto appSuspend Process for 10 secondsResume Process, and you get your own empty session, youre welcome.
