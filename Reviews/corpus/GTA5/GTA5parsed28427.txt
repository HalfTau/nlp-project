Fck you Take TwoDoing what you did was totally unjustified. Single player wise....good game but again youveoff a TON of people/players so youre getting a massive thumbs down in this review.BringbackopenivEDIT  Single player is good and based on that id rate the game up. But, many people were whining about Taketwo shutting down openIV and not allowing mods in the game...me included but not as much as the only mod i use  was/is make gta look great again. I now come to online play and that currently is a steaming pile ofwith multiple users abusing the servers/sessions with pathetic mod menus which in turn brings screaming little whiny kids begging for money drops. The gta community is one of the most toxic ive seen. Most of them i would bet they wouldnt even have the balls to say what theyve said on online to a person up front. R and taketwo need to put an end to people being able to freely use mods in an online session.This isnt a review bomb shut up steam these are the facts.
