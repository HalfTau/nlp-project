On behalf of the Singleplayer modding community, I send a big F YOU to TakeTwo and Rockstar. Rockstar...Good job not only, not apologizing, but not taking the fall and just blaming TakeTwo for destroying your whole community. Job well done.OpenIV was the only program to place mods in the game and SPECIFICALLY block all Online access to GTA Online. Congtraz you killed an innocent program that protected itself against fraud.....well done.I think im done here, Rockstar youre a lost cause to the gaming world.....bet you wonder were did it all go wrong.
