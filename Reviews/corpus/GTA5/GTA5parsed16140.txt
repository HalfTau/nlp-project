I played this game for weeks not to mention the hundreds of other hours I have played this game on pc and playstation to earn over 2 million dollars as that I was saving up to buy a vehichle. For absolutely no reason Rockstar has decided to take my money away even though I have not once cheated in this game. Used to be one of my favorite games, not going to play it at all anymore though. Great work Rockstar!I give it a 28/10
