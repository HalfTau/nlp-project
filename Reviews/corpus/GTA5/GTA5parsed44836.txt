The modding community was what kept this game alive for as long as it did and now Take Two  Rockstar thank them with CD on OpenIV. Unbelivable!Why even bother to play the game now? No new singleplayer content and GTAOnline is just hacker heaven.EDIT Thankfully, Rockstar realized how stupid it was to ban offline modding tools and the game can be recommended again...
