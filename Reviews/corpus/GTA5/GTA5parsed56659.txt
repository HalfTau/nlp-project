So where do we begin here then...Well what a sht fest this has been, over 15,000 negative reviews in 24hours, thats a record in itself, Take Two Interactive, you gone done fcked up!Rockstar games have always openly supproted and endorsed modding of their games in singleplayer, but for some unknown reason their publisher, the cck wafflers at Take Two Interactive have had the cheek and the absolutely disgusting guts to make the decision to take a sht on Rockstar and send a cease and disist letter ordering the takedown of OpenIV an essential tool that only effects the singleplayer portion of GTA V that allowed users to customise their game to their liking by being able to add new vehicles, pedestrians, weapons and much more. Pretty much all single player modifications across all recent Grand Theft Auto games require this tool as OpenIV has been developed for well over 10 years, as a result Take Two are throwing away thousands of individual mod creators and giving the middle finger to the majoritiy of Grand Theft Auto 4 and 5s player base who have used and enjoy mods, furthermore modding has increased the lifespan of each Grand Theft Auto game and many users specificly purchased the games on PC for the mods and its modding potential. But, now due to Take Two becoming more and more greedy like the money grabbing bstards they are as lets all keep in mind that GTA V is still being charged at FULL price nearly 4 whole years after it released and weve seen all the single player DLC cancelled as they have decided to focus on Online DLC and microtransactions to make as much money as possible, even though GTA V is currently the 4th best selling game in history!Take Two Interactive, you gone done fcked up!Extra linksGtaForums regarding OpenIVPetition to save openIV
