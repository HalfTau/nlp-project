i use to play lots of gta online on ps4 and ps3 and was so happpy whene i got a pc so i could play online but from the day i bought it nothing but moders all over the place so most of the 151.7  hrs i have on record are mostly nothing but single player i dont even touch the multyplayer because i am afraid of lossing the the little amount of money i got hoping till a day whene there servers are free of cheaters but you and i know that aint going to happend so i must give it a negative review i you relly want to play these game online just get a xbox one or ps4 but even then i think its a bit late to join the online world ill be nothing but a rat race same mission over and over to get money un less you want to buy shark cards it is your money you do what you want but i would advice against it.
