Awesome game, chilling in Los Santos, drivin down the street, but aware of modders that could ruin your game experience, its a shame form devs part, that the restrict the game so anyone can run a custom server where RolePlay would be next level...but GTA is a classic you should atleast play it once.9.8/10
