Singleplayer is 8/10 but what forced me to do a negative review is Online. Back in 2013 the most expensive thing you could buy was Adder for 1M. Today its a fcking yacht for over 10M and your payment is still the same as in 2013. Each update adds more cars that are over 500k and its rare to see a car thats below 500K today. Theyre just forcing you to buy Sharkcards that are more expensive than the base game... This is the first time I saw the P2W mechanics in a 60 game. I had to grind money for 2 months to get a yacht. From 10 AM to 10 PM doing VIP Jobs. The worst thing is that they want to add more microtransactions into RDR2. Dont buy this game if you dont have 75 to spend every month for 8M in game.  they disabled ability to mod the singleplayer game to make you play Online and buy sharkcards...
