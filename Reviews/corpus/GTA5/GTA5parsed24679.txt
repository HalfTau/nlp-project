Adding Take Two and Rockstar to the list of companies where I WILL NEVER BUY A GAME FROM AGAIN. GTA V has always been to ing grindy to then have to spend almost all of your moneny on endlessly increasing prices on everything in the game.  Forget it. I shouldnt have to put in 40 hours a week to afford a plane, a car, or a bunch of clothes. Then on top of it, the down right selfish move to ban modding.  you.
