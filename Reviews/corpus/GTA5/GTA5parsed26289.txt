Play it for the story, TakeTwo only wants your money for the online microtransactions. Ive probably given them my fair share of cash through buying the game on so many different platforms. I refuse to purchase a shark card. The fact its even in the game shows they how ludicrous the online payments are. Theyre visciously low.
