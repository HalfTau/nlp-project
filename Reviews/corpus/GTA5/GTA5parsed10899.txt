GTA V has completely changed from when I started playing this game. The online sessions are no longer fun like before, all the dlc updates coming up are just letting people kill each other, modders are around the map Rockstar didnt even take their responsibility to apply anticheating. As my opinion, GTA V is no longer a fun game, it has completely changed to a pure commercial use tool, which is a pure money maker. This is absolutely NOT what Im expecting to see in GTA VI.
