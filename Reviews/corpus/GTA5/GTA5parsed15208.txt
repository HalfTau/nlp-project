Holy crap, this game is a mess, well online is at least. Singleplayer is fine, but Online is an absolute mess as of september 2017.If I was writing this 2 years ago I would completely recommend this game, but that is far from the case now. Recently Legitimate players have been loosing money theyve made legitimately, which is really messed up. The online is an absolute mess right now, as with the latest dlc being the most expensive every in game, with things like a 6 million dollar plane that is absolute garbage.Overall, dont get this game, not until Rockstar, or Take Two, or whatever group is responsible for all the crap that has been happening recently gets their act together.
