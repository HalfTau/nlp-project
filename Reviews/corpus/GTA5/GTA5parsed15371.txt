GTA V is easily one of the most expansive, high quality open world games in recent years, but despite the quality of characters, voice acting, fullness of the world, and general graphical fidelity as well as fun silly moments as can be seen by the myriad of .gifs on the internet, unfortunately, I cant recommend it in its current state at full price of 60 USD.If you were simply interested in the singleplayer aspect of this game, there are several games which are more fun despite doing much of the same thing, for example Just Cause 3. For full price, GTA V is, if you could get it for 30 USD, by all means, not a bad purchase if all you want is single player.However, the thing that really holds back this game is the GTA Online aspect of the game, and this is for a number of reasonsOverall, because of this, Id say give GTA V a pass, if you wan online game like GTA Online, Im not sure there is anything better, but with how poorly maintained it is to speak nothing of the endless loading screens, the online isnt worth it.If you just wanted the single player experience, honestly just get GTA IV, Just Cause 3, or any other game even remotely similar.
