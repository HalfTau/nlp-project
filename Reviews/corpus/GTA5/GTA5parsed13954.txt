Legit really rockstar. I do reccomend but you left quite a bit of potential out. Ripping customers off and everything. I even got banned in online because if another modder that I tried to report. But I got banned for NO REASON! The story mode isnt fun even with mods and I do request an unban. I also do want an update with cheaper cars that might actually be ok. Now they are all too expenisve. Rockstar is money milking customers and take two made it even worse by destroying OpenIV. If 1. I dont get unbanned 2. Keep milking us for money 3. Make it less of a rip off game I will not reccomend it to ANYONE.
