GTA onlinethe online experience has been a mix, there is 50/50 chance of encountering modders/ hacker/toxic in my session. but heisting with friend is super fun. the character customizing and the market for items is amazing.i have encountered stuttering/ frame drop issues. my rig can run this 60fps easily, fyi.and i suspect there are server issues as well.fix, rockstar.GTA Vthe story and gameplay is amazing, 9/10. the character is also good. this alone save this review.
