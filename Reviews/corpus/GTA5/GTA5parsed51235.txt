The company makes stupid moves in regards to the game. The support is total garbage, they recently gutted single player modding which they previously supported, the free DLCs though yes they could charge for them are just repetitive grind fests that reeks of free to play mobile games that just push microtransactions. This game could be so much more if Take Two and Rockstar werent so greedy and ham fisted.
