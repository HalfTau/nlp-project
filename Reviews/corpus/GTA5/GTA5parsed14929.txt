Have over 1000 hours in game. Most of them in on PlaystationSingleplayer   Mods disabled and i cant spawn new online cars in singleplayer. Just i could try them out before i buy them in online for massive amounts of money and get ripped bec of slow speed or bad handlingMultiplayer  Hackers, Salty players, and worst customer support. If you lose anything in online cars from garage belive its your fault and never will they refund you anything. Every update keeps getting worse. Like the last hangar update. Most of the vehicles added are too expensive or just useless. Like the Big bombing plane. 6 millions and it can be blown with 3 explosive sniper bullets.Rockstar always makes harder to make money in online. And you wonder why people cheat...
