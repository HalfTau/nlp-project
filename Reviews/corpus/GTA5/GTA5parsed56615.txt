online fun to play with friends, lots of stuff to do and buy and play around with. i have countless hours clocked in on multiple accounts. but it is a huge money grab. lowest sale price was maybe 50 off, and developers overprice every item on the game even if its useless just so you buy more shark cards. really slow grinding and most of the community is salty and ive encountered and dealt with lots of griefers. believe it or not, grieving isnt allowed, but nobody knows that because if someone gets reported for grieving, rockstar doesnt give a flying  because theyre still getting money. overall online experience 3.5/10single player the story is very fun for your first time, there are slow parts, but in my opinion the story doesnt have a lot of replayability. the modding community is massive, ranging from Lamborghinis to iron man suits. once you finish the game and youre tired of modding, theres not much to do. overall single player experience 8/10.when i post this review, chances are that rockstar still has this game full price, so do me a huge favor if youre going to buy this game, buy it on sale, so you dont feel bad when you eventually cheat because its incredibly grindy.
