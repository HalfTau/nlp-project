Rockstar, I used to love you. But as I will explain youll see why rockstar is actually the most horrid cheapskate company to date. Ill be honest my first 2 bans were my fault and I was in fact modding. Realizing one more ban would be permanent was when I stopped. I checked the cache and reinstalled the game. Absolutely no mod files in the folder. I launch the game and play for about an hour before logging off for the day. The very next morning Im greeted with the black screen of death saying Ive been permanently banned. I looked for any possible answers and came to the realization that rockstar is the bottomfeeding scum of this plant. Create another steam account and rebuy the game my Just so I can get falsely banned again? Seriously  you devs.
