It finally happened. I beat a GTA game. Ive been playing this franchise, including the handheld versions, since GTA1 on PS1, and none of these titles have been able to hold my interest long enough to complete one. GTA5 did. I chalk it up to 3 factorsIt embraced its insanity with the storyline mainly with Trevor.They put out a pretty good PC port.They gave you a wide variety of tasks to do. More than escort and kill.But then theres the online mode. Rockstar seemingly jealous that the genius modders beat them to the punch way back with GTA San Andreas, Rockstar decides to try their best. While Im only rank 15 right now, and expect to play for a while longer, this mode....is a complete cluster. Its a mess. Its a bucket of random ideas they just threw at the wall and left it to the players to decide what sticks. The netcode and matchmaking is god awful. Hackers are everywhere forcing you to matchmake into new sessions. Performance randomly drops to 20fps. I am matched with nonUSA players 90 of the time who can only type in moonspeak. The community is toxic to all new players and will do everything they can to grief you into giving up and uninstalling. Be prepared to just get stuck in locations where you cant do anything but be instantly killed a hundred times until they grow tired. And if you try to crew up for missions, just assume everyone youre cooping with has literally never intereracted with a video game before, and they were born with only one arm.Im just shocked this is the portion of the game that has been printing money for Rockstar for years and allowed them to not put out an actual video game in all this time. If you have at least 3 very reliable friends who intent to play with you on the same schedule for the long term, then GTAOnline is a safe bet for you. Otherwise, holy hell, be warned....
