Rockstar and Take Two are treating their customers like ATMs, they constantly remove features and restrict player creativity. Just look at other companies and how they genuinely listen to their players and implement suggestions into the game. Rockstar and Take Two have turned GTA5 from a world of wonder with many modding possibilities into a plundered piece of crap forcing players to buy Shark Cards to fill up their wallets further whilst little content is added to the game. Albeit I have many hours, this was before GTA5 became a shady moneymaking scheme. DO NOT buy this game and in fact boycott any games this company has or will release, such treatment should not be tolerated. .
