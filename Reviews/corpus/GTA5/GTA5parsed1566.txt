I would give this game a positive review if the developers had not abandoned the single player, but they have.The only thing worth a damn in this game is the online multiplayer, but that is riddled with cheaters and an overall toxic community. In the few games that I have found that dont have these, the game is quite enjoyable.The game is also quite unstable and causes my pc to freeze completely requiring a restart its the only program that does this, but it could just be me being stupid so idk.
