Excellent game even in late 2017! The story is superb and even the multiplayer makes me constantly want to return for more.However, for multiplayer keep in mind this1. There will be a lot of waiting on loading screens when connecting to different activities!2. Main currency  dollars  can be bought for real money for very large sums of real money. It DOES NOT make a game p2w, but prices are a bit higher then in f2p games.3. If you are not buying shark cards real money  in game dollars getting all of the cars you want even if you want just a fraction of what is there for sale will take A LOT of grinding, meaning CRAZY amount of solo grinding.4. Game is most fun when you have a stable group of 4 friends always playing together, you can play solo and with randoms, but it is definitely LESS fun.
