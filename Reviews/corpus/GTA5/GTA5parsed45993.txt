This game is good, however, Rockstars parent company Take Two, are ruining the freedom of single player modders who are harming nobody except for Take Twos huge desire for mass micro transactions. Please do not support this game until Take Two stop their Cease and Assist on the best thing that happened to GTA single player, Open IV.
