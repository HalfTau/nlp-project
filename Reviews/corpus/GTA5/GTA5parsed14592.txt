Each new dlc adds 400 in vehicles and items if you pay microtransactions, or grinding every night until the next one comes out. They literally add vehicles worth 60, the inflation is that ing rediculous. They scummed it up and went from online and single player being 2 exes to 1 solely so they could stop modders, while still say they support the modding community. If you described this game in one of rockstars previous games it would sound like another of their parodies of the industry. Will never pay for another rockstar game, Ill download it for free and do whatever I ing want with it.
