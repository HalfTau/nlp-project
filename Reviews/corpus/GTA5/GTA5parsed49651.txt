Edit Rockstar listened and decided to talk to T2 and revoked the CD for OpenIV and Mods are allowed again.This is to show that if we can be loud enough, we can make everything go on the right path. Thank you everyone.You. If you are reading this. Go ahead and buy this game. Or not. But at least know that companies makes mistakes, but some are willing to listen to their fans.Original ReviewThey decided to kill the franchise the best way they could, making modding illegal. Please, do not buy this game. Even if you are going only to play online, do not buy it. Show Take2 that they are wrong. They just flipped hundreds of people who helped them sell the game. Lots and lots of players bought the game on PC because we could be able to mod it. Now, you cant anymore.Flip Take 2. Vote with your wallet.
