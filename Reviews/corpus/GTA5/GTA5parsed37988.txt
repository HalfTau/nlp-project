The singleplayer was worth checking for, the storyline was descent, the detail and attention to the world was terrific but meh right after you finished it. Theres just really nothing to do apart from killing random peds and stealing cars. R dont even bother to expand the singleplayer game. Theres so much potential.The online?. Its good if youre playing with a friend. Its quite fun to be honest. Its GTA but with MMO. The online gameplay mechanics is pretty grindy. The ceo stuff, biker stuff and now the gunrunning dlc. considering the cars, items, customisations price up to 5mil10mil and earnings of each job with the highest being in 2050k if youre playing the heist. 1020k if youre playing solo. The online game is just a grind fest. not recommended if you want to play online solo.and now they wanna take away the only thing that keeping the game alive by shutting down the openIV?. seriously R and take2?.
