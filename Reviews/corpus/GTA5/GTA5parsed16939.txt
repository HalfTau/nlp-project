The game itself is fantastic, no question. However the anticheat is false flagging legitimate players, removing millions in legitimate earnings  and Rockstar refuses to acknowledge it.I have lost trust in their ability to track their own ingame currency, therefore it is now worthless to me.Imagine a game where the saves randomly corrupted and reset hours of progress. I would immediately lose all interest in playing further, however good that game was.In the same way, I have no desire to continue playing GTA online until this is resolved. Legitimate progress can be arbitrarily wiped at any time, and support waves you off with a middle finger. Why bother.
