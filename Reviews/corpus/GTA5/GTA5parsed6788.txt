OMG! YOU Rockstar Games! Like really  YOU! I wasted so much hours on this stupid game. GTA Online is like a cheap hoe full of cancers. To make money I have to do CEO t missions and because no one wants to be hired at the GTA minimum wage or when they accept, they dont do anything I have to do EVERYTHING by myself. I have to deal with chaos players that blow me everytime I respawn or blow the merchandise I spent HOURS to collect. They blow me for fun. Now with this STUPID update, NPC blow me for fun as well. Yeahey! So much fun! You Rockstar Game. I will start to cheat on this game because there is NO point to waste more time and patience for nothing. I wont buy your ing GTA6. Not interested to beonline by a video game. I will DOWNLOAD it for FREE.
