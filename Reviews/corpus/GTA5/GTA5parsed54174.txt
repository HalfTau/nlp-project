It is unfortunate that a game such as this with a large and unique multiplayer has such issues. Rockstar really needed someone with experience to manage it but instead they tried to take on the beast known as GTAO alone. It has pushed many away, especially with unfair punishments to those that have done nothing after devoting many weeks in the game both on console and PC. Some of those on PC bought the game to mod the single player and have more fun, others went to single player after getting tired of the toxic online. Now, the single player is pointless after you have beaten it and you cant have fun on your own with mods. Unless you want to deal with a solid single player experience and then deal with a toxic, grindy, microtransaction riddled hellspawn of an MMO, I would not recommend getting this game. Legit players get punished for people giving them money or because they are flagged by an automated system. Rockstar rarely helps out in these situations going so far as to close support tickets without a response.
