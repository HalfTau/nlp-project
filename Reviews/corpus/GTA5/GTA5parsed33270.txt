Today Rockstar Games and their publisher TakeTwo Interactive sent a cease and desist to the developers of Open IV, a tool made for modding GTA and allowing the games to thrive years after release. So much time and effort put into the tool so that people could make the game their own and its all gone due to the greed of Rockstar and Take Two. I will never buy another Rockstar game after this and it was bad enough as it was with them turning online play from something basic and fun in GTA V into a greed propelled grind fest.
