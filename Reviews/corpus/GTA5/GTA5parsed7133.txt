Well, Ive played GTA V since it first came out on the XBOX 360...now and days though i have to say im slightly disappointed with the online portion. Too many hackers that make the game sometimes unplayable if you are soloing.With that said, with a group of friends the online portion is amazing good fun, even if you and the guys are just running around shooting, burning, running over or any other form of mutilation to each other.Would i recommend this game, not for full price, not at the age its at. but if you manage to get gifted or find it on a good steam sale definitely.
