I NEVER thought Id have to write this review,  but times have changed. R once told us they stood by mods, they even showcased them on their social media platforms. Now R and T2 only care about profit margins. They want us to pay 60 for the game and continue to spend money on monthly micro transactions. If we arent doing this, we are freeloading scum to them. I can not and will not support a company that does not respect its community, or modding. T2 and R can go F themselves, they wont see a dime from me Im done with them. Its time we hit hem where it hurts, in the WALLET boycott ALL of their future and current products.
