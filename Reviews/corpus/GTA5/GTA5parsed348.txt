I like to mess around with mods in this game. I dont really play online. Its a pretty good game, but the downside of it, is that I think if you install mods, and when you drive a vehicle, it just automatically drives for you. But it doesnt drive you where you want. When I first got the game, I had to wait all night for it to install. Great job Rockstar, for making a MASTERPIECE!!! !
