Never thought Id say this, but after what the way this game turned out with its Open World with nothing to do outside of the main story, no single player DLC, multiplayer thats basiclly Mrated ROBLOX with one of the most obnoxious communities to ever grace the gaming landscape, KING levels of microtransations being bought by the 10 of s with too much disposable income filling TakeTwos pockets therefore justifying more reasons to milk the player base dry and disreguard single player, and last but not least the reason im writing this now banning mods, You know thing that saved this franchise on PC, I will likely never buy another Grand Theft Auto ever again.PLEASE ROCKSTAR DO NOT DO THIS TO RDR2. hopfully it wont cause most people who appericate RDR more mature than the GTAs community of middle schoolers, dude bros, hood rats, and screaming Youtubers with too much disposable income and or moms credit card.
