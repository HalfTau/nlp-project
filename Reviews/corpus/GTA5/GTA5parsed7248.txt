Single player  awesome.Online multiplayer  disgusting.Attitude from Rockstar telling people PC market isnt worth porting over the PS version and trying to milk the cow with microtransactions and kids using their parents credit card to buy useless pixels  even more disgusting.I own every GTA game in one or more format but this one was my last if they continue with this buisness model. These days its a choice to support or not game devs with the availability through alternative sources. I know they probably wont care about angry customers like me because theres still millions of people who dont care that this company is trying to screw them over with microtransactions but im still one less and im sure not the only one.They made a fortune with GTA IV, but its never enough for that kind of people. Their mission isnt about making a game for gamers and making pofit out of it, its about making profits period and that is pretty sad.
