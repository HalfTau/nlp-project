After 40 hours into this game here are my thoughts on it. This game has so much potential and most of it is wasted in a huge money grab. The shark cards are insanely expensive. The online is one of the worst I have ever dealt with and I have been playing online game since the mid 90s. for a game that is 2 years old and still costs 60 bucks plus the shark cards you would think they would have dedicated servers with some form of matchmaking. Putting a level 250 in with level 5 players is just dumb add in a community that is insanely toxic and troll ridden you get a game that is not good for new players. On top of all that you have hackers that ruin gameplay on most servers. Then you have to go to another session that takes 15 minutes to get into because of theirpeer to peer system just to have some clown put a campfire in you that kills you over and over again and you have to log out of the game totally, I also had to verify my local files, to get the fire to go away. In the end after a half an hour I get into a room with decent players and can actually play the game.All of these problems could be fixed by simply putting a small amount of the cash grab back into the game. With so many free to play games out there that manage to keep the servers clean and running.
