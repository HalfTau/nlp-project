Over 50 new vehicles along with tons of other content have been added in updates since the game released on PC, but none of it is available in singleplayer. The only way to access this content is via online multiplayer, where you have to slowly grind for ingame money or pay real money for pricey shark cards. Many of the cars cost over a million ingame dollars before you even customise them, and 100 of real money only gets you 8 million ingame dollars. This is on top of the game still costing 60 years after release and rarely ever going on sale.Previously it was possible to enjoy update content in singleplayer through the use of mods, however the games publisher has recently begun cracking down on singleplayer mods and threatening legal action against the creators of said mods.The best part of GTA to me has always been the extensive freedom to experiment with lots of cars and weapons and other neat toys in an expansive sandbox world, and all these restrictions are unprecedented for the series. All development focus now seems to be on monetizing the online multiplayer, and I am fearful for the future of this series. At this point I cannot recommend the game to anyone who doesnt have limitless disposeable income to get around the MMOstyle grind, since massive amounts of the games content is unavailable in singleplayer for seemingly no other reason than incetivizing multiplayer microtransactions.
