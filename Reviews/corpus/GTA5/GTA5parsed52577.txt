GTA 5 online was unplayable to begin with because of all the modders unless you played in private sessions with friends, but now they took away the only other fun thing to do which is play in SP with mods. Why? I cannot comprehend, what does it batter if I mod my bikes to be giant bananas? Seriously, its offline so it doesnt affect anyone but me so why make it illegal? !Edit seems like we won this battle but I still cannot recommend this game due to the multiplayer community, though I did get sucked into the story mode if thats your thing.
