Picked up this game during the winter sale. Its a pretty game and all but there are some things you should know before buying it if you plan to play online. I have 78 hours, a third of which have been spent in failed attempts to join a lobby or fleeing lobbies with hackers in it that just put a ing Xmas tree over my character or keep killing me thru passive mode.If you do buy this game, you better get used to the following errorsrockstar cloud couldnt find your stuff try again later LOL here are some more ads for Card Sharkrockstar cloud found your stuff but  you, it doesnt want to load, try again later.the game needs some files it could not download try again laterunabled to connect to cloud, cant save your game ...yeah, you guessed it, try again later.You need more patience than skill to be able to enjoy online mode.Online mode and it is p2p issues are the only reason I do not recommend this game since this mode is where you will be able to take full advantage of their content releases but if you just wanna play single mode and satisfy those feels of GTAIII nostalgia, then the game is great. Botton line, I hope this review captures the essense of all my saltiness and frustration at the amount of time and attempts it takes to load into a lobby.
