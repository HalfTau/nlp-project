Not worth the full price of 60 but if you find it on sale for 30 as it usualy goes few times a year, then go for it! Great single player story! game mods make this game complete, its a shame theres no steam workshop support or something alike....cash grab online gameplay...  you dont need to pay for their cash cards but otherwise its a grindfest to get any game money... most online content are races and people with most ingame money will have better cars with upgrades, that you cant even compete with, other gamemodes rely on you having friends to play them with otherwise you will be stuck on queues forever...So you either grind endlessly or pay to win online
