GTAV, though is a great game, its creators, Rockstar Games, and thus Take Two, are money hungry. Recently they decided to send OpenIV, the mod that is used for over 50 of GTA mods, that has been around for over 12 years, a cease and desist, basically shutting down the modding community. Rockstar then proceeded to release a statement, in which they hid behind Take Two,  TakeTwos actions, then states Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody., but instead of talking to OpenIV, and working with them to stop this, they take legal action. I find part of that line outragous, interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody., as if the GTA Online experience was good to begin with, its full of hackers, that Rockstar are failing to stop. Please continue to boycot all of Take Two, in hope of a better solution.
