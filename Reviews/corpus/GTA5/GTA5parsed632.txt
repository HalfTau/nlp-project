Ive been big fan of the Grand Theft Auto series since GTA 3. I think this game is amazing in every way possible. When Online launched, me and my friends spent countless hours doing the most random things in game together having fun, making money and memories. When I seen the nextgen trailer I was blown away and preordered the game for second time. And when it launched, again I played for countless hours. When the PC version launched, I couldnt play it due to me not having a PC that could run it. When I finally got my new PC GTA 5 was one of my first purchases and I was looking forward to grinding. But, I was upset deep down about how Rockstar decided to make this games grind to literally be endless. Overpriced items and vehicles, 30k for a mask? Really? Making money in this game is almost in possible and is way too grindy. People run around in this game with God mode, No clip, freezing other players, Deranking other players, Taking away money and generally running a muck and ruining the fun. And they dont get banned. But. If you decide to download a menu to have some fun in Single player and Invite only sessions with a couple friends, instant ban. When it comes to ruining others fun its all dandy and just fine. But, having fun with a harmless menu. Unacceptable. Im done with this game. I had my fun and this game will be dead soon.
