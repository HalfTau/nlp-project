This game is a fun game overall. The multiplayer is fun to get in with some friends and  around with each other and others. The singleplayer storyline is interesting and exciting. And modding is one of the best ways to have fun in the singleplayer.Oh wait.Take two interactive banned modding in singleplayer sessions. No more downloading vehicle skins or new weapons. No more converting your game to a zombie infested wasteland. No more playing as a cop.I like the multiplayer and the ban on mods wont stop me from playing the game. And if you have friends to play this game with, you should consider it. Its fun and has lots of things to do. But I cant give this game a good review after they removed one of the three best parts of the game and tried to make up for it with another idle cash making DLC.
