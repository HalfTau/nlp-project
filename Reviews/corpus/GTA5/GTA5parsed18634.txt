We all know what the problem with this game is... No need to beat a dead horse. Your shark cards and toxic players can all eat a bag of babyIve owned every GTA to ever be released and Ive purchased this game 3 times on different platforms and had fun with them all. Bought the PC version for single player modding and to become a kingpin with my homies online. However it seems theres alwaysd some cancerous guy in a jet that just ruins hours of work. unles you buy shark cards you have to spend HOURS grinding for next to no money, that is if some 7 year old doesnt just keep stalking you with his kitted weapons and superior abilities.Buy for single player, until multiplayer stops banning random people instead of the actual cheaters and selling fake in game money for real beer money, dont buy stricly for multiplayer unless you wanna spend all your hard earned money a  garage and only be able to afford like 4 upgrades for a crown vic or some If you want to get trolled 24/7  then buy for the multiplayer... careful though, you might get banned for no reason.
