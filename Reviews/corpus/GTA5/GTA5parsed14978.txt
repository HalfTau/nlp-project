I love this game but Rockstar need to start actually banning cheaters, it is ruining the online experience and i have stopped streaming this now due to frustrations of being pulled out of my car while racing, teleport hacks, speed boosts or slow applied to my car. The online leader boards are also a joke, how can a player get a lap time of 10 seconds and not get banned? The proof is right in front of you Rockstar.It feels like every other race has a Modder, some i have video proof of which has been supplied to rockstar. You can image how us legitimate players feel reporting the Modder with video proof then get a response telling me how to report ingame and the report get updated as resolved but the Modder is still online and very active. So is the call resolved because i didnt report in game or because rockstar have dealt with the Modder he is still online cheating so Im guessing my call was resolved because you supplied me with a how to on reporting in game and if thats the case why do you have the ability to report on your support website. What does a Modder need to do to get banned now days!!!Rockstar need to clean this game up and take out the trash, until they do i cannot recommend this game.
