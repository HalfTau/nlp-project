Do I recommend this game?Definitely!Im not sure where to start, so lets start with my favorite thing about this game.THE UPDATES.It feels like every month, the game is revamped and there is something new and fun to do.Whether it be checking out the new cars, terrorising the town with the new weapons/vehicles, or just goofing off and having a blast in the chaos we call GTA Online.The single player mode is great, there are multiple stories, outcomes, and even characters!Every event is unique and interesting while still being challenging.Online is blast, whether youre by yourself racing or doing jobs with your friends.Getting money isnt very difficult, just a bit time consuming, not to mention there are tons of ways to get it.Wyl33 Js Rating 8/10
