I have played this game for over 400 hours on PS4... and what rockstar Yes cry about it but theyre responsible too is Unacceptable... mods basically keep a game alive for years after release, look at Fallout, Skyrim, Minecraft and Halflife, the first three would be nothing and if there werent mods on HL, we wouldnt have our favourite titles like CSGO and TF2... to kill the modding scene of a game is a very bad business decision... Boo rockstar and take ... Boo.
