Rockstar/Take Two, it would be fantastic if you werent money hungry anticonsumerists. Stop ing with mods, stop artificially limiting money in your online economy, stop selling shark cards as a way to bleed your customers dry. You have one of the best selling games of all time, Im sure youve made enough money to allow your players to actually enjoy the game they paid for. Also thanks for taking all of my money in Online, and leaving me with just enough to go  myself.
