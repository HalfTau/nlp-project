First of all The Game itself is good. At least the Singleplayer. I didnt play the Multiplayer.Despite the fact, that i like this game, i cant recommend it because of the anticonsumer politics of Take Two.First the CEO of Take Two stated, that he thinks they are UnderMonetizing the Costumers. Apparently stuff like the Shark Cards are not enough.And Now they shut down GTAV Singleplayer Modding with taking down OpenIV. According to a statement of Rockstar, OpenIV enables recent malicous mods that allow harassment of players and interfer with the GTA Online experience.But that cant be true, because OpenIV only works in Singleplayer, like intended by the creators of the tool. Shutting down OpenIV wont help at all against the cheaters in the online mode.Therefore I feel I cant support Take Two anymore, until they rethink their decisions on how to treat their customers.Edit SourcesUnderMonetizingRockstar Statement
