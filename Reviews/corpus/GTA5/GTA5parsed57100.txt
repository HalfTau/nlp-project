Recently, Rockstar decided to remove vast amounts of money from peoples accounts because they felt that these people had too much money to not be hacked in. Of course, a huge amount of these people had gotten their money legit, or even from Shark Cards Rockstars microtransactions for ingame money. I had around 300 million removed from my account, and I am far from innocent. I hacked in almost all of my money because if Im being totally honest, the game is more fun that way. It is designed to be a grind so you buy shark cards, and that system is inherently limiting in a game that has historically been about having no limits. I still have well over 100 million and that is enough to buy anything I want ingame whenever I want for months to years depending on how often I play. So Im exactly the kind of person that Rockstar was trying to punish with this money wipe, yet Ive not been punished because of the complete lack of effort required to get that money in the first place. But they have successfully punished potentially thousands of players that are completely innocent. If that injustice isnt worthy of a negative review then I dont know what is.
