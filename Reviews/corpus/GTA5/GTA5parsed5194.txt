I recomend it for singleplayer only, multipllayer has its ups to an extent but it feels more of a 24/7 grind before you can have fun, and when you can afford to have fun a new update comes out that you cant afford in game, because you are only half way modding your car/base, there are modders everywhere, some good, most bad though, like in one game a modder droped 1000000000 on everyone and guess what, everyone couldnt play for 2 weeks because their anti cheat more like anti fun thought we all were hacking, if they added in a decent kick system, and took away shark cards and anti cheat then I would recomend it, then you could kick trolls, there is a kick system, but I have never seen anyone kicked before, like half of a lobby voted to kick a guy and he was blatently hacking everyone exploded on spawn even in passive except him and he still wasnt kicked
