The hilariously foolish greedy corporate tools Take Two and thier recent FY to the whole of the GTA modding community regarding openiv, prompted me to now write my honest review for GTA V after 4 years of playing single player mods..Rockstar are the best developers on the planet and make the best games. However guys, I pray you ditch T2 asap for your own sake..Take Two are the worse publishers on the fing planet and are cruel greedy ROBOTS without soul..Bloody corporate tools who perfectly represent filthy sick greed..                    Shame on you..!!!!!! !I will not recomend this game while Take Two are the publishers..
