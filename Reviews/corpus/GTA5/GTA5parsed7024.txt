Grand Theft Auto V, the game is four years old, and its still kicking Although we never saw a story mode DLC, and we might never, the story mode was still fantastic. Its set in the sunsoaked city of Los Santos, a place where everyone is grinding for money. You meet three characters. Theres Franklin, just a hustler trying to get out of his situation and make some paper. Michael, a retired bank robber, who went into the Witness Protection Program, but after a series of unfortunate events, has to put retirement on hold. Trevor, a former associate of Michael, and now a psychotic drug dealer. We follow them up to the point where they all meet. And then, its just chaos from there.Now, Online is a bit different, I played it at the launch of it on the 360. You create a character, Lamar Davis greets you, introduces you to the City of Saints, and lets you go. Your character is much like Franklin, just somebody tyring to get rich. Theres heists you can do, youll need a crew for that, and theres the GTA freeroam we all love.This game is wonderful, we can see why Rockstar put like six years into it. Ive been playing the story mode, doing the strangers and freaks, collecting scraps and spaceship parts, and Im happy to say, I love it.
