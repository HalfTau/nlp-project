Ive been a steam user for three years and have never left a review and its pretty bad it took this to happen for me to have to leave a review. I spent thousands of dollars on a desktop and a laptop over those three years just mainly to mod GTA and Arma mostly and I bought GTA V three times the first time I spent 150 on The Collectors Edition for the 360 the second time 60 on the Xbox One and then again on the PC. Rockstar Games used to be one of my favorite companies because they Pride themselves in the job they do but this is unacceptable if you dont want your game modded dont put it on the PC period a big part of PC culture is modding and if youre not going to let us then we dont want your product you guys can take your game turn it sideways shine it up real nice and stick it up your candy 333s. DO NOT GIVE THIS COMPANY ANY MORE MONEY AS THEY HAVE BECOME MONEY HUNGRY 33333333 Which Pains me to say about one of my all time favorite Devs but it needs to be said we pay there bills if it was not for us they would not have gotten this far in the industry we the consumers should not be treated this way!!!!
