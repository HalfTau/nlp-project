GTA V is not a bad game. The online portion of the game, however, is. Its a cash grab. If youre going to buy this game, wait for it when its on sale or if someone offers to buy it for you. The story is great. I would recommend you buy it on sale only for the story. GTA V Online is absolutely atrocious. In order for you to have fun with your friends and do heists, you need a ridiculous amount of money. To buy nice vehicles, houses, facilities, etc. you need millions of dollars. If you want millions of dollars, either grind, cheat, or spend 100 real cash for it. Instead of Rockstar starting you off with only 2,500, they shouldve started you off with a decent amount of money. That way you could actually do some heists and obtain some decent cars. In conlusion, dont spend 60 on this game for the story only. Wait for it to go on sale or ask for it as a gift.
