Do not buy this game and support TakeTwos utter BS. They have made it clear that they do not care about their consumers and that if you buy their game you have zero right to change anything about it for personal, singleplayer enjoyment. Not to mention how cancerous the online already is. Pay real money for everything and still have hackers kill you every time you spawn. Oh and pay 60 for that enjoyment? . Off.
