The appeal to PCGamers and PCGaming in general is the oppurtunities for tweaking a game to make it your own. You have advanced options due to a more educated community to enable people to take the game to new levels. Recent actions by Take Two have taken that positive and  all over it. I doubt I will ever buy a Take Two / Rockstar product again.
