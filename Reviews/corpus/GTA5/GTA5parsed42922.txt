Shutting down OpenIV and related tools not only harms the creative industry but its also a kick in the gut for those that enjoy modding their singleplayer games, just because they want to prevent the possibility of someone tampering with their online servers which OpenIV automatically forbids, as it prevents you from going online, btw and to shove more hark Card down the consumers throats.Probably not going to make a difference, but this anticonsumer bull from Rockstar and TakeTwo needs to stop tbh this and TakeTwos CEO saying theres more cash to be made from microtransactions is causing a lot of people to lose hope in Rockstar, which is a shame since their games have always been good, regardless of platform.And lets not even start talking about the singleplayer DLC that was cancelled in favor of the online component.What else can I say? Cant recommend it even if I wanted to.
