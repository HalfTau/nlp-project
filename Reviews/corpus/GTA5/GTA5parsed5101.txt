I was just ripped off by rock star today over 500.000 dollars on a car tha they said was free but then chargede me for thatamount.  when trying to sell worthles car back they show no value.  I have been a member since 2015 Ripping off their customes seems to be their way of getting all of the money from us.They also will not let sell anything back after you spend millions in the game..l
