trying to make money on gta online is really hard. the jobs you do,  dont make you enough money. everything is pricey. you could be playing for 8 hours and make about 100.000. but you buy one thing and all of that money its gone. If you have lots of money. rockstar will think you modded and they will take all that money away and leave you with nothing.  This game was good . but not anymore.
