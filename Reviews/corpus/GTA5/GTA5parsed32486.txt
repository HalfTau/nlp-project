I will preface this by saying I have not played with mods. Ive showin interest in it, but never got around to trying them. Take Two has taken away the easiest way to use mods. This is not a good thing. This has proven once and for all that no, Rockstar and Take Two do NOT care about single player. As such, this review is only about GTA Online, and not the base Grand Theft Auto 5 game.Its boring as hell. Everything is priced in such a way that you need to buy Shark Cards in order to get anything of worth. It costs 60 dollars base and would do better with a subscription model for making money.The only thing I found worth a damn in GTA Online was the stunt races, in which I didnt even have to use my own cars. I am not a fan of racing games nor racing segments in games. The fact that this was the best part says a lot.Grand Theft Auto Online is not worth 60 in its current form.
