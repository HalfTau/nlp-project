A hacker dumps millions into my bank without me asking, what do I do? I report it to Rockstar. What do I get? A slap on the wrists for having hacked money. Brilliant customer service from Rockstars ivory tower.The game at the moment is really grasping at straws. Ive put in a decent amount of hours and had very little return. Dont get me wrong, its a great game to play with friends and just have a laugh but with the amount of updates that require unprecedented amounts of money is ridiculous! Show me a Rockstar game developer and Ill show you sell out.
