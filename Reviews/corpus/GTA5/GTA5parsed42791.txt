First they openly say they suport moding as long as it isnt online, now they shutdown the only modding source that has been in development since gta iv. I ussaly support what rockstar does, as if they are my favorite team, but this just went over the top. I dont know who supervised the decsion of sieze and desisting OpenIV but whoever did is a god damn idiot. Buy this game ONLY if you like wasting money on micro transactions and having developers quit story mode DLC and focusing on the online interaction.
