Theres literally no reason to ever purchase this game.The storyline is enjoyable but its able to be finished in short play through.GTA Online was designed specifically to reap as much money from microtransactions as possible which has sucked the majority of fun out of playing online in this once great franchise.With the recent banning of single player modding, this game is a waste of money.
