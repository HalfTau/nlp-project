Trashy community, modders all around and respawn points always end up in the vicinity of the donkey that killed you half a dozen times, in addition a complete and utter money grab with consistant game breaking updates where they add more ridiculous and overpriced things for people to screw you over with, things that make the average players experience more enjoyable simply dont exist and things that only benefit the people who are capable of spending on the game or would mod are in abundance.Overall great looking game marred by a terrible community full of high level modders, serious balancing issues, idiotic aircraft controls, rubbish ingame interface and the absolutely worst money grab predating EA.In conclusion play online at your own risk, R is brutal to those who cannot splurge on their game, story mode however was brilliant and quite a fantastic experience, in my opinion its really best to  just play the campaign, try online only if you have the patience of a god whilst having both time to grind and money to spend.Seriously how the hell did R slip under the radar for money grabbers when theyve been pulling this crap since 2013.
