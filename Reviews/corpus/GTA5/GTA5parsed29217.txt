Do not buy this game. Take 2 has removed modding, OpenIV is no longer available. They should have just focused on the online mod cheaters. They took away the only reason why i bought GTA V, modding brought a lot of people together, even gave people jobs on the youtube, that never hurt anyone.... BECAUSE IT WAS SINGLE PLAYER MODDING! referring to OpenIV OpenIV was 9 years old, still young, and Take 2 killed it..... Do not support this game, its like you have a canvas and the compnay of that canvas doesnt want you to use any creative tools on it that ONLY effects you and ONLY you.
