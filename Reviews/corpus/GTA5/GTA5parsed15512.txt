Great single player game and online game untill R decides to take your virtual money away.R is currently taking legitimate money away from hundreds, possibly thousands of players.Their cheat detection is flawed and honest players are paying the price for it.If youre reading this and are skeptic about it, so was I, until it was my turn to pay up. I had some money for over a year in my account I rarely spend money and now a year later and after about two months of not being signed in I  log on to see most of my virtual money GONE. I never once cheated and would like to know what I did wrong.
