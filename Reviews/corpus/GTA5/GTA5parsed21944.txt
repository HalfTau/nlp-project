This game is pretty good overall. Graphics, map size, etc. However I cannot give this a recommendation as I feel that Rockstar has completely neglected the single player aspect of this game in an attempt to force players to go online onto their hacker populated servers. Just seems like a massive cash grab. There has not been a single SP dlc release Which I would have even paid for, so its not like I expected a free expansion.I cant recommend for the sole fact that I feel if I did, Rockstar would take that as confirmation that GTA V Online is a success. Its not, at least for me. And honestly, with every site that Ive seen, GTA online has received a lot of flak for nonstop hackers. the fact that if you want to have anything decent you are essentially forced to buy a shark card or spend ridiculous amounts of hours to buy a single car, which isnt for me.
