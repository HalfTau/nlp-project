Its not about the money, its about sending a message.Rockstar Games are not the enemy, but their publisher TakeTwo is treating a great game made by exceptional people as a pure cashgrab. Mods were a great way for people to increase the longevity of a game they love. TakeTwo decided to damn that all to hell. Do not support this company until they are held accountable for their actions. Do not support them until they can prove they actually give a damn about the consumers that line their pockets.
