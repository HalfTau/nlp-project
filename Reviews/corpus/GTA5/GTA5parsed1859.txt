Im not going to defend or accuse anyone with this review and just get to the point. GTA V is fun. Just like other GTA games. You rob, steal, murder, and lie your way into fortune in this game, and that is a fun enough experience. In addition though, there are tons of side missions, events, purchases, characters, and weapons that make playing through the game a good time. Are there problems with the multiplayer? Yeah, of course there are. There may be some more in this game than in others, but it all works, I personally havent had issues with it, and even doing online play is fun, if far less rewarding. Its a nice addition though. If youre interested in this, get it for the gameplay and world you can play around in. Dont depend on the multiplayer for enjoyment.
