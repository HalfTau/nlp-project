GTAV, the mystic game that rockstar originated, maybe one of the best video games ever, I totally recommend it because its fun, nonstressfull, etc...But I also can say that modding is getting out of control, firstly because of the number of modders out there that dont get banned and than we also have the out of control imgame money glitches which take out the fun part of GTA Online such as grinding money to buy something in our wishlist which usually makes us feel acomplished.Overall including the pros and cons of GTAV I can recommend it if youre searching for a fun game.
