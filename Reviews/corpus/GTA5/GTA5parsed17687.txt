I had money taken away from me that I earned myself by doing missions with the help of my friends. It wasnt all small amount of money either. It was over a million dollars ingame, money that I spent a long time getting, just gone. I have contacted Rockstar support, and they just sent me back an automated response telling me that I had somehow cheated or gain money illegitimately. This isnt true, and yet I have received no help whatsoever in resolving the issue, just an automated response. I have been penalized by just playing the game normally. And I would never recommend a game to anyone where you are penalized for actually playing the game the way it was meant to be played, while there are still thousands upon thousands and cheaters who get off scot free. Rockstar has no ability to determine who is cheating and who isnt, and it is entirely their own fault. Fix my problem, and I might consider picking up this game, and any other game you potatobrained  put out. I honestly hope either the  business practices change, or you go bankrupt. Because every Rockstar game since GTA IV has had these problems.
