WIthout mods its very limited. Its pretty but theres not a hell of a lot to do. The main story is engaging but is quite short and doesnt vary and locksup sometimes. And GTA online is a soulless grind  all work, no reward. Its a carrot on a stick and doing the work is arbitrary and boring, not to mention impossible when it crashes literally every few minutes and takes up to 15 minutes to get back on to a server, and sometimes hours to find a stable one. I dont know how a Grand Theft Auto can be such a source of frustration and misery after all the great things the series has done.Single player mods kept it kind of interesting, but the blanket mod ban means it can be nothing more than what it started as which is mostly a pretty but boring, rigid sandbox. Its an aimless driving simulator, basically.
