Before I write this review I feel it is important to note that I have never modded this game before. I know a lot of people are frustrated with Take Two for banning modding and I cant really speak on that.Grand Theft Auto V has provided plenty of entertainment for me in the two years Ive had it. It has amazing graphics, good gameplay mechanics, tons of firearms, great character design and good writing. This review will be divided into 3 sections, Story Mode, Online Mode and Overall.Grand Theft Auto V story mode is a very well written game. It features 3 main characters, Michael, Trevor and Franklin who are all heisters trying to get by in their own different ways. The game allows you to switch between these characters at will which really broke boundaries and allowed Rockstar to make missions more tactical and fun. It also comes as a given with the true Grand Theft Auto humor that we all know and love.ProsAmazing graphicsGreat writingGreat storyTons of new features, some used more than othersFun gameplay mechanicsGood humor spread throughoutConsTake Two banning moddingTakes a mean computer to run this babyFrom the view of someone who doesnt mod, I believe that Story Mode, on its own, is an easy 10/10.Online Mode is a fun experience with missions the player can do, heists which pay well, and just general driving around causing mayhem. Unfortunately, Online is riddled with cheaters, commonly refered to as Modders, who can spawn in money for themselves, break other players game and cheat just for their own fun at others dismay. I have had myself locked in a cage, be lit permenantly on fire, and spawned with aattached to my face, to name a few examples. Fortunatley it only takes a restart of your game to fix this. Online also is very pay to win with most updates containing vehicles and bases that cost millions when each heist or mission can only provide thousands at a time.ProsFun way of playing with others in the world of Grand Theft Auto VAmazing graphicsMore features than story modeConsPlenty of cheaters that wont hesitate to kill your game, forcing you to restart it to fix itVery pay to winI think Online Mode is fun just with some annoyances. 8/10Overall I think Grand Theft auto is a good game that just really needs some efficient form of anticheat and mod support.ProsAmazing GraphicsFun GameplayVery funnyWell writtenGood character personality and designConsLacks mod support for Story ModeCheaters in OnlineHard to run this game on the average computerOnline is pay to winHefty price tag for a game that came out 4 years agoAll in all, I think GTA is a fun game that everyone should try at least once. 8/10
