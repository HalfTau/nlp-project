I love this game. It is disheartening to see the what is happening here.I have been playing GTAV since day one. Modders have been a major problem since day 2. My wife stopped playing the game because of modders. The people saying they only use these mods in single play I think are full of They ruin the game for those of us that want to be fair. I for one welcome the banning of all modders. Whether it be singleplayer or online.Maybe Rockstar will come up with a compromise for all you entitled lkittle s, but I for one like to play the game the way it was made. I welcome rockstars ban on modders. Maybe my wife will start playing again.
