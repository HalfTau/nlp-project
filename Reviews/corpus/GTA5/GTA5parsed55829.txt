Id normally give it a positive review, but I am sick and tired of being used as a cash cow. Microtransactions  fine, fair enough. But now offline modding tools are being taken away from us, all while online continues to suffer from hackers that dont use said modding tools? Screw this. No ones stealing anything by using modding tools, its just obvious they want to lock down their product to milk out as much cash as they can. Well Im one frankly tired customer. Get yourtogether.
