Take Twos decision to prevent users from modding the game goes against one of the core benefits of PC gaming.Aside from that, the game itself is rather underwhelming. The story is quite enjoyable, however there are few positives other than that. The online mode has become a gigantic cash grab for R and it is clear that no meaningful content is added through their DLCs. Users want more, quality stories to play through, but instead, Rockstar has decided to unnecessarily pump out BS addons to their online game in efforts to coax more Shark Card purchases from the masses. Do not recommend.EDIT Why the  is this game still 60 dollars 2.5 years later?? ?
