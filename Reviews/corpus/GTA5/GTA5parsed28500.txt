I rarely review and usually its if the game is really good or really bad. Or if the copyright owner/releaser/maker makes some bad decision like in this game. Modding is what keeps games alive. Modding is what makes people buy games. Look at Minecraft and think if it would be so huge success if they would have banned mods. Or any other game with huge modding base.
