GTA 5 will always be a strong follow up in the Grand Theft Auto Series, as it has expanded so much farther into the online scene. Unfortunately, quite far in the wrong direction.GTA Online is basically what Take Two and Rockstar have done too make as much money as possible FAST. The game has become too much of a grind simulator where you waste countless hours of your time just trying to make enough money to even pay for vehicle upgrades, thus forcing you towards shark cards, or even hacking.While on the topic of HACKING. This game has gotten to the point where you cannot find a single game that is hacker free at this point. People do not care about anyone but themselves and will constantly ruin your fun with you or your friends just because they can.This game is fun if you have friends and just want to dink around. Solo grinding in online is a mssive waste. Not only that. Single Player is a cluster F of copy and paste missions that can be grinded in a single day.
