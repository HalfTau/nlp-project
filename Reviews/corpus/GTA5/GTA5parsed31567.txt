New release addons are unaffordable without forking out money for the shark cards, and they keep make missions harder so people cant earn money easily the free way, pushing people to get shark cards to get the updates. It might seem understandable that people pay money to keep the updates coming ... the biggest problem is that those who cant afford / dont want the updates become seriously disadvantaged in the online community people with money to spend get all the new weapons and vehicles, making them virtually invincible for those that cant afford the new content. In effect Take Two has ruined the game for those who dont have money to support the upgrades!
