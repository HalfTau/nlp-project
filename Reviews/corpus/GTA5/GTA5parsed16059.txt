The game now sucks. Everything costs way too much money. Shark cards are a joke. You want the one bike in the game that has a rocket and can fly? Yeah, thatll set you back 5,000,000 in game cash. Want to buy that with a Shark Card? How much would be a reasonable price FOR A SINGLE INGAME item? Id say 5 at most. Guess what? A single flying bike costs 50. Go figure.Oh, and theyre also sending out CDs to anyone who decides to mod the singleplayer  which Rockstar said theyd do more updates for and then never did. Why? Not sure. Greed? Probably.
