Rockstar recently removed a huge modding tool for GTA 5.  So if you buy this to  around with mods just know that most mods will not work.  They claim that they are stopping hacks from being made however, there isnt a doubt in my mind they did it in hopes people will move from single player to online and start purchasing shark cards.  As much as I hate to give this game a bad review something needs to be done about it.  In conclusion Rockstar pulled out a good chunk of their player base and threw it in a blender, furthermore Rockstar is soon going to realize that killing the reason people like me bought the game isnt going to help any financially.
