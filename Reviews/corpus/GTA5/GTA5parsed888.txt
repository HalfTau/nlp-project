stupid loading system,you just cant exit mission or whatever without waiting longtime to load you up to an empty lobby,game is full of cheaters and trolls... cheaters are not so bad some times they give you free money and after a week you get banned or rockstar takes that money from you,and the trolls.. oh boy dont you love when you spend a lot of effort into a mission and some randon dude just dies without any reason? or just dont do what mission tolds him because he is a ...BUGS BUGS EVERYWHERE!!! bugs in missions when you dont see a map or just mission is just gone and youre left with 3 dudes inside and empty map,job lobbys bugs the most when its full.Hope gta6 will be worse then this so i wont buy it
