Grand Theft Auto has always been a fun type of game to play, where you are able to do the things you can not do in the reality. Become a rich gangster with tons of money just to run around and blow everything up, buy a racecar or play a set of golf. This game really gave me a good amount of joyful hours. I would say the only negative thing about this game comes from the long loading times, the unskippable cinematics and the heist setup. Money grinding is awful as well but I found it slightly fun to do so that is not a thing I would say is bad but some people may find it boring. Still a really fun game and worth the money!
