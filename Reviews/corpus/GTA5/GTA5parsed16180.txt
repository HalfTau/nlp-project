The Engine is a Master Peice and Extremely Under utilised.If your looking for a Fun SandBox / Singleplayer experience you wont find any other game that is engineered to this Quality.I own GTA on the PS3 / PS4 and the PC. My actualy playtime is over 2000 Hours.I have only tried Online for about 8 Hours.Most of which was spent wondering which bit was supposed to be fun and not just endless menus and queues.
