Rockstar I thought I could count on you, what was first a fanstastic game now has become a grind nightmare. Perhaps it was because single player was a good distraction or there was a lot less multimillion dollar items but now its quite clear that you want to make it so hard to make money that well buy shark cards or hack.The double money events and discounts are brief and unpredictable sighs of reliefs that seem to only allow you to buy one of numerous multimillion price tagged items.The grind and small opporunities to make money makes it feel like a free mobile game that relies on microtransactions, but the fact that I paid 60 and can only enjoy a small fraction of the game leaves me with dissapointment and lost in trust in rockstar.I think Ill hold off on preordering red dead  redemption 2 in fear of the same outcome.
