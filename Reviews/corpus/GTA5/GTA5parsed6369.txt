Ive put more hours into this game than any other on in my library and I keep coming back to it time after time. The single play alone is worth full price with its amazing story line backed up with some great characters. The online is also a fantastic experience with a robust and diverse set of activities to take part in. I think youd have to be an ignorant hater to downvote this game. 10/10, best GTA yet.
