Use to enjoy this, but you take out Single Player mods one of the best ways to get even more hours out of this game. Just because one person can rework the engine to do a 10x better job then actual developers can and brings people out of Multi player.Also dont even get me started on shark cards and the ridiculous ammount of grinding this game takes. Its like asian mmorpg level grinding just to get one car.GG in destroying a good modding platform too bad you guys dont have enough money.
