Never supporting greedy, money grubbing antics.Banning Mods for this game is the last straw for me and these game companies thinking they can squeez us of our hard earned money!.. We all need to make our voices heard by doing things like this and not giving them any more money to take from us!.. I for one am for paying for the hard work of the devs but not the greedy money hungry PRs and other corporate bards.
