No more modders since the ban. FANINGTASTIC. Sadly the single player mods had to go down in order to stop the muliplayer mods. It was messing with money so I support Take Two all the way. Messing with players microtransacted money is a crime. If I was a publisher or developer thatwould make me so damn angry trying to combat it. This was their best option against it. Im sure well get a fix later on. Rockstar might even make a modding tool where they have control over it.Also these negative reviews will do nothing. We all know GTA 5 is a great game. What you get when you buy it is amazing. This is like calling a Boeing AH64 Apache helicopter horrible because the military took away your ability to add on extra crap and paint long slongs all over the exterior. Its still a badass chopper and GTA 5 is still an amazing game. Grow up people.
