If you like the GTA Franchise you need to play this game, its a great port for PC. It has a lot of details that make the world very active and enjoyable, you have a lot of things to do, the missions are fun and diverse and the online aspect is fun for a little while, although I dont like the grind to get the better things and there are a couple of cheaters so I tend to keep playing the campaign.
