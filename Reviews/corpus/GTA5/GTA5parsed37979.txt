Honestly, between the recent ratfckery from Take Two and the fact the Onlines economy is broken on purpose to force people to buy microtransactions, i cant reccomend buying this game. Breaks my heart, since between the time i played on console before its out and the time on Steam i have more hours than i can count, but its just not worth it any more.
