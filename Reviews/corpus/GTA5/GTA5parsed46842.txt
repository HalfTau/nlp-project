I hear the news that OpenIV is banned. Of course, as it listed in the agreement when we buying this game XX section, YY terms. It seems that we never own the game that we buy, we only own the right to play it. So, it seems that OpenIV should been banned. BUT, as consumers, we also have the right to vote against the game feature that we dont like. Thats what I am doing, by giving Not recommend, I hope to illustrate my point that I believe.I dont know others, but I personally speaking, I never am a fan of online game. I try the GTA Online quite some time. And I get tired to repeat the same mission all the time just to earn the money to buy a fancy car. But Is it really what I want when I end a heavy day and come home with a wish that can relax myself by the game? No, I want innovative content in this fantastic open world, I want to play cops in the game because I would never be a cop for my whole life, LSPDFR mod can make it happen while the original version can do nothing. Unless the Rockstar think they have more idea compare with the whole mod community. I think they should develop a way to allow the innovative content continue to contribute the development of GTA V.GTA V used to be a wonderful game. After experience the story mode and tired of the battle online, you can still get the mod to allow you enjoy the sunset in the Los Santos. But with the OpenIV gone. I am afraid that there will be no fun for guys like me who shares no interest in the battle online. Thus, No recommend for GTA V.
