I bought this game on pc to transfer over my PS4 character for better graphics, frames, and i prefer the mouse aim but now with the ban on most mods and not being able to transfer characters anymore this game had no place in my library. I guess I could recommend buying if your a new player to the franchise but if your coming from last gen for mods or anything else theres no point because that no longer exists, not to mention the awful grinding aspect of the online mode where it would take your almost a day of grinding to get a single car. It seems that Rockstar is becoming a more profit driven company.
