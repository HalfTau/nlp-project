After playing this game, I have a few things to say about it. One, the singleplayer mode is very good and has a great story. Here are some pros and cons about Singleplayer and the game itselfDriving Physics and Steering are great and comfortableWide variety of guns and combat optionsGreat voice actor ensemble and radio choicesMany jokes and puns put in the gameCan be played with a controllerLots of customizationLong Storyline Minimum about 40 hoursVery open worldReplayability due to many options in missionsCan be a bit glitchyGets boring offline after the endingSurprisingly low amount of accessable buildingsStory can be very predictableSome sidemissions seem uselessNow I will talk about the Online mode. GTA Online is what most people buy this game for. Recently, Rockstar has disabled modding of the game in an effort to stop hackers which were all too frequent in the community, this resulted in an outrage and many people were upset about it. I kind of agree with the hate, because they even disabled mods for singleplayer mode, which cant affect other people. Anyways, there are still people hacking in the game and it can be quite annoying. Speaking of annoying, the community is one of the worst that I have seen in any online game before. A lot of toxic players that just hunt down others, but I would say that the way the game works is to blame for that. If you want to go online, be prepared to meet a lot of  people.TLDR I think that the game is worth buying on sale, I got it for 50 off, which definitely more than doubles the  per hours played rule that I like to follow. Great singleplayer, online is alright, just play with friends, especially if they have lots of weapons.8/10
