Gta V is a quite a entertaining game. atleast as long as you either never finish the story or finish the story then do everything which seems like alot but really its just a bunch of rehased missons. all in all i bought this game played it but now theres really nothing for me to do anymore. online is boring and tedious. theres little to no replay value once you know the end. To be blunt i bought this game to have fun with MODS. then after 3 weeks i got bored and tried to go mod. But guess what OPENVI was shut down because rockstar/taketwo cant stop eatinglong enough to figure out that modding is half of the pc gta community even more so. I would only come back to this game if they opened modding back up to the public and stopped being so but hurt about malicous modding becuase they could instead create programs that dont allow mods to be installed and play gta online at the same time. It may seem hard to do with every advancement but it would sure as hell bring the community together back under the fun that was modding so base game i give a 6.5/10 becuase it is fun for the first 10 or so hours of the campaign but after that is just driveing around the world and seeing all the same sights. online i give a 3/10 its boring, tedious, and shoves cash cards in your face around every turn. this game would be a solid 10/10 with modding brought back and implemented like Bethesdas Fallout 4 and Skyrim Remastered modding is. or even through the steam workshop. that way modding would be easy to install fun and safe to use both for the player and Rockstars precious online.
