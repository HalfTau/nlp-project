FIRST TIME I ever write a review on Steam, first time I feel REALLY NEED TO!  Now that openIV has been shut down my reason to play GTA IV over and over has also been shut down along with it.  VERY DISAPPOINTED to put it it mildly and WHY?  I dont see any downside to mods!  This is a disaster, its depressing its the end of GTA as we know it and I dont think Ill bother buying future Rockstar titles if they cant be modded anymore.  And if Im angry I can only imagine how all the creative talents behind these tools and mods must feel, Rockstar would have made millions thanks to their efforts and passions as yes mods contribute to ongoing sales and now you shoot them and the PC playerbase in the back!
