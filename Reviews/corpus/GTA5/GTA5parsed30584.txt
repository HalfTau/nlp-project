Look, everyones heard about the mods thing by now, but theres another, slightly underreported thing going on. To combat hacking, Rockstar/T2 have been basically nuking players ingame banks at random and ad nauseum.This means that you can work and grind away to afford that sweet vehicle, only to have your money wiped, with no chance of getting it back so far, its been reported by many players that Support has been pretty much unresponsive to tickets. Add to this equation that RS/TS is heavily pushing sharkcards real money for ingame cash and you get an interesting picture so far it doesnt seem theyre very interested in differentiating between hackers and people who actually put in the grind. Theyre just wiping people with large bank accounts, and telling them to go buy a sharkcard.TL/DR, consider carefully how much time you want to put into the game might get arbitrarily wiped and have all that time wasted.
