Personally, I love this game. As of this review, I dont have much time in it but I feel like I need to post this. Everyone is mad about the devs banning a modding software for GTA online but in my opnion the other parts of GTA online and the single player story are enough for me. It is a bueatiful game with amazing gameplay and story line.9.5/10
