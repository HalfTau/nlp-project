Listen up, TakeTwo is trash, they are the reason why this game is doing terrible after disallowing SIngle Player mods. Rockstar lied in their statement about online modding, OpenIV requires a program for you to download that restricts multiplayer use, and if you dont download the program, then your mods wont work that you installed and you will recieve an error..... but Rockstar and TakeTwo want to beand disallow which caused their game to recieve more than 20k negative reviews in 5 days, enjoy it Rockstar..... TakeTwo has their head up their hope they shut down.
