Take Two decided it would be a good idea to shut down Open IV because they didnt get enough money from releasing the game twice at 60 and all of the micro transactions they get. Sucks because GTA is a good series and I wanted to keep playing it, but I cannot in good conscious support a company that would stoop to such low levels just to make more money on top of their already mountain of cash.Dont buy this game, they do not deserve your hard earned money.
