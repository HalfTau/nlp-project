One of the greatest experiences i have had in gaming. The story is pretty excellent, with all 3 characters being interesting in their own way, and really make an interesting team. The visuals are gorgeous, and runs well on my PC. The World feels very alive, and there is many different things you can do in its world. You really lose track of what you were doing easily, to go do some random task, and get lost in its world.As for GTA Online, it is a bit of a mess on PC, with modders, but Rockstar has done a pretty good job of trying to keep that under control. You will still have a hard time staying away from them, and it really ruins the experience sometimes, but take away the modders, and GTA ONline is incredibly well made, and fun experience. This is the best GTA game i have played so far,which is imprssive, since my favorite GTA before this was GTA3.I give this a 9/10.
