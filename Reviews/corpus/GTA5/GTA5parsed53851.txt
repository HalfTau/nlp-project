Modding has been a big part of the GTA series since San Andreas. Removing the biggest mod on the platform, which enables other modders easier ways to creat and play, is unfounded and appaling. this game just lost 8090 of the biggest mods out there. So, Take Two, Have fun losing 8090 of your modding fanbase. I HATE YOU!
