Bring back mods, no one should support this awful move. It does nothing but screw over their customers in an act of greed. Their recent acts show that they care more for squeezing every last drop out of you in the form of shark cards, rather than providing an open community.I would NOT recommend this game to anyone until they allow the free marketplace for modding games that we own.
