These days people blame EA for lootboxes and microtransactions on the other hand GTA is a pinnacle of it!. Aside from what the game actually is which is truly awesome including both single and multiplayer the huge cost of buying equipment and business is the ultimate downside of this game. Unfortunately the cost of shark cards is more than double the cost of entire game right now, which is quite embarassing tbh.Rockstar could have been manage this by significantly reducing the price of old dlc items so that the newcomers and regular players could get some benefit out of it but that never seem to happen.Even if you are considering to buy it right now you may get it at the discounted price but do keep this in your mind that GTA online is gonna take a lot of grinding.PS I wont be bias towards the game because of microtransactions.There is still a lot in this game which you could play and enjoy without even buying every single dlc item.
