A great single player story and a horrible online multiplayer experience designed to make TakeTwo as much money as possible. Because of this, you can expect to be bored once you finish the single player story and, get this, TakeTwo has now decided that mods for their game are illegal. So I highly recommend that you do not purchase this game. Speak with your wallets, dont give them another dime of your hard earned money.
