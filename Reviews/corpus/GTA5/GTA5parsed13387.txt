The graphics are great if you have the right specs and singleplayer is just a dream. But multiplayer in a nutshell... horrible. Modders. Modders EVERYWHERE. My friend who played this game since it came out got banned because a modder gave him a few billion dollars in game. He called R and asked what to do. Rockstar asked him for his username and told him they would fix it. A few minutes later he got banned. If R doesnt change its attitude towards its customers NOW, GTA V Online will probably be full of unpunished modders in a few months or so. If you want to buy the game for Online then dont. Buy anything but GTA V for Online. I have lost all respect for this game.
