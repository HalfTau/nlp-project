Great job turning this game into a cash cow.Disabling mods, making everything expensive as hell and forcing players to grind money for an insane amount of time or buy those  shark cards.Moddders and legit players are keeping your ing game alive and they are paying the price of your incompetence at stopping cheaters in your brokengame.You are losing your fan base for a few more dollars.
