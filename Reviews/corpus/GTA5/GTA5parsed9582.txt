There are pros and cons about this game.Overall this game is a must buy and hopefully DLC will keep improving this game. I would like to see some more histes added as they are fun to play.UpdateAs I said previously  I would like to see some more histes added as they are fun to play. Well the good news is Rockstar have added new hisets but the only thing is they are not affordable to setup and everything is getting worse and over priced, Rockstar want our money, really bad. Thats why instead of fixing stuttering issues, they bring out updates for DLC which provides us with free content. Theyre trying to turn the multiplayer in to a premium currency. Shark cards are expensive and earning money is a task require 100h of making small amounts of cash. Just like on a mobile game. Everything is priced terribly and they are really trying hard to get as much money out of us as possible.
