Play the campaign, avoid online like the plague.The solo campaign of this game is wonderful. The character development is amazing and the voices are probably the best acting I have ever seen in a game. The game play itself is engaging, although I do feel there was too much effort put into the story and not enough put into the actual missions and game play. Everything boils down to 5 min cut scene, drive/fly/swim here, shoot something, drive/fly/swim back, 5 min cutscene.The onlne, however, should be avoided at all costs! Having owned the game for a month I have been unable to find an online session that didnt have at least one modder in it. These modders will blow you up randomly, give you money that will lead to YOU getting banned, and do all other kinds of randomthat makes the online portion of the game completely unplayable. The icing on thatcake is that those online who do have money either from grinding or from buying it with real cash have nothing better to do that ruin your day with absurdly powerful weapons and vehicles. You can only do Heists with your reallife friends because random people can and will screw it up every time. Only a complete masochist or someone willing to spend hundreds of dollars on Shark Cards would play GTA online. I would rather eat a bucket of salt and vinegar razor blades with mysubmerged in a deep fryer before playing online again. There should be internation laws prohibiting the amount of torture that is the online experience water boarding would be a restful reprive compared to online. Satan himself is jealous becuase even he could not think of a better form of agony to inflict on a human soul. If you are thinking of buying this for the online, save yourself the pain and just go slam your genitals in a car door for an hour, you will have a better time.
