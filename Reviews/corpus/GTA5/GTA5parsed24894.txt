Rockstar will punish you by taking away all but 20k of your 4mil because a modder gave you money while you were in a loading screen.They have made the game nearly impossible to make money on without shark cards which require real money, added content with very high prices that will take months for a normal person to afford legitly ingame, and last but not least... They attacked a modding community with threats of legal action that developed singleplayer mods for the game.Save your money... Rockstar has turned into scam artists.
