I do not recommend anyone buying this product. It is an alright game per say, however, paying for DLC which is not included in single player from what Ive heard is NOT acceptable. And banning mods in singleplayer, really? GTA Online should have been a seperate game from the start or it should have been a game without microtransactions.Overall, this game deserves negative feedback and it is the sole reason for me writing this review.
