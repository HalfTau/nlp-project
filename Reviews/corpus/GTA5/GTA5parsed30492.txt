I played the story of GTA every time it released. After you beat it it gets boring and repetitive and the lack of singleplayer DLC makes it even more boring. At least add in guns or vehicle. I used openiv and lspdfr and many other mods to make singleplayer more fun and give me something to do because the online is ridiculous. Everything is over priced and the only real way you can make money is if you have friends and do jobs and heists with them because everyone else has no idea what theyre doing. People are hating on Rockstar but it was mainly Take Two. Hopefully all this gets sorted out.
