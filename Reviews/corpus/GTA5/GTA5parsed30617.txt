This used to be a good game. And to be perfectly honest I dont care that mod support is being attacked.Im just horribly tired of the awful cash grab the online play has become. Adding cars worth millions of dollar that take countless hours of grinding to be able to afford. Only to be blown up instantly by hackers.But hey you can buy some sharkcards so its all good, LMAO
