this is really dissapointing.the modding is what drew me away from xbox and onto PC. It shouldnt be the publishers choice to disable mods. We bought the product and we should be free to do whatever we want to it. As a player whos been with GTA since Vice City, I say  you T2 for ruining a once great franchise.
