If I were rating this game soley on the single player experience I would absolutely be recommending this game, however the way theyve handled the online multiplayer has been one of the saddest, money hungry methods of game marketing and has created a dreary outlook on the future of both the GTA series as well as gaming in general in the years to come.Rockstar has tapped into the freemium game market strategy by selling in game money for your hard earned real money. This wouldnt be so bad if they didnt also skew the ingame economy to essentially require the purchase of multiple shark cards in order to acquire most of the online content.also they hate mods, that sounds like its a big deal too
