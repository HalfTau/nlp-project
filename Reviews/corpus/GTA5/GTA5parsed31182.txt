still one of the better singleplayer experiences out there today, but if youre looking to jump online and have fun well... unless you spend even more money you wont. everythings locked behind so much grinding its not even worth starting now. personally id just wait till red dead 2 comes out, even though itll be the same you at least wont be so far behind.
