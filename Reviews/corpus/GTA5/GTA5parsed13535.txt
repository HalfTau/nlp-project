Ill start by pointing out the game is fun. I love the game play. I cannot recommend it due to the MASSIVE amounts of modders in the game using god mode and killing me over and over for no reason. Every server Im in has at least 1 modder. I just left a server that had 3. one was teleporting to pick up his own resupplies, one was asking for money through discord to give money drops and one had god mode and kept killing me. I dont feel like Rockstar has done enough to prevent modders from ruining the game.
