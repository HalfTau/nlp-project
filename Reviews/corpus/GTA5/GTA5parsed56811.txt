Just bought this with the expectation that I would be able to mod it and not be forced to play the broken AF online for new content. And its too late for a refund. Thanks Take Two. Cant wait to see how you handle that new IP you just aquired without the modding community. KSP would not be anywhere near the game it is without them. PCMR never forgets.
