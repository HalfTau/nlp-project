I stopped playing after Rockstar neglected the community and added microtransactions. Such an overrated company, the games are good for the first few hours, but too be honest, Ill stick to other games with developers who actually know how to make games last. This game is now unplayable with all the hackers and s, and with every update, things get more expensive, which means the only way to get the new items is too either buy shark cards microtransactions or hack for money.
