Buy the game if you plan to spend substaintial time on story mode, which you probably wont because mods are the antichrist to T2.Multiplayer used to be pretty fun, but I got to see the toxic and antifun player base in every format. Its inescapable. Now all I do is log in just to customize the newest cars, check out the new content to see whats fresh and fun, and thats about it.EDIT I just got 20m of my money taken from me, so now theres absolutely nothing else to do in this game. I know I may sound entitled, but its not fair that I have to give up something that keeps me coming back to this game, even if that money was shoved in my account. I need to keep up with the new content that I dont want to grind/pay for just to have fun.
