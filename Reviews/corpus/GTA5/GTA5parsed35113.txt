Well, I didnt want to jump on this particular bandwagon at first, but. But. Two things. First, banning purely singleplayer modding tools is a bad move, regardless of the publisher/developer motives. Second, there are tons of imbeciles regurgitating the same oh, Im so glad they banned modding, and I can enjoy this amazing, beautiful, perfect game without those pesky hackers. No one willme online now, yay!. Its simply not true, and if you burden yourself with one minute of web search you will understand that.So, no, I cant recommend buying this game. T2, your fanbase is what provides Zelnick with the means to support his lifestyle and his ridiculous claims that you have more wood to chop meaning gamers wallets, youd do well to remind yourself that. Until that happens, Ill refrain from spending my money on your products.
