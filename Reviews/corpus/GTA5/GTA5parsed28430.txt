edit Rockstar heard the community and brought modding back. Also I felt I was being unfair to the vanilla game. Left my original review below but if youre thinking of playing this for the first time, go for it. Its a seriously good game but was marred by its low replayability on single player.It was fun the first time round. With little replayability, I started doing mods for my singleplayer because GTA Online just... isnt fun for me so I can change it up and have some fun with the good concepts and mechanics of the game.Disable modding? Negative review immediately because there is no replayability in single player without mods.Shame.9/10 with mods. 2/10 without.
