I dont even mod this game or even play it that much anymore, but I wanna demonstrate my complete disaproval with the actions that Take2 took against harmless modders, who actually had principles, integrity and respect for Take2.  They blamed them for rockstar/take2s inability to fight cheating online, and for the poor architecture holding their multiplayer together.Buyer beware. I definitnetly wouldnt fund childish and uncalled for behaviors like this.. That is, if I ever have to make the choice of buying a rockstar/take2 game again..And well, tbh, this game gets kinda boring, and I never really felt it was still worth the  70 CAD asked for.. Saints rows 3 was more fun than this imo.
