Grand Theft Auto V is an openworld game like no other obviously. I personally bought this game to use the police mod LSPDFR. The story mode is fun, but multiplayer is not, especially for the lower levels, because1. Modders cheaters everywhere.2. Unless you team with someone in their armored vehicle, you will probably just be sniped over and over again.Otherwise, enjoyable.
