The modding/botting/hacking/scripting/whatever you want to call it in online is just absolutely out of control. I mean I have hours of footage of players spawning cars, airbreaking them into others, other miscellaneous illegitimate shenanigans, and its gotten to the point where its completely unplayable online. These arent even alleged aimbot issues. This is blatant molestation of gameplay in all aspects.  You can spend X amount on a bunker/airstrip etc. but if you cant complete these missions to cash in on weeks worth of investment and gameplay because somebody starts spawning and dropping airplanes and cars on top of you causing the mission to fail and progress to be wiped, especially in missions that arent allowed to be completed in private sessions, I cant reccomend paying 59.99 for this game, nor 23.99. Ive bought three copies since the original release, a collectors edition on 360, a copy on Xbone, and a PC copy. I havent been banned for illegitimate reasons like others claim to have been, but I simply cant put any more time into this game and Im infuriated to have spent money on shark cards over the years, only to have essentially lost that money tenfold by illegitimate means. The whole experience thus far is significantly more upsetting than the whole All Points Bulletin fiasco  That game may have had an aimbotting issue and was riddled with bugs, but AT LEAST people werent able to practically take money out of your own pocket.Just dont. Get onboard with SAMP or MTA  Most servers can at LEAST manage cheating. Dont get suckered into this game like I did.
