This game has gone from garbage during its release to alright after a few dlcs, but now its been tainted by antimodding t. Most people dont know how to create scripts to run our mods so we download them but now rockstar has sued the openIV team which doesnt seem to be coming out with any updates any time soon. Havent heard anything about scripthook V lately regarding whether or not it has been shutdown as well but its been a few days and nothing yet has been released.
