hello,we are rockstar games, we like money. please buy shark card, we like money. we give a  about the hacker plaque in our online game.now for real, thats all what i can think of when i think about gta online. i play the game since release on the xbox 360, then on xbox one and now on PC. im lvl 406 in online mode and i got everything i want in this game and have money. i never accept money from hackers. i really loved this game so much. thats why it is so heartbreaking for me to see what rockstar is doing with this masterpiece. the time where the heist came out, or where CEO and Biker came out, this where the glory time of GTA online. everything was perfect. but then rockstar starts to give a  about hackers, to give a  about us. now every DLCs is just some over the top action junk with overpriced items and facilitys to squeeze the last dollar out of there victims. u really cant play this game anymore. in my opinion, GTA Online is dead.BUT,there is still the singleplayer, and this on the other hand is the masterpiece i was talking about. Good story, intresting Characters, lot of things to do etc. etc.when u want GTA V, make sure u want it for the Singleplayer not the Online experience.singleplayer 8/10online 2/10 Before Gunrunning and hacker plaque 10/10
