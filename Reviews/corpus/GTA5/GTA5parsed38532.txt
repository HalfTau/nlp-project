I love this game and have played both the singleplayer experience and multiplayer extensively in the past. I love R and this game but I cant in good conscience keep a positive review up while T2 behaves this way. Taking steps to ban online cheaters was a great thing, but the way they have handled it was very uncouth. Mods that dont affect online play should be allowed. Whereas Bethesda realized how important modding is to the community and took their implementation too far, T2 has decided to go the opposite route and ban them outright. Id love to continue to support and love GTA as I have in the past should the decision be reversed Id be the first to change my review to a positive one. As it stands, however, I dont plan on defending this game out of general principle.
