Dear Take 2,Congrats on taking a game that was pretty good and with the communitys help, AKA modding, made it soo much fun! and turning it into complete crap. Hope you do good with sales after this! Actually I hope you dont do well!  Its what you deserve for this. Your reveiws were mostly possitive and sales were up but you got too cocky with E3 and messed up. We use Open IV to do stuff that you have never owned up to making because you all are just in it for the money and dont care about the players. We use it to add in offroad vehicles something you guys wont add more of and we also use it to help a 4 year old game look more up to date. And btw all you did by this is just made us mad for no reason. Those of us who have it already can still use it. So basicly you guys just pulled a typical three year old This is unfair! move. And to those of you thinking about buying this game, forget it. The missions are good, but everything else is done for. Online? Nope taken over by modders and also Rockstar will ban you for just being in the lobbies with them. which is something you can not control. Also you can barely make enough money to by an appartment unless you pay them wayyy more. So just do yourself a favor and go buy something like Player Unknowns or better!We love you Open IV team and we wont stop till youre back up XOXO
