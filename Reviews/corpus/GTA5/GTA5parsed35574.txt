single player is fun the online is a cashgrabbingguzzler and the mods have all been made illegal. Do not buy this game and i strongly advise against supporting any take two products in the future. They wont let people do what they want with their own games out of fear they will lose microtransaction income. If the cease and decist is retracted then i would advise buying it. If they refuse to however boycott the products.
