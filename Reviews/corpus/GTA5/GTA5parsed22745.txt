Dont buy this game even on sale, unless youve never played the single player. The online is just a cash grab by Rockstar, making earning money a grind and trying to force you into buying their shark cards. Its filled with hackers that ruin the game and Rockstar have done vitrually nothing about it. Their recent take down of the OpenIV as an attempt to fix the online shows how little they care because OpenIV disables the online when people use it so doesnt contribute to the amount of hackers in the online. And to top it all off, I log in today to receive a message saying 1.3 million has been taken from my account leaving me with 20k. This is complete BS because I have never gotten modded money from a hacker and now Im left with nothing after spending hours playing their  game to try and get money.Dont bother wasting your time and money with this game.
