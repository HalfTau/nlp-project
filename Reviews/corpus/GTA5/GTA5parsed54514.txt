Basically, Rock Star hates you and only cares about your money. That was obvious from the day it first released, and the fact that it still cost a full 60, despite coming over a year later than the console versions. The screwingover didnt stop there, though. They started charging ridiculous amounts of money for in game currency. Instead of discounting their game during Steam sales, they would only sell discounted bundles that included this ingame currency... but which still cost at least 60. When this currency apparently wasnt selling well enough, they started adding a constant stream of crazily overpriced ingame items. It used to be that there were only a couple things you could get for over a million, but now theyre a dime  a dozen.And all of these complaints are only valid when the game actually works. GTA V decided to buck the trend of other AAA games instead of improving over time, it actually gets worse! Now, It can take me up to thirty minutes just to get into an online game and stay in it. And recently, hackers managed to somehow take all of my ammo rebuying it would cost over a hundred thousand in game dollars, which would conservatively take about an hour to earn back.Finally, theyre recently started screwing over creators of singleplayer mods, which is hard to believe is anything other than an attempt to make even more money with some other upcoming monetization scheme.
