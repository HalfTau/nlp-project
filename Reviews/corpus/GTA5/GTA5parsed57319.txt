This game owes its life blood to the modding community. Lets face it, games like this are fun for their edgy eight hour storyline. But after that, you think people are coming back to hear the samejokes over again? Or to continue their super fun online experience of getting banned for being on the same server as a hacker? No, they come back because of the endless possibilities others have created for them. Mods are not hackers. Modding is not illegal. This company has a major inferiority complex. People are not playing San Andreas 15 years later for any reason except mods. For the love of god find some other way to get this game, dont give them your money.
