Be wary when purchasing this title, 57 hours of game crashing troubleshooting with so called help from rockstar support. Game only crashes every time with no exceptions stating ERRSYSINVALIDRESOURCES5 My PC is by far unable to run this game but unless something changes be careful. I bought 2 copies one for me and my girlfriend only to feel robbed of both time and money so Im not impressed to say the least.
