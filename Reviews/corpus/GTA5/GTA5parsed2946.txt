Game is amazing. Low rating are because they tried to shut down OpenIV, a popular modding tool for single player. More than half the players who play single player also used mods, so they werent happy. They brought it back, but theres no repairing the damage. Game itself is brilliant, but MP can be a bit of a grind.Online 8/10Single Player 10/10
