GTA 5 continue the standard set with its predecessors great game visually with some issues but overall enjoyable.The shooting part is on par with the previous iterations it is not a shooter by any means but it does its job.The story is long and it is jumping from one character to another. A bunch of wackos that go on between violence and crime this is fundamentally unchanged from the previous games so if you dont like violence this game cant be really played otherwise, and you should avoid it.The characters are not likable at all I had issues from the start to care about any of them they are mostly low class people that resort to crime which is a bit of contrast with the protagonist of the previous game. He at least had some sort of moral dilemma while the 3 protagonists in this game are fundamentally plain criminals with no real objective to change.The writing of the story is based on their characters, so it fits perfectly with all the shenanigans that they will have to go through. At times feels like it is a 11 copy of real low class families with very streamline situations, that are both gross and funny. But this is what makes GTA what it is so they hit the spot once again.The game runs great for me in 5060 FPS, using a 1080p resolution and all details maxed out on a GTX 980 and I7 KL unlocked at 4 GHz action is fluid and I did not notice any pop up or technical issue. Audio is also great with the usual cursing and dialogues taken straight from the ghetto or from criminal series like the Sopranos music is awesome as usual and overall it immerse you.To me it is a great game and probably because I do not play online or even care much about that. Most of the complains in the reviews are on one aspect of the game and not even the main one, since GTA has always been about the dysfunctional characters and their stories, as single player mode. Gladly GTA is still delivering that with flying colors and the extra thing of the online mode with microtransaction is a way to cash in on the game knowing that most of the younger audience nowadays is hooked up on achievements and community events online.If you get the game for the online part mainly just play other open world games but if you mainly want to play the solo story, and pop in multiplayer now and then just to have few rounds of fun then it is highly recommended. Just avoid full price because it is a 2 year old game at this point 29 bucks is probably the highest that the game should be paid.
