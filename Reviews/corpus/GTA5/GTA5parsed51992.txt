I will no longer be playing this game due to the Single Player aspect of the game not allowing mods, and Take Two Interactive declaring that modding of their files is an illegal act. This is a despicable asbuse of power, and I will not be purchasing another Take Two Interactive game as long as this ignorant policy is in place. I hope your games are often played by everyone but NEVER purchased. You deserve it, !
