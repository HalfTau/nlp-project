LOL i love how people still thumbing the game down cause of mods i understand it was a complete low blow but open IV has been up for 10 days and obviously like most communities ppl are to stupid to notice dont listen to negative reviews half are people with like 3 hours who are just following a bandwagon ive played this game since its initial release on xbox 360 liked it back then and i do get a little annoyed with how expensive it is now and u kinda have to buy shark cards to get new released content but its mostly small things and im not going to thumb it down cause of that had a lot of great experiences with this game.
