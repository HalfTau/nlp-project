Liked story mode to avoid crappy rockstar sever as they has hackers problemsTried setup coop sever to have my kids to play with me, it doesnt work!It is only worth it if you buy less than 25 as if they have story line DLC then I would be happier to open my wallet!If Rockstar has brain, make GTA 5 storyline as coop then more people will buy same for DLC for storyline.Rockstars online game for GTA 5 is POS!GradeStoryline AOnline F or D
