Still unbelievably awful support for multiplayer, and extremely toxic stand toward modding. The game came out in 2013 and it STILL retails for 60, and goes on sale for 30. Thats kind of insane. The price of ingame purchases is absolutely disproportionate, and is unrealistic to grind for everything. When I can make 500k in about 6 hours of work assuming a modder or some griefer doesnt destroy my cargo, but the new motorcycle costs 4 million dollars, something isnt balanced correctly.Every single multiplayer lobby is filled to the brim with modders, almost without fail. So you want to join a game and do some gunrunning with the boys? Well, prepare to have your cargo destroyed from miles away by a flaming, exploding blimp spawning on top of you, because modders are either not punished or arent detected well enough.That being said, I have almost 400 hours on PC and another 400 on PS3, so I guess I cant really give this a negative review. I STILL have fun with the multiplayer, every time I play it.If you are looking for a bug free, hassle free, hacker free multiplayer game this is not it. Look elsewhere. This game is a broken, modded to hell microtransaction machine. But its pretty fun tbh.
