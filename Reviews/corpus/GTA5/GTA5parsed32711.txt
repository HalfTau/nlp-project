Im leaving a thumbs up, even though it wont do anything against the overwhelming tide of hate toward the publisher and misguided anger toward the developer. The truth is that the game is still fantastically entertaining and fun. I played it like crazy on the Xbox, and got it on sale after upgrading to a gaming PC.What the angry reviewers should be upset about is players abusing the support for mods in the online area of the game. Its not like take twos goal was to limit players enjoyment of their product, their decision was based on the opposite, protecting players who go online and legitimately want to enjoy the game. The people who ruined it for everyone are the people your childish outrage should be directed toward.As for a review of the game The multiplayer offers a huge amoung of gameplay, with entertaining and fun characters and enough diversity in gameplay to keep it fresh for the majority of the story. The multiplayer is intensely fun as well, with races, deathmatch gunfights, custom cars, and a vast selection of weapons. If you think the multiplayer would have been better with people breaking the game and ruining your good time, then I suppose you should pass on it until Take Two lets those tools back into the game.
