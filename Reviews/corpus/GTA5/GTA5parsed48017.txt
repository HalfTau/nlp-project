As TakeTwo has reversed the CD letter they sent to OpenIV I would like to give this game a positive review. I would reccomend this game to anyone looking for a game that they can mod to their hearts content. The online mode is still filled with cheaters and hackers despite TakeTwos attempts. The online mode is tedious, but fun with friends. Would not recommend the online mode if you dont enjoy microtransaction riddled or grindy games.
