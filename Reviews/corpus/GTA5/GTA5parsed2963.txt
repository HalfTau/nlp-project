After reading all of the reviews about this game I can confirm two things.The rockstar servers are absolutely terrible on PCThere are too many moddersHowever, despite all of the issues in GTA online, I think this game is incredibly addictive. Single player mode has an amazing story and online is a lot of fun to play with friends.The pros of this game putnumber the cons, which is why I still recommend it.
