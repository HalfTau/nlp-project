In addition to this the whole system is designed to entice you into purchasing various cash cards since it will take hours of your time to buy any of the better items.It is legitimately difficult to find a public lobby where someone isnt spawning random hightier vehicles, money, or using various griefing cheats.Also very important to note is that if a hacker randomly decides to spawn money for you, it is unavoidable and you will likely get banned and/or a character reset.Buy only on sale for 30 or less so you can at least get 1/h value
