Everyone hacks online and Rockstar does nothing to stop it. Enjoy wasting your time trying missions while people in God mode kill you over and over again.Also, if you try and play legit online the pay rates are way off. Rockstar pushes their sharkcards, which are a total scam.The story is great, but the broken online mode makes me regret paying for this game.
