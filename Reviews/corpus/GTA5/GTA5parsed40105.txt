GTA V, itself, is a very good game. The single player is spectacular. The story is engaging. The characters are well written, the visuals are amazing. The online portion is...underwhelming. It contains little more than loading screens. The heists are pretty much garbage. The missions are meh. Everything is incredibly expensive due to Shark Cards and cheaters, so legitimate players who dont want to buy shark cards cant experience the full game. Heists can only operate with a full crew of 4, and any death of any player results in a failure. Its just very poor game design.But what really seals the deal is Take Two. Their legal CD of the OpenIV mod creators is unbelievable. This is a single player mod that does not affect online play at all. Due to their behavior, I highly recommend against purchasing this game as well as any game published by them.
