Why in the blazes do I need to play the single player prologue EVERY SINGLE TIME I want to start GTA online?! Makes me think the devs are complete  or just dont give 2 piles of dung about their game. And when I want to stop the game I need to shoot it down with the task manager as trying the proper way will kill my operating system to the point of having to press hardware reset on the case.Throw in the fact that progress isnt properly saved ingame as well, the limits imposed solely to make more money with Shark Cards that cost 10x as much as would be logical if you are into pay to win systems and I am quickly getting very sick of this game.I just cannot be bothered to touch it again for totally stupid reasons the devs could totally fix. Lazy and greedy devs combined with gamecode that is clearly not meant for Windows 10 users makes a game nobody should buy.
