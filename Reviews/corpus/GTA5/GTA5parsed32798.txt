Still bad a bad review. Neww reason.Before it was their actions against offline OOPS I MEAN ONLINE modding yeah sure, now its the fact this game is 5 years old, and hasnt dropped in price one damn bit. I know other games do this too, and I think its just as scuzzy. Its taking advantage of the digital market, and the consumer.I think with the age of this game, 69.99cad Is steep, Id gladly pay 4050 for a game half a decade old, especially one as well made as this, but not for 70 bucks.I am aware its the same price on the next gen consoles, which is also ludicrous, but they at least have slaes on the game here and there. I have a few friends who grabbed the game on Xb1 for 15 bucks.TLDR Drop the price, or put the game on sale once in a while / and more than 10 off would be nice. Would probably buy 2 copies for my buds if the game was cheaper.
