I not recommend this game...and there is the reasonRockstar have ed up the prices of cars, buildings and etc. Normal player who plays 2 hours a day CANT get enough GTA to ENJOY the ing online game. The money you get from heist and missions is really JOKE. You need 2 Pacific Standard Heists as a host to buy A ING SUPERCAR.You join an online session and you see some of the players have billions with mods but noone gets ban. Especially the livestreamers from twitch and youtube.So you Rockstar... want to play LEGAL but with these prices on every single thing, or better with these PAYMENTS from jobs that are real JOKE you will lose all of your community.
