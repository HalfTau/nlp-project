Should you buy CounterStrikeOffensive?I recommend this game to anyone that likes a good shooter game. I think its a fun game only if youre playing with a team or people that you trust. Part of the community can be really toxic, and theyll get mad at you if you do something wrong. The best aspect of this game is the Competitive mode, all of the other game modes are obsolete in my opinion. If youre competitive and you like shooters, this is a perfect game for you. This game is certainly not for everyone. I think the graphics are alright, its definitely good for an old game, the developers have re textured and revamped some maps to look more appealing.Pros Great game mechanics Very rewarding Fun to play with friends Very competitiveCons Faulty anticheat Toxic players Hitboxes are slightly delayed Spray patterns are glitchy in the new update Hard to rank up in Competitive Trollers
