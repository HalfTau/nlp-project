I had tons of hours on GTA on my playstation but then found out about the world of PC gaming. So after buying games and alot of other stuff, I realised that alot of my friends play GTA and its awesome with the mods. so i get it but while its downloading the mods have stopped which makes the campaign very boring after so much of playing and the multiplayer, if youre just starting, man are you gonna have the most boring time robbing store after store waiting for somebody to start a match or kicking you out because your level is low, then when you do get a buisness you do the same mission over and over and over again and you 10,000 every crate. which may seem like alot but everything in this game is just so expensive like a car for 3,000,000 that has the same stats as a 3000 car. You might as well just spend money if you didnt already spend enough for the game.
