Gta V is an amazing game to begin, although it does have many problems. I seem to not be able to complete many missions online without my game crashing.. After contacting many different support individuals their only advice was to reinstall the game.. Unfortunately i have very slow internet so reinstalling over 60 gigs is no simple thing for me to do. I do enjoy this game but these small bugs are a awful downfall to GTA for the PC.
