I would love to play this game for another 268 hrs just to get anything in the ing update, or I could play it on single player with mods! Oh, wait....Long story short, everything costs more in game money that you get, you have to grind like a MMORPG to get this money and even USE half of the content updates That get more expensive in game than the last.All so you buy the shark cards I think.
