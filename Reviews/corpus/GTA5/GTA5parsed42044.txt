A good game in thoery, Although RockstarTake Twos  business practices have been questionable at best since before PC release.  Game was a staggered consolePC release so that people would buy it twice,  there were promised expansions to the single player campaign that they backtracked on,  the constant addition of microtransactons in a full price AAA game and now their comments on what they think of their customers.  Rockstar and Take Two can now go to hell in my book. Done.
