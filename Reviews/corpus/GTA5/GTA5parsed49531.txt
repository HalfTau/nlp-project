The game was great. Until the idea that making people play 40 hours a week in multiplayer to purchase in games item was a good ideaIts a Grindy as Everquest, and Everquest SUCKS... Oh lets make it easier with microtransactions and make people pay real life hard earned money for in game currency. Inb4 do you want people hacking? Cause thats how you get people hacking. Funny thing is its all getting blamed on the modders when in reality Im pretty sure its cheat engine thats the overall problem. If only reason was used.RIP OpenIV LSPDFR LCPDFR
