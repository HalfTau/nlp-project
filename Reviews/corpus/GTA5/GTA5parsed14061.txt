Hackers Hacker Hackers and even more Hackers, and instead of giving us things we can straight up make money from like new heists which everyone was looking forward to, they keep pumping out mediocre dlc made with the sole purpose of making people spend money on shark cards to even be able to afford any of the new content, not to talk about the fact that rockstar literally take money away from peoples accounts and throw bans left right and center and manage to ban everyone but the hackers which are making multiplayer unenjoyable. As a long time fan of the Grand Theft Auto series It breaks my heart that I cant recommend this game at all at least for the multiplayer, while the singleplayer is fun, it lacks any of the new content and becomes pretty boring. Fix yourRockstar/Take Two. At least we can look forward to GTA Vice City 2 sometime in the future.
