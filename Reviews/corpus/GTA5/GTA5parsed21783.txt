In addition to the whole Open IV debacle GTA online is absolutely terrible. Everything is overpriced in a bid to get users to spend money on microtransactions and I also found out that the many hours I spent earning money on XBOX ONE were pointless as you can no longer transfer characters. They ruined single player by killing Open IV and they killed multiplayer by overpricing everything, DO NOT BUY!!!
