Great Single Player Game, online however has been nothing short of a disaster. Hackers on every server. No point in playing any missions because a hacker will just randomly kill you and give you trillions of in game cash. Based on my experience with GTA Online I am very hesistant with regards to the next game by Rockstar. Update 9/17/17  Hackers continue to free roam in this games online portion and Rockstar seems to look the other way, just had a friends Supercar get completely stolen from their Car Inventory and Garage. after they bought 20 in SharkCards. Will Not Be Buying Another Rockstar Game.
