Loading times are horrible. Sometimes, it also gets stuck while loading online.Way too high CPU usage capped frames at 60 FPS, 6600K, almost always at 100.Texture/Model PopIns.Also, Rockstar seems unable to prevent players modding in GTA Online, so I guess the only logical decision was to send a CD letter to OpenIV, a tool that has been used for SINGLE PLAYER Modding in GTA titles since over 10 years. Note This isnt going to prevent any modding in GTA Online, as these mod menus dont use any of the functionality that OpenIV provides.This game would be great if it fixed the problems I mentioned earlier, but in its current state, the loading times are too annoying.
