I really have enjoyed the GTA franchise and ended up purchasing more copies of GTA V than any other game I own. Its a shame its going to go out in flames like this. R I will not be supporting your games in the future unless this is addressed. I have tried to make online work, I have tried to get around the shark cards and extreme price gouging, Ive even tried to look past the hackers and jerks who ruin the game. I can even look past the insane loading screens. I look past that because at least I can play single player in peace, with graphical mods and trainers to truly enjoy the SANDBOX you have built.With no additional Single Player content since launch, Ive resorted to excellent mods that ENHANCE this experience, and keep me coming back. In fact, the only reason I bought the PC version was to take advantage of mods. BUT NOPE. Buying the copy 3x wasnt enough, Take Two wants more from me. They want to extract MORE from me in ways that only reward the cash cows. One of the most lucrative, best selling video game of ALL TIME, needs help from you to keep it going. Try and square that circle.
