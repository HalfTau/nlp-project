1  Rockstar has betrayed its fans and declared that modding their software is in violations of its terms and conditions. The popular modding suite from OpenIV that tens of thousands of GTA players use to run fun mods like LSPDFR, has received a cease and desist letter from Take Two Interactives legal team. Take Two is the parent company of Rockstar.2  Rockstar has made it mandatory to connect to Rockstars social club in order to play any aspect of GTA, including single player. Thus, any use of illegal mods or cheats can result in a ban from using Rockstars online service, thus, you will no longer be able to play GTAV, even though you paid for it. Rockstar has taken the stance that you no longer own a copy of the software, rather, license the privilege to use its software on the condition that you adhere to every single one of Rockstars ever changing terms.3  It isnt lost on my that Rockstar has been fighting a seemingly losing battle to stop cheaters in the online game, many of whom are using mods that use OpenIVs plugin. However, TakeTwo Interactive has also gone after another modding community that was creating a private server mod for GTAV that would enable people to play GTAV on private servers with mods and not ruin the GTA Online experience for other players. Instead of meeting the consumer half way and either securing GTA Online better, or supporting private LAN or private servers like most games do, TakeTwo and Rockstar once again show that they are only concerned with corporate profits, and do not wish the players to play GTAV in any other mode or setting unless Take Two can have complete control and profit from it.I will no longer be supporting a mindless corporate machine that wishes to seek legal action against its consumer base for modifying the product to suit ones own needs. I am effectively boycotting Take Two Interactive and Rockstar.
