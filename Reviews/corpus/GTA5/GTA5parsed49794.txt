EDIT Hope to not have to come back here again. This review IS NOT for TakeTwo , but for R who everyone knows makes a damn good game, good on you for sticking up for your players. Also, for everyone who supported the modding community during this . R has always supported and even promoted mods in the past. Its too bad the big wigs on top who care more about the money than the game have the final say. Assuming this keeps up in a positive way i will always reccomend, mods or not. Its a great game, and an amazing world with almost infinite possibilites with mods. Im just one voice out of the 10s of thousands of people who have spoken out over the last week, but i would like to personally thank all of you.ORIGINAL  Hope this all gets fixed , R.I.P OpenIV .
