I would say if I put all things with modding aside game became battlefield on steroids with lots of grinding and non rewarding system usually filled with hackers and you will get a nice mixture of DO NOT BUY! product.The major problem as I see is that everyone have access to military weapon. You can buy tank and rest of military vehicles with a simple click on your phone. I bet real mafia is buying tanks like this in real life. The RG went to far with latest update.I have played online until last DLC. MY first expirience with new DLC was 7 people with tanks in same session and couple of hydras  hunting newbies. What a joy may that be. I left my farms, my office and office garage full of expensive cars, 3 luxury homes and all just cuz i didnt want to play another war game.
