The online session is totally trash, I didnt play GTA online for a long time and finally bought this game during the winter sales, but when I connect to online session, the game told me my online account has been banned permanently. Im like what the  is this ???!!! I spent 4hrs to download this game with full excitement to see whats new in the GTA online and BOOM! Full of dissapointments. All of my hardwork in GTA online, BOOM, gone, just like that, and theres no point for me to grind again for another 300 hrs to achieve back what I achieved before. Save your money on other games, dont buy this piece of P.S I bought physical copy before this
