I dont get why people call them microtransactions, a flying bike that costs fifty real dollars or a golden jet that costs twice the full price of the game would need pretty massive transactions.Seriously tho, this game feels like a single player MMO. If you play with a lobby of random pubs, you will hardly get anywhere, and grinding up a million GTA takes a few hours, the setup of which already costs several million.If you dont have MMO amounts of time, or the resources to take the easy way out shark cards, dont bother. Otherwise, game is loads of fun.
