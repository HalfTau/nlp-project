Removing mods was a mistake. Take Two ed up big time, and the overwhelmingly negative on the recent reviews is proof that they messed up. The singleplayer mode, when the campaign is over, and sometimes even while the campaign is in progress is pointless and gets boring really fast. I wasnt a big fan on online mode since I saw it as nothing but a pointless grind, sure the heist update was fun, but that was probably one of the best updates for online, if not the best update for online. And that was over 2 years ago. There was no reason to remove mods, Take Two. Im ashamed the way that Take Two limits users, people just want to have fun with mods, I would understand banning mods on online mode, there is no doubt about that. But singleplayer? Really? Why? Thanks for freeing my hard drive of 70 gigs, I needed it
