The incredibly hostile attitude of Rockstar and Take2 towards the PC community has led me to give this game a negative review. First, GTA Online is a poor experience as its a grind fest, which encourages its players to pay for shark cards, which buy you in game currency, which is the goal of the experience. It punishes players who just want to have fun. They also insta ban people who have simple mods online.But most importantly, they have sent cease and desist notices to OpenIV, a modding tool for GTA games, which is incredibly anticonsumer. The modding community for GTA has been massive and has added life to the GTA franchise on PC. Being hostile towards modders is inexcusable when its the reason when many players, such as myself play this game. I get banning people who mod single player and then play online to an extent as you cant take any risk, but this is just stupid. This wont affect cheaters on GTA Online as they dont even use OpenIV. Youre just screwing with the average player of GTA. I wont buy your next product, even if it is the best ing game ever because its clear you guys are incredibly greedy and dont give a damn about your playerbase.If you guys can reverse order, then I will gladly change my review. But until then, this is my last Rockstar/Take2 game.EDIT They removed the CD from OpenIV but removed a lot of mods that altered map assets. Keeping my review up because I dont think this is the end of Rockstar and Take2s nonsense with the modding community
