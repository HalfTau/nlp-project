Its honestly a good game, I just wish they would fine toon the pricing and bring back some of the older content, I miss the old days when the most expensive thing was an adder for a million dollars and when the armored cars that dropped the 5 grand when 5 grand was actually something to go for. I like this game but i personally dont reccomend the game for its nearing the end of its life and the content is honestly not there yet.
