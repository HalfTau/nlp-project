and in the product includes GTA online something you already paid for and you gotta pay more money to get things in the game, and they are trying to ban mods, and i recommend never playin this game if you  own it, it will save you some money and time. And also when you mod the game and they add an update for it you cant refuse the update because they want to outdate the mod you have installed, soo you cant play with the mod ,untill the mod is updated. And this game will crash if it has one problem, it also fills up a lot of space on your storage, each mesh and texture file is about 1,000,000 in size. Its also has some of the most repetitive gameplay I have ever seen its, kill this, kill that, open this, blow up that, find this, move that, sure it has an ok story but the gameplay itself is almost too boring. And in the online if your making money the AI will get a higher accuracy and does more damage, in heist if your gonna complete it fast some times a random ped will go faster and kill you on the road.
