The only reason why I bought this game is now been disabled. The owners of this game disabled all singleplayer mods. There is no reason to play this game anymore. GTA online is a hackers haven and it looks like they only want to fix hacks when there new DLC out.GG. I will not buy any more rockstar games or shark cards until they start to support the community.
