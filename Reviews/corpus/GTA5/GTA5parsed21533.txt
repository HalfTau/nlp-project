This game is fun and all, and I would recommend, but the game takes WAYYYYY too long to load. I mean, Just Cause 3 loads faster than this game. There have been countless times where I am stuck in the Social Club loading screen. Why does that need to happen? Why does there need to be a Social Club sign in? Why cant we just use steam like the other online games out there?Ill admit that I have bad internet, and sometimes online games dont work well, but I get an error message when trying to join a friends game, and when I try to log back into Online, when it was working 5 seconds ago. I am positive this is a GTA problem, since my internet seems to be fine on other games while GTA isnt working connectivity wise.I would have a much easier time recommending this game, if Rockstar could try to fix these problems. Otherwise, gameplay wise and whatnot, the game is good.
