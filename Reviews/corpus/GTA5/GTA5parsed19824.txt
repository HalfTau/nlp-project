Its a great game with friends. Think there need to be more normal looking long hair options for woman though. We might be criminals, that doesnt mean we should look like rats...I think the missions and such should be more accessible. The agent that keeps calling me to tell me about all the fancynobody can get without paying for a sharkcard needs to be banned.I hate a lot about this game, but I still seem to love playing it.
