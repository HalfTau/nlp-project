This review is about singleplayer company ONLY. I dont want to play in GTA Online, so yeah, singleplayer only.Ive done this game 3 times. Once on Xbox 360, then on PS4 and now on PC. And every time when I play it, it feels good. Everything about this game is goodExcept for aircraft controls. Im talking about driving, storytelling, NPC behavior, voice acting, animations.Pros Story, characters, story telling and that stuff are super cool! I understand every character, every decision, plus on some points youll have to choose for example, heist plan. Every action is recording, so at the end of the game youll have nice psychologist review. Details. SO MANY DETAILS. You met one of characters? Hell offer you to hang out with him. You hit another car? Listen to the responce. Killed famous guy? Listen to the news on radio, itll be mentioned. Music. Every action comes with own music. Stealth  stealthy music, heist  action music. Plus, lots of music on radio. Optimisation is just great. Ive played on my notebook on highultra settingsNvidia 960m at 60FPS! You have more than just main story. You have lots of side mission with strangers and theyre really cool. Humor is about feminism, racism, capitalism, etc. I love it! City is alive! ALIVE! A L I V E! hey,  off I have no idea how did they found those voice actors, but they are G R E A T.ConsI N G  A I R C R A F T  C O N T R O L S
