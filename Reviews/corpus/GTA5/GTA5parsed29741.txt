Dont get me wrong, the base game was good, despite zero replayability and a plot that doesnt even try to make sense.However, one cannot in good conscience support what happenned next1. Plenty of free DLC content, with replayability, fun toys and a few nice quality of life improvements. Except all of it is multiplayer only.2. Players in multiplayer are actively incentivized to prevent other players from making money.3. There are tons of hackers in every other multiplayer lobby, often making it unplayable and potentially exposing other players to the very strict ban policy.4. You know how FTP games are generally a lot more expensive than normal games? Yeah, prime example. The most recent upgrade, Gunrunning, would cost you around 400 or 320 hours of making ingame money or around 200 hours of pure nofun farming. Thats avoiding 2 and 3 above and assuming you aint big on cosmetic upgrades. Oh, and if all you want is just one fancy toy from the update, you cant buy it on its own its useless without a certain costly upgrade, which is unlocked through random costly research, and then you need a bunker costly to do research, and then you need a special new workshop costly to install the said upgrade, and then this workshop can only be deployed inside a new truck costly... You see where Im going by now.5. How do the new updates to the game greet you? Right, with a black loading screen with a huge notice about what theyll do to you if you try to cheat. Yep, gaming mood going, going, gone...6. Take Two and Rockstar pretty much spit into the customers faces by issuing a cease and desist vs Open IV  modding tool that allowed the community to at least try to address 1 above they essentially banned modding for singleplayer.All things considered, heres hoping to The Elder Scrolls Vice City.
