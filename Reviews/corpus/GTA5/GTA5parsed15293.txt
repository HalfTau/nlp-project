Story was excellent, best GTA game ever. But there is a big issue with online. The loading times are huge. I think developers should do something about it immediately, otherwise they will lose player base which is already shrinking. Graphics are extremely good, game play is good and musics are excellent as usual. Also, the character Trevor Philips add another dimension to game. If you didnt buy it, you can just buy to play for single player. However, it is sad that online still need improvements.P.S. If you are 4 friends looking to play together, it is the best game for you. Waiting times should be no problem for you, just do it.
