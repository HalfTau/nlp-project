The GTAV singleplayer still is one of the best experiences you can have as a player. The Charakters are stong. the Action is great and I liked the story.And even GTAO had potential. It really did.But due to overprized stuff that is almost necessary in order to do the fun stuff it is imposible to play without shark cards. That and the recent ban of mods are the main reason why i cannot recommend buying this game anymore.Rockstar has stated that this behaviour towards mods was not their decision and i am inclined to believe them. However, that does not make this any less painful.STOP PLAYING. DO NOT BUY. SCAMS ARE LESS COSTLY.
