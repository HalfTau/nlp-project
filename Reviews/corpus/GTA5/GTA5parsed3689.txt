This game reminds me of when I was a kid, riding my bike around, gaining athletic prowess through repetitive physical actions, stealing cars, and shooting everything and anything that even could be misperceived as in my way. My mom, god rest her soul, would have loved this game, it really incapsulated every single morale code she held dear and tried to pass on to me. So, in closing, this game is a mustown staple to any christian gamers library, a little boring for the kind of people who prefer more brutal gameplay. 4/5 bibles.
