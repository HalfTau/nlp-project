No, this dead horse has been beaten long enough. The game is dead, dont say it isnt. Its from 2013 for s sake, you can only keep something like this alive so long without milking it for every dollar. Gunrunning DLC is a perfect example of this, you cant feel any of the new content unless you have millions of dollars ingame, which either needs way too many hours or way too much real money. Also, Im pretty butthurt they shutdown OpenIV because my pockets were bigger than a Jews wallet after reciving the passover donation moneyTLDR Takes way too much ingame money to enjoy the new DLC, also modding is good, you cant deny it.
