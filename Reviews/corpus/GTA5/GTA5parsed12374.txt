I have had this game for ps3, ps4, then finally pc. i had a very big shock when i got this for the pc. over time ive seen this game develop  not very well Firstly, all the single player expansions were cancelled.The online stock market never happend.The shark cards ruined the game purely a pay to win scheme now everything is so god danm exspensive.The thing that annoys me the most the the phone calls... please please sort it out rockstar its a fking psstake.every other online game has amazingly managed to make it rather easy to mute people and somehow rockstar has made it rather god danm dificult, instead i have to listen to some annoying 13 year old about how he is going to desecrate my mother with his one inch pinch.Im not sure about the future of GTA i hope this isnt it.
