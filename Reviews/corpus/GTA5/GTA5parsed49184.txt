TakeTwos actions were not specifically targeting single player mods. Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody. We are working to figure out how we can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players.  Rockstar GamesLet me translate The online didnt make as much money anymore because we suck at preventing cheating and people preferred playing the role playing mods or modding single player so our boys at TakeTwo decided on a scorched earth tactic for this one.Dont support business practices like this.
