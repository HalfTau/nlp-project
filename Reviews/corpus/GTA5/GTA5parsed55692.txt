Hire the modders, pay them to make the single player content you REFUSE to create. Dont think about it as a bad thing that your fans are creative. Help them. You are lucky and yet you ignore and now actively attack your community. That is just sad. We all know you should be better. Please make good going forward. We dont want you to become heartless like EA.
