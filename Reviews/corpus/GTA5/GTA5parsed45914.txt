Take Two you really juston yourself.The only reaosn people still play this game is due to modding so you have the best reaction by adding the antimodding policy which is making the game so boring as now some people cant play LSPDFR due to OpenIV and a ScriptHookV error caused by this new update. Sort yourout. Its almost like you dont care about GTA
