Dont buy this game. Its a fantastic base game its got a great story with interesting chaeracters, and the world is vast and you can do what ever you feel like.Rockstar and Take Two are greedy, corporal scumbags. They, if you havent heard, have banned modding from GTA V singleplayer. The logic for them is if the stupid, easy to manipulate goldfish cant mod anymore, theyll move to online, and buy sharkcards with the little money they have.Im sorry Rockstar, that youre making billions not trillions. What help is it? You could buy everything in the world with that money, yet youre still wanting more. Im sorry that youre not the top selling video game, youre fourth.And you act like were fish, like well do whatever you want us to do because youve got more money than my whole family tree. And I know this wont change anything, but DONT BUY SHARKCARDS. Dont give them what they want. you, Rockstar. Greedy, malevolent scum of the earth.
