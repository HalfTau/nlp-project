Bought the game for single player initially, to be honest. Played through it twice and loved it. Then, a friend introduced me to single player modding by showing me this video with cars sliding around at 100 MPH and hundreds of cats being spawned from the end of a machine gun. That was what brought me back.Considering the zerotolerance policy pushed by publisher TakeTwo on the modding issue, I cant recommend this game. If they have any deference, theyll ban mods for online only and let the single player modders do what they want, seeing as it affects no one elses ability to have fun.Your neighbors gay marriage doesnt negatively affect your straight marriage, and neither does their single player modding. Get it together, Take Two.
