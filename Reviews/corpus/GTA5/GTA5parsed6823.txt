Single player is one of the best GTA stories ever told and every reason to pick this game up when on sale for a huge discount.Multiplayer however, is a mess. Im not talking about the price of new Xpac content either. There are ways to farm cash quickly if you are not a scrub, do some quick research on farmable missions, heists, open world stuff, ect.... As of Doomsday, leveling up as a lowbie has never been better just join a DD mission and chill with the CEOs. That said Ive seen so many bad players who cannot seem to figure out how get item A to point B and refuse to git gudIve seen someone struggle for 10 minutes to figure out how to put a van in a garage. Fortunately reddit can save you there with many group pages filled with players who actually have common sensesuch a rare thing these days.All this aside the reason I cannot recommend this game for a few reasons. Chiefly being, thepoor servers for online. Constant queues with poor matchmaking options, followed by more loading screens, followed by a mission where one scrub can ruin the whole experience, followed by another loading screen, and one last long one to take you back to the overworld at which point sometimes things happen to fast for the game and leave you in loading limbo till you TM and close the app. After the server issues comes the modder problem and the games ban system picking players who may not of been hacking and just in the wrong place at the wrong time and permabanning them. Lets wrap up the three strikes with this final point TakeTwo have been nerfing every way to make more money in online from bugs to straight up removing the best farming missionold school 2013 stuff arguably better than the farming methods available now with the DLCs from the game just to make shark cards more enticing. In a world currently running rampant with the freemium method desensitizing society to its inherently greedy and underhanded approach to revenue generation Id tell you to pass on this one.
