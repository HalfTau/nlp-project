well, kinda hard to make a good judgement. The story mode is nice. Like it.Reason why i do not recommend that game is the online mode.It takes ages to login and get started. The loading screen is your new friend. My recommendation get a discworld book. You will be suprised, how fast you will be done with it. Just take your time, enjoy the music from the loading screen and read a good book. Im writing this, while I am waiting for the game to load...
