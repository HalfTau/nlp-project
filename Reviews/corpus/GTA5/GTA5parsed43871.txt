I love this game as much as anyone else, but the new update took away all my money, everything is so expensive, the bases have timers that you have to PAY to get the upgrades you want, and it all around isnt as fun as it used to be.That and the loss of OpenIV has ruined any fun i was having with it. I may still play from time to time, but ive been pretty burnt out recently.Please fix this rockstar.
