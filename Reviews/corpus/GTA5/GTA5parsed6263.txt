For anyone reading this in the future.Singleplayer is pretty good, straight on fun with a good story and loads of fun to have. Can be improved with mods for extra catharism.Online/ Multiplayer steer clear. A very obvious cash grab masquarading as some online fun. The concept was good but sadly it has completely fallen apart and sets up paywalls everywhere. Missions are quite lackluster in both quality and variety, hesits are pretty fun but a lot of them incoporate freeroam which has hackers and general douches aching to greif you over and over, and finally the insane level of Pay 2 win aspect in this where players can buy ridiculously overpriced money bundles shark cards to get flat out better equipment. DO NOT PLAY Online if you value fun or sanity, it will frustrate you as much as the load times and the greifing. In the most recent Doomsday update they added an orbital cannon which is basically pay 900k to insta kill someone period, no ifs or buts, just flat out a greifing tool. Rockstar and 2K hate hacking til they can make money off it. So no blance, no variety, and definitly NO FUN.If you buy this game dont buy anything else in it, the story is fun enough for a couple of playthroughs but the online is the ultimate p2w experience or maybe hacking It is pretty sad that this is the case but that is how it is.Online had so much potential but someplace along the line of shark cards and stupidly overpriced OP equipment and vehicles, that potential died along with a decent chunk of fun.
