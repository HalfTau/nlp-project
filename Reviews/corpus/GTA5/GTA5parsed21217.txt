To be completely honest, this game did not wow me. It also did not live up to my expectations. I thought that it was going to have more action, more adventure, and more badassery. In reality, half the game is just you driving to a location, shooting it up, getting money, and losing the cops. All the quest and missions sort of have the same backbone to it. After doing ht first 10 or 15 missions you get tired of the same old pattern. Sure its a fun game, but its not worth the price tag of 59.99. You can get so many better games at that price point. Plus, Grand Theft Auto Online is complete trash. Community sucks. Lacks fun activities with other players.
