Used to love modding gta 5 offline. The openIV team were always good at putting updates out better than R Now i cant have my fun in a open world sandbox game which is meant for modding but take two are c and took away everybodys fun. if you have not purchased gta v on pc yet i highy recommend not purchasing this dog bowl of a game. TAKE TWO YOU WILL NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AGAIN WITH YOU DEMONIC DESPISE AGAINST YOUR COMMUNITY YOU NEVER LISTEN TO US NEVER REPLY TO US AND NOW YOU TAKE AWAY OUR ONLY FUN ON TWO GAMES WAS THIS PLANNED ALL ALONG TAKE TWO?
