I would recommend the game due to the great mods and addons that you can put into the game. But wait...Take Two Interactive, the company who owns publishers Rockstar Games and 2K Games decide itd be a great Idea to take this away, taking away MOST of the mods used for singleplayer. OpenIV have been creating mods for over 10 years, bringing thousands of people to actually buy, install and play Rockstars and 2K Games.Theyve done this for one thing... Microtransactions. Theyve been losing sales from their audience on GTA5 due to the mods for SINGLEPLAYER in which they believe isnt fair on them. Theyre trying to make singleplayer as plain and boring as it first was so more of GTA players ove to online, the paytoplay piece ofit is, just so they can get money from them to bring their income back up.Ill come back to recommend the game if Take Two ever decide to take back what theyve done, otherwise Ill just watch all the negative reviews from other players.
