UPDATE Thank you to the community and to Rockstar urging TakeTwo to get rid of the Cease and Desist letter, while what they did the right thing to rid the CnD, Im still going to keep the thumbs down. The reason being is that this shoudnt have happened in the first place. TakeTwo, you need to respect your community and the people who buy this game, especially to those who mod your SINGLEPLAYER experience which potentially increases the game sales.We dont hate you, just hated that you made a decision that almost lead a great community into the dirt, a community that loves Rockstar games and appreciate the fact were given the chance to increase our play time.Lastly since you did this, I will be most definitely be getting Red Dead Redemption 2. You Take Two and Rockstar are both a great company, and a great team. Lets all join forces to keep on making great content together, and having an excellent communtiy. Thank you.I loved this game, played the hell out of it on Xbox One, then decided to get it on PC since I had the computer to run it and I could also use mods. But now that dream is now a nightmare since TakeTwo Interactive has officially screwed OpenIV when they did nothing wrong. Good job....................................................................
