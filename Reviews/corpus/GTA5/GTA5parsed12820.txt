With modders in almost every session you will get into, the time and effort needed to build your own so called criminal empire makes this a very unsatifying and forgettable game online. Normal Story mode for the casual player will suffice but the hard core gamers will find the need to try the almost unplayable Online mod. There are many really good features to the Online game and have enough variety to draw you in. But when you cannot advance because some griefing modders are blowing everyone up and stopping all game play in a session, you ragequit to another session to find....... a modder Teleporting next to you, killing you with a single punch, then TPing away laughing. If thats what you call fun, then Online is just for you! I am uninstalling this game. Good luck to the new buyers. This isnt worth the money.
