I have immensly enjoyed the GTA franchise and while I personally have not yet played modded GTAV and likely wont get to now I am giving this game a negative review in support of all the players that have spent hours of their time playing an altered version of a product they paid for imo modding is fair use.This review also represents my stance on the principle of modding due to the number of other games where I do play in a modded environment.
