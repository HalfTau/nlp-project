This game is a great game, it is fun and very exciting. I have put multiple hours into it, playing solo and playing on the online part. I do think that they should focus more on the single player aspect and that they should also devote more of there resources in other places besides multiplayer, i understand that it is a great money maker but at the same time it gets very boring and repetitive
