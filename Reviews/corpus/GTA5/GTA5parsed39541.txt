I would not recommend this game because they essentially turned the game from a singleplayer/campaign oriented game into an online only game. Take two basically killed single player with banning open IV with no real reason other than being money hungry. I would not reccomend this game anymore. The multiplayer is fun however after 50ish hours it gets boring. With singleplayer it is fun for like 1020 hours unitl you complete the campaign. Then you could download mods and make it fun again. No longer can you do that so I wouldnt reccommend buying the game any longer.
