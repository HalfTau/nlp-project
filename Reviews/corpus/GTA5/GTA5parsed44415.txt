Rockstar is my favorite developper and publisher. With a pedigree as impressive as the GTA series, Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne, why would you not expect the very best from them ? More importantly, after over a decade of publishing games that felt and were complete with great stories and amazing content, only ever releasing DLCs that not only were great but felt like completely different and new games, one of which is actually my favorite zombie game, youd would have to be crazy not to expect anything else than an amazing and perfect game and eagerly await each dlc.In any case thats how I felt back when Grand Theft Auto V came out. At first I was overwhelmed, I had never seen a game with such a big scope, so much to do and so much to see, the game looked amazing and felt amazing and the missions were great, but the more time passed and the more I realised the game didnt have nearly as much soul as Red Dead Redemption, GTA IV or even San Andreas had, the game didnt have that unique charm of the wild west or of the gloomy and dark vibes of Liberty City and its fun and crazy vibe paled in comparison of those in San Andreas. Of course the missions and visuals were much more impressive but thats to be expected from a game coming out in 2013, for which we had been waiting for for 6 years now.The first thing that worried me was when I entered a police car and noticed we couldnt do police operations, not a big deal, I thought, therell be some more things to do, paramedics, firetruck or the train for sure, so on I go, ready to stop the train and get inside. I run up to it and with my pistol I shoot the driver... nothing happens, the train just keeps going, at this point Im baffled, theres no way they did this right ? Surely theres a bug or its because I shot the driver and theres no one to stop the train, so on I go and decide to wait for another one and I start to follow it, it has to stop at some point so I follow it, and follow it, and follow it and obviously it never stops. Now Im legitimately disapointed and confused, why would Rockstar bring back the train and showcase it in a trailer and not let you drive it ? I go on a hunt for a paramedic and fire truck, same thing, you cant do anything with them. What the hell Rockstar ? I also notice that this game has nowhere near as much side and has taken a few steps backwards compared to GTA IV and even San Andreas, you cant enter restaurents, the army wont come for you when youre at max star level, the game has serious lack of interiors and you cant buy and get new houses unless it works with the story, the activites like pool, bowling, air hockey, Poker, black jack and so on have been dropped and theres only tenis and golf left, there are animals to kill and hunt but there isnt any point because you cant skin them to sell their pelts, the people and police are all inging crazy and as soon as I even touch their model they want to beat the crap out of me, thats if they dont pull out a handgun, you dont see police doing police thing anymore and when they do they dont arrest and make a cool scene like in IV, they just pull up, shoot the guy and leave and god forbid you try to help cause if you do itll be your turn soon, you also cant crouch anymore, peopel dont react anymore when you shoot them aside from dying when it used to be that they would lose balance and if you shot armor wearing police theyd stagger and shoot their gun from the stagger, all the police does to stop you is ram yourand you seemingly cant avoid it even if you have the fastest car in the game, peopel apparently die after being hit in the face two times which makes it hard to have a cool fight, you cant turn the engine of the car off anymore etc. I just didnt believe all the details that made the previous games amazing had been thrown out the window, at least I was going to get a good story I thought.Jokes on me though cause the story isnt even all that great, the characters dont ever really grow and at the end of the story, without spoiling, youre kind of at the same place as you were in the beginning so even though you do all those cool missions it apparently doesnt matter at all. Its a real shame because the characters are probably the most interesting ones we got in a GTA game but because the game is shorter than GTA IV and its divided in 3 protagonists we dont have nearly enough time to really grow attached to any of them. Oh well, surely the definitely incoming DLC will fix that.Thats what bothers me the most, we KNEW a DLC would come, there had to be one, it had even been trademarked and the voice actors had teased it on twitter and then... silence. Nothing, its been 4 years now and there is no DLC in sight, even worst, its not coming anymore, for sure, because Red Dead 2 is on the horizon and they would never release a DLC that could hurt the sales of their next upcoming game and why did they never release it ? Because they just decided to sit on theirbecause the online mode made enough money off of the shark cards anyway, so why bother ? All they want us to do is take their stupid online mode with its 10 minutes long loadings and its god awful player base, buy those stupid cards and  vehicles they put in the game and shut up. At least I can mod singleplayer and do what I want right ?It hurts right ? Grand Theft Auto has always been huge when it came to mods even since San Andreas where modders gave birth to the first ever online Grand Theft Auto game which might have inspired Rockstar to make the online mod in their next games, people made and created the craziestfor GTA especially in GTA IV when people made zombie mods, tsunami mods, earthquake mods, they made models for npcs and players, recreated real life cars with the outmost care and details and made all sorts of visual mods like the famous ENB mod, in GTA V they doubled down on the sillyness and made some mods that turned the player into Iron Man, the Flash, that let players finally drive the train like they wanted and put in features that should have been in the game in the first place, they started what is now one of the biggest feature of GTA Online, that is GTA RP and now T2 and Rockstar comes in and says  you and is stopping modders, starting with the OpenIV team.Well  you too Take Two and Rockstar, it is such a shame because even for all its faults you made one of the most well crafted games of all time but then you do all this you cancel the singleplayer dlc, you shove those microtransactions down our throats for that terrible online mode where the grind is eternal and awful and then after people have sunk hundreds of not thousands of hours you go and ban their accounts for seemingly no reason and take away everything they worked for, make probably the worst story Ive ever gotten from a Rockstar game wich is baffling considering Red Dead Redemption came only a few years before GTA V and it had the best one, take away all those amazing details GTA IV, San Andreas, Vice City and Red Dead Redemption had and have one of the most disapointing and underwhelming radio soundtrack Ive heard in a GTA making an all around very disapointing game.Rockstar used to be my favorite developper and publisher, not anymore.TLDR Rockstar used to be great, they used to make amazing story, they used to make incredible and perfect games, they used to stand up for modders and even feature them on their website, they used to make great singleplayer dlcs, they used to pour love and details and content in their games. Not anymore.
