Its a great game, considering I bought it on the 360, PS4, now PC. I think its exremely greedy to stop player transfers though. Running into modders/hackers in multiplayer is actually quite rare, so dont let that stop you from buying the game. Single player has a good story to it and has very good voice acting.
