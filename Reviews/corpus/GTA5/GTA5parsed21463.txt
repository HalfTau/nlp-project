If u have money  send them to the game and you get everything but then u have nothing to do.If u have no money  play the game for 24/7 to get everything but then u have nothing to do.So only 1 thing what u can do is hustling as much as possible to get something  clothes, cars, houses,... and trying to avoid lil kids which want to kill u for no reason. If u want to lose your time 24/7 doing some papers, do it in real life cause money from real life give something, this game only steals your money  and time.btw Banning people who drop money for free to other players didnt start to make the game fair....they want people to buy shark cards.
