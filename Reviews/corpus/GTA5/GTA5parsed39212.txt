Rockstar and Take Two are taking this strike on modding way to far, destroying peoples livelihoods like the guys over at OpenIV, and ruining the fun of other players, specifically the ones who still actually play the god awful, underdeveloped, short single player. Worst part is, Ive seen no change in GTA Online in the amount of modders, so the online is still broken to all hell, but now the single player can join it too, Rockstar, get yourtogether...
