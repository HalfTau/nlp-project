Story mode hasnt received a single dlc since launch and now T2 has banned single payer mods, so no way to add new user made content... NO SINGLE PLAYER MODS, RLLY??Online mode mechanics are totally free to play/pay to win style, there are modders griefing ppl in 50 of the servers, and in the rest, it doesnt matter, even nonhacker players will try toeverybody off destroying stuff to avoid getting money, totally encouraged by R, they want to make getting in game money as difficult as possible to sell shark cards, is the only thing the care about.Im never gonna but a Rgame again.
