Just let us mod in online play... think of how great the game would be if you didnt have to spend 40 game time hours to buy a car. 90 of my time played was when you could mod, boy were those the days. Now I log on for maybe 30 minutes and get bored because its just too grindy and the loading screens are minutes long. has that potential to be a great game but falls short now.
