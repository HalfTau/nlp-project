I was expecting a whole new GTA online experience, with new patchs and what not. Yet i got stabbed in the back. I bought this game 3 times on 360, PS4 and now PC. I had my level 100 charactor transfered to PS4 once from  360, So i couldnt do it a second time.This is a total fxxking bullshxt if you think about it. I bought this game 3 fxxking times and instead of encouraging third purchase, they force you to do the stupid ing grind all over again. Of course I didnt know this and after ton of research I found out FROM THE ING PLAYERS, NOT ROCKSTAR, that I cant transfer it the 3rd time.Total ing t.
