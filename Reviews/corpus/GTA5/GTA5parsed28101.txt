This game is amazing! In singleplayer, the story and character development.... well.... You couldnt ask for any better. everything is just so well written. You hate the people youre supposed to hate and love those who you are supposed  to love. and the graphics. WOW!. car Handling is perfect concidering what you do and how you use vehicles in the game, but for a game where you use cars and vehicles all the time, it could be better. As for online, a solid A. All the opportunities and stuff you can do, makes me want to play this game all the time. Although it is a bit expensive, it is worth it. It used to support modding very well, so you could make great cinematic videos, which you can still do, but not as good. The days of modding in GTA is over. That is the reason why people are rating this thumb down. But you should totally buy it. Modding will be back some day.
