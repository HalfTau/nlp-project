GTA Online has slowly but steadily lost its identity over the years, and while the singleplayer offers some very fun content it is obvious that the online portion is the main selling point.And that exactly, is its downfall. TakeTwo and Rockstar have pulled a move for nothing but greed. When GTA Online launched the grind was very quite fun, things were obtainable but reasonable with the most expensive vehicle obtainable costing 1 million dollars The Adder, and it was nothing but a luxury item. These days you can spend 6 Million ingame dollars to buy vehicles that will ruin everyone elses day in the lobby as they are nothing but heavily overpriced killing machines.The game has lost its identity, it is nothing but an almost impossible grind.
