To be honest, I never thought of rubbing a bank ever before even in a gameexcept PayDay.The steps before we stated is interesting,it shows me a lot of funny.But some of us didnt like the background music especially during the battle we fought against the enemies.At all, its a good game and worth to play for a while.
