This game has an outstanding story mode. Its interesting, itll keep you coming back for days  or perhaps youll play it in one two day stretch, because you cant put it down.The online mode is possibly the worst thing ever created. I know nuclear weapons are pretty high up there, but no. The online mode in this game is the worst thing ever created by humanity. Easy solution? Stick to story mode. One of the perks of sticking to story mode is getting to enjoy mods which make the single player experience more interesting. Oh, never mind. TakeTwo just sent a CD to the creators of the main modding tool for this game citing security reasons. . This is part of an ongoing attack on the PC community by TakeTwo, which started with a CD to the original FiveM team.They feel theyve not made enough billions out of milking the absolute dogonline mode from this game. One of the things implied by security reasons by TakeTwo is people playing onlineonly content in single player, presumably ahead of release, as we have seen. Apparently having access to online only content in single player is stealing billions from them.This is intolerable on PC. I would say it is a duty of those that have not purchased this game to never do so, and I would suggest it is a duty of those that do have the game to not ever purchase a shark card, or even stay off the game completely. We dont want this behavior on PC. TakeTwo, you are not welcome on this platform.
