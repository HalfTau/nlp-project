Nothing less than revolutionary, a setup for games to come for the next decade. Underwhelming graphics but minimal glitches with a compelling story to lift you out of your seat. In no way do I blame Rockstar for the hostile enviroment online but I forgive them when reminded at the complete quality of the game. The game does an incredible job getting the player emotionally invested in these different personalities. I look forward to all Rockstar releases for the future to come
