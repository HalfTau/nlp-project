So basically, really good singleplayer, but the games management is cancer.Half of the time, R gets who they ban wrong when it comes to hackers. There are people that can hack continuously and not get banned while people that just so happened to join a lobby with a hacker giving everyone money get banned for having illegitimate funds. You might as well get a new game if this sht happens to you because youll keep getting banned until its permanent. R seems biased against people theyve banned previously, with more than a few accounts of this happening. People have also gotten banned for using mods inonly but Ill get to that in a second...In fact, no. Lets talk about that now.So TakeTwo has decided that mods are not OK. In GTA. The wacky game series that has had mods since the dawn of time and has sold more than a few copies because of the badass mods you could get for it. Modding this game has always been a chore and there was always a risk of being banned in multiplayer because...??? You modded singleplayer. How. Dare. Yuo. The final nail in the coffin is sending a CD letter basically stop your operations or well shoot you full of lawsuit holes with our army of lawyers to a major modding site for GTAV. Of course everyones rightfully mad.And the salt on the wound is the fact that someone high up in TakeTwo thinks that they are being polite by not charging more for this game. OK.If you dont care about all of that, then how about the fact that the new update is pretty much unaffordable if youre not a hacker or a money whale because you need at least 10 mil to get started on it. But you can totes bypass the money grind by buying overpriced Shark Cards.Top kek.Its a shame that an amazing singleplayer campaign has to be completely ruined by the developers and the publishers decisions. I guess if you dont care about all of that and want your onrails experience, go right ahead. I wont stop you but fck.
