Dont listen to any of the reviews that are negative on behalf of hate for the developer. That hate does not reflect the actual quality of the game, which is completely fine. These reviews of negativity and hate have no place in the product review section, and should be placed instead in the forums for discussion. You guys are not reviewing the game, you are creating congestion in the wrong section and acting like children. Banning mods is stupid, sure, but dont make your complaints here. People who want to buy the game will see the reviews tanked because of your childish behavior and back away from a purchase of an otherwise quality game for reasons unrelated to the games function. Not ever customer cares about mods and your attempts to convince people not to purchase it because the devs are seemingly preventing mods is unfair to the game and the customers who want to buy it but have lurking thoughts of uncertainty due to the negative rating honestly, reading just a couple of your reviews would be enough for a sane consumer to just dismiss it and make a purchase anyway.ProsGame is funLooks goodOnline is funLots of contentConsCommunity is childish and takes to bashing the games rating to try getting a point across, probably the same kinds of people who throw bricks through windows with letters attached to them
