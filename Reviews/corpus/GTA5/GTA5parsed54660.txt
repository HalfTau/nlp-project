TakeTwo Interactive, parent company of Rockstar  Games, is hostile against single player modding. They have sent a cease and desist to the OpenIV, killing one of the most universal offline mod tools to ever enter the GTA landscape. I can only see this as an attempt to further milk GTA Online for every penny that they can get. They dont want people to have fun in single player. Along with OpenIV, they have also killed the Liberty City and GTA V initiative.Please pledge support to the PC community and culture by not funding TakeTwo any further.
