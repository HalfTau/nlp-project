If you dont already have the game, you can currently get it for 25. At that price, it is totally worth it just to play through the story mode. Online is a whole different deal. You can have some fun racing and taking part in various heists and other shenanigans without wasting your money on Shark cards. The fun wont last forever when you run up against players who paid to win, dropped a bunch of IRL money on better weapons, armor, cars, planes, and other things. But it can still be enjoyable and is well worth the current price. Even if there wasnt online gaming, it would be worth the current price.
