only reviewing for badges but with the amount of time spent on this game stealing cars, working on a criminal organzation,escaping  the law, making deals crazy deals with my silent character and pulling off rediclous stunts just to make ends meet,causing complete chaos on the streets in the air and on water... well very few games are that fun.
