Good game but it belongs to moneyhungry, scummywho would rather silence the creative expression of the modding community andoff its entire fanbase than let its community enjoy the game, which they bought with their own money, whatever way they please. I will be boycotting any future Take2 games until they improve their consumer relations and I GLADLY welcome anyone who is willing to do the same.We cannot afford to let Take2 get away with this or else we risk the rest of the gaming industry follow this really REALLY  business practise.  you Take2, have fun rolling around in your money piles while you can, it will not last.
