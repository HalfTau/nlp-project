300 hours on this game. 50 on the story and the rest online. Dont let the free DLC fool you because GTA doesnt want you to play online. After 200 hours of building a charactor, buying businesses, car and condos I was banned. Why was I banned, for cheating. Now I had no cheating device installed but like everyone played in servers where people cheat. It is unavoidable. After calling them and explaining I didnt get I was read the same lame excuse of You ID will be banned for 30 days. I waited the 30, begrugdingly. I deleted the game and did a fresh install. Started a new charactor since Rockstar deleted my old one, and started to build my empire again from the ground up. 40ish hours in I received a notice telling me I have been perminately banned for cheating. Again I tried calling Rockstar telling them I will submit any files they need to prove I wasnt cheating, I was informed they have algarythms that detect it so I was definately cheating. I have never used OpenIV, had any mods installed, or any programs that allow cheating, yet now my Rockstar account is banned on all games past present and future from online play. Great Job Rockstar for cheating your loyal players.
