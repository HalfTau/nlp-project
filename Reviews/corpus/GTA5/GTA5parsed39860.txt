Got permanently banned because it was the second ban i received.The first one i got because someone teleported me a whole day long and then rockstar thought i were it.After i started over again from scratch i was happy that i found a modder who gave me a decent amount of money so i didnt have to make all these lamea55 missions to afford like 1 car in 1 day.But then i got my second ban which now is permanently.Besides that OPENIV is not available because R and TakeTwo took this away from us, too, the fact players get banned for no reason is big load ofWhy is Rockstar doing this to me/us? Because i cant fkn afford 100 for 8Million shark card?I paid 60 for this game and after these 60 they even have not enough and suck our money out of our wallets with thissharkcards.I dont recommend this game as long as Rockstar and TakeTwo doesnt care for their players/customers.There are plenty of people like me getting banned for no real reason. I mean it is NOT a reason to ban ME because SOMEONE else gave me some money ingame!If Rockstar will see this Review, in fact i doubt it, i hope they can contact me in any way to tell me how my ban is reasonable.is my email its also associated and linked to my social club account which is permanently banned for GTA V Online
