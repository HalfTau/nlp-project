This game is probably one of the best games ever made. I enjoy it thoroughly.Its a dam shame that people are giving bad reviews because of the mods not being available anymore. It doesnt mean that the game is bad.One thing Ill admit is that the map editor is the worst editor Ive ever used. If steam had a star rating system Id give gta5 a 5/10 just because of how frustrating the map editor is.
