TakeTwo, Rs publisher, decided to TakeTwo fingers and show them to OpenIV and the entire modding community simply so that they can force people into GTAO and buy microtransactions.Ive got 2 copies of GTAV PC, retail and digital, Ive probably played 200 hours in game, but due to TakeTwos incompetenceDO NOT BUY GTAVEdit OpenIV appears to be back, but that doesnt change my verdict on TakeTwo, and you still shouldnt support their shady practices.
