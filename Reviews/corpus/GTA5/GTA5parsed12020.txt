Great game, Online unplayable in its current state 9/10 lobbies have hackers in them. This has been a problem for a long time now, months and months with no resolution in sight.Should you buy this game? If you solely want single player fun then Yes. Its well worth it. If you are buying it to play online with friends... NO
