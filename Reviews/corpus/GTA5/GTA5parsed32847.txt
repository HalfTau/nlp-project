TakeTwo got greedy, banned modding, and made everything in the game unaffordable just so players would spend more money on it. Its impossible to play for more than half an hour without getting extremely bored. The game isnt fun, the story is crap, and any potential it does have is completely wasted due to the head companys greed.Were undermonetizing our players, I believe they said. Clearly this game is only designed as a cash machine without any passion or love thrown into it, and it shows PAINFULLY.
