The game has every great features input into the online game, but then was made so difficult to play and have fun with, that its actually an annoyance rather than a flexible game to have fun withHeistRequires high end apartment, tedious startup, not to mention the time consuming session for players required to be filled. There are jerks who always left at the last minute, or left when the mission fail at the last checkpoint. Loading takes a toll of the time and each full heist could take like 23 hours, without any fail of course. Unless you are doing the first heist, which is the Flecca bank. CEO Mission, also known as crates and vehicle mission.Forcing the players to go play in public session, whereby all the vehicles, truck, boats and airplanes could be blown very easily with any jerks using homing launchers. To make things worse, the connection stability is so terrible that any associates can get dc very easily, leaving the crates/cars exposed and destroyed in public. The reward for the associates was not interesting at all and many would not want to be part of it and waste time.Biker DLCAgain, with businesses almost similar to CEO missions, just a little different whereby you need to wait for the production to be filled and then actually selling it. Issues were same as CEO missions as well, forced to join public, whereby 20 jerks were waiting to fill you with frustrations, after hours of waiting for product completion upon spending efforts in resupplying each business.Rockstar should provide more flexible options to players instead of forcing players to go public and perform each missions. The players should be allowed to do so in solo session while can get extra rewards if the players willing to go perform those in public.Overall, there are many great features in game, specifically for the online version, but Rockstar just ruin each of them very hard and leave the players with nothing but annoyance.
