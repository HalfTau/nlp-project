Mods are back, doesnt mean the online mode got any better. There are three ways to make money in gta online illegally hacking it in note HACKING, not MODDING, very different, grinding more than I have ever done in any free to play game to get money, or buy shark cards. Guess which method they want you to pick, cause it sure as hell isnt the first two. Couple that with poor moderation and stupidly unbalanced vehicles, weapons and most systems that exist in the game, and I strongly recommend you buy nearly anything else.
