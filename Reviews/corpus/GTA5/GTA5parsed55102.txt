I played this game for so many hours, offline and online included. No longer can offline be modded because of Take Two, and so the game is incredibly boring after finishing through story mode. Online sucks as well because it relies on you spending money on Shark Cards. RIP the modding community and streamers. RIP Rockstars integrity
