Ive been a fan of Rockstar since the early 00s. Ive put more hours into the GTA franchise than I have multiple games put together talking over 20,000 hours over the past decade and a half. I was eagerly awaiting the announcement and trailers of GTA6. I was looking forward to more Lazlo, more shameless mocking of politics, more blatant disregard for being politically correct, more racial and class stereotypes because Rockstar are masters at delivering this stuff alongside an engaging story in a world where you can do almost anything you want.But Take Two, Rockstars publisher, has made it clear they are AntiGamer. They can dress it up however they want, but removing the ability to mod the game, after the option has been around for years IS AntiGamer. At this stage of evolution of gaming, modding is something developers, especially AAA developers, should be incorporating into their games as a default feature. And yet here we have a publisher who would rather remove an aspect of the game thats been around for years.If modding is not an option built in for GTA6, I will not be giving my money to Take Two. I dont want to stiff Rockstar, but I will not give my money to a publisher who hates me. I will be looking up what other games Take Two publishes, and if theres a title I want that they would get money for.... looks like Ill have to find another way to play it.You cannot take a deuce on your customers and expect to keep getting their money.
