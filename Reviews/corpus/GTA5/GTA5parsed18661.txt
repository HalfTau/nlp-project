The constant presence of cheaters and hackers are killing this game online. I received huge amount of money without ever being able to refused it, get teleported and given cash without being able to refused it. Money just appear in my wallet without notice. Rockstar did get the money back of my toons without banning me but i feel like some day they will be less nicer. Didnt play the campaign, just online fun.
