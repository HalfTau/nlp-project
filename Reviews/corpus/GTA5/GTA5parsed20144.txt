Great game with a decent enough campaign and superb online! Had this game on the playstation when it first came out and now moved to PC and wow its superb in 4K resolution, game runs sweet on max settings too. Rarely any trouble. Frequent updates, some good and some not so good including races, missions and deathmatvhes etc. In game purchases  of money available however persoanlly I think this spoils it a bit! Anyone who plays GTA welcome to add!
