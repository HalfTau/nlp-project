I can recommend the single player as it has the best characters in any game, all though the story missions themselfes was a tiny bit disapointing.The HUGE negative side of this game, and why I dont recommend it, is the grindy multiplayer.Youve read it all around pay up, or expect to grind and grind and grind the same missions for days while being killed by some kids who have paid huge amounts of money to get planes that can instantly kill you from the other side of the map without warning and without reason. After all this grinding, you can end up with a slightly armored car which can withstand bullets, but not the rockets incoming from hacking kids with battle helicopters.Play the single player, stay clear of the multiplayer.
