Dont indulge in this game. Its just a time and money sink that gets you nowhere, with the added bonus of not being able to mod anything at all anymore. Good thing that I paid like halfprice for this game one time and not a dollar more. Enjoy it if you want, because I assure you there are still people, but dont pay for it.
