Game takes EXTREMELY long to load, even on an SSD an an i5.Very flakey game. Needs SEVERE revision to the online play. What makes the game bad? Having to play an introduction in story mode before you are allowed to play this game online. Followed by the amount of resources this game requires to run. It is very flaky and runs like garbage. I can literaly go cook a meal and come back and it may be not even be loaded.
