The very idea of banning modders from singleplayer games is abhorrent to me, The singleplayer is good, mods made it excellent, the online is only ok with friends, its mostly a money grab, but with the right group of friends its a fun grind, that does not however excuse the behaviour of Take 2, and the inaction of Rockstar. If you have any love of the PC community do not give these people your money.When you see thousands of your dedicated playerbase  a lot of these negative reviews are from people with hundreds or thousands of hours in the game leaving in droves, that is a call to action to communicate, but all rockstar has said to the community is  wasnt us they really need to figure their hi out.In addition there is a difference between modders and cheaters, modders play singleplayer, and keep to themselves, cheaters actively attempt to ruin the gameplay of others in online, I guarantee that shutting down Open IV will not result in a loss of cheaters in online.
