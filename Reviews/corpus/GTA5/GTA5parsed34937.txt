This Game used to be the best I modded theout of it played online on top of modding single player for fun as a hobby.  Now that Rockstar and TaleTwo Interactive have done this disgraceful act they shall pay for their crimes. How could they do such a thing? Single player modding kept the game fresh and fun now its just bland and boring... Furthermore, Rockstar and TakeTwo treat us like absolutethey dont care about us. Fail to realize what they have done, and have awoken the beast that the GTA Modding community is. They will repent their sins. Overall, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME! The companies behind it are solely motivated by their greed and money lust. They dont care about the community and  with us constantly! LOVE YOU OPENVI!! DONT BUY THIS GAME!
