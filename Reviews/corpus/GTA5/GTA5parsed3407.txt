The game itself was always awesome, the humor, the puns, the easter eggs and the stuff u hear on radio, etc... BUT the GTA Online is still something that didnt work... and still dont... I wish there was a consistent way to play coop missions in this game... but i still love the franchise, just try to make GTA Online work, please?
