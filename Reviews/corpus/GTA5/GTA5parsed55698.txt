Really disappointed only reason me and a lot of people brought this game was to mod and you have stoked that, nodding is not illegal and you know that you just want to push people onlinr so they spend more money on you ing micro transactions, I hope you get so many negative reviews you are forced to revert back. Modding kept the PC version of this game alive, time to watch it burn.
