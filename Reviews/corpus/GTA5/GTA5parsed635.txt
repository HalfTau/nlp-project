Good graphics and doesnt take a super strong computer 30 fps on a slow dell, good plot healthily mixed with open world and many sidequests, if thats your thing. Online is fun, but expensive, might require shark cards or get carried. Lots of realism insurance, house buying, ceos of organizations. Modders are annyoing but can be avoided.Dont buy unless on sale, still a great game tho
