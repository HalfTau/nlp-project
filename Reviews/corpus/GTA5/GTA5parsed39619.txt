This game is super fun. Best GTA in a long while since Vice City imo. The online portion is fun too, just make sure you have friends to play or it can get kinda lonely and not fun. A lot of people are complaining about taking away their mods and what not, but it doesnt take away the fun factor of the game. In fact, getting into a game with some invincible dude not killing everyone and stealing your money actually makes it enjoyable, who would have though?The single player is well done and well written. Once the heists kick in the overall enjoyment of the game skyrockets and is blast to play. The overall tone of it is perfect unlike GTA 4 and the characters are entertaining.If you havent played it do yourself a favor and pick it up. Its super fun. the online portion is like playing an MMO without all the grinding. The heists both online and single player are super rad.Overall 8.7/10
