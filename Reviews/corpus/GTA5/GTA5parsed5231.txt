Open world playground where youre the biggest thug? Killing people and robbing companies. Now with 200 more playable characters. Liked when you were younger and wrote some weird code to get a car? Now you can spend several hours doing repetive things or pay generous amount of real money to get the car of your dreams. Dont bother buying for Online, unless you have friends or looking for some people to play with.Offers at least 40 hours doing only singleplayer, so if youre not into Online, it is still worth for the classic GTA experience with a decent story.Regarding Online Its filled with so much content, that doing all of the Rockstar created jobs will take you a good amount of time. Constant updates, with poor support and occasionally failing to save. If youre worried about, buy an SSD, the game has 75GB on a large open map. If youre worried about, theres plenty of ways to play only with your friends. The only problem with Online is, that it is pretty much P2W as long as you care about other people in public lobbies. Making money takes a long time, so having fun with your friends is prefferable, than putting yourself through annoying grinding mode. Most of the stuff you buy is permanent, so its somehow rewarding.
