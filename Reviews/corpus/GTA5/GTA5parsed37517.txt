I have probably played more of the GTA series than any other game ever, I love it. But I cant encourage anticommunity practices. Mods have kept me coming back to GTA for years and now but now 2K has decided to take all of that away and nullify thousands of hours of work put into the mods and tools created by the community. Its amove all around and does nothing to fix the problems with multiplayer like they claim, its pure greed as far as I can see. Sorry Rockstar, your publisher is ruining this great thing you have made.
