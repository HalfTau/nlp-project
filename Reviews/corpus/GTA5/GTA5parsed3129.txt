Of course recommended. been playing since it first came out in 2013 but story mode only. finally got a chance to play the online and absolutely enjoy every second of it. sure the online can be grindy and full of cancer and modders players but dont let it stop you from enjoying the full content of it like races, deathmatches, heists, CEO jobs, Motorcycle clubs, and LOT more contents. Story mode is 10/10 not as good as GTA IV though, but eh we know gta v story is a bit boring D. but overall, i love this game and i gave it 9/10 not 10/10 unless rockstar really decides to ban ALL the modders which is really annoying.. Recommended!
