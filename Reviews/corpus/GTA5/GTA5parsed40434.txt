GTA V has the potential to be an amazing experience, but time and time again R and T2 have demonstrated that all they care about is money. Someone starting a new character in Online now would stand no chance of saving up enough for the high tier vehicles and businesses in any reasonable amount of time. That is, of course, without spending real money, or cheating. Its not even as if caving in and dishing out the money is that viable either the Shark Cards are all horribly overpriced considering the price of most vehicles, you would have to spend 40 to have enough ingame currency to afford just one good vehicle.All this I would have forgiven as the game is good fun, especially with friends, however Take Two recently filed a CD against OpenIV, a modding tool used to create harmless single player mods, such as the Iron Man mod etc. which you will probably have seen if you use youtube. Considering the quality of some of these mods, and the hard work put into them by certain individuals of the community, it is frankly an insult to the playerbase that they felt the need to shut it down especially as the tool was not used for anything shady in Online.If I were you I would hang back from paying for this game.
