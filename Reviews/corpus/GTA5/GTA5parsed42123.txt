I guess I gotta ride the bangwagon as everyone else.I just think the latest update was pretty awful. Cash grab, takes a total of 7.5 days of ingame idling to get everything done or pay a total of 10 million over 2.5 hours to get research done.The new vehicles are fun, especially the Oppressor  but the update itself is .Oh yeah, good job on taking down a huge mod menu contributor. No, not Open IV  one of those actually terrorizing online gameplay.You shouldnt have sent a CD to Open IV. Shot yourself in the legs.
