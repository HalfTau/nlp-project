The story line for single player is awesome! Then I switched to online and just wow. Everything is massively overpriced! You have to buy these massivly overpriced apartments so that you can do heists etc. The jobs you do wont make enough money to buy these items unless you want too commit too this game like a fulltime job. In essence they tilt the game so that you keep buying Shark Cards too boost your in game account balance.
