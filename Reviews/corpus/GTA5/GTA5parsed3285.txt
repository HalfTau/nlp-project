Disappointed to say the least. I thought the Xbone version was bad.. Constant load screens with no expectation of it ever loading, system crashes and full lock ups that remind me of gaming in the 90s. Seriously I have rebooted my pc more times in the 2 days owning this game than in the past year of owning this PC. How it still commands full retail price is beyond me, Its 2 generations old and coded by chimps on typewriters
