I have no problems with rockstar getting rid of modders messing with the servers and the people who actually play and farm legit, but we are also talking about getting rid of the SINGLE player multiplayer..Fix the online the server, but dont stop single player modding, I dont see whats wrong with that and SINGLE player modding has been a part of the gta genre since the beginning! Get rid of the online modders, but dont punish the single player modding.EDIT Thank you for listening to the community, heres your thumbs up back.
