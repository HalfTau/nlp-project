I dont play GTA 5 since a couple months. I have spent many hours on this game, which a lot of them, were spent in single player with mods. The main modding tool, OpenIV, was shutdown by Rockstar Games. Why? Because they want you to play online, it gets them more money. A while ago they shutdown another service which created a thirdparty online system. Rockstar games creations are awesome. But they are managed with just money in mind, and to make them get back on the road, we should stop buying from them. No more shark cards and negative reviews will be very common in the future if they dont change their mind.BY THE WAY SINCE RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 IS COMING OUT ONLY ON PS4 AND XBOX ONE, THEY REALLY ARE SCREWING US PC GAMERS.
