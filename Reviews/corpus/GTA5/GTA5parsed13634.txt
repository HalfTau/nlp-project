This is  a great game, that is if your PC can handle it I am a low spec gamer I play this game on a about a 6 year old laptop with nvdia 4200m and get about 40 fps on all low at 800600 which is playable for me as I just play for fun. I wouldent spend too much time on this game as it will be addicting in a bad way, Im talking to you 12 and under as you guys are going through a transition of middle school and your rotting you will rott your brains with strippers, guns, gore and the ocasional drugs which will be bad for you... Have Fun!
