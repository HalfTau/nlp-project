It looks like the actions against OpenIV have been reversed, so Im reversing my review of this game to a recommendation which I could already give because it is a fantastic game! Ill leave my original here for I guess posterity.I love this game hands down but Take Twos recent action against OpenIV is inexcusable. Its such a shame that theyre harming the modding community, something Id never honestly tried with this game but actually was thinking about recently. I really hope that Take Two keeps true to their name and reverses this ridiculous policy.  Original review, June 17, 2017
