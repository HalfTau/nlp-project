Its not the greatest Grand Theft Auto, but it still very well made video game.Tons of content both for single player and multiplayer.The story personally I didnt like, was very disappointing that they took the comic direction more than the dramatic one that we loved in GTA IV.I dont think it was the greatest Idea to do 3 characters simultaneously, interesting for sure but I had trouble to connect with anyone because of that, one minute you playing Michael and just when you get interested in his life we cut to Trevors story and then Franklins, maybe people liked it but I personally didnt think it was the greatest idea.The graphics are awesome and the map is big and beautiful but not the physics of the game, the car driving is absolute childish and unrealistic I know it doesnt supposed to be but hell, in GTA IV it was great, yeah it felt you drove a drunk car but at least it had a good racking mechanics and it felt real, here you barely can destroy a car when you crashing it and just standing right beside some people can make them call the cops on you for some reason what the hell?.And the most importantly killing and having a police car chase is really boring, especially when you 5 stars wanted and the cops try to run you over like mad people I mean... It isnt me who supposed to be the bad one here?.its not fun and I stopped doing that after couple hours of playing, which is sad because the main reason people play these games is because its fun doing that thing.Online part on the other hand is very troubling subject The main problem is the loading screen time... just... my god you waste 70 of your time on these incredible long loading screens for no good reason, just a shame, if it was made technically faster I might have played this for a longer time.Also the robbery was really disappointing since they were advertising it like the really big thing of the game, it just aint... it involves a lot of waiting again with the loading problem... and unskippable long cutscenes that really arent that great in the first place, and if someone fks up or dies you wait like 2 minutes to start over, thats just absurd, and I dont have a problem for games to be difficult and hard but here its just annoyingly bad and awful executed.I do recommend this game because it was very well made and you can see they put a lot of effort into it, but its still not a very good GTA game in my opinion funny it comes out from a guy who played it for more than 200 hours but thats only for the achievements in my defence,if you want a good story and game mechanics you should check the previous titles like GTA IV or Vice City or SA that I  personally dont like but its still more fun and holds up more than this one.Anyway, not that bad but I was still really disappointed when it came out mainly because of the weak story line, but hell, at least radio rock radio is great!
