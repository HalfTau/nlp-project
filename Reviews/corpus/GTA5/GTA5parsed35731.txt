this is the ing lamest gta game even though its the one I played the most, I dont remember anything from my really lengthy experience of going through the campaign, there are only two ing characters that are memorable, compared to the many I remember from Vice City, III, San Andreas and even ing IV. The open world is not even that fun to explore or mindlessly drive around in because everything feels arcadey and floaty in the worst possible way, it tries to be loose but it ends up being feeling too strict in regards to every single possible action the player can make.I think I can write an entire video essay on how this game pales in comparison to its predecessors, and how Take Two the publisher treats those who mod this game and try to make a better multiplayer is absolutely one of them.
