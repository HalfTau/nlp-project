Modding is back, and the game was still on sale for Steam Summer Sale  30. Tbh I think 30 for a game thats like half a decade old is crazy but that should speak to how well this game can stand the test of time, which makes it a good purchase. Online community is still thriving, and now thanks to Rockstar, the single player community can thrive again too.
