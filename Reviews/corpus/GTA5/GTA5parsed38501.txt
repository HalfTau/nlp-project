Take Two Interactive has backed off from GTA V modders but the damage to their reputation is already done. It is still blatantly obvious that all they care about is money with how they keep coming with updates and new content for the online microtransactions while doing nothing about the ever present population of hackers that ruin the experience for everyone else.With the current online experience and pricing I can not in good conscience recommend this game.
