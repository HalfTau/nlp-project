This game was once great. I started on Xbox 360 and played the crap out of it, moved to Xbox One and the game just gets worse and worse with each update. If youre brand new to the game there is no way in hell youll ever experience everything without paying for overpriced Shark Cards. My real anger came when I purchased this game on Steam after building my first PC and then finding out they removed the character transfer. WHY?!?!? Why would you do that? This is to prevent modders from transfering modded accounts to PC like that actually worked? No. I come to PC to find modders EVERYWHERE. So not only are the modders everywhere, I have to start a new character because I cant transfer my level 318 over to PC that I have spent countless hours on. This as well as the recent removal of innocent players money is by far the biggest F you Ive ever gotten from a game. Not to mention their servers that seem to be runned  by a 12 year old. Seriously, Ive never had more trouble connecting to friends in any other game then this. Its not that my connection is bad, far from it, but the amount of disconnects and server crashes my friends and I have endured are just unreal. Glitches, holy freaking hell there are so many glitches that hurt this game even more. And for some reason, R only patches ones that are fun. Like the gate glitch, drive your car into a gate and keep pushing on it and it launches you. Or the Titan C130, they patched the rear door so it doesnt open. But again, they dont fix their servers or patch the bad bugs.Do yourself a favor, DO NOT purchase this game. Ever
