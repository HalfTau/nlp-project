Why is this game on mixed i personally like it very much, the only things i dont like are that you cant change the characters car not so much, i dont like losing my car if i for example put it in the safehouse garage and then take it for a ride and go somewhere it will dissapear, these are the only things, overall its a great game, you should buy it.The multiplayer is good too i really dont know why people dont like, sure you need to grind and sure it has some pay 2 win elements like shark cards which give you extra money but where is the problem? You can be alone or make a private session with friend if you like, stop sayingabout the devs its only normal to need more money after this game. 11/10
