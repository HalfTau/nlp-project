Love the game!!! But I mostly love the online mode cuz its actually an mmorpg session LOVEIT!!!!. But lets be honest, there are still some downside with it like the modding being banned thing that you just did which is awful and there is this one player who had an armored truck and fing shoot me while I just getting started even though I get over it. Soo at least you guys can let me have a session where the online players are the same rank as me. And obviously PLS ADD A DLC FOR STORY MODE!!!! You guys already add soo much content for online mode, so how about you guys gave us a DLC for Story Mode!!! But all and all its a great game and for those who read this comment, dont always trash talk about the creators. Respect them and when they do something terrible dont just say anything figure out WHY they did it so you guys understand why they did it even though some of you already know why.
