Is it a good game? Sure. It does what it has to do. GTA Online is pretty fun once you get past the confusing UI and the painful lack of a good pathing system.Its just not a good Grand Theft Auto game. The singleplayer is lacking and suffers from being forcefully tossed between perspectives, two of which only exist to flesh out the remaining and only remotely interesting one. Its the first Grand Theft Auto game where the online features are better than the singleplayer, which might work for some people, but Id prefer it the other way around read the story is bad, in my opinion.Id give it a mixed review if I could, but being forced to decide between recommending it or not, I choose not to.
