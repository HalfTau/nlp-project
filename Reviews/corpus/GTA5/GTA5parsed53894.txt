I loved this game, while it did have its rocky start, it eventually became really fun with a great modding community that continually gave it life. The fact that Take Two is trying to kill the modding community in order to force people to play GTA Online, which is full of bugs, hackers and nearly impossible to play without buying game sharks microtranactions shows how little they care about the gaming community and only cares about making money.Until Take Two decides to remove its cease and desist against the makers of OpenIV, I ask you stop playing GTA V and ask steam for a refund, hopefully theyll listen to our wallets if they wont listen to our voices.
