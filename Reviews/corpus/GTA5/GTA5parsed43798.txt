Rockstar and Take , what makes you such a company? This game is hugely known for its modding scene and this is one of the only things left keeping this game alive with sales.I do not understand what makes you such tight . Why not alow people to have fun with a better game by adding things YOU cant provide? What makes you so scared about people using your games files to make it better.You have been shutting down GTA 5 modding since its PC release, and now you have just took it a step further.If you ever touch FiveM, we can guarantee you that your sales and reputation is not going to look too good.You can redeem yourselves by making GTA 6 a mod friendly game. Even better, add modding into the games mechanics, especially for the roleplay scene. This game is revolved around modding, and it has always been. If is simply the best part about this game. So listen to your followers, the people who pay so much damn money for this game. They want it.
