Graphics are still quite good. The single player is good fun just like the other gtas and humorous.The multiplayer is where it really shone out for me as I loved playing gta 4 on multiplayer  admitedly no team mafia work but lots of crazy special races, survival and businesses to run as you slowly accumulate hoardes of wealth and real estate its a long grind but great with friends. Heists are probably the best part of multiplayer Ive found so far at level 89.The loading times to get on servers can be a bit frustrating at times 5 seconds to several minutes, but then they have a rather large online player base for the servers to cater for.There arent many games I can play for more than 300 hours and still come back for more! Totally got my moneys worth out of this gem for 20  given the time Ive had out of this I would almost pay full price for it!It is a bit cpu intensive my old fx6350 struggled to run this in 1080p at 60fps while my new ryzen handles it well.Highly recommend this to any gta fan.
