 Sorry for the bad english, its not my first language I have never been more dissapointed in a game dev.I have seen many terrible decisions made in the past, but without a doubt, this has got to be the worst.Its not a good idea, to mess with the community, because then this happens.If the API changed the way multiplayer, in farvor for unfair play, I can see the point of them getting it removed, but this is not the case.Why they are doind this, is beyond my understanding.Just look at Skyrim, and see how well that game goes, because of MODS!I hope Rockstar/Take2 is going to pull this back and allow mods for GTA V again, because this is really destroying the game.I hope people choose to never buy another Shark card, so Rockstar/Take2 will learn thats its unwise to screw over their community, just because they are greedy!At this point, I would rather use my money on a Call of Duty or Battlefield, rather then this.
