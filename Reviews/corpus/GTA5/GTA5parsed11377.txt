Rockstar support is very helpful when you are troubled. rep lulThe fact that Grand Theft Auto V GTA5 and GTA Online feel like 2 different games to me and they come in one pack seems very critical. I find the main story to be casual rockstar script writing, it does the exaggerate the feeling that it is unique in the sense of how things play out in terms of story route. If you get the game you probably should get it for the sake of GTA online solely. It feels uncomfortably worthwhile to say so that just GTA online is worth 60 USD, its quite steep but to say the least the features and entertainment you get for just GTA online is of a significant amount.This has the environment where this could be a game requiring a lot of grinding. You could end up procrastinating a lot over this game. Load times are crazy. I mean sure keep items and feature prices steep no problem, dont take it to the point where we need to become a pay to win player or have to pick up some unethical measures. Ping difference in combat results in troll results, its frustrating to be on the short end of the stick in that situation.To conclude, get it for GTA Online or not at all.
