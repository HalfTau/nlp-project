Dont get this game. You will meet so much tryhards and hackers. You will meet tryhards of every race dissing you in another language while they use expolsive ammo for snipers and miniguns and expolsives close range. They will run after you kill them a couple of times. They just go ghost orginizationOff Radar for entire crew to run get bullsharkboost that allows you to take and give more damage and snipe or try and rush you. Or they just might go ghost orginization and get a armored truck or a car with guns to catch you by surprise. And if you say that you will just leave them alone just know, you cant. They will try and kill you if you are minding you own business. Take it for me dont get this game i owned it on ps4 previously and wanted to see if was different on pc but it is not. The main thing i did with the time i have on this broken game is main get into gun fights with lvl 200 people who tryhard even when i am not even lvl 90. They will just the minigun on you like with was a normal assault rifle. The have no care they will kill you if you even if you are lvl 2 because they want to boost their kill/death ratio.Just dont buy the game.EDIT Also every thing is overpriced so if you want to pay 10,000 for a shirt in gta onlinewhich allof the first part will take place in then go for it. All the cars are also overpriced so if you want a carThe cars that are not slow and the ones that have cool customization cost basicly 1,000,000 and you do not want to work for it then that will be 20 of your real life money.
