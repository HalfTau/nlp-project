The story isnt bad, but the online portion of this game is god awful. Everybody there is mindless and eventually made me quit online mode. Also, if youre thinking about getting mods for this, beware. I had two, TWO MODS! And the game said NOPE and instantly crashed. I cant even get back on the game. everytime i click on the game, it tells me that the mods are keeping it from running. Ive done everything in my power to get rid of the mods, but it just doesnt work.
