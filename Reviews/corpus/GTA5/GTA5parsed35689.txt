I really enjoyed the story mode, after I completed it the game got boring really quick so I installed mods and it got more interesting, then I found out I cant play online if any mods are installed so I had to do two separate install directories for gta5 modded and unmodded, now they want to stop modding support all of the sudden wtf why OpenIV ??? oOThe online is fun as long you got the money to spend, if you dont have the money then you got 3 choices, grind and keep on grinding and you will still get fk all as other troll players will stop you from earning any reasonable money, you can hack to get the money, if you lucky enough you can meet a hacker that will be kind enough to give you some money or take your wallet out and spend you hard earned cash on in game cash, you might as well because to get any decent money from grinding you would have to quit your real life job or be a little kid that should not play this game in the first place.I wasted so much time on GTA online grinding same missions over and over and 8 out of 10 jobs you do some idiot will fk it up for you and others in the lobby or just simply quit mid or end of heist and there, good 1 hour wasted its just not worth it anymore, I had the most fun with the game when a hacker joined our lobby and started giving us cash, and no I wasnt stupid enough to pay for in game currency, whoever did ruined this game as Rockstar made jobs just not worth your time so that they can milk you out of your money even more.PS. I rather pay for the DLC and am able to enjoy its content, not get it for free and cant do anything with it unless u got no life and can play this dam game 24/7 or you are some rich kid.
