I purchased this copy purely for the modding community. LSPDFR and to fool around in modded singleplayer. Open IV does not allow modding of online play. Take Two is really shooting themselves in the foot and will most likely see a major hit in the sales of their upcoming games if they do not make this misstep right by the community. This has effected 10000s of people. Until something is done to fix the wrong decision of shutting down Open IV I cannot reccomend anyone to purchase this game and support Take Two any further.
