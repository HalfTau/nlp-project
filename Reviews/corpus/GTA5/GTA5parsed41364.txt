While pretty fun, the cashgrabbing of the developers and the shutdown of the modding community is having me give this game a negative score.Especially when you look at the still high pricetag.If you play this game, youre going to encounter an artificial paywall where you must spend money on microtransactions just to have the nice stuff.
