I like this game, its funny to play, lots of things to to and own in multiplayer, but in its current state its unplayable. It has been overtaken by hackers, and the devolopers seem unuble or unwilling to solve the problem. Beware if you are planning to buy this in order to play online. Until something is done, your game experience will be ruined!
