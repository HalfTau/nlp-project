This game use to be fun, but it got really bland and stale for me after I played its PC release. There are too many issues to list surrounding this game now and not just from a gameplay perspective but with how rockstar and take two have been treating the community. I simply cant justify recommending this game to anyone. I truly regret giving them my money twice over now seeing whats become of it.I know my play time is low on PC but I use to play this game a lot back on console
