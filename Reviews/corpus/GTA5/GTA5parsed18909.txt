I do recommend this game. Why? 600 hours and most of them were fun, we play games to have fun. Mission accomplished. Has it turned into a cash grab? Well yes, but any game with microtransactions is a cash grab.In short Great graphics, amazing single player campaign, amazing graphics, amazing gameplay, moderately fun multiplayer
