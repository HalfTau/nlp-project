Its not pay to win, Its pay to have fun... When a game adds a sence of progression its usually good, but in this case youll find yourself wanting to play all the new updates that have and relise you need millions to do that. To get 8,000,000 in game cash, which will get you a few nice things, or a big boat you will need to pay 100 out of your own pocket! For a game thats about 2 years old on PC these prices are unreasonable. I can no longer recommend GTA V
