This is sad that Rockstar is putting down the modding. Because single player modding doesnt affect anybody! Ive been playing GTASA and IV with mod for more than 7 years. It had been giving me the incredible moments and feeling that we lived with our friends. Thousands of new ways to play any kind of your ideas with mods even in IVs unranked multiplayer. Ive taken a hundreds of cinematic screenshots in IV with modded cars and graphics, it looked incredible, people liked it! Now is it going to be prohibited? The ability of creating some great memories and feelings is going to be closed. Can we protest that? Can we win this via petitions?However, this is the most polished game franchise Ive ever seen.
