Game mechanics are ok besides the armor, and single player works cool I quess, but  that online, just  it. Im not even talking about their greedymicropaymentstrategies, updates adding tons of ING EXPENSIVE stuff but never any considerable ways to make money,  CEOmechanics or hackers. Those things could be tolerated, if the game was a playable quality product. Well, the online is ing not. The netcode is absolute t, using bandwidth like theres no tomorrow and jamming routers, yet continuously dropping people off sessions and heists, scrambling group of friends to multiple different sessions and often just lagging in general. Loading screens are a hell, a typical play session say, doing some heists with friends consists 25 of actual playing, 70 of loading screens of different sorts they never give any output to the player, so you usually dont know what the  are you actually loading right now, if anything and at least 5 starting up crashed games, rejoining sessions that dropped you and other kinds of t you have to go through to make up with the broken game. And from that 25 gameplay, about 70 driving from place A to place B, 20 shooting at the police, and maby 10 of actually unique, designed and enjoyable gameplay.I just had my share of these and all of the new bugs introduced by the doomsday heist trying to play the final act with my  friends, and just  YOU,  THIS GAME. I couldve used all the time I stared at loading screens doing something worthwhile with my life.
