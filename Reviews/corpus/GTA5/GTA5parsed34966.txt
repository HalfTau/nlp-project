Great game and experience. The vast world of GTAV is beautiful and Rockstar raises their own bar via the attention to detail. The online experience can be rather, well, janky at times however, it was nice to finally have a fullfledged, and consistently updated, online GTA world.Now comes the hard part. Those behind this game have taken action against the very community that supports them. By shutting down an expansive modding community and framework, I can no longer support the developer and publisher.Shame on them. Heres to hoping they realize their mistake.
