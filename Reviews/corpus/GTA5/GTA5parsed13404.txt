This used to be one of my favorite games of all time, and one I would play almost daily. Ive easily spent hundreds on both copies of this game for various platforms, and the games ingame pay to win currencyShark Cards. This being said, Ive now uninstalled the game and have no intention of playing it again or giving Rockstar a cent more. Every piece of content theyve added is prohibitevely expensive for anyone not willing to spend literally hundreds on Shark Cards. The online play is riddled with hackers who have gone unchecked, and now have the ability to kick you from the game. Rockstar also insist on randomly draining your ingame finances because their awful anticheating algorithm flags your account declaring your ingame wallet has beenincorrectly altered. In short, this game used to be great, but is no longer worth playing in my opinion.
