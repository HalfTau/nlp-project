Why even have the singleplayer if its not going to be supported and is just ruined? Should have just been honest with the fans that this game was a cash cow and the only thing you care about is making money from the multiplayer, dont buy this game guys unless you want to absolutely grind the multiplayer and not have fun.Either develop on and add to the singleplayer yourselves or allow modders to do that work for you, dont remove the only creative content that singleplayer users were getting and then do nothing yourselves.
