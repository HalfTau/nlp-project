Put a lot of hours in the game. Enjoyed the single player and had some good times on the multiplayer. Mostly by fooling people that paid out hundreds of dollars with nothing but a cheap motorbike...But all that goes down the drain when one attacks modders.Buy something from a company that gives a damn about its player base rather than using them as a personal piggybank.
