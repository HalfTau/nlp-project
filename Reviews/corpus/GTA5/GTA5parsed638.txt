Great game, with lots to do both in singleplayer and online. Plus, a steady stream of new content in online which is rare in new games, and very welcome.However, it really is sad much of this new content in Online is gated behind insane ammounts of ingame money and no way to effectively make that money except paying for it with IRL cash.
