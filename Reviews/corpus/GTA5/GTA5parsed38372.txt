They do not allowing modding anymore. GTA V was special because of its new graphics and implementation with mods. However, with its removal its pretty much every other GTA game. They not only ruined our future GTA experiences, they made anyone with folder configurations for mods have to reinstall the game. Do not buy this GTA, buy the older ones, they are cheaper and allow for mods.
