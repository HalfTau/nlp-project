The story in this game is one to remember. It is full of hours of fun, but once you complete it once the second time feels slow if you try to replay it. And once its complete the world just feels empty. Thats where mods come in, giving the game more life, more to do. BUT ING CORPRATE DS COME IN AND TAKE IT ALL AWAY. This game with mods run through Open IV like LSPDfr made me purchase this game a 2nd time. I had it on the xbox 360 brfore it came out on pc, and mods were the entire reason i repurchased the game on a different platform.I hope rockstar hears the backlash and understands that people want mod support in GTA games. Bethesda has nailed having mods open to the community, mods are why i still play Fallout 4 and Skyrim.If GTA V could have a simlar system to fallout 4 and skyrim remastered... the amount of people who play will skyrocket, as will the reviews. Wake up rockstar and take 2. listen to you consumers. As bethesda, EA and ubisoft have.
