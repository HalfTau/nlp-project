OPEN IV was the major selling point for me buying this game a third time, 2 of them on launch and this one when modding became doable. 2K, please learn to embrace the modding community.EDIT 2K has since backed down on OPEN IV, I recomend the game now. Story Mode and Mods are overall worth the price of entry and is a steal when on sale. Multiplayer is extremely grindy, encourages microtransactions and littered with cheater/ modders but can be great with friends.
