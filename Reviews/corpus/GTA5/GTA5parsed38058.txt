I enjoyed the campaign Ill give you that. But after that there is nothing to do. The only thing else is multiplayer where everyone is somehow allowed to mod BUT NOT the people who try to actually play. Somehow the modders never get banned and instead the people trying to play take the blame for everything. Cockstar has terrable customer support, you cant get any type of information from them and Im pretty sure they only have automated replys. GTAV is just another jewish swindle to rake up some extra quarters. They update the multiplayer only to make them seem like they care about the players but their really just in the business just to be the biggest jew on wall street.
