If this was 2015, I would have recommended GTA V to you on the spot but as is I cannot recommend this game. The base game is fun, singleplayer is a great ride, but like all rides you eventually have to get off and when you get off you are greated with Online. GTA Online is the single most horrible gaming experience Ive ever had. It took me three seconds to be attack by a hacker. When I then blew up the car the hacker was in he promptly survived anyways I was forced to empty my entire bank account to pay for damages. What kind of buisness model is that?! A game about car chases and crime but if we destroy each others cars we have to pay out of pocket. Whats more, TakeTwo has forced Rockstar to cut any extra single player content and instead work on making new stuff for us to spend money on in GTA Online. Oh you can buy a buisness now What does it do? Lets you buy more cars and a helicopter!. Theres no substance to GTA Online and it might as well have just been a matchmaking racing game since thats the only good part about it. This is coming off the heel of TakeTwo pursuing legal action against Open IV and failing to actually target hackers. Its the equivelent of blowing up any old mosque to kill ISIS. I cannot with a good concious recommend this game, wait far from now when they drop it down to 1020 and play the singleplayer.
