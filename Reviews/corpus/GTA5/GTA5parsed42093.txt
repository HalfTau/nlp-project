Average to bad story. Terrible online. Money hungry publisher. Missing features and details from the previous game that came out years earlier.Lazy story design, starting out strong then quickly dissolving into a forgettable mess of bad missions.Rampant cheaters in public online lobbies, though with 500 hours, trainers are also the only way you can have fun in online mode too. If you want to do online missions, hope you love fetch quests or playing the same heists over and over again.Doesnt help that the publisher, Take 2, decided to shut down OpenIV while Rockstar was praising modding at the same time, so Take 2 could think that they were taking care of online trainers, when they were just blowing their foot off. Absolutely brain dead.Im disappointed with myself by buying this game twice Xbox 360 and PC.
