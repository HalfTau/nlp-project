I recieved cheat money several months ago, and my account was rectified the update right after that. I logged on earlier this week and rockstar had taken a further eight million from me. Double diping is unacceptable if youre not going to do anything about the modders and youre not going to provide any customer support. This was legitmate money I can only assume they think Im going to buy a shark card after this. No, im just going to write a  negative review.
