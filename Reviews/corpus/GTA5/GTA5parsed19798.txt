First of all This game is a loading simulator. I really like/ love the game but I dont recommend the game anymore.You need to wait a very long time before the game actually loads online. No, this is not my internet connection since all my friends are dealing with the same issue. When youve finished a heist or mission you can expect loading simulator again.Ive made a list why I dont recommend GTA V at the moment Its loading simulator. They are all about the sharkcards. All the new cars etc are way to pricy to get all the items legit, except if you buy a sharkcard. They do ban you for no reason I has this once and they wont remove your ban, sometimes life just sucks.Maybe you can see it in the hours I played GTA V but I still enjoy the game. I cant give a positive feedback because of the things I wrote above. I do love the gunrunning update, it gives some more content to the game but as I said above, all the new items are freaking expensive.Its crazy that the game is on steam still for 60 so dont you dare buy it for 60. There are a lot of sales so just wait if you want to buy it.
