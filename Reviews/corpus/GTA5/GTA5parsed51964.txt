The reason the modding scene is dead in the water isnt even the fault of Rockstar which is ashame. I hope nobody wastes their hard earned money on this as the modding scene with Open IV was harmless and only affecting single player. Take Two has made a paranoid decisiom purely to try and maximise profit from GTA Online, and I for one wont be returning to this game unless the decision is reversed. Or if Rockstar can help come up with a solution as they have no issue with modding
