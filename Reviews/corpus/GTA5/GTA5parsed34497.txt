I have been a fan of the GTA franchise for a very long time. I thought there was no way it could change, as I have spent countless hours in VC, SA, IV and V messing around with mods. Now modding the game became illegal. Really? Take the best thing about your game and flush it down the toilet? I cant legally play single player with mods, because you claim you lose money on shark cards. I wonder how many people who received money from illegitimate sources are going to buy shark cards now xD. So lets do review of GTA online Cant play any of the new content missions due to imbalanced pvp mechanics. Good luck delivering anything across the map trying to fight against explosive ammo Prices are laughable. Nolife for a couple hours to earn lousy money so you can buy a mid range car. Unless you want to grind all your free time, there is no way you can enjoy all the content. But of course you can buy shark cards. 60 bucks for a couple of cars anyone? The way the servers work makes you wanna punch the wall and eat paint. Either you are stuck for 5 minutes in a loading screen or you get disconnected from the lobby.I know times are changing and the new generation likes to be  in the  so I wont tell you not to play online. But for gods sake, let us just enjoy the single player game, for which I have paid 60 euros twicePS3, PC... Yeah, it wont happen again.For the record, the story mode is fantastic. Too bad nobody will keep playing it without mods...
