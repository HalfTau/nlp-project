This is is a good game to play with friends, if u dont have friends too bad. To get a good car or a house u have to do many missions which takesload of ur time, thats why u do a gta glitch. The servers are litteral takes 3 hours to ing join a lobby. And it randomly just kicks u out of a game when ur playing. For a game with millions of budget money and hasloads of cash, the game should be much much better, with better servers and service. And please take down the ing prices of the ingame cars and not everyone can buy those  sharkcards for only to get a enough to buy a house and a car. And the heists doesnt help either, when u dont have more than 01 extra teamlife and there areteammates andheists Prison Break cough cough... remove it.  But its a good game for people, but please fix the servers, there is a reason for people modding the game when ur money begging has been going on for 3 years withg these dlces.
