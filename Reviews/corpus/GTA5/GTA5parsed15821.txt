Honestly you will end up paying for this game its one of my Favourite games by far the campaign is long but its still cool asf to do loved it even from xbox 360 and PS4 but the graphics on this game will always make this game what it is today, especially the mods on the campaign can be hilarious as  i love it, the multiplayer can be fun if no one kills you, sometimes missions can be good if players have a clue what they are actually doing, races will always be my favourite personally, i always enjoy doing them win or lose i always get money or not.
