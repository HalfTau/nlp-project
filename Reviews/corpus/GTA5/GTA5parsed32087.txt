I have spent hundreds of hours of my life grinding in this game, from console to PC. Ive never felt so betrayed by a gaming company than I do right now. My friends and I spend hours and hours grinding and grinding to get the new content but the GTA economy is so unbalanced and only favors those who have the means to buy the Shark Cards. I didnt buy this game to spend hundreds of dollars on ingame vehicles when those hundreds can go to my real cars monthly payment.
