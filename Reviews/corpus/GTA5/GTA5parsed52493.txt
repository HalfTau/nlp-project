I am purchased this game on PC for one reason, and one reason only.  Modding.  Thanks to TakeTwos actions, I see no other reason to have this game on PC.  Ive purchesd this game at full price 3 times now.   Once on Xbox 360, once on PS4, and once for PC.  I have also given an abusrd amount of money to the micro transactions for the PS4 GTAV Online store.  That stops now.  I will not purchase anything else from TakeTwo until this issue is resolved.   If modding games like GTAV gets thrown behind a paywall...  I will uninstall this game and let it collect dust.   Do yourself a favor and stop giving this company money.   Thats the only way they will ever change.
