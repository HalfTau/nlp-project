Well, This will be my first review ever on steam but I thought Id counter everyones review by giving it a thumbs up.Aside from modding, the game itself is worth playing. The stacking 340 hrs and so on was ALL from online gameplay. Sure hackers are annoying but thats why you switch channles and just ignore them and play your heists and jobs.Would I recommend it? Yes if you dont want to mod the game and like to mainly play online like me.Its honestly what you make of it, if youre going to let just little things drag you down, then you shouldnt buy this game. But if you dont care much for modding in single player and love to play with other people and play the story as it is, then go ahead and buy it.
