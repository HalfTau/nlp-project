Not going to review GTA 5 itself, instead Ill focus on GTA ONLINE experience.Played it a lot and recently Ive seen an influx of toxic players abusing the game as it is. It can be fun untill you end up in a session with griefers killing you just because they have aim assists/mods. Not reccomended until R creates separate sessions for mouse users and pad. Or incorporate similar aim assists for mouse users. Until then it should be avoided.EDITAvoid Online like fire until R decides to actually do something about all the cheaters that are littering the servers. They can easily hack your account, take the money you PAID for thank God I never did effortlessly kick you out of a session in the meantime it takes a LOT of effort to remove ONE griefer from a session in a regular way. At any given time theres around 1600 players that are actively cheating using external menus.Therefore I am asking, is this what I paid for R? Because if it is I want my money back.
