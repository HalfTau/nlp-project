Im not okay too with Take Two removing the mods from the game. And sure, everyone had a right to be upset once that happened, but now that its back people are still downvoting this game for that same reason?Whats more, not only this game got heavily downvoted which I can understand, but the other GTA games too? Whats gotten into you guys?Downvoting a game as a form of protest is quite debatable itself, but downvoting all of the other games as well is straight out stupid no offense intended.With that being said, dont let yourself be fooled this game is quite fun itself. It can give you some good time with both single player and multiplayer this one turns out to be rather funny if youve got friends to play with.Sure, mods had been declared as illegal and that was a dumb move, but now that they made up for it this game definitely deserves a second chance.A well deserved second chance, imo
