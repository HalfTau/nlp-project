I played GTA V for 30 hours and this is my reviewEven if the mods have been removed from the game, I like to play without them. Now, there are not so many modders as they used to be. The modders are funny but we need to know that they are using cheats and its not so legal.I like to play GTA Online with my friends. Its so fun to play online with your friends. You can do a lot of jobs that are pretty cool. I buyed this game only because I can play online with my friends.I recommend GTA V because the graphics are the best from all the games and the game run very well for my computer. I played the Story Mode for few hours but the Online remain the best for me.This is my review and I hope I helped you to decide to buy the game.
