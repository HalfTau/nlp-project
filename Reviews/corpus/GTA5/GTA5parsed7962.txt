Heres my significant and brief review of GTA V and GTA ONSingleplayerAwesome storyline.Interesting characters.Marvelous,astonishing graphics.Simple gameplay mechanics.Plenty of after main story content to keep you entertained for hours.Easy 100 checklist to complete.MultiplayerGTA ONThe game lets you grow a criminal empire with diverse activities and businesses to buy.Easy mechanics,fast paced,efficient for any gta on player. The game advocates a pay to win gameplay,which is made up by implementing the microtransactions feature,called shark cards in game.As money isnt easily gained because it requires much effort and many hours to spend into theorder to progress rapidly through the game and compete with other players,the game basicly forces you to buy shark cards.Most of the time useless things are added into the game,promoting further the pay to win system.Modders and Hackers modify and alter your gaming experience in a negative way,of course.For instance,modders can spawn money drops,they can blow you up in various ways and in no time at all.Hackers can alter your character statisticslevel,money,assets etc.Of course you can contact rockstar support and they may or may not help you.Unfair payouts in all the vast plethora of available job lesuires,businesses etc.Rockstar has nerfed all these ways of making money as to promote their shark cards and push more and more future customes into buying them.Cancerous community of cruel,mean and vicious players,who tend to ruin your gaming experience,much like hackers and modders.To sum up,i of course recommend GTA V singleplayer.As for GTA on,it requires a lot of time to be put into for a person to do all the fun stuff other people do.If you dont have time to do most of the big stuff,then this isnt the game for you.If you have time then aye, I recommend this game  to you.Beware though.Always play in solo public sessions alone or with friends only.Watch a YouTube tutorial.Dont buy everything.Buy only the essentials.Watch some YouTube tutorials also.Then buy the things you really want if you only have the sufficient and excessive money amount.
