Well Take2 got what they deserved. Im not changing my vote unless unrestricted modding is allowed again. I really miss the GTAMP mod which wasnt even published, and yet they took it down because uummm it can make us lose profits of our gaem u need to stap working on it or else jail Great logic Take2. Clap fckin clap. Like youd get billions of GTA5 3 years after the launch anyway. But guess what? You couldve had more income, even 4 years after initial lauch, and spoiler here,. To end this miserable opinion of mine, Take2 are stuck in the 1990s because theyre a bunch of old farts with concrete brains.
