GTA Online is an awkward, clumsy dissapointment. Theres no server browser and finding other players to play heists and other missions with can take ages. Ingame items are extremely over priced, and its entirely unreasonable how much reallife money they charge for shark cards.The original single player game came out over two years ago yet theyre still charging full price. And now, theyre going after modders, like that will do anything to stop the rampant cheating situation.Sad how a few years back I put so many hours into the San Andreas Multiplayer mod, just to see how far short the official GTA Online release came, compared to what modders freely and willingly added to the games.Devs are greedy bstards, who allegedly cut off and stiffed one of their own longtime employees over royalties. Like they didnt have enough to share. Really ironic when you consider the game is all about robbing people. Guess it takes one to know one.FromSam Houser  orchestrated and encouraged a company culture involving strip clubs, personal photography of employees in sexually compromising positions, and other conduct grossly in violation of standard workplace norms.If you played this game on a console already, dont buy it.
