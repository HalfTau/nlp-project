Buy this game only if you love 10 min loading screens everytime you try to go into GTA Online. Seriously this game is pretty substandard for a AAA title game. If this game was a 10 game I would have closed an eye though. Until Rockstar decides to re price this game at 10 or fix their , dont bother getting this game. Even so, Ive seen better 10 games out there.
