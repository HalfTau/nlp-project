Horrendous multiplayer with insane load times, extremely bad matchmaking and microtransactions.Extremely anticonsumer publisher, who sues mod creators because it draws people away from the their own terrible multiplayer implementation and micro transactions.Its a shame, because the singleplayer is great.
