One of the best games I have ever played. I dont mod this particular game because I dont need to, so I could care less about OpenIV, not my problem.When you beat the game and have almost two billion dollars in the bank theres nothing you cant buy.If you want more then play online, that is if you can find a lobby without hackers in it /Cheers
