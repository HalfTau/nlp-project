Single player mods are critical to my enjoyment of this game that I own. The multiplayer effectively requires shark cards to play with new content, which is also frustrating. But when my single player game mods are denied, which have no hacking or cheating beyond that which is needed to enjoy some of the new free content released to the multiplayer, it reminds me of the extreme disconnect between gaming executives and gamers. Modding is the life required to maintain a game at the scale that GTA V is.Please reconsider your cease and desist to Open IV.
