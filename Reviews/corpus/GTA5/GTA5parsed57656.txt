I Bought this game 3 times, the most recent time being for PC. The main reason I bought it agsin forPC was because I wanted to have fun goofing off with mods, now that I can no longer do this because of the greedy people at TakeTwo so I no longer have any use for this game and woulnt recommend it to anyone...
