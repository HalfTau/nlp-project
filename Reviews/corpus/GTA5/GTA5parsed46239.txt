RockStar games and Take Two Interactive just sent a Cease and Desist order to the creators of OpenIV, a piece of software that is the backbone to nearly every GTA mod there is to find, all in an effort, as the theory goes to push people toward GTA Online and the endlessstorm of MTX hat lie therein.There is no world where this sort of t should be allowed to fly. I will not purchase another title associated with RockStar or Take Two interactive unless they undo the damage to the community that has supported you for years upon years even in spite of the way you treat them..I wont ever be changing this review either.. the very idea that it was okay for you to do this has earned you a negative review forever.
