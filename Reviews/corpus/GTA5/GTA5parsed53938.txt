OpenIV and the modding community on PC is the only reason why I bought the game on PC again after already buying it on PS4. I wanted to hold out on buying GTA V until it was coming out on PC. I felt that GTA V was still worth buying again on PC FOR THE MODS. Take Twos actions against OpenIV ruined literally everything that made GTA on PC special. The only reason I bought it on console to begin with was to give the game itself a shot when at first they wouldnt say if GTA V was going to release on PC at all. When it did release on PC I transferred my PS4 online stuff to the PC version. Now without modding support I dont see a reason to continue playing this game for the vanilla content. Ive never finished the vanilla content in a GTA game anyway.
