I have always liked Grand Theft Auto especially San Andreas. I always seem to have fun playing This game for multiple reasons it doesnt matter if Im just beating a random person on the side of the road or actually playing the missions although I personally like this game Im not saying its the best or that its worth 60 ing dollars  the campaign is fun and so is the multiplayer if your not playing with randoms its quite hard to do the things you need to do in order to level up on multiplayer when your just a level 16 and the guy who has taken a liking to smearing your face along the sidewalk is a level 136, play with friends or dont play at all.
