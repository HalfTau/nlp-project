Not recommended due to Online content. Hacking/modding is present constantly but there is nothing being done about it. Theres not even a rudimentary anticheat system, it seems. But to read other reviews, it seems all the wrong people are banned in the feeble attempts to stop it.Additionally, joining a mission/job has about a 80 chance of making you need to quit and restart the game. Ill boot it up, get an invite to join a heist, then get told that the heist is full and asked if I want to join the queue to enter. No matter what I select, Ill get stuck in a top down view of the world and no matter how long I wait it will never return to my character.The single player experience is really good not a lot of replayability, however.
