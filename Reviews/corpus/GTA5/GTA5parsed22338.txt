I would recommend this game, until the whole openIV thing, they dont like people modding singleplayer anymore, which are where most of my hours clock in.If modding singleplayer gets your social club banned meaning you cant play singleplayer or multiplayer, its not worth any money you could pay for it.Edit Okay, you took it back, you can use mods, but you still attempted to take away mods which made most pc sales, and due to the current state of online being grind like its your job to buy anything unless you pay real money for digital money, of course, Im keeping the review as it stands.
