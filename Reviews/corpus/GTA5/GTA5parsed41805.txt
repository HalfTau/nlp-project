TLDR Fix yourTake Two/Rockstar. Support mods and fix your in game currency!Gotta say, love the game. But as with most of the other negative reviews currently going up, I cannot support something that is pushing microtransactions in a FULL PRICED GAME. Banning the modding which is only supported in single player is not the right way to stop hackers in online gameplay. How about you fix the economy in online Take Two/Rockstar to support and reward gameplay and not have players needing to sink 100s of hours just to buy 1 of the latest cars or thow 20 more at a title that you have already PAID FOR to get a minor amount of in game cash. 1,000,000 doesnt mean anything in this game where a set of pants costs 20K.
