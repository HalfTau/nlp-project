So, this is more a review on the Developers and the Publishers than the actual game.Rockstar is the developer and TakeTwo is the publisher. TakeTwo attacked the modding community, something I, and many others, simply will NOT stand for. Thankfully, Rockstar was able to smack some sense into TakeTwo and theyre no longer actively attacking the modding community.I leave a positive review to say thank you to Rockstar. I realize it was very likely a reaction to the overwhelmingly negative reviews and reactions from every sensible person who plays videogames. But, I still appreciate them getting TakeTwo to back the hell down, lets home TakeTwo gets the message. You  with our family, well spam yours with negative reviews.Now, this doesnt mean Im happy with TakeTwo, I agree with the majority of people, regardless of whether theyre apologizing now, they still shot first. But, I acknowledge that they arent actively attacking mods anymore.
