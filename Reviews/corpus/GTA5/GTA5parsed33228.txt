i love  the grand theft auto series been a fan for a very long time but i have to give the a negative review because of the openIV problem. one of the biggest reason i bought gta iv and 5 on pc was to play mods i cant play on console  and now these false accustations on the modding community has caused  take two not rockstar to threaten to sue the openIV team because of malicious modding but if they actually  took the time to look all the hackers in gta Online are NOT using openIV to hack the game there using other software and exploits to hack and manipulate the online you cant even connect to online with open iv enabled. so unitl they fix this major problem  i cannot thumbs up this game. if they do fix there mistake  i wall gladly change my review.EDIT like i said if take two and R  fixed this i would once agian thumbs up this game but even though they may have fixed it i believe they still have damaged the Reputation and need to tread lighty from now on
