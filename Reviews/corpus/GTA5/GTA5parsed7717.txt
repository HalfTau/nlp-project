When first heard about this game, I was really excited.All the videos and images I keep seeing how you can become a CEO and run your own company, collect and customize awesome vehicles, live in a mansion where you can call home and best of all do bank robbery heists and make tons of money. Lots of action and adventure? it seemed like a dream come true.But when I finally had the 60 and bought it, I realized I was wrong.Ive played a lot of horrible games in my life, but this REALLY takes the cake.If youre looking forward to becoming a rich man in los santos, FORGET IT!! !Before you can even get to the fun stuff the game provides, prepare yourself for a crapload of grinding, busy work and getting trolled by other players.Not to mention the fact Rockstar doesnt give a ounce ofif you get banned and lose all your money for NO aparent reason!Do yourself a favor and DONT BUY THIS GAME! EVER!!!!!!!! !Trust me. You wont regret it
