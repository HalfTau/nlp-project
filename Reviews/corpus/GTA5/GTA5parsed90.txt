Online mode is extremely unfriendly to new players.Even without the worlds most toxic gaming community, no one does the basic jobs anymore.Youre basically stuck trying to find bare minimum jobs you can do as a newbie because youll be instakicked from any heist you join.Other than that, the opening loading screen is ridiculous. I just waited 7 ing minutes on it.
