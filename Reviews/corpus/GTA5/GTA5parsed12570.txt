Pros No issue with gameplay Small rendering problem here and there but its my HDD Missions/Heists really fun Story mode Yet to be finishedCon GTA Online Modders/God mode needs to be taken care of especially when doing missions theyre not dying literally I shoot a guy bullet in the head doesnt die but his friend who doesnt have god mode on dies.Personally, I didnt know how I would survive GTA Online luckily I meet friendly people and they invite me to their organization to do missions and such be friends with them and play all night long.
