Rockstar is the stupidest game company, dare I say even more stupid than EA, for discontinuing OpenIV, a modding platform. So sad, the only reason I waited for GTA 5 on PC was to play it with mods, now its just plain old GTA 5 that weve all seen and played 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times.
