GTA V is still a pretty solid game in 2017.The single player story aspect is solid and if you ever get tired of that theres still the online part of the game. It is not perfect and can get annoying at times, either due to s or rockstars servers but its good enough to have fun with your mates andaround Los Santos.If youll buy GTA V for the online aspect alone I do not recommend you to do so, but if you want to replay the single player aspect and get heaps of fun running amok with Trevor then I highly recommend it. Treat the online aspect of the game as bonus content and youll not be dissappointed.
