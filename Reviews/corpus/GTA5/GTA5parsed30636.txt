Very good game. Gameplay and the graphics are amazing. Lots of content too.Recent nonrecommendedreviews are mostly because of the mods for GTA V got banned. I understand the anger, but Ive put 350h to this game in singleplayer and online without any mods. Say what you say, but in that matter, the recent nonrecommended reviews are misleading. Many put hundreds of hours to this game even without mods, and suddenly they wouldnt recommend the game because no more mods. I still would easily recommend it.
