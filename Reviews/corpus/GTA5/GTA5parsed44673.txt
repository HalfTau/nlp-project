Take 2 and Rockstar have been cracking down on the single player mod community to try and drive people to play online where they want you to buy in game currency with real money. This decision to go after modders to try drive shark card sales is abhorrent, I am now adding take 2 and rockstar to my boycott list right alongside ubisoft and ea. Well some boys, youve made sure you wont get a single penny more from me because of your petty/greedy behaviour.
