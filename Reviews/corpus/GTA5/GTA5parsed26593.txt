Had a lot of fun when I got round to buying GTA for pc cause it opened up a world of loads of fun mods Ive always played it on console and logged many hours on there. But anyway they recently shut down openIV and all the mods that came with it and its became just as blan and repetitive as the console versions. I can no longer play as a chicken which really made me giggle. They hype up online but its garbage full of cheaters and all they do is constantly kill you and if you keep getting killed that makes you more likely to get killed more cause it says youre mental or something, sure they added all these new race courses and games but open world online everyones aim is to make you angry as possible I cant play this game for more than an hour. Rip open iv. Wouldnt recommend not now.
