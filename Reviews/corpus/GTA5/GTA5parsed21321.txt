This game was good for the first 2,5 years it was out, played the campaign 3 times on Xbox on 2 times on PC,  it really was before its time with all the stuff you could do in it and such. Ive hundreds of hours on both platforms but as the years went by the game went from an actual fun game to just adding sharkcards and multimillion dollar supercar DLCs, now it has gone down the  with all that it ever was. Im not gonna say anything about the whole Take Two modding thing becuase I dont think that is relevant if youre are not modding it. The game is just now based on luxury, 4 million dollar supercars, owning a big organizations, and buying shark cards. It has left behind the GTA feeling that it started out with. GTA now is about living the rich life with bikes that can fly and expensive yachts. The feeling from GTA SA, Vice City, GTA 4 etc is now gone. This just dont feel like GTA anymore with all these new dlcs containing the exact same stuff over and over again. They need to move on from this game and go forward, now they are just milking money from it. Adding expenisive stuff or flying bikes is not gonna rescue or make this game better by any chance. Just move the  on.Writing this on christmas 2k17 atm, theres a new free car wich can be collected for FREE. But when people try to get the FREE car rockstar charges them 525k.
