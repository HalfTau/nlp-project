This is one of my favorite games of all time! The story mode is fantastic and gives you tons to do even after you beat it. But the online is what im not too happy about. First of all, Im no longer able to transfer my character from Xbox One.. and 2nd, the online went from an awesome experience having gun fights in the streets and causing chaos to overpriced vehicles, flying bikes shooting rockets at you and being overpowered by vehicles that are way too OP. If your interested in the story mode, then this is a 10/10 for sure! I still like the online, but if you have no friends to play it with then your most likley gonna get bored real quick!
