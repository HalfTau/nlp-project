While I do enjoy the online aspects of the game, and never really cared for the Singleplayer or mods, what Rockstar has done has basically destoyed anyones rights to enjoy free content.I cannot recommend a game that hason the modding community and the creative people of the internet.Rockstar, it was fun while it lasted, but this move as sealed your fate.EDIT AS OF JULY 11It seems that Rockstar is returning mods, but their idea in the first place that that was a good wont change my review.  them.
