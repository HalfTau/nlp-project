I cant even get thisto launch. ing Rockstar doesnt support people who play on PC in the slightest. I submitted a ticket and, instead of maybe telling me why the issue was happening to me and a bunch of other people on forums, they told me to CHECK IF I HAD AN INTERNET CONNECTION FIRST. I WAS CLEARLY SUBMITTING THE TICKET, THEREFORE I HAD INTERNET. Needless to say, this is absolutely ridiculous and frankly Im sick of it.
