Well, the game is back  to being normal after the hate bomb occurred. The Online is still crappy and P2W, but there is some fun to be taken out of it.If you get this game Id say only stick to the singeplayer, more fun to be had with less being spawn camped by a flying motorcycle that can shoot rockets, yknow?
