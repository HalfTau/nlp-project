GTA Online... TakeTwo Interactive and Rockstar Games continue to weaponize free content updates by doubling down on an awful, unrewarding grindfest design that heavily emphasizes toxicity in its PvP to increase the time and effort it takes to reach any goal in the multiplayers limited scope so that you give up and spend real world money on shark cards. Beware the hackers as well. Theyre just as prevalent as they were before the supposed crack down.
