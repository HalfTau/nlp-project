They killed modding. Possibly the major reason to buy it on this platform, they have taken that away. Single Player has been completley abandoned from launch, there has been no DLC and they have now taken away the only support this game has ever had  community support. All in the hope that you will spend a fortune on online microtransactions instead.At one point this game might have been worth owning. Not anymore.
