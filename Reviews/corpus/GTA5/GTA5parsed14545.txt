It is a fantastic open world game to be honest, I guess there are no strangers to the Grand Theft Auto series, most of gamers ara aware of this. Storywise it keeps you entertained as you have 3 main characters to play on while the story develops, so thats a new thing added to the series, def good. I never had problems with this game except for the last couple of months where I started having a huge delay on ingame texture loading, besides that all good, would totally recommend this game.
