Updated post June 24 2017Great to see that Rockstar Games brought OpenIV back to life in cooperation with OpenIV developers, you guys rock. Taketwo is still a lame publisher for doing this to its pcfanbase, it was unnecessary and not desired.Original Post June 17 2017GTAV was a great game before they banned OpenIV a modding tool. Bring back the mods! I want to be able to play LCPDFR now and in future! The life cycle of the future pc gtagames is also in danger if this stays banned.
