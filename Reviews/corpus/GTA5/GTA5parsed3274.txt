What can I say? The game was definitely worth the wait. In terms of performance the game looks absolutely incredible at max settings and five hours in I have yet to experience any kind of glitches or crashes.This is a refreshing PC release in that there are no major glaring issues right out of the gate at launch. Rockstsar definitely took the extra time to polish this game nicely as it has completely blown me away.Finally a preorder I didnt regret.
