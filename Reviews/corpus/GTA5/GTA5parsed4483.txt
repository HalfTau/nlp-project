Since Im a huge GTA fan since 1999, I cant believe how deep is this game!Its way much more than anyone expected!We all would love to have much more in GTA 6, such as the capability of traveling from a city to another using planes, trains, vehicles...etc!Not to mention everyones dream to have all the cities combined in a really massive world..I guess that would break any record!Imagine if vice city, Las ventura, San fierro, San andreas, Los Santos, liberty city...etc, are all combined together in one game!Anyways Rockstar Games nailed it again!
