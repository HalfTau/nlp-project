I owned this on Xbox 360 Originaly, friend bought it on Steam for me to play it with them, and sadly, its not worth it.Multiplayer is rampent with hackers/modder/cheaters. You cant really do most of the content in the game thats free roam multiplayer CEO, MC Work without a modder blowing up your supply or messing with you to the point of where you cant even do anything. It makes multiplayer a chore to play, and makes the biggest money making things in the game hard to do.Single player is worth at least one playthrough, but until they start cracking down on the cheaters that ruin the online expereince, try and stay away from it.
