Started off promising, but has quickly devolved into a BUY OUR MAKESHIFT FREEMIUM CURRENCY TO GET THE COOLTHAT YOU CANT EVEN GET ON SINGLEPLAYER.Thats not Grand Theft Auto, its daylight robbery.Also note this game usually increases in price before going on sale so they dont lose much profit. And dont even get me started on ing over modding support.In conclusion, play Saints Row instead, at least that lets you be a complete sock and doesnt send you a CD for it.
