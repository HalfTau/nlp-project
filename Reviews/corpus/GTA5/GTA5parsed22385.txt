The overwhelming number of negative votes is due to the OpenIV fiasco, which is null and void because OpenIV is BACK.If you have yet to experience GTA V, do yourself a favor and get it. Save for GTA San Andreas which brought tons of character customization and GTA Vice City which brought 80s style and glam, this is quite possibly one of the best GTA games yet in terms of scope, visuals, and gameplay.
