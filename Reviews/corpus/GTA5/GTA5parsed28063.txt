Love this game but there have been no more Heists added which I would say is one of the most asked for things and even though I dont use any mods I fully encourage game devs to allow the modding of their games. This almost always results in the game being better overall due to the variety of options available to them that mods allow, and can also result in those mods being added to the core game, and the mods developer being paid for or even joining the dev team. So due to the fact that Open IV is now banned resulting in pretty much no more mods Ive gotta say NO!!!!!!! Do not buy this game and do not give in to the money grabbing scumbags who dont care about their players, and only care about making as much money out of an amazing game before they burn it to the ground.
