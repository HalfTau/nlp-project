My Friend and I have had a conversation, we were talking about many topics. One of these topics was the creator, about calling us freelowders if we havnt goten Shark Cards. Yes, this hit me in the bad way because I dont have money and really hated that fact. Now, I wont buy one while I have the money. The second topic was the money. I know this will happen again becuase rockstar wants us to pay money to just have the in game money taken away later, just to repeat the process. The way they did it was unfair, knocking everyone down to 200k, I had 6 mil saved up from last year, yet all of that is gone. The third topic was the prices in game. It is no dought that some of the prices has been raised to massive proportions. It is hard to get some of the thinggs you want now. The final topic was how this would effect the funds of GTA VI if it comes out. We have estimated that most people including myself, wont get it. Yet some of those people wont have the money, some who do will remember what happended, please rockstar, GO BACK TO WHERE IT WAS!
