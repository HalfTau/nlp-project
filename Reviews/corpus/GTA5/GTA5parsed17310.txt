Honestly, Im a single player gamer. I have no interest in GTA Online. Now the story mode was fantastic, but Rockstars refusal to create anything new for the single player community, or even port cars or anything from the online mode is unnacceptable. Its certainly not worth 60 dollars anymore for single player gamers.
