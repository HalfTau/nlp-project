Now that I can once again play  the LCPDFR mod again I would like to be one of the first postive reviews after this whole mod fiasco.Just to keep it short, this is a fantastic game that should not be missed. Rock solid singleplayer and multiplayer modes provide loads of fun. The mods make it a sea of endless possibilites. Thank you Rockstar for listening and reacting to your community. Cant wait to see what else is instore for the future of this series.
