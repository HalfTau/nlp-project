How to cut branch you sit on ?No Man Sky,  Assassin Grind, Call of Duty yearly releases.This companies are hated for their actions toward gamers.Now Rockstar is censoring mods ?People wont play multiplayer and buy your stuff just cose you blocked mods for them.You can be 100 sure people will hate you , and wont buy next release.Many other games out there. GTA V is fun , but srsly. Not irreplaceable.EditMods will return. So i will change vote.
