This is the official resource to Rockstar Games. If you want to close Open IV then find a suitable replacement. Official GTA V mod manager would be fine. You can also made a normal zombie mod for GTA V singleplayer  that would be also fine. But at this moment you are indifferent about singleplayer and focused on online   but inline missions are not very interesting either.
