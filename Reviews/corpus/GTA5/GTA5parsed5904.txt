I really wish I could rate GTA 5 twice  once for single player and again for multiplayer.The single player game is amazing, its so well done with great characters, story and voice acting. The music in this game is just fantastic too, with a few songs Id never before that are now some of my favorites. The gameplay was smooth on a midrange system, always entertaining and hilarious at times and I dont recall any real bugs or issues that I came across this is playing within the last year. As a single player game, I highly recommend GTA 5.Multiplayer on the other hand, is absolute trash. Id read about what Id be getting into so there were no real surprises but what Rockstar has done with GTA Online is just shameful. Hackers/modders are rampant and will wreck your gameplay. I started GTA Online a couple weeks ago and just cant do it anymore, its so frustrating and the player base modders and cheaters is just trash. Its not only me who is frustrated by it, Ive seen so many people rage quit out of GTA Online after getting targeted and harassed by modders.Why Rockstar doesnt hammer the modders and cheaters is beyond me. They just dont seem to care that the rest of their players are affected by it. I guess as long as the boatloads of Shark Card money keeps coming in, who cares right? Absolutely disgusting.TLDRGTA 5 single player  9.5/10GTA Online  2/10
