Overburdened by microtransactions and abysmal levels of grinding, the Online portion of the game is also plagued by hackers, a completely wonky anticheat system and no attempt to put the players fun first.The singleplayer experience was decent, but was much enhanced by mods. TakeTwos decision to ban mods is likely because they know their own incompetence at dealing with hackers in the Online game and this wont fix that or because they plan on doing something ala Bethesdas Creation Club and so they wanted to bully the competition out of the way. em.
