I like playing the game with friends, very enjoyable to play, not if youre a new player however in GTA Online. You are put into a lobby of people that have rank 100 with millions of dollars and every vehicle and weapon in the game, these players have the intent in bullying low ranked players and destroy their experience, modders are plenty.However I woukd recommend this game if playing with friends, missions are fun and so are the heists both doomsday and regular.Solid 7.5/10
