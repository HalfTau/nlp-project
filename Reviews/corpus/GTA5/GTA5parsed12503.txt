I am sick of all those hackers/cheaters!!! Wtf is wrong with u Rockstar? Do something! I will never buy an online Rockstar game again as long as those nonplayer cheating idiots keep ruining my game!And apart from that let me start like this  u  u and  u ing nonrockstar. I cannot play my friends online. It just keeps saying left, left, left...I and my friends have tried every ing possible solution Dmz mode, port forwarding, static ip, MTU value change and dozens of ing ridicilous things which I dont remember and wala !!! Same result !!!!! I will never ever never ever gonna buy a ing star game again! Stay away from this  star who dont give aabout their customer problems guys ! I mean it. Really...PUBG full of cheaters, GTA 5 full of cheaters, almost all online games are full of cheaters... I am really, definitely, absolutely sick of this. I will never ever gonna give a penny to an online game again. The thing is the devs dont give a  about it. Hey devs, continue like this and you will end up having games full of cheaters who even dont buy your game they get it also by cheating because all they know is cheating. They even got into this world as a result of their fathers cheating on their mothers. So their whole world is cheating. From now on I will stick to the single player games. I think if every legit player who wants a legit competition does the same thing the devs will have no choice but to start a merciless fight against cheating and cheaters.
