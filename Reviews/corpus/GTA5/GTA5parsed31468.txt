Banning mods for single player mode to try and force people into the cash cow known as GTAO is a stunningly stupid piece of marketing from Take Two and has had zero effect on the modders in GTAO, if anything theyve come out in force more since the ban was announced. Everytime since the announcement theres been at least 34 modders per lobby screwing with everyone and its only going to get worse as the actual player gets smaller and smaller meaning less money for those greedy s at Take Two.For the sake of it being a review of the game Ill list a few pros and consI cannot recommend this game to anyone given the near full whack price youll have to pay for a short, but sweet, story and a massive cash grab attempt at multiplayer which is full of hackers, modders and beggers
