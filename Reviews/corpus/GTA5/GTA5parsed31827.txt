Single player campaign is not as good and artistic as almost every other GTA game especially IV was great.Car handling is worse than in Need For Speed.Guns are badly balanced, some are just extremely overpowered which makes it stupid to buy other weapons.Grand Theft Auto Online is just money fishing through Shark Cards with a stupid community. It isnt possible to do any CEO missions while you are alone in a session which makes them impossible to do them in your own way because there is always someone let it be a psychopath or a modder, or just both who ruins the experience. Theres no mission worth the frustration because they are all dull.Take Two made it very hard to install mods some are even illegal by shutting down OpenIV. I understand modding in GTA Online is not cool when you are trying to sell overpriced Shark Cards but come on, now the extremely dull Singleplayer mode becomes even dumber.
