Dear Zelnick,You are a moron.We are convinced that we are probably from an industry view undermonetizing on a peruser basis.I bought GTA V on Xbox 360 and on Xbox One. I bought it once more on PC for the mods. You have an extra 60 because of me. I have never spent or will spend a single dollar on microtransactions in any form. To say that you are undermonetizing me is offensive and incorrect.Get ed.
