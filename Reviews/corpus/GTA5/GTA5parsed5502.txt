If you are buying this for the singleplayer dont bother, mods get  after every update, and those thousands of updates are multiplayer only, noone of the stuff of the multiplayer gets added to the singleplayer, and you cant even play offline, if you want to play the cashgrab that is online go ahead and buy this mess, if you are looking for the singleplayer just get thewink, winkShame of take two, when the pirated version has better singleplayer than the full price version you know something is wrong.
