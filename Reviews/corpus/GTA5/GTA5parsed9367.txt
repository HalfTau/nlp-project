One of the best games ever created.First off. The singleplayer is an amazing dynamic world with good characters and history. Definetly worth a play.Most people probably get this game because of GTA Online, and it is very fun aswell, only problem i have with it is overything is so overpriced, itll take endless hours of grinding to buy a car, this forces you to buy a sharkcard .Apart from the prices on ingame content the game is fun and has loads of customization and content that can keep you and your friends entertained for many hours!Defo a must have in your steam library!
