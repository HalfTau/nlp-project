As much as I want to, I cant recommend Grand Theft Auto V.The online has a ton of problems. there are many game breaking bugs, and there are enough to the point where I came here to complain about itIm okay with grinding because I enjoy playing the missions online, but there are two problems with that1 playing with random people is not fun. theyre either very new which is totally fine, or they dont care enough to invite you back to the heist you helped them with all the way through.2 you have to grind for quite a long time, which i will get to in a second grinding for stuff can be fun, but rockstar makes it really hard to enjoy it there is lots of content, but the npcs who are associated with them, such as the bunker or hangar, call you every time you get in a server, telling you that you should buy one. Id love to, but I CANT do that because I dont have 2 million to spend on this stuff. the loading times are pretty bad. I spend more time on loading screens than playing missions, and its not because of my hardware.Yes the game is good, but just leaving a heads up for the current state of the multiplayer
