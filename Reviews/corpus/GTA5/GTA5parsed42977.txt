I dont even play with mods, but shutting down Open IV mods and claiming it was to stop online hacking is completely ridiculous and untrue as they dont even let you go online if you have them on. Take Twos poor treatment of its PC players and its pennypinching for shark cards is going to turn a great deal of people against Red Dead 2 and Grand Theft Auto VI in the future.I love this game and have invested hundreds of hours into it but I cant in good conscience leave a positive review if theyre going to treat people who support the game like this. Dont buy the game at full price or pay for a single shark card.
