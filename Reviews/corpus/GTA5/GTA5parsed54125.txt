The only reason why I purchased this game was to mod my game to play LSPDFR. Shutting down OpenIV was the wrong move. I do not even play, or will never play GTA Online. I should be able to modify my single player game like so many other games out there without effecting online play. I would not recommend purchasing this game until OpenIV is allowed again.
