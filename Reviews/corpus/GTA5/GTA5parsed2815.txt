GTA Online is awful.  You get constant phone calls of ingame spam reminding you of the content you simply cant afford. Im sorry but after a few hours of grinding and experimentation you are looking at between 58 hours of grinding for 1 million depending on equipmentTo get to the content the game CONSTANTLY reminds you of, you need about 2 million. It reminds me of a mobile game with the incessant reminders of microtransactions. While the game doesnt tell you to buy shark cards but it does a bloody good job of reminding you how poor you are and how many millions you need to get to what I hope are the fun parts.IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING CLOSE TO AN ADDICTIVE PERSONALITY DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. FRANKLY, A MOBILE GAME IS LESS OF A CASH VAMPIRE AND PROBABLY OFFERS MORE FUN.
