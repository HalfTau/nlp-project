Easily one of the greatest video games made. The characters and the writing totally hit the spot, the characters are so so memorable and distinguishable. The writers have built such immensely good story telling and characters that it is quite honestly mind blowing. Trevor is such a well written anti hero but you love him from day one.The online is a bit janky but fairly ok when you get used to it. Races playlist are fantastic, love them.This game is a must buy on sale, dont buy shark cards. You dont need money to have fun.11/10
