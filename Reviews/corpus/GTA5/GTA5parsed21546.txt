This game was great at times, but it has gone to When you PvP people complain about you, when you die people laugh at you, when you try to have fun a modder kills you Rockstar hasnt doneto remedy this. The most recent update gets rid of support for a common modding tool, but this doesnt get rid of modders and cheats. They also added a flying motorcycle with rockets on it that nearly costs you GTA6 million to get and have the rockets. Once the people get it there isnt a damn thing you can do to properly combat it, and nearly everyone has it except the legitimate players. So now instead of just being greifed from the extremely common modder, you also have to dodge flying fuc k ing motorcycles.I dont know what Im going to do. This last update was the last straw. I just want to have fun with my friends, Rockstar.
