Deciding to drop my own opinion of this game in the wake of taketwo taking down OpenIV. As a disclaimer, Ive never actually tried any mods. The gameplay is solid, the singleplayer is solid and has a strong story and characters.Screwing around with friends is so fun, but... the grind is some of the worse of any game aside from some MMOs. Every dlc releases more and more powerful vehicles and weaponry, basicely the definition of power creep. Everything costs so much money, finding ways to make money while avoiding griefers and hackers is frustration incarnate. Even new clothing from the DLCs are exceedingly expensive. It tarnishes what would otherwise be an amazing online experience. Public lobbies are chaos and toxicity. All in the name of shark cards.But wait, you just want the singleplayer? Thats great but there has yet, and likely never will be, any expansion of singleplayer content. Even new vehicles and weapons dont carry over to singleplayer. And with the death of mods, it brings the game lower.All and all, its a solid base thats ruined by greed. If you have friends to play with, it might still be worth playing. But anyone just starting is going to have an uphill battle to get anywhere without, guess what, dropping money on shark cards. Do I regret the time sunk into the game? No, not really. But I do reget the money Ive dropped on buying the game on two platforms and on shark cards.
