A phenomenal game in both the single player campaign and the multiplayer mode. Though Rockstar still hasnt topped story or the customisability offered in GTA San Andreas this game does prove to come extremely close and in some regard push the boundaries.This game is a great step in the right direction. The only things I dont like are the online multiplayer loading times and size of the game once installed is a problem unless you either delete some stuff or buy a new hard drive to accommodate GTA.Otherwise a dope game. 9.5/10
