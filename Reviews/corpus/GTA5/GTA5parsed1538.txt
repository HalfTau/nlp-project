Singleplayer is fine. GTA Online is terrible. Everything is absurdly expensive considering how much you get paid from jobs and heists. Rockstar wont stop telling you to buy shark cards, and worthless vehicles and properties. Ingame characters literally wont stop calling you about it until youve bought all of those things. Oh, you finally bought a insert property and realized that its completely useless? Well, too bad cause you cant sell it.There are hackers everywhere. Some of them are actually nice, but most of them are s. Rockstar doesnt really seem to care anyway.Internet connection errors are very common, and no one seems to know why. Infinite loading screens also occur more often than not while joining and leaving jobs.The only way to enjoy GTA Online is to haveof money, and if you want a lot of money then youll probably end up paying for it or give up and stop playing GTAO.Dont buy shark cards. They dont deserve your money. Theyre already greedy as hell.
