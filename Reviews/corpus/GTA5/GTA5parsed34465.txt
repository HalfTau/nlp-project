never before have I regretted a purchase. I got this to play GTA online with my friends who all moved to PC because why not? GTA online has become such a ing mess of cheaters, toxic players, the completely ing absurd power creep that Rockstar pushes with each and every update, and horrendously  outreach from Rockstar. and with the recent news about Open IV I cant even recommend this game anymore.
