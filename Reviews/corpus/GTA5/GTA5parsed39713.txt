Edit Take two have since allowed open iv to continue therefore my point about them killing it is no longer vailid, the multiplayer is still cancerous and should be avoidedEdit 2 while the multiplayer is till cancer and shoud be avoided it is fun with friends, especially when doing heists but to get to that point takes alot of time or you have to payThe singleplayer is brilliant, and it was even better with mods till take 2 interactive killed open ivMultiplayer is cancerous and is the reason why they sent the cease and dissist to open iv as it was aparentley allowed people to hack in money, therefore taking money away from take two. Open iv never touched the online and woulent even allow you to connect online while it was instalked therefore making their claim basically invalid. Avoid this game and any game that take two owns till take two gets theirtogether and allows modding again.
