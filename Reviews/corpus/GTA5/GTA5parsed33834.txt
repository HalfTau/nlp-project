Too much focus on overpriced multiplayer addons that just result in you and your friends getting blown up by some 7 year old with his mums credit card, or some scriptkiddie that thinks crashing everyones game will make their peepees grow.The subsequent minutes long loading times are also a massive pain in the proverbial but GTAOnline could have been an amazing idea  if only Take 2/Rockstar let us hold our own private sessions, so then we didnt have to deal with the rampent hacking.Also, removing the main modding tool for your game  via a DMCA, no less!! is just PR suicide and Im glad its showing in the ratings  maybe then blinded companies will see what happens if you attack a fanbase that has supported your games for over 10 years will bring to their game!
