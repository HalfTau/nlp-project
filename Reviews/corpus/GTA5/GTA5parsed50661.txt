GTA V has a fun and immersive Singleplayer thats long, funny, big, has some thoughtful messages, and is 100 worth it, but Multiplayer? Absolutely not. GTA V Online is probably some of the most boring online ive ever played after the first couple days. On top of that Rockstar has really milked this online, But how? All the DLC is free and you can earn money. And youre right it is free and you can earn the money, however this takes days upon weeks to get a ton of cars, nice apartments, etc. Its simply not fun after a couple times of logging in. But Jeremy, you have 340 hours? I do, because messing around with friends can make the game pretty fun, but when thats the only way to make a online game fun, even that will get boring after a bit.To add icing on top of the cake, Taketwo will most likely remove modding as a whole with a cease and desist. This is a big  you to all the people who love the modding community on GTA V Online and rp. you Taketwo,  you Rockstar, I dont want to buy your overpriced shark cards.
