I would love to recommend this game to everyone I know. Its really that great.. however, recently, players have been getting banned from joining MCs  Orgs because of a mod menu which allows unscrupulous users to spawn cargo beneath a player, causing them to destroy it. The destruction results in a 30min ban, and during this timeframe, you cannot start the new heist, sell bunker cargo, steal/sell vehicles, etc.Rockstar had their chance to ban OpenIV users, but they backtracked after all the negative reviews.I refuse to play in public lobbies without forcibly removing all other users at this point, and for anyone else tired of dealing with this issue, heres how you do it press ctrlshiftesc to open Task Manager click the Performance tab at the bottom, theres a link to Open Resource Monitor in the Resource Monitor, locate GTA5.exe rightclick GTA5.exe, and select Suspend Process wait approx. 9 seconds during this time, the CPU graph should show a decline after 9 seconds, rightclick GTA5.exe again this time, select Resume Process tab back into GTA, and everyone in your public lobby should quitIf youre not alone in a public lobby, attempt to suspend/resume the process again.
