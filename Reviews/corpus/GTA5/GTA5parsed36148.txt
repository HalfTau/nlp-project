This game is awful.  Its run by money grabbers, The Online content is a grind of the same rewrapped and reheated coupled with problems and issues by modders and hackers.  The ingame content is hugely over priced 2000 for a TShirt and the stunt tracks and races are nothing short of programming that counldnt see past Sonic the Hedgehog.
