The modding community, and OpenIV have had a huge impact on PC gaming as a whole. Take Two has destroyed years of hard work on the behalf of hundred of thousands of modders, who do not earn any kind of revenue from their work, but only seek to improve a beloved game. Im not mad, just disappointed. No wait, Im also furious.
