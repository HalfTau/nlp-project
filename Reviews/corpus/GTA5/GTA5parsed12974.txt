First bought this game on PS4 and bought a PC just to play it again but with better graphics and a higher frame rate. Story is great and theres plenty of stuff to do but Online is where theres the most replayability. Many hours of things to spend your time on in Online and many new vehicles to get. I like the continued support for the game but of course there is some negative aspects too, such as the increasing amount of cheaters and the prices of vehicles is getting a little too expensive. Theres a lot of grinding involved these days just to get what you want, so unless you have many hours of free time youre pretty much limited to buying shark cards or making a friend that owns it all wholl let you try it.If I were to judge the game entirely based on the single player, I would recommend it since the graphics are great and the story and music are also great.If I were to judge it just on the Online alone, I would have to give it a mixed review. Online was great around the Heists time but ever since then things have just been getting too expensive while the payouts of jobs have stayed the same. There are also many cheaters in the game and Ive recently been finding one in every single session. These people can drop money on you which can be detected and get the money removed or if it keeps happening your account can get suspended and they also have access to every players IP address which I know first hand because someone got angry at me so decided to post mine in the public chat where 28 other people could see it.Rockstar do seem to sometimes ban these cheaters but a lot of times its ineffective considering they can just buy cracked accounts and use an updated cheat that doesnt get detected.
