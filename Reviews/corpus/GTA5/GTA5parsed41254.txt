Single player is short, but it is pretty good. It seems like there will be no additional content out for that. The multiplayer is a terrible grindfest. You want that cool car? Get ready to playthe same few missions over and over for 40 hours until you can afford it. Or you can shell out real money for in game cash. Or just hack it, tons of hackers going around unpunished. Want to mod your game? Too bad, they took that away. Rockstar started off great, they execs are just trying to squeeze every dime out of this game. It turned this game into a giant turd.
