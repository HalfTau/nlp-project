I love the GTA series, and expected this game to continue the trend. The singleplayer is excellent, and I thouroughly enjoyed it. When I finished it, I looked forward to the promised singleplayer DLC, which was due for release in 2014. 3 years later, Ive begun to suspect that Rockstar is too busy rubbing shark cards on themselves to finish it.And therein lies the problem with GTA V. The MP was a buggy mess when released, and full of hackers. Rockstar eventually fixed the hackers, so they could push shark cards. Now, theyve killed modding completely, which is a huge part of what makes GTA good.Make your game work on release, and release more quality SP content like you promised you would, I dont want another 6 reskinned cars and another hat in MP.
