This game is pretty dang cool, even by todays standards. That is until you hit Online mode.Prepare yourself for twelve year olds rocking around with invincibility shooting rockets down from crazy hoverbikes while you attempt to find your way. Theres no real challenge in this either, because on the map youre given away by a marker that everyone can see. They see where you are, and even which way youre facing. Yeah, this makes for some on the edge of your seat PVP action.I dont think Im that autistic, but for the life of me I couldnt figure out what the hell I was supposed to do without already having a hundred friends on steam ingame. Is there a matchmaking system for jobs?What is this game?
