One of the best single player experiences Ive had, even 5 years later. Even better with endless mods to try out.Heists will be a huge pain unless you have at least 2 other friends to do it with. Randoms arent helpful and will probably cause you to fail. Dont worry about getting there though. After spending 20 minutes connecting to online, a modder will immediately kick you and everyone else out of the lobby.
