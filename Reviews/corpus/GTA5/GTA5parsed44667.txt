The gameplay itself is fun and all, but how the game was handled over time is just awful. I have little to say regarding the main story, it was alright I guess. Although gta online is a mess. Not only have they went with P2P servers enabling hacking to be a piece of cake, but they now just went out of their way to shutdown the most important singleplayer modding tool. Rockstar support seems to be useless, they dont even allow ban appeals because there are so many requests that they just dont want to deal with it anymore despite many false positives. I havent been banned or anything They moved their focus to sharkcards and it feels almost a requirement if you want to get the new vehicles priced usually around 23mil. Which takes about 46 hours of non stop grinding missions to get, or you know, pay for it. Eitherway point is, I love the game and its really fun with friends. But the way the game was handled and how the servers are p2p just caused so many problems that its just no excusable anymore, especially when they released the game 3 times, ps3/xbox360  ps4/xbone  pc. There no excuses for thispoor management. Im not recommending this game because youll end up frustrated and dissapoited. Rockstar/T2 Fix your sht and Ill consider updating the review.And for solidarity RemoveCheatersNotModsNullKey out.Edit1 I just wanted to update this review to mention the server issues that have NOT been acknowledged by rockstar where almost everyone on pc has their game crash every 5 minutes. Some people even say they crash in single player mode after 20min. No mention of this on their twitter or any official source. Their server status is showing all fine and dandy. Keeping this negative review, guys get yourtogether jesus christ.
