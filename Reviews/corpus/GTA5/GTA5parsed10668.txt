A quality game by Rockstaer, there is honestly nothing else to say. Almost everything is better compared to GTA 4. Some may say that GTA 4 had more realistic world, and it may be true, but if you consider everything else they did in GTA 5.. yeah, its a good game. Nice story, bigger world, more variables, heists, online allthou microtransactions are poor.This game is worth every dollar even at full price.
