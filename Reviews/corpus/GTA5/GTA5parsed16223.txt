This game has been out for far to long for the online play to be so bad still.  Constant modders ruining lobbies, random crashes and freezes, and a general lack of interesting things to do.  If you dont have friends to play with its almost unplayable.  If you get this game get it for the story mode and plan to avoid online play. also the price of 59.99 is outrageous wait for a sale its not worth that much.
