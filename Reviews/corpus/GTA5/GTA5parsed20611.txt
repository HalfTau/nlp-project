For thte last day, the game has been consistantly freezing and crashing. I have finished the story mode and am trying to enter online, but but because of the crashing, I cant even finish making my character. Reallyoff. I bought a shark card with the game when it was on sale, but I cant even access it right now because the game wont work.Great game, but PLEASE fix this. I will request money back for the shark card if the crash isnt fixed soon, as its no use to me if I cant even create a character to access multiplayer.
