Much better than GTA IV series which was mediocre and stripped of lots of its appeal the GTA III series had. IF this was a stars  rating I would give it a 3 1/2 star rating  GTA IV a 2 star and GTA III, and GTA VC a 5 star ratign and GTA a 5 wishing I could add more stars to it rating. MOdding them and playing ALL the mini games made it so much more worth it than the GTA4 graphics  yet stripped down action and the multiplayer stupidity that goes on without hackng preventions that work
