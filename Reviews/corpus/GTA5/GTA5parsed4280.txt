I got the game for 24 USD which at the time cost 30 AUS which is a baragin for a game like. I recommend it alone for the story mode. But we never got Single Player DLC thanks to GTA ONLINE whether that good or bad that for you to say. I owned the game from Xbox One, PS4, PS3, PC Social Club and now the Steam Version. Why did i buy another copy of GTA 5 for PC? Well i love Steam. And i thought that the physical copy of GTA 5 for PC would be steam. I spend countless hours on the console versions and i will on Steam.
