After getting attracted by videos of wandering in whole big open world, running your own criminial empire. I have lured to this game and finally got this, but I have ended up getting refund after playing for 3 hours..In our country there are soap opera of 30 mins which usually have 1012 mins advertisment, which makes them so annoying to watch. If GTA V was Soap opera instead of game it would have been perfect one. after 1015 mins of gameplay there is usually one loading screen which lasts for avg. 3 mins. In my 3 hours gametime I have spent atleast 1hr in loading screens.The game is packed with really good stuffs but this loading times makes it impossible to enjoy such beautiful game. and after 2 years prior release rockstar dont bother to fix this.Spend money in other open world titles like witcher than spending money in this Loading screen simulator.
