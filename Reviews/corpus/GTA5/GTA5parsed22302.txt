Enjoyable SinglePlayer, now that mods are back. Online has a messed up community, but with friends it is still a fun experience. Gunrunning DLC introduced lots of new ways to play, make money, etc.. For 25, it is a totally fun experience, I would definetly buy it, and even more if a few other friends are joining in!
