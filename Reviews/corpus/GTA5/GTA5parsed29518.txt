I do not recommend this game for a variety of reasons, one fo the primary ones being the toxic and disgraceful actions of its publisher TakeTwo. I have been modding since GTA 2, never online, and have always loved putting different cars into the game, applying realism packs, and more. Modding has been a staple of GTA for as long as I can remember, and its not even the only reason I can no longer recommend the franchiseThey clearly have no interest in keeping this game alive and I honestly believe the next GTA will not come out until their cash cow the terribly balanced disguisting online grindfest that GTA Online is dries up. In fact I encourage everyone to avoid the next release as well unless TakeTwo issues a public apology.There are plenty of other games made by much more deserving teams you should throw your money at. Agents of Mayhem, Crackdown, Saints Row, and plenty of other games have shared this space and if it were not for nostalgia I would argue that many elements were done better.
