An enjoyable game with great graphics, good gameplay, and a somewhat functional/disfunctional community of online players.Once you finish the story you can go into GTA Online and get pssed off at other modders or just higher level players until you can actually get a chance to play the game, or you can just screw around with mods and scripts to your hearts content in story mode.Overall, this game is great. The story was fun to play through, and Online is fun and challenging, I would reccomend playing with friends. If Online is getting to boring, just hop into the modding community and find some scripts that you think will make this game nicer or a bit more fun for you.If you want a game that is difficult to get bored of, then Grand Theft Auto V is for you.
