Online mode has terrible gameplay mechanics. The publisher no longer releases any modifications expanision packs to story mode this results in a game that has the potential to evolve over time stuck with its original story only. In this day of Agile software devellopment with deployment of modern applications via continuous integration and delivery, we should expect more from this publisher to keep us engaged and provide us with a reason to continue to invest in their platform. Threatening custom content creators with legal ramifactions who only wish to express themselves via someone elses platform is a violation of freespeach and should not be tolerated. Take two you must evolve your business model to include and support these artists.
