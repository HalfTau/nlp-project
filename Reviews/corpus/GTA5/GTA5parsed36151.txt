Ive never modded this game ever and only slightly did so in GTA IV. That being said, I cant get behind banning an entire modding community tool made for singleplayer. The OpenIV tool, as Ive read, only affects singleplayer, but I could be wrong. Either way, its a shame that any company would seek to kill outside creativity towards their franchises. You just destroyed the last traces of what could be a surviving player base for your game, Take Two.EDIT Ive read that Take Two has initiated talks with OpenIV and the website just received an update for minor bug fixes and other stuff. If this means OpenIV is back up and running and the modding community is free to mod again, Ill retract my previous review in favor of a positive one because, well, GTA V is still a good game to me, mods or not.EDIT 2 Multiplayer is still full of overhostile sociopaths and the grind is horrible but hell its a lot of fun if you stupid stuff with friends.
