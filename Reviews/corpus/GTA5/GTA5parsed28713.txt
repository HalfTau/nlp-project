A great game full of creativity and fun but made by greedy no good childish developers who ruined there own game. This is the end of gta guys. RIP opening mods, we will truly miss you. But maybe good will rise from this. Lets hope a game similar to gta will release but the the developer will actually care about his/hers supporters and there creativity. But let it not be to similar, because rockstar and take two will probably send a cd because they money hungry savages
