Ever wonder why you cant use any of the fun miltiplayer vehicles in single player? Its because TakeTwo would rather you pay them to get the ingame money to buy those vehicles in online instead. This whole OpenIV business is the same thing. They dont want you modding in fun stuff because they would rather you pay for it. As if 60 x 75 million wasnt enough for them. If TakeTwo is going to hamper their single player experiences in order to push more microtransactionriddled multiplayers or worse, if they start bringing microtransactions into their single players, then buying their games isnt going to be worth it, including this one. Not only is crushing this tiny mod team for making their game even more fun and no doubt selling them millions on PC copies a horrible thing to do, its also nothing more than a blatant and cheap move to push their awful microtransactions to pull as much money out of their customers as possible. Dont fall for it.
