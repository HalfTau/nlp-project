I used to wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone with an interest in sandbox games, but they gated the coolest sandbox content to be online only. We used to use mods to access that content in single player, but then they threatened the people who created mods to allow us to enjoy it with legal action. The best stuff in this game is now inaccessible to people who dont play the online, and so I can no longer reccomend this as my favorite sandbox game.I cannot support a game that expects users to pay full price, then doesnt let us do what we want with the product we purchased, then expects us to pay yet more money to be allowed to access content that we already payed for.
