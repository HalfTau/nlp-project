Although its been a while, GTA5 still holds up. The graphics are amazing and are amazing compared to the console versionsPCMR!. The gameplay is still fun, the map is gigantic, and the three characters introduce a fun story. Now that Take Two has allowed Open 4 and Mods again, the singleplayer is amazing to just roam and playand kill all the npc. I havent spent too much time on the online counterpart. Overall, GTA5 is still amazing and the PC port has opened up a lot of possibilites that werent possible on the console.
