Came for the Story and stayed for the multiplayer. I first started playing this game when it originally released on the 360 and I got many fun hours out of the game, but after abandoning an account that I bought a bunch of items from money drops from hackers in favor of a blank slate, I felt like I was being punished. In game items are excesively overpriced to tempt players into buying shark cards and getting something nice in game can take way too long. The game is fun if you can enjoy the simpler aspects of it, but if you like the fancy stuff and dont have a lot of money, this game might put you off.Its still a good game in my opinion, the micro dlcs just make it hard to love and recommend.
