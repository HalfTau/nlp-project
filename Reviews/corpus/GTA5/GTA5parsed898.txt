I got around 70h playtime in story mode as i do not like the comments about online version and didnt play it.Story mode, so single player, was fun so far but slowly actually since a while it is getting boring.Actually, all i was doing was driving cars, shoot around, grab guns from police and military and running away from them...Tried to explore building, but all was closed 99of it.I played a little bit of mission goals, but that was boring after 67 mission.Then changing the characters?Dont know what is that good for, I hate that already from resident evil.It is a huge world, but somehow dead except you can drive cars, shoot at people, fight with the policeBut hey, i saw it now and i played Dying Light  Just Cause 3 before and the world there is so much alive and much more interesting, more fun to play. Going back there, Sayonara!Would like to recommend the game, but cant do that, cos most of the time i fight police to take their guns/ammot?? ?And online part isnt really playable according to already existing comments.Cant recommend your game becasue of that...
