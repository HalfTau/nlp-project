Dont listen to all these haters in the recent comments, every part of the Grand Theft Auto series is a piece of gaming history, even if they chose to ban some modding tool. Just play the game and watch out for all the details in the GTA world, R did such a great work to create a virtual living city and a great storyline for you to experience. Also it is the first 3DGTA with an open multiplayercity where you can do everything you shouldnt do in reallife. This is one of the greatest games ever!
