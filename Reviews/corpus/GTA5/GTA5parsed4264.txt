GTA V offers the GTA experience we have all come to expect and more. The world of GTA V is expansive and well thought out. Coming back to Los Santos after all these years feels just right. Strory is good by GTA standards and while your choices as a player dont really make a difference to overall story expect at the end I really like the 3 protagonist approach. Side quest are also fun and provide much of the WTF feeling DGTA Online however is in my opinion mostly just a cash crab. It can be fun at times but often halts down to a grind for money doing the same missions over and over if you are not willing to pay to win. Also PvP elements often are spoiled by horrible lag and netcode issues this could be improved, havent played in a while.So recommended for the singleplayer not so much for the online. Trevor is love, trevor is lyfe.
