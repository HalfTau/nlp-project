TO START OFF I DONT HATE THE GAME.What really bothers me is that i have played gta franchise since i was 6 and ive been enyoing it on ps3 i enjoyed it so much i could play it for hours and hours... But when i bought the game to my PC i realised that OHI CANT TRANSFER MY PS3 ACCOUNT and that made me a little annoyed. And i had to start all over again. Then when i got some money YES I GOT  MONEY DROPPED i had fun but one day money got removed... DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET MONEY IN GTA V ONLINE. A CAR COSTS 3M Dollars thats not normal. It would be normal if money would be easier to make but the game isnt fun without mods and as we know modding online EVEN IN CLOSED SESSION gets you banned. I think i have to move on and find another game to play but its really sad that rockstar is a money  and doesnt care aboout other peoples thinks... ROCKSTAR PLEASE FIX.
