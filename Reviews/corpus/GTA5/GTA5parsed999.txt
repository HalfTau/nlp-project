This game itself is great however there are some people who suck the life out of fun in this game, and no not the trash talkers im talking about the Modders V.s the people who really play the game fair. I would not recommend this game until Rockstar does something about these modders. Rockstar can have the modders but please just put them in a different server like yall do the Dunces or rather the bad sporters, if you cant do anything about it just let them have their own server and let the people who really want to play this game the non cheat way have theirs thats all im saying.However if you arent the person into online....who wouldnt be Then get the game i play story mode all the time thanks to these modders ive noe yet completed it well not on P.C but its great some story lines may be funny to you so if you dont mind playing Story mode 24/7 be my guest
