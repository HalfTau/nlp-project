Do NOT buy this game if you have any interest in modding. Take Two Interactive just killed off the one essential backbone framework, OpenIV, with a Cease and Desist, essentially gutting the GTAV modding scene.This is disgusting behaviour when one of the reasons many of their PC sales happened it exactly because of the ability to mod the game.If this perists, this will be the last Rockstar or Take Two game I buy.
