Was promised singleplayer DLC content, it never came. Loading time for Online is huge, sometimes its not even joining. In order to buy things, you either have no life and only play GTA V or you give them more money to buy Shark Cards. The singleplayer story was okish, but not as good as the other GTAs. You cant play singleplayer without internet connection this makes no sense. In Online, after you play like every mission available, and then you start do some other things, it gets repetitive and boring after a while, nothing to do. Also, you can no longer mod the singleplayer game because they want more money from Online. After Rockstar has been very supportive of the modding community, Take Two is screwing with everyone.
