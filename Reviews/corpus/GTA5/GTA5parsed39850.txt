There is a reason why I havent played this game in a long time despite the never ending content updates. GTA online is a boring grindfest of a multiplayer experince and lacks tons of critical features that have been asked for since it came out almost four years ago. Instead of listening to the community rockstar has decided making as much money as possible would be a better option than making a game thats actually enjoyable. However theyve gone so far as to completely prevent modding for the game which is something that completely goes against the spirit of GTA. San andreas is 13 years old at this point but people still play it because of the mods.GTA is a series that has long been in my life and I have always played the newest release on day 1 even when it required me to buy a new ps3 just to play GTA 5. And rockstar was always known as a quality dev that actually cared about their customers and making a game that is quality. But it would seem that the old days of rockstar making good videogames is over, and despite making piles of cash anyway by being a nice developer, they would rather do everything they can to make as much money as possible and theyre stooping low enough to bully modders the only reason why they still get sales on their old games mind you.As for GTA 5 the story mode is pretty good the first time around, but its not the most memorable story theyve made. Freeplay is kinda boring compared to previous installments and while new SanAndreas is pretty large, the amount of stuff to actually do in the environment is kinda limited. GTA online is fun for the first 20 hours until you realize its just a massive grind fest, with no point in grinding anyways because a hacker is just going to give you all the money you could ever need anyways.
