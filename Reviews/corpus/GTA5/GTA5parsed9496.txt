This game is the most annoying ing game Ive ever played the npc drivers have the intelligence of a ing brick and go out of their way to hit you at the worst times the enemy npcs have aimbot and can kill you in two shots with a pistol from a mile away it seems like everything in the game is pitted against you to make it unfair just so those shark cards seem more appealing to buy
