Everyone downvoted this game because of the OpenIV controversy. I definitely agree that mods are important and shouldnt be shut down in any way, but I do have to admit Ive had this game for years and never used any mods. I dont have much total playtime because I also owned it on PS3 before the PS4/Xbone/PC version came out and played the hell out of the story mode already.The story mode seriously is incredible. If there is one gripe I have with this game it is that they pour all their resources into the GTA onlinewhich is no longer an online mode for a GTA game but rather its own entity. I would love for story DLCs like we got with GTAIV.
