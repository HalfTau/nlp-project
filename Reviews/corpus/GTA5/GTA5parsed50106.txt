OpenIV has been a tool Ive used in previous versions of GTA but not in GTA V because i mainly play online. it has helped me evolve my different computer skills mainly animation and graphics wise, and now you choose, and Ive seen other people use it as a starting platform as well.. taking them down although they never harmed you or your game, they only helped you is a silly thing and i will not support or recommend a company who chose to act like this
