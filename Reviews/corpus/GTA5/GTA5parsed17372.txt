Another great Grand Theft Auto.Have been playing GTA since GTA 1s release.Huge fan, and almost never dissapoints.There was just San Andreas that was a miss.The MMO feel of GTA V makes it worth its price.The single player missions was amazing aswell.Played for hours on end, and will continue to do so.
