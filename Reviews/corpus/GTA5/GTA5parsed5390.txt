I really enjoy this game for its openworld experience and cooperative opportunity. There are plenty of things to do to fill your time in this game whether it be singleplayer or on GTA Online. I dont really like the paytowin aspect of the game but the features that make up such a beauty outweigh and deliver a fine experience.
