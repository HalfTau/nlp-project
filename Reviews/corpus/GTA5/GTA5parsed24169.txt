After alot of youtube gameplays and all that made this look really fun, but it not. First I was slaped in the face with 68 hours of waiting just to find out that I cant connect to any servers, which is great gameplay! Seriously most of those hours is me waiting! When I finnaly connect to a server, Im unable to spawn with out getting killed by somehead and/or a haker. Hell a drug addiction would be better than playing this game!
