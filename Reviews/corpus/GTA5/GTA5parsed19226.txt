I got this game to play the multiplayer. Thats really the only reason I ever played a game that was made by Rockstar. The game was fun for a while even though I had to deal with the occasional modder or griefer that was deadset on ruining my day. The fun started to die down due to the overwhelming amount of money grinding that was required in order to get that fancy car or apartment that I wanted. Whenever discounts or double money events popped up, I would often take advantage of them to help me gather the funds needed to get the items that I wanted. All in all I always had a good time in the game.However in the recent months the actions of Rockstar and Take Two have made me very disappointed. Attacking the singleplayer modders and money wiping players who may or may not have gotten in game currency from a modder shows that they do not care for the players of their game, but rather the money that is in their wallets. Rockstar and Take Twos tactics of banning players just because they happen to be in the same server as a hacker shows that they do not care for fairness or getting things right.While I do enjoy playing the game every now and then, I cannot in good faith recommend this game or any future games by Rockstar and Take Two, not unless they change their business tactics and how they handle their online community. Rockstar themselves made a promise of singleplayer DLC early in the games life but have yet show anything for it. Adding that they banned singleplayer mods could lead one to assume that they want all their customers to only play GTA Online and therefore spend their real life money on the free DLC by use of Shark Cards.I hope this disorganized mess of thoughts helps people in some manner. I just felt like I need to get this off my chest.
