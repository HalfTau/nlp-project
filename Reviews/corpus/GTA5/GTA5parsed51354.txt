Open IV DOES NOT SUPPORT GTA ONLINE MODS!Open IV has been shut down by Take two and this means they have disabled around half of the available GTA V singleplayer mods. Their reasoning is that Open IV enables the creation of malicious GTA Online mods which is strictly NOT TRUE.Because of this I implore you to NOT buy GTA V until this issue is resolved and Open IV is restored.
