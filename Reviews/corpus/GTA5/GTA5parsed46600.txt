I have been playing gta ever since the original grandtheftauto came out on ps1. I love the game and how it has over the years developed into what it is today, i love gta5 and actually dont even go online at all, i only ever use single player mode and have many many mods on it to do with lspdfr, police mods so i can be a cop ingame and drive british police cars and have callouts etc, a huge part of my gaming is modding my gta and thanks to take 2 thats all over now. AIm a 31 yr old guy and have never broken any rules regarding online, i simply stay offline.Im DISGUSTED  that take 2 have issued a cease and disist to the creators of openIV .I will no longer support rockstar or take 2 and will deffinately not be buying ANY products either of them have anything to do with,F.V.C.K Y.O.U   T.A.K.E. .2.Thanks for ALIENATING me for using mods on SINGLE PLAYER MODE ,Im now gonna take a dump in a bag and post it off to take 2 . not even joking
