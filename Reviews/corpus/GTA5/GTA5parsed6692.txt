Ive bought 3 copies of the game for ps3 then 3 ps4 GTA Bundles and two copies for Pc.You could say i love GTA so much that i bought it for others to play.The only downside to the games is how HARD it is to make money online. You make a few grand here and there. I spent all day doing missions and only had around 200k at the end of the day.Cars, planes,weapons  and homes are in the millions so its really hard to have nice things without playing the game 24/7 or cheating.If youre just starting out online, youre going to have a rough time!! !EA could learn a lesson from Rockstar. Free DLC a complete fun game with a kick a story.Single player  10/10Online  2/10
