Ive been playing GTA Online since its original release on the Playstation 3 and I can easily say that this title was a huge part of my gaming experience growing up. The online features this game has to offer are unmatched by any other title. Along with the constant creation of new content such as heists, biker clubs, orgs, and etc. I only have ONE complaint about this game. Collectively, Ive spent well over 600 hours on my original character grinding for rank, cars, property, or whatever. I dont understand as to why Rockstar removed the character transfer feature from within the game. I sadly found this out after purchasing the title once more on PC. However, I truly do love the game so Im not too angry about restarting. Despite that, I think that GTA V  GTA Online are masterpieces. I cant wait to see what other great things they do with GTA Online or any other relating titles in the future.
