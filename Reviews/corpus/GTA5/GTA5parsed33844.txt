This is what makes the actions of Take Two Interactive invalid, and illegal. Under the First Sale Doctrine Ruling, it was decided on 3222013 via Supreme Court case 11697 Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley  Sons, Inc that ownership trumps the copyright and/or patent holders rights. Therefore, any action that Take Two Interactive is doing to prevent modding of private games from here on out referred to as single player or those games that take place off of TTI and Rockstar servers is unconstitutional, and thereby, actually the illegal act. Furthermore, any actions that TTI or Rockstar take against the players or the creators of such software is as well illegal, and unjustified.
