Grand Theft Auto V, like most GTA games, is a lot of fun while the story lasts. Unfortunately though, GTAV continues the trend started in the previous title of having little to no additional content once the story is completed. There are properties and businesses to buy, but no additional repeatable missions, minigames, or other forms of income you would need to actually buy them.The heists were interesting at first, and the idea behind having a crew that increases in talents as you do more heists is interesting. However its all smoke and mirrors there are no more heists once you complete the few ones available in the story, and the game punishes you for picking any but the most expensive, highly skilled crew members regardless.Rockstar instead focused on the online Multiplayer, which features a highly exploitative business model. For 60, the singleplayer isnt enough as there is no post game content. From here on out, singleplayer content which has been the best part of the GTA series is officially dead in favor of the online multiplayer and appropriately named Shark Cards.With an interesting story, but very shallow content otherwise, GTAV doesnt have anywhere near the staying power of older games in its series and similar games such as GTA 3, GTA Vice City, GTA San Andreas, Saints Row 13, etc. Add to that that the Publisher Take Two has declared that singleplayer modding is illegal, it can be expected that the GTA series, and likely anything else produced by Rockstar, will continue on in this manner.To conclude, GTAV simply does not provide the same value as should be expected of a modern AAA 60 title. There is no interesting content outside of the story in singleplayer, the online multiplayer is designed in a way to only be enjoyable if you pay extra, the most interesting parts of the singleplayer are built on underutilized mechanics, it will not keep you entertained for nearly as long as other similarly priced games, and finally, the publisher will not allow members of the community to contribute their own singleplayer content, as anything that deters its players from the online multiplayer cannot be accepted.  A very depressing entry to a series that offered so much in the past.
