Play with hackers the MMO experience. Multiplayer anticheat is completely broken, probably design to keep people buying copies of the game. Completely t experience, I tried again and again to get into it but I cannot remember the last time I played a multiplayer game without having at least one person running mods.Solo is the only playable option, and an overall enjoyable gaming experience.
