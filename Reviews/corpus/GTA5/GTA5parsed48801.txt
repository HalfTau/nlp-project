Shark Cards are not the reason I bought GTA V 3 different times on 3 different consoles, same with GTA IV and Max Payne 3 and Red Dead.Shark Cards are not why I bought all DLC ever made by RockStar for all of their amazing singleplayer experiences.Shark Cards are not why the community of friends I have made around all these online modes, from GTA IV to Red Dead, even Max Payne 3 exist.The reason I buy your products, your games, over and over and over is because of the amazing singleplayer DLC you used to produce. I hate to even call your DLC anything less than their own great games, Undead Nightmare is still in my top ten games of all time. But with Shark Cards, its sad to see that you guys are treating DLC the same way everyone else is, lowering the bar you have set for so many years.Buy more money so you can have this wacky hat and op gun. Isnt that what gaming is all about?I have a lot of problems with how GTAs story was treated, from the reduced ammount of activities to do in the world all so you can play as three bland characters with only one having a complete arc by the end, but this just shows how little you care about producing good SP content. By not even allowing the community to step in and fufill the role you have shunned by focusing on just the, impressive, but lacking MP, you just show how little you care about creating the Singleplayer experiences you used to craft.Im just hoping Red Dead 2 goes back to just wanting to be an amazing story with an even more incredible world to explore.
