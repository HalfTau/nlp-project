UPDATE Rockstar seem to have convinced TakeTwo to retract their legal threats against OpenIV. Im now happy to recommend this game again!Great single player experience thats worth the price of entry, with a great story and characters, but also set in an expansive openworld sandbox that lets you do whatever you want between missions.The online mode can be fantastic too  when you can find a game that doesnt have any cheaters  stick to Private games with friends if you can, because running the online heists with a decent crew is . That said, many have complained about the need to grind for money, with expensive vehicles and other items to try and coerce you into buying Shark cards with real money.Previous reviewTake Two/Rockstar actively attacked the single player modding scheme by taking down OpenIV, rather than opening dialogue with the OpenIV team with their concerns regarding online cheating  or heaven forbid, spending some of their impressive profits from the game to implement an anticheat system to prevent it, as theyve failed to do since its release  means a negative review from me.Sorry Rockstar, you done goofed.
