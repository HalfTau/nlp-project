Only worth buying maybe, look at the price for Story Mode or to have fun with friends in private sessions.GTAOnline is pretty crap, the DLC is always the same except the worthless, dull vehicles that cost millions. They keep making new sorts of missions that you can only do in public sessions, forcing you to play with people that will kill you for no reason.Game is overpriced, Shark Cards are overpriced, and ingame stuff is overpriced.
