Honestly tired of the game. the loading times to play online are so bad, I forget I have the game open some times. Not to mention the modders in the online environment always messing up the game by spawning players all over the place or spawning vehicals everywhere. What annoys me the most is when friends drop out of sessions or getting stuck on loading screens, forcing them to close and reopen the game with these extremely long loading times.
