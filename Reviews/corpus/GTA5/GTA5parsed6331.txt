Unplayable.  Loading screens exceed 4 minutes which wouldnt be terrible if the game didnt crash after 1540 minutes if play time.  Ive spent more time trouble shooting, looking at crash logs, reinstalling various drivers and the game then Ive spent playing the game itself.If it works Im sure its a wonderful game and I enjoyed the bits of online and single player I played.  But there is no reason for a games scripting to be so sensitive that it crashes easily on a rig that handles all other modern titles.
