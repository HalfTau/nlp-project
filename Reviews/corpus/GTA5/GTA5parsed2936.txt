Extremely fun game. When you buy this, you essentially buy two gamesGTA V and GTA Online.GTA VGreat story, character development, and voice acting. The missions are fun, and the gold challenges are just difficult enough to make you hooked on getting them all.GTA OnlineGreat way of building up economy. Might be a little slow in the beginning, but Its so worth it. The game is just pure fun with friends.Hope yall enjoy itKarl.
