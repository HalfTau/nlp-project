GTA V, is great game to mess aorund in with your friends, if your just getting started I would not reccomend you jump into an online game but finish the campaign and then move onto GTA online, just becuase everyone already has everything unlocked online and can really mess you up quick. There even are hackers online that will kill you over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over agian. So stick with the campaign if your just starting out.
