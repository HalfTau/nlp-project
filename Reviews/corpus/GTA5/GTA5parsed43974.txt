Other than game mechanics and environment, this game was a tragic dissapointment.Generic story line, boring characters, unrealistic heists miniguns and juggernaut suits? seriously?, and a money hungry multiplayer. Take a lesson from the previous GTAs and make your game more playable for everyone. Overpricing weapons ammo and cars only makes it harder to stomach the freemode and unmemorable online game modes. Not to mention it takes me 200 lightyears to join a match. your shark cards btw.Also dear TakeTwo, modding is the only thing that can save your game. B1
