Im giving this a bad review even though mods are back, it still has a lot to catch up since the ban of OpenIVAnother reason is the online is apsolutly horrible because the money you get is literly not enough all you get is maby 5001000 on some missons and you hardly that much on races or even the new gunrunning missions
