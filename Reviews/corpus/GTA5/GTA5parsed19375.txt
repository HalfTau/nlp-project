Between the PC version and PS3  PS4 versions, Ive put over 300 hours in on this game.I love SinglePlayer BUUUUUUUUT  more on that in a bit..Online is totally fced cuz of the damn microtransactions and EVERYTHING being ridiculously overpriced.The fact that we will probably NEVER get any SinglePlayer DLC is what makes this the worst release in Rockstar history.I cant think of a more blatant middle finger to the true fans of the game and series than this.. Its absurd that theyd totally sidestep SP DLC for their own greed. Theyve made enough money off this property.. Time to GIVE BACK TO THE FANS!!!!!!
