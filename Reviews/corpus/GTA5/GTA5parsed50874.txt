I paid for this game twice. Once on the xbox 360 and once for the PC specifically for the mods. Remove those mods and what do you have? You have a game that became stale for me three years ago.I know I am not the only person with the same story. When I buy a game for one specific reason, I expect that reason to stay around for a while.Do not buy.
