Personally as a person who never really modded this game and just enjoyed the single player, I would recommend it for the specific reason. Some people dislike the single player story, I honestly enjoyed it and replayed it several times on numerous consoles and gaming platforms. Sure, I could give this a negative review for all the flaws this game has, how rockstar/Take Two is wanting to take our money through microtransactions. Either way, my personal experience with this game is really good. I preordered this game in 2013 and the minute I picked it up I enjoyed it. All I can tell you is if you really want to play this game, dont support the online multiplayer aspect. Just play it for the single player or modding if its back which Im guessing it is. The choice is up to you but the story is fantastic and entertaining. I wouldnt buy it at full price, get it on sale.
