You can bite my shiny metal ss Take Two and Rockstar. The reason i have 600 plus hours on this game is thanks to Openiv unlocking the single player mode because you and your parent company are money grubbingwho DONT ADD ANY CONTENT to its single player mode. Your absolute microtransaction milking online pile of dog crap is why i may never buy any game from you again.
