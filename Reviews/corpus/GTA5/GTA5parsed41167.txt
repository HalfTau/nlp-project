UPDATE TWO I love this game, in singleplayer, and the fundemental ideas of GTAO, however the economy makes me want to run far away from it. In the beginning, we had reasonable prices and shark cards that while they were microtransactions in a premium game, were fairly balanced and you got a respectable amount of money for them. That has since changed drastically.First, they never go back and fix anything, they just pileon top making everything below it redundant. This applies to game mechanics and the economy/microtransactions themselves. It seems with every passing update, the items in game get more and more expensive. A borderline usless yacht for as much money as it would cost me to buy a whole new game? Sure! Why not? 60 million in new content added in the smugglers run DLC that would take me at a generous estimate at least 60 HOURS of grinding to buy all the content thats assuming you have everything set up to maximize profits and dont waste any time, or gasp actually want to do something enjoyable like the stunt races or what have you. If I were to by shark cards, it would cost nearly 700 for all of the smugglers run content ALONE, ingoring any of the prevously price gouged DLCs. Yes its free if I want to grind tedious cargo sell missions and import/export jobs, but as the YouTuber Nerdcubed did the math for, you would be better off getting a minimum wage job to make money in GTA Online, it would be less time and just as fun. Yet I keep playing it, because goddamn it I want that flying bike. I will say this though, Take Two Interactive will never see another cent of my money in shark cards. I know Im just a drop in the bucket, but if we all put our foot down, we can put it right where it hurt, a swift kick in the wallet.
