Look, Rockstar. It was a good run. I thought the game was great when it first came out on PC. I poured hours into the game, brought copies for friends And that was about 100NZD a pop when it first came out, and had a ing ball with the game.But then the mods started to roll in, it just got ing better and better! You guys were 100 behind the effort to mod the game for offline players, for those that wanted to do sillyin the singleplayer experience. I was one of these people, but thats been ruined.TakeTwo, the company you work closely with has decided that 2017 is the year to put the axe to the modding community for GTA. Funny enough, Im doing the same thing for the game. Sorry guys, its just how it is.
