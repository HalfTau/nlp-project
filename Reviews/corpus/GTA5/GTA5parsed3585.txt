the game has become too much of a cash grab for the creators due to them bumping up all the prices of cars, bikes etc. this ends up forcing most people into buying shark cards or to commite months of grinding into getting one  car, rockstar has the audacity to realeas a jet with no fetaures and literaly no upgardes that cost millions! not to mention they also still have game breaking bugs from the day of realese wich are not just limited to pc but to all platforms. it is a mess what this game is! if u want an online experience like gta 5 online go back a game and play gta 4 or saint rows because iv had more fun in both of those games then i ever had in this ing waste of money and time of a game!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS i pray that one day someone will make a player freindly version of gta where there are no micro trancations thrown around and no t coperate greed as well!  U TAKE 2  U ROCKSTAR AND  EVERYTHING U S DO! u dont deserve the playerbase that u have atm and i hope that it disaperes or that MODDERS SWARM UR ING GAME because they already do but i hope more do because those guys are what make the game worth playing not theu put out! ah sorry about the rant but in overall dont buy this game it will suck the cash from u and leave u with nothing the game is a complete grind with a player base of 13 year olds and  save urself the time and cash and play another game i rate this game a 4/10  U ROCKSTAR
