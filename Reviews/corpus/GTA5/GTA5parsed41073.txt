This is a sore subject with me. I bought the game on 360 originally, played it for a few hundred hours and had a blast. PS4s version was the next I picked up because I wanted some better resolution and first person mode seemed really fun, and IT WAS! I had so much fun playing it. I decided to wait for it on Steam, and when I had the chance... I jumped on it.Man the game was gorgeous, not super realistic or anything crazy, but just crisper and nice over the console versions. First person mode worked so much better on the PC. But I didnt want to just play through this game again in Single Player for the 3rd time, I wanted to make this world look hyper realistic.I remember some of the mods I used for GTAIV and how the game looked photorealistic with real cars and amazing textures. I was frothing to thing of V being up to that standard.Then Rockstar decided to wave their giantaround and say, Naw dawg, single player modding is a bannable offense in Multiplayer.So, that was that... I played for less than an hour, because I wasnt allowed to make the single player game better, shrugs I guess I cant recommend this game, even though Ive spent close to 180 dollars on it over its life time. Anyone sitting on the fence now should just not bother, unless they open up and say modding is ok on the PC.
