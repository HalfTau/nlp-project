Take 2 has their heads firmly up their collective aes send a CD order to openiv for producing a program that allows modding of the single player game. NOT GTA Online. So please, tell the one company adding new content and playability to the single player game mode that R and Take 2 have NOT provided any extra content or DLC since the game launched, to shut down and put a dev team out of their jobs.Screw you Take 2. But I guess single player doesnt sell your idiotic micro payment shark cards does it?
