It has come to my attention that Rockstar is negotiating with Take2 in order to find more common ground in regards to mods. While this is good, this negative review still stands. They may improve in the future, but in just the same way that we cant let EA and Ubisoft forget about thetheyve pulled, we cannot let Take2 forget this.
