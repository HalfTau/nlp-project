Rather than continuing to support the 3rd party modding scene like they claim, by working with the mod devs who have previously gone out of their way to avoid messing with online or anything else, they simply shut down the core component for the majority of single player mods. in other words, rather than letting you enjoy your mods, they want you online buying micro transactions. frankly, online sucks. Itd be more enjoyable if it were just added to single player, with lobbies to do heists with friends
