Rockstar is money hungry and want you to pay 100 real money on top of the 59.99 to purchase the game for only 8 mil in gme dollars. What the hell can you purchase with that half of a jet. Dont even think of getting to participate in the gunrunning that they just released you cant afford it because everything is to much and you cant make enough in a heist to afford it all. Ive had the game a while now and Rockstar has continued to screw it up even more than before. When red dead 2 comes out if this company has anything to do with it i personally will not be getting it. so  you Rockstar and all that you have F up on
