Edit 4 since steam dosnt have a neutral rating, ill keep changing this review depending on how i feel about the game at any given time.Edit 3 Rockstar, why punish legitimate players by ridiculously inflating prices when its an absurd grind already, when you could instead sue the cheat makers for damages, putting hackers off, reducing the grind and make the game more enjoyable for those who play properly? It worked for Blizzard with Overwatch when they went after the cheat makers for that game, so hopefully there would be some traction for it for GTA?Edit 2 Didnt mention that the votekick function has no reason system backing it up and can be abused by players or groups of players to remove people from the session with ease, ive had multiple ocasions when ive literally just joined a new session and get a votekick warning seconds later, being told by the system to improve my behavior D.Edit Im changing the recommendation to positive as despite the games flaws Rockstar are willing to try to correct some issues with the game mainly cases where money was mistakenly removed.Original ReviewDont get me wrong Id love to give this game a good review as it is an awesome concept a third / first person shooter that allows the player to get in and out of land, air and sea vehicles in a free roam environment, but it is severely let down by the sheer amount of grinding needed to acquire even a small percentage of the available items.Theres also huge problems with cheating in the game where hackers can perform actions ranging from invincibility to spontaneously blowing up everyone in the session and framing another player for the action with the kill count.Its quite possible that the anticheat is also a bit flawed as Ive heard of instances where people who have worked hard to earn money legitimacy, without having a hacker create some for them, have had their in game bank accounts corrected by the developers.Some items in the game are also quite overpowered and have few if no effective counter except themselves, mainly the Hydra, explosive sniper and to a degree the oppressor jet bike.The way I see it the hydra could have been balanced by making it two distinct vehicles, one designed for air to air with its manoeuvrability, speed but no explosive cannons and another like the A10 in real life that has the powerful cannon and is armoured, but slow and easier to hit.Also the recently added anti aircraft vehicles would have been much more effective if the gunner could aim up more and hit targets above them, as well as being a bit more protected so they dont die instantly from a single missile hit.If they really wanted an explosive handheld weapon like the explosive sniper in the game they should have made a rework of the railgun that requires a charge time to fire holding the button to fire in a few seconds time, so people cant just pop off shots all the time.The oppressors rockets should have been limited to dumbfire mode, as people can just lock on, fire then buzz off out of range and cant be hit easily because of the low profile of the bike.So yeah, with some rebalancing of items, a buff to moneymaking and better anticheat this game could be flawless.
