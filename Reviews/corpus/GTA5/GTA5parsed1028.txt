.... ggggooooddd ing damn it. I like this game. I really do. But. I updated my system. needed a new video card so i could actually enjoy the graphics, so i bought one, and had to do alot of upgrading, even threw in a new HD and reinstalled windows. ... And some reason it wouldnt let me continue from my save game. So just download a save game close to where i was right?NOPE! something is set up so you cant import a save game. So you have to start over from scratch dragging through playing that worthless ing sagging  micheal who should have put a shotgun in the mouth of each of member of that whiny entitled sack offamily and blown their brains across the walls of his house, or should have jumped for ing joy when that stupidharpy of a wife left him and took the biggest poster children for super late term abortions with her.Oh, and playing through whats his name. Black guy. that pile of  who sits and whines and es and moans and moans and moans more then a porn star getting ed in theby a donkey, but with less charisma, grace, talent, and likeability then the donkeys wrinkled sphincter.All i want to do is play the game and have fun with the only actual fun character, trevor, but no. If i want to get to there i have to go throguh all the worthless ing mindless drudgery of dealing with those ing wank stains on their stupid  worthless missions that lead no where at all with the festeringgobbling gaping wounds of characters that screech around them.
