i didnt mod the game i have no want to do so butboring onlineimpossible to have any fun since anything you costs a ton of money and makes u grind missions and other stupid sh!t most online people fck up and then u dont get sh!t, the emphesis is on shark cards and i dont know of anyone stupid enough to actually buy 1 nothing like spending 50 on a card u can spend instantly and not even have a fully upgraded car.single player is way to easy and boring. if your almost dead just switch guys.the cars are slow at least in the old ones it had a motion blur to feel faster.its fairly unoptimised you get 60fps fine and dandy the next moment at the same spot you have 30. the game barley ran on consoles when it came out and still barley does its ok guys we added first person and a ton of screen tearing and fps dropsbigmap which is hyped up when most of it is empty with nothing there.the servers are terribleyou cant recomend this game even without the latest case in lack of judgement taking down mods which make the game look great from what ive seen in videos and the game modes.
