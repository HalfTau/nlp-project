The only reason I have played the GTA series was due to the extensive modding capability. Im sure this is the same for a great deal of other buyers of the games. Take Two should take a second take on their rules. I truly hope their sales plummet for this and future games. In fact, Im sure they will because of the aforementioned. The game was great with mods. Nobody wants to play their trash online and deal with microtransactions.
