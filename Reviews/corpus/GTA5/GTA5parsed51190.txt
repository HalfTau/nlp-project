Ive bought this game three times, and every time, it has been well worth it. Ive never thought to post a review on this until now, but everything about the game is fantastic, although the online part with Sharkcards isnt ideal.The story is fantastic. Every time I thought I was done, I found I had more to do. The Online is pretty fantastic as well, even when you encounter the occasional cheater.Definitely suggest purchasing the game if you have not done so yet.EDIT Reasoning for the low review score is due to the salt surrounding Take Two and their cease and desist notice for OpenIV. Rockstar has now talked to Take Two into being more open to mods. OpenIV is now coming back. No need to be salty anymore.
