I am a long time player of GTA. I have played hundreds of hours in and modded GTA 1,2,3,4, and 5. The OpenIV fiasco is the breaking point for me. Modding was a large factor in my purchase decision. I dislike the stock physics and handling, so I make my own tweaks. I add functions like being able to use pedestrians as human shields, or make the weapon damage realistic. I was having an absolute blast while becoming increasingly frustrated with rockstars attacks on these things. I already regretted my purchase after watching Online be introduced as a grindy, p2w snoozefest targetting mommys credit card. Singleplayer expansions were shelved indefinitely, and multiplayer content like lowriders never gets added to SP. Rockstar has attacked every alternate way to play online, making it impossible to enjoy the game my way. I dont care about their forced progression or doing missions with randos. I just want to drive around with friends or do weird stuff with modded ramps and a fire truck. This attack on OpenIV is the last straw. I did not have much hope for GTA 6, but now i am not buying a single Rockstar game again. No RDR2. Nothing. This boycott will work, because your product is not a quality one anymore. Does anyone remember when they were DMA designs? Remember the original Multi Theft Auto mod? Remember the San Andreas Car Garage or whatever it was called, with modded car sprites and more for the original GTA? Does anyone else love to find a mod to put their own car ingame? Ive spent so many late night hours tinkering with those things. I cant believe how far you have sunk, Rockstar. I guess this is goodbye.
