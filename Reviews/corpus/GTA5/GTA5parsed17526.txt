Rockstar is stealing legitimately gained money from players, again, and at the same time just put shark cards on sale. Very slimy R, we do not appreciate the overpriced in game items to begin with, but this is complete BS and you are missing off a lot of loyal and honest fans. Get your heads out of your ae.
