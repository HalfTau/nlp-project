Just read some of the reviews here. Open IV was shut down, which is  stupid because mods can add years to a games lifespan. Loading takes forever. Making money takes forever. Takes 10 drconds to ruin someones hard work which probably took them all day doing. If they really shut down open iv due to online hackers why not just seperate the two games online and story so modders can still work the magic in one
