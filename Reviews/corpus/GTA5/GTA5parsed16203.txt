To start, I dont think this is a bad game. It isnt the game at all that is the problem. Aside from the boring as hell hand holding introduction to the single player, of which i only spent an hour or two in, the multiplayer community is the thing that killed the game for me. Youve got modders, hackers, people going in got mode or blowing everyone in the map up at once. Youve got people that put you in cages, take away all your weapons, and put wanted level up so the cops can kill you. And then, after all that t, youve got the regular s that will kill you or set a bounty on you for no reason. Hardly anyone wants to play nice. It really ruins the experience when the person you just did a mission with kills you right after all cause you got a tiny bounty on your head. Hardly anyone uses voice communication and its utterly boring to grind away for whatever you may desire because the prices are so high. If the playerbase was more friendly, it wouldve been far more enjoyable. Maybe Ill try it again some other time.
