I used to play this game a lot with my friends and purchased it 3 times PS3, PS4, and finally, PC. I got the game on PC so that I can play single player with visual mods and other goof mods, now Take Two took that away. Rockstar and Take Two are looking for somebody to blame the INFESTED Online mode on. The players who ruin GTA online arent MODDERS, they are HACKERS. Stop blaming innocent modders and actually fix GTA Online. Do NOT buy this game if you are looking to mod it or play online. The single player is okay, but not worth anywhere near 60. If you play online, I can guarantee at least one hacker in your lobby that will spawn money on top of you and get you banned unless you talk to support before spending the hack money. Fix your game Rockstar, please.
