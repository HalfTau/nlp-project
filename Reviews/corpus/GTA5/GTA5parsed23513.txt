I bought this game shortly after it got released because I was interested in the Online aspect. It was good while it lasted. For maybe a couple of months I had fun making my way up to organising heists and buying cars. When I finished all the heists and got myself a couple of apartments and cars, I was kinda growing bored of it and just left it as it was. The game was sitting in my library for a good year or so, I pretty much forgot about it. Then I read somewhere that the game has been updated with new content so I went to check it out again.Now Im just stunned at how much there is to do ingame when playing online, its awesome and my money well spent. I never modded the game to begin with so I dont really care about what happened recently. The game is awesome for its content, and if you have a good setup then the graphics an also be amazingly beautiful.10/10
