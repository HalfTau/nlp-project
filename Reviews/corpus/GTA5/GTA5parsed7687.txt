Amazing single player.... just a shame that Online is a former shell of what it used to be....If you buy this game, buy it for the single player and the mods. DO NOT buy the Shark Cards. I gave up on them years ago. This is a pay to win economy at its worst.This is what you get for treating your customers likeTake Two....
