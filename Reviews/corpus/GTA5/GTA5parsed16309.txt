The single player story is a great experience, even though its a bit short. The main problem with this game is the multi player mode, GTA Online.Considering that you can either do a ton of boring grinding or just buy a SHARK card, GTA Online is basically a P2W game, and the fact that this game is 59.99 is a bit rediculous. Not to mention that GTA Online is also swarming with cheaters as well, and people that werent even cheating in the first place are having legitimately earned funds practically being stolen from their accounts, or getting banned outright its probably for the best anyway since this game is bad and people will eventually stop playing it. while actual cheaters are still about on the game with ludicrous amounts of money, and even modded ranks too... This just goes to show that Rockstars anti cheating system is EXTREMELY flawed, not even VAC is this bad...This games single player is simply an amazing experience, but ever since the spat with Rockstar and T2, there is now little modding support, and for an open world game like GTA where there is tons of modding potential, that was basically all dashed in an instant. And for some people, mod support is a big selling point, but this game doesnt have one. But now that I think of it, this game could benefit greatly with Steam Workshop support, as its been proven to even keep older games like Left 4 Dead 2 alive and kicking, as it is still in the most 100 popular games on Steam, and it would most likely be dead if Workshop wasnt a thing.Overall, this game truly is Mixed, and really just isnt that good. This game alone has made me not want to support Rockstar any more. To be entirely honest though, the only reason I even bought this game was for benchmarking, and writing this review...
