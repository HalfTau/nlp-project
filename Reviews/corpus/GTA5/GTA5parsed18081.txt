One of the best gaming experiences I have ever had. Absolutely loved the characters, the story, the humor, the car radio, the graphics and the gameplay. However, Im gonna have to give this a negative rating because of the fact that the multiplayer was dumbed down for the sake of microtransations, which I despise. There is nothing more I hate than  and unethical business practices like this is the gaming scene.I wanna thank the developers for making such an amazing game, but  you to the rest of the s who did all this crap.Imo, buy this game if you wanna enjoy a solo story. But if you are planning to buy this game for the online multiplayer, you are probably going to be a little disappointed. It has become a pure grind and filled with annoying noob donors. Not to mention the incredible loading times and all the hackers.
