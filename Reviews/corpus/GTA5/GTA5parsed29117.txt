i recommend this game, but it has the worst help and support out of any game ive ever played. I have been trying to get my ps4 account on my pc, so my online stats would carry over to my pc. it is unfortunate that rockstar recently removed that option. overall its a really good game, but bad help and support. if anyone knows how to transfer a ps4 character to my steam account, it would be very much appreciated. videos on this did not help, most of the options that were showed in the videos were removed by rockstar.
