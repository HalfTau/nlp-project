Rockstar has gone and started removing peoples legitimately earned money from online. Even cash earned with the purchase of shark cards only days before.I havent even played online for months, not since the Open IV/mods being removed fiasco, and I still had 95 of my cash removed from my online account because...?Well, Im still waiting an answer on that. I think most of us are.This has become a pattern by now, where Rockstar does something silly/stupid, and it takes huge playerbase outcry to even ellicit a response from them  if were lucky. And Im just tired of being a part of it.And if youre looking to buy this game, you shouldnt be a part of it either. Im not even joking or exaggerating when I say its like being in an abusive relationship. In fact, that is exactly what it is. An abusive relationship between the game company and its consumers. And this is just Rockstar were talking about here, not the rampant cheating thats going on still that will most certainly cause you problems as well.Now maybe youre just interested in the singleplayer. But the truth is that Rockstar no longer wants singleplayer to be GTA Vs selling point, but online. So even if you want to just play single player, you will only at best be getting a very limited experience of what the game actually offers.The question is less a matter of is it worth the money or not? and more of a is it worth the trouble?Is the game good? Yes. Yes it is.Is it worth the trouble? No. Im afraid not.
