Unfortunately, without mods I cannot reccommend this game. I bought it on PC primarily to be able mod it which by the way is fantastic fun, people have created so many amazing additions for singleplayer and with the CD sent to OpenIV it seems that singleplayer modding of this game may cease to exist.
