Jumping in at a later date, due to all the fuss.But I do geninly belive that the multiplayer aspect of this game is well and truely screwed. To much content is locked behind an absurdly high Paywall, including aspects of the game that make this both Pay to win and Pay to play. The singleplayer remains a truely solid game, but with regards to GTAO, the game is no longer fun to play.
