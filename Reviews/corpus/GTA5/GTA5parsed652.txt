Very fun game but theres so many micro transactions! it makes it not enjoyable with constant calls from agent 13 and lester its really annoying but minus the online factor its good like always but the online feature is more focused on by rockstar making it less fun and very costly after a long time of playing, you have to create a seprate 3rd party account and not continue to play with your steam account on Online making it more steps just to play online.
