In its current state and that they have barred users from using mods in offline singleplayer mode i would highly not recommend anymore.OnlineOther online players are usually Trolls, Hackers or general nutjobs. unless you play with 3 or more other friends would not recommend dont rely on random players for heists most of them either dont know what theyre doing or just troll youA Lot of stuff is far too expensive ingame to actually pay without sharkcards moneygrabtactics I mean the Yachts seriously from 8mil with no upgrades?Traffic is too aggressive, AI is sometimes far too easy but mostly overpowered as heck.Game is starting to get highly repetative, and the RandomEvents on jobs I.e. when on biker jobs come too often, and you often arrive and run out of time because the event starts when your on the other side of the map in a slow car. thanks Rockstar
