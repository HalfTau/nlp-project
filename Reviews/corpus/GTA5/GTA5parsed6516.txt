I came from PS3 so I have a good amount of time in GTA, Online too, but since the last few updates everything is just too expensive, Im a casual gamer, I dont have a huge amount of free time and I like to play in freemode. I know its stupid to say but jobs dont have much replay value and Heists arnt playable if you dont have a lot of friends to play with. Randoms are just lvl 120 idiots that dont know how to handle a gun. so earning money is to hard and when I finally had like 7/8 million dollars, Rockstar comes along and takes it because It was obtained by modding. great service Rockstar...
