Grand Theft Auto 5 is a good game. But Rockstar  Take Two are completely messing it up. Only new content for online playing GTA ONLINE Single player is still as it was on release. Bring the new content to SP to!!!!! They removed legit modding completely from the game.At this moment. Wont buy the next title!If Rockstar would solve this things. Im gladly to put it back to positive!Dont get me wrong. I dont like hackers and hack mods. But legit modding was awesome...
