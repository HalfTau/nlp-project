GTA V has an incredible good single player story with a lot to discover.You have to like the system of splitting chars into three but its alright in my opinion.Hands down for multiplayer you have to grind WEEKS! for one car, or buy Ingame Money with Real Money.This is one trend I really dont like in our gaming society today and it gets worse.Also Multiplayer is packed with cheaters and Rockstar doesnt want to? do sth against it.With banning singleplayer mods, the Company shot itself.GG Take Two  Rockstar, that was Harakiri.
