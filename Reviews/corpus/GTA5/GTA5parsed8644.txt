The long wait has been worth it. If youre a PC gamer whos spent the last eighteen months envying the console crowd while they all got stuck into the latest, greatest GTA, then rest assured that you can now play the definitive version. Sure, the Xbox One and PS4 versions were amazing, delivering GTA 5 at higher resolutions with more detailed textures, smoother surfaces, better lighting and cool depth of field effects see our full review below, but the PC version offers even more enhancements plus a couple of additional features that play to the PCs strengths. In doing so, it adds a few more metres to one of gamings towering achievements.Having covered the game twice already, we wont go too far into the detail of what makes GTA 5 so good. Partly, its a question of experience. With four previous 3D GTAs under its belt plus Red Dead Redemption, Bully and assorted DLC packs, Rockstar has had time to refine its vision for open world gameplay and its systems, and GTA 5 has the best driving, the best shooting and some of the best mission design of the series.Its also a question of structure. Dividing the action amongst three protagonists with three interlocking storylines and three distinctive flavours means you nearly always have the option to flick from Michaels ageing career criminal saga to Franklins ambitious hoodlum story to Trevors crazed, amoral brand of mayhem, where the dumb, cathartic slapstick violence we all  deep down  love GTA for finds its natural home. With repeated play, it only becomes clearer how well all three tales mesh thematically with Rockstars savage satirical take on the Californian dream.i may have copy and pasted it
