This game is really bad on the pc platform, not only do you get banned almost instantly for no reason but the anti cheat system is so easy to fix that its dumb, they could just get an anti cheat that checks your files for something that shouldnt be there and give you a warning, or get battle eye FOR FREE. yes, battle eye is free and its a good anti cheat but rockstar doesnt listen, dont play gta online unless its a private lobby with friends.
