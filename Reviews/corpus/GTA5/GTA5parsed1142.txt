This is how GTA V is designed. If you wish to just go killing anyone this is the game for you, if you wish to try and do businesses to get money or doing jobs this game is not for you. Someone with a higher level or better buildings and equipment will always have the upper hand over you. Either using a rocket bike to shoot you with a fly by or use and Orbital cannon to destoy you while doing shipments or restocking. Thus if you a person who thrives on killing others for little to no gain you will enjoy your time playing online, whereas you a person who enjoys collecting and building yourself up to enjoy the game with mates its a terrible idea.
