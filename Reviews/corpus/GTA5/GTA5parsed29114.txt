Do not get this game. The online experience is a cess pool of hackers and paytowinners who make it impossible for you to do anything late or end game. In its current state there is no reason to play, if you want to have fun. Rockstar has made it very apparent that they dont care about their playerbases well being or gameplay experience. It has become glaringly obvious that Rockstar is only in it for the money made from GTA Online, and nothing else. If they cared about their players, they would do something about the overwhelming grind to gain in game money, XP, the endless modders/hackers in every lobby, and the massive gap between F2P and P2W players.
