I bought GTAV twice, once for PS4 and once for PC. I wouldnt buy a game again if it wasnt good. I dont like GTA Online, so single player does it for me. The reason I bought it? Because I wanted to play the story again, but like so many others to get those insane graphics and cool cars everyone has with the use of mods. So from the heart of a seasoned GTA player started with GTA top down FUDGE YOU TAKE 2. You are money hungry s and have no love for video games whatsoever. Nothing but love for R though, you guys still rock!
