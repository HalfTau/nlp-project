I have bought this game 3 times Fme right?. I Preordered it on 360, bought it again first day for Xbox One. And bought it for PC after about a month of the release. I bought it for PC for the specific purpose of playing harmless single player mods. But since being released for PC, Rockstar and TakeTwo have put up road blocks to the modding community. Including recently sending a Cease and Desist to Open IV. DO NOT buy this game on PC if you intend on enjoying mods in Single Player. DO NOT buy this game on PC if you intend on enjoying their own multiplayer either. They have attempted and failed to clean up the cheating mods on their own Online. You can and will get caught in their attempts to police the rampant money modding whether youre guilty of it yourself or just an innocent bystander. They cant stop the Grief Modders from ruining your online play but they can stop you from enjoying the work of the modding community in Single Player. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC. Full Stop.
