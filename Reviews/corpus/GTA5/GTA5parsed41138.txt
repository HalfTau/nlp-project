Singleplayer has been fully ignored, none of the promised DLCs have come to fruition. If youre buying GTAV for the singleplayer, keep in mind very little of the multiplayer content is available for you to use. Getting 100 hours of gameplay ouf of just the singleplayer is really only feasable with modding, andSo what of online? The online mode GTAO is entirely focused around microtransactions, i.e. selling ingame currency to you via Shark Cards. They do this by restricting the largest sources of income to specific missions and gamemodes that get incredibly repetitive and boring. Grinding for money is inconsistent at best unless you have a solid team to play with often or a lot of time on your hands.Online DLCthe only DLC that has been released for the gameis incredibly overpriced to the point of being paywalled and requires a lot of time, effort, and money to get even the most basic of fun out of it, despite being marketed as free additions to the game.The combat, races, and other modes are all balanced in the favor of those that can afford the most powerful items, which also happen to be the most expensive.GTAV has sold over 75 million copies.Is this even satire anymore?
