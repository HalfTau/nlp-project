You dont own this game... You only borrow it. You cannot play this game how you want it. You will use this product the way the Parent Company of Rockstar wants you to use it. Why are you keeping us from using YOUR product that WE buy the way WE want to? A bucket is meant to hold things, but if I want to go buy a damn bucket to use as a hat the makers of the bucket wont threaten to ban me from using buckets.
