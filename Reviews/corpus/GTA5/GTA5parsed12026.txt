I think that consumers frusturations with the GTA Online have caused people to forget how amazing of a singleplayer experience this game is.The quality of voice acting and writing in this game is incredible.The amount of detail put into the game is insane.The combat is very fluid and fun.Driving is better than in any other nonracing game I have played.This is truly one of my personal 10/10 games. It is only about 4050 hours long, but every single second of it is teeming with quality.
