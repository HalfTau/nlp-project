EDIT After R has listened to our complaints, Single Player modding is back! I hearby change my review to a rightous upturned thumb! Thanks R!Before I was all likeR killed themselves by banning Single Player modding. Ive spent a lot of time on the game and genuinely enjoy it, but now I feel betrayed. Oh well, I just bought Arma 3, screw R, our relationship is over.
