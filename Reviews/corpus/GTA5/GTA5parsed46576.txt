The only reason I played this game was to use mods. I gave you 60 and you throw it back into my face.Your online content is a joke, its full of microtransactions, impossible to make money, and the only new content is a few new cars and repetitive missions. No new map expansions, just simple missions and maybe a new interior once a year.The cars are all very similar, and there are about 6 different interiors in the whole game. Why exactly a car made my Karin has the same interior as a car made by Blista I dont know, but to me it shows not a lot of effort went into vehicle design.ALL these problems can be affected by mods, which are now being banned by R and T2.
