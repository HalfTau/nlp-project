Heres the thing, right. I used to be an avid modder of the singleplayer. LSPDFR, a plethora of vehicle mods, etc. I havent played this game in a long while, and for good reason. Its just not fun singleplayer wise. Sure, you have that run around and kill stuff aspect, but other than that, the game isnt all that deep. Modding really brought the world to a whole new level, and when Im unable to do that, I lose all interest in the game.The multiplayer aspcet is fine, its fun, but takes a lot of grinding to get to the really cool and fun things. However, a lot of people have been getting wrongly banned. Be weary.I dont reccomend this game. Its just too much hastle and not enough fun.
