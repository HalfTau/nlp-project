The uniqueness of Grand Theft Auto V on PC is its flexibility. You can change it to your taste. But instead Rockstar decided to pull an ultimately bad move and give us the finger to the PC community. This is why I bought your game Rockstar, to enjoy the masterpiece you created and build upon it to even further my enjoyment. I even thought that you might have created a workshop to support singleplayer modding. But I guess you took us for granted.
