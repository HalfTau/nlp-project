I bought GTA purely for mods. I like many others bought it THREE times. Im sorry Take Two if I havent already spent enough money on your game and your multiplayer is a micro transaction hell hole. honestly its a good game but you cant expext people to spend 40 on your games 3 times and not be angry when you give the modding comunity a cease and desist just so you can have more people playing multiplayer
