The only reason I bought this game for the PC is because of the ability to mod the SP version NOT Online of the game and play around with all the real life car models that great modders/artists created.Unfortunately Take Two/Rockstar CDed the popular Single Player only modding tool OpenIV and therefore I would not recommend buying this game as they effectively destroyed the Single Player modding community.They reapproved and allowed the OpenIV mod so changed it into thumbsup.
