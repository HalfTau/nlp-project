Singleplayer is a lot of fun. Multiple characters that each have their own story. Most heists/missions can be played in multiple ways each with their own benefits. Shame about the promise of singleplayer dlc that was made in 2013/14 and to this day still hasnt been released.Multiplayer is only recomendable if you have friends to play with or are willing to search for people to play with. Since atleast from my experience playing gta online alone is far from interesting. There are quite a lot of free dlc added to gta online but most of them are just items like cars, airplanes, buildings etc. And require you to either pay money or grind for ingame cash. Every mission is kind of fun to begin with but after you played them a few times for rp or cash the boredom kicks in. The one dlc that doesnt require too much of a grind to start is the heists dlc and those heists are without doubt worth your time.For 30 bucks this game is definitely worth it even after all this time. The singleplayer on its own is absolutly incredible and the multiplayer is fun with friends. Though it does suffer from hackers. This game gets afrom me.
