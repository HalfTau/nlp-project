The game at its roots had potential, but then Rockstar and Take Two figured out that they could make more money by adding pretty skins and a hard grind to the game than giving the players a fair progression. Now the game has fallen into chaos with high levels with miniguns and armored vehicles killing people who only have m9s. Its a crying shame that the came had to come to this but thats what happens when a game becomes a cash grab.
