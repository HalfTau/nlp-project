The single player campaign is quite a fresh approach with you playing as three main characters.Story 4/5Its the cliche one last job story line of one mans mid life crisis.Design 5/5Vehicles, clothes, npcs, and most of all world design. All of these things on such a massive scale really shows us why triple A open world games are only produced by massive studios. It is something people will use as a reference for years to come.Mechanics 4/5Weapons are satisfying to use and vehicles are nice to operate. The most infuriating thing is just the sluggish character movements during combat. However, overall it is quite refined.Online servers 0/5Servers are p2p. Yes. Hosted by one of the idiots in the session. Yes. ing so many latency problems caused by bad connections. Widespread hacking with no effective anticheat in place because original game doesnt have one and obviously serverside anticheat cant be implemented.Oh and this is what causes the endless cloud simulator situations. Complete and utter garbage network connections to the host.Online gameplay 1/5Grindfest. Heists and set ups will wipe constantly because of some ing idiot dying for the nth time in a row or some  leaves. This prevents you from getting any cash at all to get to the better cash farming methods, which then prevents you from really enjoying the unlockable content.You could waste hours of your life grinding or just pay some guy 2 usd to get a billion in game cash.Overall 3/5TLDR The entire game is propped up on an amazing single player experience. If you have 3 other friends that want to play  online as much as you do, this game becomes a 5/5 for you.I will not recommend this game because rockstar and take2 are Shark cards are priced at insane rates and heist payouts are really low because they want to sell them. Not to mention the vehicles are damn expensive too, all because they want people to buy shark cards.Suing openinv doesnt really help either.They never ing learn.
