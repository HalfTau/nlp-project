I was recklessly driving in my car one cold winter evening. I felt lonely, lost, like something was missing. I decided to listen to the radio, in search of anything that could make me feel again, but nothing seemed right. Not until I found the song Money come and money go by the infamous artist Lee PerryI had never heard something so beautiful, so deep before. Something we can all relate to.Money come and money go... but I remain!
