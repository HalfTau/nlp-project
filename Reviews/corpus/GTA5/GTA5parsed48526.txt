A message to The Beautiful GTA Modding Community I know your eyes in the morning sunI feel you touch me in the pouring rainAnd the moment that you wander far from meI wanna feel you in my arms againAnd you come to me on a summer breezeKeep me warm in your love then you softly leaveAnd its me you need to showHow deep is your loveHow deep is your love,How deep is your loveI really mean to learnCause were living in a world of foolsBreaking us downWhen they all should let us beWe belong to you and meI believe in youYou know the door to my very soulYoure the light in my deepest darkest hourYoure my saviour when I fallAnd you may not thinkI care for youWhen you know down insideThat I really doAnd its me you need to showHow deep is your loveHow deep is your love,How deep is your loveI really mean to learnCause were living in a world of foolsBreaking us downWhen they all should let us beWe belong to you and meAnd you come to me on a summer breezeKeep me warm in your love then you softly leaveAnd its me you need to showHow deep is your loveHow deep is your love,How deep is your loveI really mean to learnCause were living in a world of foolsBreaking us downWhen they all should let us beWe belong to you and meRepeat fading outCopyright property of the BeeGees probably still?I found the lyrics on a website plz dont sue me.....plz I beg mercy of you..
