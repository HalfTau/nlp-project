Did you think GTA 4 is the worst game of whole series? NO! GTA 5 is much WORSE! This is surprisingly stupid game with ultimately terrible online mode. Story mode? Just play one time and forget forever  its very far from masterpiece. Gameplay? Car physics is not good, damage model is very strange, etc.Online? It does not worth the money paid for the game. Very monotonic gameplay, lack of missions, not just unfriendly players but highest concentration of cheaters/haxors in freeroam session, stripped down gameplay, player is strongly relied on farming and/or microtransactions hello, korean MMORPGs!, bans for nothing or just for being victim of cheaters whereas cheaters are not banned in most cases. I know even case when player was banned for official Criminal Mastermind achievement because technical support decided 10 million bonus from achievement is too much, inadequate technical support... And this is just a peak of an iceberg! The only way to play online mode in GTA 5 is to play with trusted friends, but there is still no guarantee to dont get ban in future.Mods? Forget about mods. TakeTwo and Rockstar decided that any player has no rights to modify game, and in future they can even harm ordinary players for mods  they already do it with developers of modding tools.I can give only one advice about this game DONT BUY IT! And i dont recommend to buy any next game from Rockstar and TakeTwo. A lot of players bought GTA 5, they made The most selling game real for Rockstar. How players were rewarded for this? Only with a spittle in the face.
