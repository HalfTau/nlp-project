The online is a joke anyone thinks otherwise should play gta IV or any other online gta game before shutting this point down. Making money is the most difficult thing in the game. Sure they keep milking the game with addons but i cant even play the addons because of money. I could pay 20100 more to get the money but thats not logical when i could just get a new game that has some what the same things in it. better yet play GTA IV because it doesnt require you to play for 100 hours to get a tank or jet and everyone has equal access to a tank and jet. Not to point out the mods make the graphics on par with this game. somthing this game cant do. unless you want to play alone but wheres the fun in that? I understand its unfair if somone has infinet health is unfair but changing the graphics isnt. open IV cant be sued since they arnt infringing on any rights they only supply a software for free no cash needed it should be held agents people who use it for not the intended use. So yeah  You Rock Star.
