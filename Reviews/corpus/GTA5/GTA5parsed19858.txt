ALL MODS BANNED! Just to start yes all mods even single player mods are banned,but on a bright side no more online modders, well not nearly as much im sure some fly under the raidar, pretty much everything is now legit online no more free modded money or RP, its as the game was intended,sure it can cost an arm and anif you dont like putting in time,but if thats you and you dont like to work online for that money or spend real money on shark cards,and your looking at this game cause of the cool mods that used to be able to have that was awesome in single player like the flash mod or zombie mod then yea its banned, now idk if maybe there a way to go around the ban but as far as i know thats that. now me yes i was like others and had modded money i had no control of but i was not banned nor was my player erased or reset,so i guess it worked out for me but i RECOMMEND it because now ONLINE is actully fun since nobody is giving out all the free money and you have to do all the epic missions to actully earn the money,like heists, prison breaks and bank robberys or racing sexycars thats what makes it fun.
