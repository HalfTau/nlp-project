As a singleplayer game sure there are some nice parts to it but the online mode is broken and only wants your money. Its also clear that they have no care for the fans as they have banned modding which was one of the best features of singleplayer and now the game is pretty much dead. Maby now they will stop wasting their time making updates and release a new game. I do NOT suggest this as a full price game or even with 50 off. Also you can do barely anything on Online without friends playing with your or shark cards.
