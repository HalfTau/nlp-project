Single player is fine on its own, but great with mods, which are now de facto banned. Multiplayer is full of microtransactions and grindy missions which pay almost nothing, and everything is overpriced to force people to buy the microtransactions. MP can be fun with friends, but unless you feel like grinding mission after mission after mission to be able to afford anything, its not worth it. Theyve ruined most of the fun parts of MP out of greed, and now theyve screwed over SP as well by banning mods. Do not buy this game.
