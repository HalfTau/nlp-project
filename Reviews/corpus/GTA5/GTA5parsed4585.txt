Well what can I say. I originally bought GTA V when it came out for the PS3. The single player was great and the online play was fun until Rockstar said they will no longer provide the updates to PS3. Fast forward to now, I figured I would pick up GTA for my PC cause the price seemed right and from what I read Rockstar had fixed the multiplayer modding. Well it would seem, that it is still happening. When I was about to complete a mission, all of a sudden where ever I stepped, flames would shoot out of the ground like the flames shooting out of a propane tank that was shot in the game. I was prepared to play the game and do the grind to get caught up to other players, but not when modders make the game so unenjoyable. Hopefully Rockstar will have a better handle on their multiplayer ecosystem in future games.
