I am  a GTA user whoi thinks that game it self is a great game. however all i have got now is you are banned............... foreever for buying 200 worth shark cards. I was banned for metting a hacker.... I dint recieve any money but i was locked up in a cage like a dog in the middle of the strip club....... every time i commited suicide i was teleported right back..... and when i turned off the game and opened the the game 3 days later I was never able to........................ So please take a note of this
