Now that take two has pussied out, I can review this game positively, but there are so many problems...Solo is awesome and you wont get disappointed, but GTAOnline.... My god...First the grind is super real, if you want to have everything included in every dlc thats coming which are free btw you have to spend 10millions each time. THats a lot of money and money does not grow easy. Playing with friends is stupid because only the richest will get more money while the poorest will win 5000  every 10 minutes.The only way to make money is to already have some, thats the problem of the game.
