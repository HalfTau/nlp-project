This was a great game. But, the rise of overpriced additions to the online mode, and the successful attempt at dousing the creativity of anyone trying to bring new life into the singleplayer mode, which has been neglected for so long, so that Rockstar and TakeTwo Interactive could squeeze more money out of the player base, has brought this game to a most awful demise. I still play this game, but for a minimal amount of time. All of my friends used to play this game, and it would be a centre of interaction between us. But now, most of us have become mainly disinterested, and the only ones who still play it, are those among us who can afford the additions to the online mode.This downfall is what greed, and an obsession with money, can do in business, and most importantly, in gaming.
