You want to ban mod from single player and then go off ing about how multiplayer is getting attacked by all these hackers witch Take Two and Rockstar games never do anything about and then wants to attack OpenIV witch has been helping the modding community for years now and even Rockstar Games has recommend to its player and the modding world and it upsets me that the developers of this game would be these low to it players and the community just because they want to make more money at the end of the day hopefully Take Two and Rockstar Games will listen to the community and get there head out of therebr
