I bought this game to mod, I didnt pirate this game. I Bought it, I say that because the only focus the developers want is online mode. here is an idea, instead of ing over the people who bought your game, if you want to make money online with microtransactions why not just make a new play for free version? sounds bad but honestly some games thrive, If people bought the product, they should not be punished. In regards to piracy, it is a big problem but mod tools dont allow you to pirate a game. the whole thing is sour. on behalf of myself, openiv and all the players you have screwed over I do not recommend this game or any other game take two publishes.
