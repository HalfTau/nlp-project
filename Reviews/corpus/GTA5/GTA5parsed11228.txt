For a game with such high graphics, its amazing how low the system requirements are.The singleplayer mode is great, and its very different from the other GTA games because you have more characters to play with, and they each have their own story and special abilities.I cant say the same for online though. It is plagued by tryhards, toxic children and people who just like to see the world burn. If you are a person who cannot tolerate this kind of nonsense, I dont suggest that you buy this game.
