After playing GTA V for about 2500 hours across 3 platforms, I can say that it is worth buying if you are looking for lots of fun with friends. There is no other game alike.However,Rockstar are money grabbing scum and dont care about the community. If you intend to play online, expect to have to grind for hours on end for content which rockstar purposely overprices.Also, dont buy shark cards
