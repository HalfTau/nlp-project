Ive thought for a long time that this game was somewhat overrated. Yes the singleplayer had a TON of stuff to offer, but once completing the main storyline, I lost interest completely. I tried multiplayer and had an unpleasant experience, and am personally surprised that people were able to keep playing the game as long as they did. But now that I hear that T2 has shut down some of the modding scene, well, GG. I always did dislike you GTA. Hopefully now well see less  GTA V youtubers and see more people branch off to other games.
