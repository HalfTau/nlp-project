Ok so i got suspended, big deal ill wait but then i read oh yea all that stuff u got  it yea well delete that. im a modder. the only reason i mod is to make others happy because 100 real money will get you know where because its only gives you 8 mil when most dlc are 25mil60mil if you want upgrades and features. if you wanna suspend modders from regular go ahead but at least have servers that are for modders only and modders can only join these servers. i dont wanna spend 60 for the game and not get to have fun. if your gonna have the dlcs cost some much at least make the missions worth the time and give more than ing 20,000 for a damn mission.  gta online im just not gonna play it that should fix my problem u
