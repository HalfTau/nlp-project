FINALLY! They are doing something about the hackers, the so called moddersIgnore all the little cry babies mad that they cant go into god mode in ANY Multiplayer game session and just troll the crap outta people by killing them with explosions, or dropping bigvehicles/structures along all of the roads, or want attention from people by giving out free cash via modding. Get the FK outta here with that bs.Now I know there are some people who were doing actual good mods and it does suck for them, but the majority, the MASSIVE MAJORITY of thoseabout this OpenIV closure are actual troll hack modders. Years later, I can FINALLY do some more Online Play.
