Good game, I personally enjoyed both the SP and MP experience though I only play with friends because of the presence of hackers and masskillers in public lobbies. I was gonna wait and see about the whole OpenIV debaucle, so I wasnt going to write a nasty review whining about the removal of thirdparty mod software if the decision was going to be reversed later. Yall need to take a step back and look at the full picture here instead of just impulsively writing negative reviews. I hate shady business practices like everyone else, probably moreso, but I think its time that people forgive Rockstar and stop leaving negative reviews that give the impression this game is bad. Its not. Its a good game made by a company who has made mistakes. I enjoy it. Millions of people enjoy it. Besides, GTA didnt always have modding. Wasnt it fun then? Im not saying that mods should be removed, but you cant tell me that because of the removal of OpenIV the game is no longer fun to play entirely.
