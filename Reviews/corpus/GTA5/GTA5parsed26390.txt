Rockstar created a beautiful world with great mechanics. Even the assets like vehicles and everything inhabiting Los Santos are the best gaming has has to offer. But from there it falls flat... Singleplayer is great for what it is  but it lacks endgame content and uses like 10 of what the world has to offer. You feel that it was created for extensions that never followed. But the worst ist GTAO... I wont mind the grind to build up money, I think it is nicely balanced to put thought in how you invest your money. But it is essentially broken with hackers running wild and no one to stop them. Now they finally take action  but how? They limit the possibilities of legit players and take away the base for a healthy modding community, while hackers are still grieving freemode. Modding is the Reason why games HalfLife and Skyrim are still played today. Rockstar decided to trash their customers for a quick cashgrab. The gaming community never forgets and almost never forgives...
