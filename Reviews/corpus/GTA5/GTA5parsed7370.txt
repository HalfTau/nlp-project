The developers of the game only care about money they are selfish loathsome creatures thats customer service doesnt do jack to help you in any way ive seen so many bad despite the game having anything good they also have toxic players who ban you if you get teleported into a modders car when you dont want to they dont regulate the modders that take away your hard earned cash and when they do, its too late i really wanted to add my personal frusterations in there but its uneeded this is enough, if you dont have any problems risking your money go and get this game but be warned they will screw you hard no exceptions no excuses.
