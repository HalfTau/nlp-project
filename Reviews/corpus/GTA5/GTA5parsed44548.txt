 thisgame. Take Two Interactive and Rockstar Games have completely killed the game by taking away modding. They only care about taking our money from our pockets so that we may buy more of their overpriced online cars, jets, boats, or guns. DO NOT buy this game.The game was only truly fun when modders spawned in money in the online portion of the game as to buy any of the new cars or other vehicles in the game, you would have to play hundreds of heists or die trying to get money by people who have forked over hundreds of real dollars.
