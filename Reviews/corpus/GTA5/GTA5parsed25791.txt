I was starting to think R and T2 maybe werent so bad with them ceasing the fight against OpenVI. While not playing with singleplayer mods myself, I at least took it as a nice gesture. Unfortunetly two of my friends were banned from online yesterday and had their characters, that they have been building since the oldgen days, wiped for no reason and yes Im sure they werent modders, making me stop playing as I see no reason to build up my online character only for it to be randomly deleted. So in short do not buy this game, at least not for its multiplayer, because you will only find almost every lobby plagued with cheaters and then get banned instead of them. Good job R!
