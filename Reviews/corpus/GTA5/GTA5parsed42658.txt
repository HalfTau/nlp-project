Its really not Rockstars fault that Take Two stopped Modding. So it is kinda dumb to be reviewing it on Steam. Its not going to get their attention.But my words to Take Two will be. Why the hell would you make Modding Illegal? I would understand if you ban it from Online and make it harder to Mod but banning Singleplayer modding is just plain stupid. After all of this time of GTA Modding you decide to now make it Illegal. You think this will be making you more money but its really not. Most people buy GTA on PC just to mod it in the first place. But now they cant so you will be losing more hate and supporters. Good Luck CIm making this a negative review because they are making Online a PaytoWin or a WasteAllYourLifeToGetGoodShit game. The only way to buy anything in these DLCs require you to either buy Shark Cards or play way too much. New Players will be able to get the latest DLC 10 DLCs later.
