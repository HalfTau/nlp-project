Update 2 Modding might be back but for how long? Take Two has lost my trust and my support. I wont be changing my recommendation for this game or getting any future games from them. Sad really, I was looking forward to Red Dead Redemption 2. Oh well, Ill find something else to play.Update Reported for moddability tag. With the ban on OpenIV modding is no longer a proper tag for this game.Greedy company ruins game. Goodbye GTA5, and goodbye Take Two, I wont be supporting you anymore.
