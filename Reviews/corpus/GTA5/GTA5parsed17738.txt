For whatever reason, Rockstar has taken money out of my ingame account three times now. The first was due to hackers spawning money, which I can understand, but the second two times they have removed legitimately earned money. I tried to reach out to Rockstar, and they sent me a cookiecutter response about cheating, which I have never cheated in this game. Uninstalled this game for good. Rockstars servers are terrible, from issues with hackers ruining the game to their lack of customer service. They will let thisgo on for months at a time with absolutely no fix, and then punish the majority of legitimate players.
