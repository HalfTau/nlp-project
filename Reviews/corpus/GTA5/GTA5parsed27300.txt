With the incredibly high chance to get banned for little to no reason on GTA Online, and having no way of appealing the ban. And the recent decision to eliminate all modding tools and sites. Rockstar is making some really stupid moves when it comes to GTA V and I feel that it will just make their next GTA a huge steaming piece of crap that will most likely require you to be connected to the internet 24/7.
