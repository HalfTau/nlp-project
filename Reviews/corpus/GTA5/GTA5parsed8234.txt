Yes, I decide to play GTA V today but when I logged in, it couldt start. Then I decide to go to their website and look under support and they ask me to uninstall the social club so I did it .... After doing that I cant start the game at all and they are ING indifferent when I wrote to them. I get the answer that I can go into their support website do you think I ING has done it. Its ING what started the problem so its literally 60 euro out of the ING window DONT buy it. They have a lot of good ideas but when it dosent work, there is NO ING help to get ING Rockstar.
