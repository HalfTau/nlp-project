The online portion of the game has become a microtransaction hellhole. Every server has someone in a jet or vigilante harassing some random player killing them over and over again while the player asks them to just go away.the only options at that point are. 1 Play for an unresonable amount of time to grind away the money needed to purchase the same OP godware to compete against those harassing you. 2 Spend real life money to do the same thing. the batmobile alone is almost as much as the game itself, so microtransaction might not be the most appropriate term. Or 3, just quit.12 are rhetorical. So 3 is the only real option. So dont buy this game.
