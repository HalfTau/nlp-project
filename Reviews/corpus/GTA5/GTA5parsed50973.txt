Poured hundreds of hours into this game, bought it twice once for consoles, the other for PC, and even bought a few shark cards. It is absolutely phenomenal. But Rockstar decided to double down on its anti modding policies essentially giving the community the middle finger. I will not forgive them for this. Also GTA Online is still plagued with hackers. Its been 2 years and nothing has been done about it. You would think developers have learned their lesson from the shenengians that Activision pulled with COD and that Bethesda tried pulling with Skyrim but nope. No matter how much reputation or credibility you think you may have with the gaming community, we will not forgive such disrespect nor will we back down on this stance. Absolutely not.Therefore I strongly DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone. DO NOT BUY.Rockstar, switch your policies on modding and Ill switch this review back to positive.
