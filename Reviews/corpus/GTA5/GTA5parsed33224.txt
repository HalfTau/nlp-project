Game looks good and was fun for a long time. Even tough most of that time went into watching loadscreens with the worst music ever.Loading times are long enough for me to make something to eat, got to work, get back home, eat again, start another game while GTA  is still loading, have a good night with friends in other games and eating again.The Menu is probably the worst ive ever seen.If I want a private session for MP, I have to go back to Singleplayer and start it from there.If i wanna  switch my Character and want to be in a private session, I have to press switch character loading time after wich it throws me into some random session again insane loading time. So i have to go to singleplayer loading time and then start my private session again loading time.If you want something nice in Multiplayer, get ready to grind some money in the same mission over and over again. Or you can just BUY MONEY. Im serious, buy money for a game that allready costs 60.So, you pay about 15 for a car that costs 1.25m. And you didnt even get the chance to customize it.Also, singleplayer gets boring after about 6H when the story is done. And no, its not easy to mod the game anymore since the DEVS actually think that this was a good idea.Please dont buy that game. If you still wanna play it. Crack it somewhere and go for Singleplayer. Multiplayer sucks.
