I enjoyed GTA San Andreas and GTA Vice City in my time. I played the bazinga out of GTA San Andreas Multiplayer Which wasnt even official may I add. After seeing the BETTER and even NICER way the MODDERS dealt with multiplayer I am really disappointed with the way the developers dealt with GTA online. A full onon a stick.You launch the game, the logos and the rights claim whatever. You will become accustomed to this sight after spending countless hours trying to LOAD ONLINE. Every choice to join a lobby, join a heist, EVERYTHING requires a loading screen. Oh, you were joining the session but the host began to play? Pff, maybe you want to spectate? No? Well then have this ed up loading screen that never loadsand makes you CTRL  ALT  DELETE and remove GTA 5 from tasks.Booting up the game again. Ah, a fresh start! Nope, spend 57 minutes waiting until you load online again. Oh great, I am in! Hmm, whats this invite I have got? Lets try it!Proceeds to fail mission twice and everyone votes to continue. Which just brings you back to freemode. Oh, another loading screen... thats... understandable. Hm? Whats this? Cant connect to session and want me to return to my story mode? Ehm, sure... Reconnect back and have to restart game again.Hello logos! How I miss you, NOT. Okay, this time. This time this will work. PRESS ONLINE. WAITING. WAITING.OOPS DIED OF OLD AGE, DO YOU WANT TO RETURN TO STORY MODE?.On the other hand, the story mode seems fine and wonderful. Nice working and characters. I love the GTA universes but SPARE YOUR MONEY if you want to play online. Its a load of3/10. Not a real critic but no one cares.
