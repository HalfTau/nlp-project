I bought this game for the full price when it first launched on PS3seeing the modding community has grown rapidly throughout the years made me buy the steam version on a salebut for some  from ing shark cards, greedy Take Two decided to take down what made me bought GTA V on PC, I am saddened by this action and how Take Two has treated the community whom are trying to make their game lasts, for example, I wouldnt have bought FalloutNV if it werent for the mods, the game would be long dead by now if Bethesda did what Take Two did to the staff of OpenIV.
