Update OpenIVs CD has been recalled. But that doesnt change the fact that this is a desperate attempt to maintain profit, as is ingame economy inflation. the attitude is all still there so its an empty gesture.Rockstar Games and TakeTwo Interactive were relatively small before the modding community of GTA San Andreas exploded. Since then hundreds of singleplayer only mods have extended the longevity and enjoyability and been promoted by Rockstar themselves, and the partnership has become a AAA powerhouse whose community is largely made up of that same community dedicated to Singleplayer mods. Now in an effort to pour that playerbase into GTA Online, which Rockstar themselves have stated is focused on profit over playability and contains a hyperinflated economy which forces constant dedication or literal hundreds of real dollars through microtransactions, TakeTwo and Rockstar have taken brazen, morally decripit legal action against the OpenIV team, whose tools have been constructed down to Russian copyright standards and meticulously made to prevent abuse of the game or modification of its online counterparts, with the contrived excuse that the tools and communties using them are purposefully tailored to abuse Rockstars online games and profits. This behaviour is inexcusable and until Rockstars and TakeTwos gross negligence is resolved in a manner deemed satisfactory by the community, I will no longer use or support Rockstar and TakeTwo services and encourage others to sign the petition calling for reparations at.TLDR Go eat a boat you contemptible scrooges.
