This installment might create mixed feelings, but what it does deliver on is GTA content, regardless of you agreeing or not.First off, the free roaming might feel more limited, however you get more detail on the fly. GTA San Andreas had a wider area to offer, but with limited area to roam albeit still a big area, youll definitely get more bang for the buck. GTA IV? Yeah, its probably on line with that franchise, albeit even there, might be smaller.Missions are pretty good, and you WILL get challenged. No worries. The storyline makes good sense, and it doesnt throw you off in the middle of nowhere like Vice City and especially GTA IV could at some points, losing some ends here and there. That sucked.Firstperson mode. Yes. You heard me. Thats seriously an awesome idea!What sucks? The police. In single player mode they have been tuned up so high that any small mistake will have you wasted in mere seconds. In online mode which youll probably be playing the most anyway, they have been tuned a bit down to the levels of GTA IV police, albeit a bit better AI. They have brains  trust me.You get bang for the buck. However the poop detail You are facing a huge price. Sadly. Otherwise, if you can get it for cheap, you are looking at an awesome game....What, cheaters? Well no, you know Valve doesnt have cheaters in neither their games nor the franchises they sell on their website. Kappa
