This game is so fantastic, fun and adventurous in Story Mode.When youre playing online it takes forever to get something done, everything costs way too much to keep a good budget and there are so many ways of raging in the game.I started playing online a few weeks ago, I have my own club and business, got a weed farm and 2 warehouses. The weed farm takes ages to fill I started it a week ago and it isnt full. And you need to pretty much wait until everybody has left the session to feel safe enough to make deals with the special cargo.Then again, the game is really rich on opportunities, which is probably why people still play it, but dont get your hopes up.I did, and I regret it.
