Lets not talk about single player.Single player is fine and i liked it.lets talk about online. IT SUCKS the endokay no seriously it is full of bugs and HACKERS. the grind is TOO much so people hack simple. Games that the whole game is BASED on grind warframe have less grind that this f.Whats the point of waiting for your game to load 1020min and when you log in you realise it is bugged and you have to restart the game.Im not the only one experiencing these problems , friends of mine do as well.I know nobody cares about online because its a pretty much old dead game , they got their money they dont simply care
