Probably one of the best games Ive ever played. Gameplay wise, this game is great and has been that since its release. I think that problems within the community with people like hackers and whatnot causeing confusing within rockstar, causing them to accidentally do the wrong thing to the wrong people, makes this game sound worse than it is. If none of those problems were a normal occurance, then I think this game would have a much higher rating than it does.
