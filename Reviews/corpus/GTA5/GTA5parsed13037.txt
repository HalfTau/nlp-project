Each mission online nets you an average of 10K per play. The DLC vehicles they add are usually upwards of 4 million. Each month they come out with vehicles more overpowered than the last. Like an invicible batmobile with rockets, and some b turbo boost You can try to play CEO missions, but you will inevidably die to these vehicles and lose your still poor payout. The only way to succeed in this game is to spend 10x its value on shark cards, that might earn you a months DLC. Do not buy, unless they remove shark cards.
