GTA V is pretty good..For the console. This PC Version of GTA V is an excuse for Rockstar to earn some extra cash. Customer Service sucks, as all they do is ignore you.Here are some Pros and ConsProsGraphics are incredibleYou can actually install mods to make singleplayer funSounds a little bit better.ConsAll lobbies have cheaters and little kids that spam the N word multiple timesCant play a normal lobby without being killed by a random explosive from a cheaterCheaters can literally do what they want and how they want since Rockstar doesnt care about PC VersionDid I mention that nearly in all lobbies there is a cheater?Cant play without friends so you can do your own session without cheaters.Basically, online ing sucks on PC, Singleplayer is better on PC.Everyone of the players are toxic and basically cant play with them on missions. Better doing the missions yourself.Cheaters are also in every mission so dont do the missions unless if you wanna get shot in the head from across the map.I reccomend if you want to get GTA. Get it either on Xbox or PlayStation since Rockstar mainly concentrates on the consoles. I regret paying my 60 to get this game back then. I havent been on it for a while but after hopping on for a bit to see if anything was done, and to be surprised that there are still cheaters in every lobby. So yea save your money, and get a different game. Or just get this on the consoles
