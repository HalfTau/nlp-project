I played this game alot on 360, before buying on PC for modding purposes. Never bothered to leave a review until this fiasco T2 is pulling with OpenIV, essentially barring modding for no reason. If youre just a passerby reading this review, wondering if you should buy the game, dont. Dont support this very greedy and malicious company. Dont give them your money, dont give them your time, and most importantly, dont give them the opportunity to make gaming a worse place.
