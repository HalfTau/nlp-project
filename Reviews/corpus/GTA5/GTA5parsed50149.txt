Outside some minor testing, Ive never much had any reason for playing GTA V, and this partially came down to the excessive draconian ruling concerning their online half, with legitimate programs unrelated to aiding in the game triggering the floodgate of bans. With recent news of the OpenIV closure due to Take Two, a program designed for modding the singleplayer half of the game only, they have opened themselves into a PR nightmare that could see shares plummet for future products.While I was able to get the game on sale, most people wanted to play as soon as possible. For my 20, I have a multiplayer mode Im too scared to go on in fear of receiving a ban for having Discord up, to a Singleplayer that has now lost the main avenue to install some incredible mods, some fully changing how the game plays.
