What very little time I had spent in this game since launch was spent mostly messing with mods and having a lot of fun. Now I cannot do anything I enjoyed about the title. Somehow they decided to remove single player mods, but still cant manage to stop hackers who ruin the online lobbies for people attemptiing to the play the game with friends. Big mistake on everyones end. Either bring back single player modding, or be more strict on online hacking/modding. Until then, thats gonna be a no from me dawg.
