Was never allowed to play this game due to the age restrictions and never saw what alll the hype was about, however, I was lucky enough to con my sister to get this game for me when it was on sale.After almost 100 hours in under a week and reaching rank 48, I now know exactly what all the rage is about. There are so many different ways to play GTAV that fit almost every game style. If you dont fall under that category, youre not human. This game is possibly the best and worst thing thats happened to me. Just under a week of gameplay and I can already confidently say that this is the best game I have ever played, and quite possibly, always will be.Morale of the story, GET THIS GAME. If youre skeptical like I was, take a gamble  you might as well. If youre this game isnt successful in meeting youre needs, which I highly doubt will ever be a scenario, just go ahead and refund it. You must be living in 2100 if thats the case.PS Just a quick question, anyone know what the sun looks like?
