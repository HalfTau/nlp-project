I have never modded this game, but to allow modding for years, then out of the blue decide to force the people who make this mod to stop distributing it, is kinda childish. I will no longer support this company, sure i may play this game, but anything new I will not waste my hard earned money on, Just like I no longer support anything sony makes because they pulled linux support off the PS3, I bought the PS3 because of the linux support, and I got lied to when they got rid of it.
