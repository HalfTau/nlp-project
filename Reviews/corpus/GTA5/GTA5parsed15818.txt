Willy Wonka is a guy who owns this really big candy factory, where he mostly makes chocolate but he makes other candy as well. But he is mostly famous because of the chocolate he makes. He had a pretty rough childhood with his dad being a dentist and all and that he wasnt allowed to eat candy. His whole childhood he had to wear a big brace all his childhood but one halloween, all that changed. He went trick or treating with a group of his friends and when he got home his dad just ranted about that candy was basically like a walking caries and he proceeded to throw all the candy that he got during the night out. But the next day when he cleaned out the fireplace he found a little piece of chocolate still with the wrapper on and from that day forward he loved chocolate.
