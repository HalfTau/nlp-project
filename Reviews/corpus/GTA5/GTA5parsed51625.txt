How the mighty hath fallen. What was once a sprawling city full of things to do has swiftly been consumed by paytoplay mechanics that essentially force the player to purchase hundreds of dollars worth of microtransactions in order to have any fun. All of the free content updates have been Onlineonly, and steadily increased in price until Shark cards are the only viable way to obtain the new items.The singleplayer campaign, until recently, had been kept free of such predatory behavior now TakeTwo has threatened legal action against the modding community, claiming it enables cheaters in Online. This in spite of the fact that the mods are singleplayeronly.I cannot recommend this game any longer, and will not be purchasing any future installments in the franchise.
