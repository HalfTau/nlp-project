After playing the solo game which was meh compared to earlier adaptions i tried the online play. THe community was so sad i literraly cried for 3 weeks straight and started going to church every sundaymorning which I still do. All in all the game sucks balls. After completing the ing game i finally got some millions believe me its easier in real life... haha no its not the only thing left to do was completely zero, zilch. nada.
