I tried to refund this game after a while and Steam told me that I cant refund as Ive exceeded the 2hours of gameplay. Unforunately, I spent more than 2 hours on the game trying to fiddle with the settings, graphics etc instead of playing the actual game. When I tried out the game, it was simply not fun. Not recommended.
