So Ive played around 400hourish on this game mostly online. Loved the game even when there were crazy updates. I never cheated, if i needed money I bought shark cards. Ive been playing PUBG recently and I came to play GTA again for the first time in 4months. On the login screen it said Rockstar took 9mil from me. Seriously? Not going to play GTA for a long time
