Let me start off saying that GTAV single player is amazing. I am here to review GTA Online since there is no alternative to review that section of the game itself.GTA Online is fun on an overall scheme but it takes a while to grind up the cash that is needed to buy the fun toys. Following a recent grind for over two weeks, I had earned over 10 million GTA which was taken away by R in their recent illegitimate money removal sweep. Three support tickets later, R continues to copy and paste the same generic response that states that somehow I am at fault for receiving this illegitimate money without any kind of proof or investigation into why my legitimate ingame money was removed. The fact that R does not care about its customers is very infuriating and dissapointing.
