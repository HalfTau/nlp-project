Used to be fun, but eventually the content added that cost too much to reasonably grind for allowed people who pay to have such a ridichulously massive advantage in GTA online that it was no longer fun. Any race joined had a 50/50 chance of the person running it to enable custom cars because it would give them the advantage. Any new vehicle that was remotely fun or new would be hidden behind enourmous paywalls or a decade of grinding that it was the equivilant of seeing the neighbour kids get a pool...such, it was fun to imagine what it would be like and maybe every couple weeks they would let you use it but you could never actually have the real exipirience of owning it. The final straw came with an update that added several fun gimmick vehicles that jumped, had rocket boosters attached to them or was basically a faster tank. Instead of being purchasable you would be forced to own a specific newly added property in the game which cost alot, then you would have the oppurtunity to lower the price of them by grinding through random missions untill you had a CHANCE of doing another set of missions that would give you the one opputinity to do a mission to get a discount on said vehicle. OH, and did i mention that all these missions were forced into public servers which means  YOU, you dont get to have fun, you have to attempt the mission 100 times before eventually you get a server without s in it so you can do the mission without being instakilled by a jet or some  in a Ferari with c4, then once you finaly complete all that...the vehicle becomes 10 cheaper. then you have to earn that other 90 by grinding some more and by that point 30 hours of your life is gone and you sit wondering why you arnt playing literally any other game.EDIT Recently just discovered that Take Two interactive have disabled the most popular single player mod in the community so for anyone who wanted to not be a part of the mess that is gta online but still have access to the content now cant.
