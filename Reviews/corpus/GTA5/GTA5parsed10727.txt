Well its been 4 years of playing this game, and Ive created over 100 jobs for it. I didnt expect my Playground stunt racess to catch on like they did. The reason I still play and create content for this game is because of some good community members and regular free updates that keep things interesting. Its true there are a lot of cheaters but if you can get past that and find the good real players you will enjoy the many things this game has to offer.
