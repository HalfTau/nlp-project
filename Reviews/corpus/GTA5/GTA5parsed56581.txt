the stuff with OpenIV is not cool, so hey.sp story is great.online has its fair share of hackers and kids who enjoy trolling everyone.the occasional glitch.ridiculous moneygrabbing by R, shark cards are overpriced and there is no real way to make enough money to enjoy the game without spending upwards of 40hrs a week on the game.gunrunning has finally changed the dynamic of pvp an effective weapon against griefers, vehicles that rival the insurgent and weapons that can be used in most all firefights. itd still overpriced and has terrible design choices but there are good things.every part of the game that can be accessed in both sp and online is great, the stuff thats exclusively in online is kinda difficult to characterize. some of its awesome, some is awful.the great things are few and far between.
