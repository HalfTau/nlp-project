Grand Theft Auto V is wasted!about 95 of the player didnt play story mode or didnt pass the final mission,they just play GTAOnline.Its a great pity.As a matter of fact,story modes graphics is better than GTAOL,and the story is meaningful than raise money in GTAOnline,too.If you havent pass the story mode and read this review,please complete it.I recommend GTAV but I dont recommend GTAOnline.Because Rockstar update it just in order to sell more shark cark and it wasted GTAV.What worse,hacker is everywhere.
