Singleplayer is fantastic. Story is good and the characters have a ton of personality. It contrasts to GTA 4s realistic story by being something youd see out of Oceans Eleven and as such I like GTA IVs story a lot better, but thats purely subjective.Relating to mechancis within the game, theyre pretty great. Theres a lot less realism when comparing it to GTA IV, as seen in the driving and shooting which makes it feel a lot more arcadey but thats okay, it still works, especially considering the missions found within the game.However, the main thing within this game is most likely the online part, or at least thats the major reason why people buy it. Its awfully grindy to experience the same stuff over and over again, and youre probably going to want to kill yourself by doing it. However, while  a majority of the expensive stuff is cool and all, its really gimicky. Ive found the most fun Ive had with this game is just screwing around with friends. Go on a road trip, act like mob guys and shoot randoms with tommy guns or anything like that,
