Do I recommend this game? If you want to play for the campaign, hell yeah. But DONT buy this game for online, rockstar will find a way to screw you over. My money, which I worked DAYS on to earn, got deleted. And the only thing rockstar can reply is an automated message about how shark card money doesnt get affected.The story mode is great, online sucks, rockstar sucks.
