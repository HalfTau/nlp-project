Sorry, Ive only been continuing playing this game because of the great modding community. Unfortunately, Take Two has made it illegal for OpenIV to continue to operate. Ive really enjoyed the single player mods and I understand the problem with the online hackers but this move really killed any future interest I had in this game.
