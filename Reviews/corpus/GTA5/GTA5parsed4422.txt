Very good single player content onthepackage, as you expect from most of GTA series, change the point of view from another character during a mission, from 3rd person to first person action, makes this a unique GTA experience. On the online side, is a bit of let down, very long loading times, people kicking you out as they please and the difficulty of setting up a private session prevents me from playing online, is that hard to put a create private session option?
