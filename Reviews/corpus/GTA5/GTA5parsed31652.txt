TakeTwo? more like take two steps away from this game. If you enjoy the freedom of modding or just modding in general this game is not for you. TakeTwo Interactive recently sent a cease and desist to the developers of OpenIV, a tool made for modding GTA. Modding is beneficial to games as it often extends the life of a game, and it pains me to put a negative review for this once great game but it is the only way to make them think twice about this decision. I do not support steps to restrict modding.
