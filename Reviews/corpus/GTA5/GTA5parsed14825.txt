I knew it was bad, but...The community is more toxic than I expected.The grind is worse than I expected.The loading times are worse than I expected I am running this on a frigging highend setup with the game being on a 960 Evo, jesus Rockstar.The netcode is worse than I expected.The lack of any useful anticheat and the amount of modders is worse than I expected I see at least 1 each 2 or 3 lobbies.I mean, it has some fun sides, but jesus, if this is AAA development, I am glad I avoided basically all other AAA games the past years. Still made the mistake to buy this on the recent sale granted, used money I got through the Steam Market, so whatever, hoping for a decent online experience I mean, I read bad things about it, but cmon, who could imagine its THIS bad?...well, guess I have to put up with it now.Really, the grind probably wouldnt even be that bad if TakeTwo and Rockstar wouldnt be greedy s. But currently you have to put up with everything mentioned above in order to obtain the fun things for free roam...and that over and over again. And the community is at fault for jumping on that train and buying shark cards like mad men, showing everyone that theres a ton of profit to gain there.PS For stuff like import/export apparently the meta to get money actively, even though this gain is still pathetic, I am just creating a private public session. Why? Because of point 1...What kind of mental disorder do those people have to fly around with their Hydra and destroy cars to waste other peoples time? AT LEAST TRY TO STEAL THEM YOU CRINGE S.I wish proper age verification and a limit of being at least 18 years old would be a thing for such games...makes you want to mod to just blow them up in their Hydra when they hit your car, without having your car blown up of course.Man, thatd be fun.
