For those that are looking at the people complaining about modding and thinking that they are hackers who cant hack anymore, youre wrong. A very large playerbase for this game included just singleplayer modders who wanted to say  play with real cars, on previous GTA maps such as GTA 4, and maybe even add aliens idk.  These people cant do this anymore because of ing Take Two and their  decision to get rip of OpenIV.  Not only are people scared to make mods in fear of getting sued, they really cant do it anymore.  The real question for Rock is, it has been about 3 years since this ing game came out... if it was really that much of a problem, why are you JUST NOW DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT? Seriously go shove your keyboards up yalls asses, your heads already made it wide enough.
