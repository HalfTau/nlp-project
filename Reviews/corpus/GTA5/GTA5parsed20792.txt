I bought this game to play online with my friend, but GTA online sucks. I only met cheaters, spawncampers and just other players that had way better equipment than me my friend too. I cant recommend the multiplayer to anyone and that was the main reason why I bought this game. My bro also told me that the game modes are good and I hated them. The spawnsystem isand the gunplay doesnt feel good in my opinion. Ill go with watch dogs, it doesnt have that many opportunities, but also no microtransactions
