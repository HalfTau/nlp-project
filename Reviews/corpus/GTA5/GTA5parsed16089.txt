The single player is super. 9/10Graphics are okay.Gameplay is very goodMultiplayer 5/10And heres why.FULL OF HACKERS that destroy your gaming experience.Game is greedy and you must grind alot to pay yourself whatever you need.Each update bring something so expensive that it kind of push players to buy their Shark Card microtransanctionsmoney ingame.This kind of practice made me loose hope on Rockstar and Bethesda.AND please the game is still 69,99.....
