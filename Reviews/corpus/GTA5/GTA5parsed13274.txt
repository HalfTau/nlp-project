I had to give this a No if you are getting this to play GTA Online.Most of the servers i join is swarming with modders and cheaters. Sure its good if theyre on your side speeding up missions and giving their cut in the final heist but modders do game breakinglike spawning obstacles in free mode so you get trapped in one spot with now way of getting out other than quitting the game, spawing a ing guitar within your character that takes you to the sky and kills you and being immortal in every adversary mode will make you want to quit the game.Every item in game is expensive and takes you forever to enjoy it fully unless you have friends who will grind every mission with you.Shark cards are expensive but if you can afford it then goodIf youre getting this for the single player experience, then good because every part of the game is flawless for me. I have nothing bad to say about it. I just wished that Rockstar focused on making a single player DLC like in GTA4. That dream is gone now.
