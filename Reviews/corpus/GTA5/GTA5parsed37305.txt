I rarely play  multiplayer in any game anymore. I buy games like this specifically for their history of modding. That has been the entire sales point on games like the later Elder Scrolls games and past GTA games. The fact that they are going to the point of sending PIs to peoples homes and threatening them is just plain ludicrous. I wish I could still refund this game. If I could, I would. I think Im done with all Take Two Interactive games.
