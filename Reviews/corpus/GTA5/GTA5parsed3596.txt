The gameplay itself is what you will expect from a GTA game.Its really a fun game, do whatever you want.But there are things i hate in this gameCheaters, Microtransactions, Loooooooooooooooong loading time and i dont know if everyone experiences this but when were creating private sessions with my friends/crew its so laggy.But overall, i still love the game.Get it while its on sale.
