Story mode The story mode is absolutely incredible. You really get attached to the characters you play as, and you can really see them evolving into new and improved people. And it also has so much more to offer. When youre done with the main story you can do the Strangers and Freaks missions if you havent already done them or plenty other random things. And playing around with mods is also plenty of fun. I really dont have anything bad to say about it other than the mission Scouting the Port... that mission ing sucks.Online The online mode is also very fun and playing with friends is awesome. It has plenty of races, heists and more to do. However it can get very repetitive and tedious/boring cause the progress is so slow, but it is still satisfying when you get enough money to buy a new car or something else. New heists and races get added here and there but when you played them a few times they also get repetitive.And then there are the shark cards... WHY!? I mean I understand some people wanna waste theyre money, cause as I said the progress is slower than ever. But paying 60 is insane just to get 8 million virtual dollars. THATS AS MUCH AS THE FULL GAME COSTS.Even though online has alot of cons id still recommend this game  purely bacause of the story mode. And the online mode is also fun and atleast you dont have to pay 60 a year to play online yeah im talking about consoles
