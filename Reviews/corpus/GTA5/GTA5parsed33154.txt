The game itself is good, the monetization strategy is disgusting. Next to the obvious bandwagon of hate for taking down single player modding tools  that have been around for years with no problem  before doing something about cheaters, Id like to remind everyone that this fully priced game has microtransactions. Well, micro is a big word because the prices for virtual money are disgusting. Futhermore rockstar failed to deliver on single player DLC since they noticed that they can just make a new color for a car and call it an gta online update and make money that way instead.Congratulations on ruining one of the most solid game dev reputations on the market, carefully build up over more than a decade, in a single week. Cant say you dont deserve it.
