I honestly dont what what the hell you guys are thinking. Almost 80 of your profit is from the modding community, everyone looks forward to playing GTA with nice Police cars, real cars, new guns, become a cop, play as EMS. There is so much that the modding community has brought to GTA and you guys dont realize how much it has helped your sales. RIP GTA 6 because Im sure as hell not buying just like the rest of us that agree you ed yourself.R.I.P Grand Theft Auto  1997  2017
