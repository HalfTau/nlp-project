After OpenIV has been resupported I see no reason to hop on the hatetrain, Rockstar listened to the fans and allowed singleplayer mods after all.The game has been pretty fun recently after coming back, the online isnt as cancerous as some people make it out to be. My only gripe is the huge grind for any decent money.
