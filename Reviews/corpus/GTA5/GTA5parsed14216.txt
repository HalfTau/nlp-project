Over the years I have had some fun with this game. First bought and played on the console before the PC release, then bought on the PC to continue enjoying GTA Online. We were away for quite awhile, but started playing again these last two weeks. There are a lot of cool, fun, features, but require a decent amount of in game cash to buy the properties to unlock the new features. In a way that is a decent way to release new DLC, folks can grind out the money, or buy Shark cards to gain access. I wont go into the debate on just how expensive the new content is in game, but hey we were enjoying the game so we bought some Shark cards.Last night, we get home from going out to dinner, and find out I was banned for a month and my character will be wiped. All but one of the support tickets I opened were instantly closed with all bans are final deal with it. On the one other ticket I opened, I was told that the money from the Shark cards will still be on the account when the ban is lifted, but the character will be wiped. No information on why I was banned, so I cannot make any changes to prevent it from happening again. Most likely the ban will be lifted, then will just happen again and be permanent.I had fun with this game, but due to what seems to be faulty cheat detection software and a draconian customer support organization, I will not buy a Rockstar game again.If you only care about single player, go for it.Online, expect to grind out cash in game, or buy shark cards, and have it all possibly taken away due to a false positive in their cheat detection software.I did have a lot of fun over the years with this product, just wish that I didnt spend the money I did recently in Shark cards just to lose the ability to play the game. Maybe one more negative review to join the others will help someone out there not waste their money.
