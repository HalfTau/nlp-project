The game stars out with endless fun and potential, but once you take a step into the online world. You will struggle. It requires countless hours and grinds in order to be the top of the server, nothing wrong with that but it is not very noob friendly. In conclusion, its really fun with friends and the campaign can honestly be played several times, it never gets boring.
