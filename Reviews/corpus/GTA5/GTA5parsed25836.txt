Even though OpenIV has returned, and is being worked on again, thats all well and good, but if you arent one to play mods, and are interested in the Online aspect, I cant recommend it too much. Everyone knows about the Shark Cards. And I think the name is accurate, with recent updates, they make it seem as though the next release is the hip new thing that will make you a huge amount of money, when in reality these new additions actually take you more time than some of the first releases made. As an example, the business update, adding warehouses and crates, is still the most profitable way to make money, with the biker update being considered second, by a significant distance. Compared to the recent gunrunning business, the biker update makes more money. They are giving you progressively less useful income, while jacking up the prices for these things, its all an effort to get you to buy more of their bloody cards.
