If you arent great at or dont want to farm heists, be prepared to spend massive amounts of money in shark cards for cars.A single car can range up to an equivilent of about 75.00.  And there are multiple vehicles at that price.  You could easily spend over 1000 to get all the top vehicles.The game is fun, yes, but the grind isnt, very easy to burn out.
