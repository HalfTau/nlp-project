EDIT 7/10/17  OpenIV is back, itll be interesting to see how things will go from here on out. My review will not change, as the whole modding debacle is what finally pushed me into writing a review.Ive been playing GTA V since release day, first on the PS3 and then on the PC. Online started out fun, and then just turned into a mess. With the introduction of team based missions where everyone had to cooperate, a significant part of the community turned into trolls who would intentionally fail just to ruin everyone elses fun. That mixed with the hackers  increasing in numbers and non hacking players getting banned for other hackers doings, I quit playing online entirely and stuck to modding offline just to get my kicks. Today I noticed that OpenIV recieved a cease and decist letter and decided to shut down their mod. After reading this news, I have decided that GTA V is going to be my last Rockstar game I will ever purchase. Ive been a fan since GTA III, but watching this game go from a decently fun game to a PayToWin game that also has a chance of permanantly banning your online account has just finally pushed me away from Rockstar all together. I will still play GTA V offline and mod the living crap out of it, but Ill be spending my money on other games from now on.
