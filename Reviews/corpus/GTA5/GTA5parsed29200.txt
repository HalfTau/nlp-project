This game is great before everything became a money grind in thispost of a game. This game is terrible. They removed the modding of the gameWHICH IS WHY THE GAME GOT SO POPULAR EARLIER. Online money is just a grind, and the game isnt fun anymore with all these Billion dollar companies that barely make profit. You will be spending about 1000 hours in this game to buy one car and business and a yacht which doesnt do anything. Also Microtransactions are their main source of income. Do me and everyone else who got screwed by this game a favor and dont get this game. Its not worth it
