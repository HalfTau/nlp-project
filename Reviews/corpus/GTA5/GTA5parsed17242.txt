My PC has met passed the recommended specs, but as I play the game it somehow automaticaly loses focus, and not just on GTA also on other steam Games. It bothers me how smooth the game when im playing but sometimes in between the audio,mouse and keyboard temporarily doesnt function but the game animation is still on going. This problem is really bothersome pls help
