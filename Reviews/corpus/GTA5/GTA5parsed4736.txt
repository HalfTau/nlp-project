Arguably the best online gaming experience when its in tip top order. Plagued by bugs due to fantastic updates of all kinds. this game has truly changed over the years, sometimes it falls on its face with glitches and modders tainting the experience. but after 1200 hours logged in even after taking a 2 year hiatus I came back to familiar faces familiar places all of which hold a special place in my heart. Rockstar, you have truly made a masterpiece. Despite the days my computer crashes and invites to friend lobbies are delayed I will never not one time give up on GTAonline. Cuz itll always be the best way to keep happy thoughts and to smile laugh and remember better days.
