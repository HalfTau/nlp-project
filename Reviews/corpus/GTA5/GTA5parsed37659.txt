I purchased this game at launch to get the preorder cash.Forgot about the online portion for a great portion of my game play.Got invited to come back by a friend and then we ed off to go do GTA online things.like steal cars and be red necks.So there comes a time when he steals a motorcycle, and I rode  on the back of the bike, we decide to take it off road.He heads for a mountain, because thats what you do.After we crested the peak, we flew over the other side of the mountain.And then disaster struck.We hit a rode on the other side, and me, riding , gets tossed.I immediately get banned.I was shocked. Flabbergasted even.I try to put in a ticket to determine why I got banned for a month.I was put through a circular email blender, with no access to a real person.I ask the twitter rep why I got banned. Nothing.I ask the twitter rep for help with my account, and immediately they respond with help.I then ask for why I got banned off GTA Online. Nothing.Fuming, I waited a month.I return, and my character is destroyed.I make another character, and then proceed to do GTA things with what was left of my preorder cash.And then I end up in a corporation mission where you have to race ramped vehicles down the highway to break through a  police cordon. You know, GTA things.I was racing down the road towards the objective and..Got banned. Permanently this time.Again, no recourse. No assistance. Nothing.70 canada bucks down the drain. And now this modHardly surprised at all by it, to be honest.Go play APB.At least there it feels like you earned something.
