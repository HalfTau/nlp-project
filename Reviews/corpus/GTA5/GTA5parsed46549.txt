GTAV was a very fun game for a long time but like all games it eventually got old id play GTA Online for a little bit after every major update till i got bored. Since launch ive played x360, xone, and pc but since TakeTwo wants to be a money grubbing  the only thing that kept in fun inbetween the updates was modding the single player side of the game. I never cheated or modded online nor did i want to. I just wanted my single player game to look amazing as hell. With real cars, better drifting, better planes and boats. But since they dont want us to have fun anymore I can not and will not recommend GTAV to anyone anymore Rockstar Games be the hero we need become independent.
