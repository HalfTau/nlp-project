i cant and wont speak for the multiplayer here from personal experience b/c i never gave it any timeThis game really is a technical masterclass and looks beautiful on PCs from low end budget builds to high end enthusiast onesThe plotlines here are nothing spectacular themselves but they are adequate and serve the characters well9.5/10 for Singleplayer/
