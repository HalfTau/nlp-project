Alright first to be clear, this is not a Modder discussion review of the game.This review is purely based on the online version of the game.The reason im writing this review is simple, Beyond the bizarre loading times this game offers Making it as dayz once was the hiking simulator, easily worth a title of loading simulator, this game is unbalanced in the means of making money.Heists are first of all, easily doable in a 2 person squad. In some cases even only 1, YET you cannot start one with these odds, and knowingly that the entire lobby for heists and setups is outdated, money wise of course people are less reluctant to participate in it, making finding people even harder to do and beyond that the missions are strangely buggy which has costed me losing both setups and heists out of mine, or any of my teammates control, by stupid bugs that shouldnt even be in the game.Now this is all beyond the fact of how your team is, because god forbid they leave, youll directly lose all your progress in the mission, and youre all kicked. Great.Now secondly, I guess these are the first steps people have to take. Gamble on the availability of these missions in order to accumilate enough wealth to be able to buy an office and garage / storage Should be about 3.5 mil together if you take the lowest ones which is already a climb to make.Then you have to spend money in order to make money, and again you MIGHT have to deal with bugs / glitches things out of your control, but even if you use these methods to grind, itll be tediously long.But then again, with all the spendings you have to make Even if you own a bunker for instance, but never used it you will pay 5K rent per ingame day, ammo etc its just REALLY hard to make money.My primary concerns are easily what I mentioned Sum upLong loading times.Glitchy setups and heists, that are easily forfited, and have long waiting queues etc, to less animo, to less money involved anyways, Less players needed for setup should be possible Even solo if thats what pleases you and no reprocussions for when someone leaves etc.Long loading times, that goes hand in hand if youre joining above, and even if not can get really tedious A minigame in it for instance Esp multiplayer would at least make the experience more enjoyable, added that you cant even tab out because itll stop loading and start kicking you off for whatever reason. so youre stuck looking at loading screens, and if you binge this game youll spend at least 5060 minutes out of 56 hours in a loading screen of some sort either in or outside the overworld, in heists most of these are not even skipable and take about 34 minutes to cut to the chase and get REALLY tedious.The overal expenses in this game are ridiculous, especially if youre just out to make money in a legit way, youd be stuck grinding forever and even then youll spend money for another Trap grinding session. its just neverending, tediousness. Thankfully you dont have to use your friends as slaves in your companies, since they dont really make much at all are generally not interested and in the end youll have to do most of it solo anyways. Would be really great if it was made a bit easier by for instance dropping the 1 crate rule and bind it as large as your vehicle is so bigger vehicle get some loving as well.With this said, Im going to have to give it a negative I believe the game has great potential, but It just feels a bit unpolished, and unloved as if the creators had great intend And still probably have, but kind of lost sight of improving, tweaking etc and just focused on cashing in as big as possible.I hope my review gets some love and the mentioned improvements get pushed through.
