The lack of single player expansion content and sole focus on expanding the multiplayer cashgrab should be enough to NOT recommend GTA V, but the recent efforts from Take Two to shut down single player modding is absurd. They dont provide content to extend the lifetime of their game and when the community does they get mad?
