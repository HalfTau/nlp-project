I love and hate this game. When it first came out it was amazing. Buggy, but amazing. Now many updates later i mean its not bad, but also not fun. Newer more expensive dlc should completly make the previous stuff worthless. It also shouldnt be behind a 2.7Billion pay wall. At least thats how i feel. Plus the fact that back in the day having 700,000 was a big deal it felt, Cause nothing was worth more than maybe 1.2Million. Now not only do things cost that much, but you have to spend nearly that much to even have a chance of earning money at least semi easily.Man I dont know. I want to say this game is amazing for everyone, but starting out now is gonna be the worst if you arent willing to just do races for hours on end...
