Although the single player is wellmade with an astounding story, I sadly cant give this game a positive review because of the multiplayer and how Rockstar has handled problems. Actually they havent handled any of the problems. Way too many hackers to the point where you dont want to play. They are too busy trying to make people pay for fake money. Its just sad to see this because they should fixing these problems since multiplayer is where most people want to spend their time in for GTA V.
