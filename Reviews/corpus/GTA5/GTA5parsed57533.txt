I have been a fan of Rockstar Games and the Grand Theft Auto franchise for years, since the very first game came out when I was a kid.  It is easily one of my favorite game series, and I have many fond memories of it.  But after hearing about Take Two Interactives cease  desist order against the developers of OpenIV, a tool I have been using to mod GTA games for years, I can no longer morally acquiesce to giving them any more money.  Do not buy Grand Theft Auto V.  Do not buy Grand Theft Auto IV.  Do not buy Red Dead Redemption, Bully, LA Noir, or any other game that would profit Take Two Interactive.  Modding singleplayer games is not illegal, and corporations to do not have the ability to declare anything illegal.  Fck Take Two Interactive and their profits.  Heres hoping they get a hostile takeover in their near future and Rockstar can be free of this mess.
