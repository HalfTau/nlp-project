If the price to content/quality ratio of every game was the same and this game costs 60, pretty much every Ubisoft game should cost 10 to 20.That being said there are some big problems the devs probably wont fix because it wouldnt give them a lot of money they only care about moneyTakes about 5 minutes to start online with an HDDEverything in online is very expensive and you need to do a lot of grindingIf there are more than 10 people in a session, chances are one of them is a modderSome people have a bug that makes them leave a session every now and then, which is extremely annoying happens every 5 minutes for some peopleThe singleplayer is amazing tho
