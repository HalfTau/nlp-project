Rockstar/TakeTwo just pulled the plug on singleplayer modifications under the guise of protecting online players from cheaters. Their reasoning is lying about what OpenIV actually does, meanwhile they do nothing to actually fix the problems with online cheating. Dont even bother with this game. I wouldnt be surprised to see paid mods coming to GTA5. Pass.
