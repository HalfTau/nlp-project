Grand Theft Auto V never really caught me with its multiplayer. Ideally this was a game that seemed like it would be enjoyable, but you quickly find out that the MP is a grind fest. Having fun and dicking around is no longer the name of the game. Loading times are also EVERYWHERE. An SSD is a requirement! Add on the fact that you can pay straight up, real life money, for ingame currency which is simply a disgusting system to scrap up more money. I play video games for fun, not to slog through BS to play what I payed for or hell pay MORE just to keep up. They can claim this was done to make producing more content for the game a viable option but I refuse to accept it. The additions to the game basically a bunch of models with simple stat changes or the bank heist mode and biker gangs are weak and honestly rather pointless in my eyes. The best part is that none of this is even added into the single player mode. Which was SUPPOSED to get more content but never did....hmmmmNow with the recent drama of Rockstar taking down the modding of single player, weve lost another piece of what made this series so great. The company has become money hungry and lost the soul of caring for its fans. Everything is just another paycheck.
