This review at the moment is for Single Player modeIn a sentence So well designed and revolutionary that if it werent for the Online mode microtransaction and executive greed, people would be saying that this game rivals the Witcher 3 for its single player alone.11/10 for the Story mode.Im completely blown away. The story is very well written and fun. The graphics is great and even better with Redux mod just check youtube how it looks. The mechanics switching between 3 main characters is novel and keeps the player engaged.The news, current events along with the story development are very dynamic and makes the world come alive! Im serious this is like real life simulator on Steroid. All the activities you could do in game come in variaty from Strip Club, watching movies, playing Tennis and Golf, etc.I didnt think it would be this good. I wish I had bought it sooner. I got it on sales for 23 euros during Christmas 2017 and I still think if any game is worth buying at full 60 price, this is one of them.I fell in love with the game and put 24 hours into it straight within 2 days during the holiday D.I will update the review once I play a lot of the online mode. However, Im pretty sure this review will remain positive in term of its moneys worth for the single player mode alone.Danks for the Awesome Game! 11/10!
