Honestly i have never used any mods in this game and should not give a damn. But i must vote against the notion to restrict mod support to not only rebel against TakeTwo, but also show our stance on the problem as a whole to the developers of tomorrow.OpenIV, you got another soul with you.Update Unlike many other people, i will change my review back to positive after the OpenIV controversy concluded peacefully. That is because i immensely enjoyed the games singleplayer campaign back on 360 and i still enjoy racing in Online every now and then. Note  racing is actually the only thing i do in the game. And despite all the problems like  balance,  class allocations, abhorrent matchmaking and insane prices i do not actually hold much grife against the game.Update TotalBiscuit convinced me that the ways R operates are indeed very much evil. You know what?  GTA Online. I still enjoy the game, but i do not want to support it in the public eye. Back to negative.
