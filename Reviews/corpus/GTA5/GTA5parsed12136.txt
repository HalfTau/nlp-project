As someone who has alot of hours in the game it is very poorly designed and just gets worse and worse with each update. You have to constantly grind your butt off to get that 1 car you want then find out it costs another 1 million to upgrade. Next we have modders which are in every part of the game if you like it or not you are forced to play with them. Rockstar doesnt care about the problem and thats why i have to say no until it is fixed.
