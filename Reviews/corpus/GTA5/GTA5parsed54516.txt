If I could refund this game, I would. There is a complete lack of respect for the playerbase and the communities who support this game. They keep the game interesting without dumping inordinate amounts of cash into multiplayer, which is take 2s only interest. At some point the players interest was completely discarded, and the lure of money and mircotransactions set the future direction for the company. From a Corporate perspective this is great, and if I was a shareholder I would be overjoyed. As a consumer of your product Im both disgusted and disappointed in the direction take 2 has went. I dont think you will have to worry about further bad reviews from me, since I wont be buying another product associated with this mess.
