I used to like this game until I really examined it. I realized that to actually have a good time I have to ing mod the game. Its such a waste of time with a lackluster story. The only likeable charactre is Trevor, but thats my opinion. It tries to be realistic, but then, it slides the classic GTA jokes in there, too? I mean, the way the npcs act is ing annoying, not funny. Everyone is also way too accurate with weapons and just generally way too aggressive. The gangs are utterly useless, and Franklin is a . Apparently, killing two people gives you a star even though there arent any police patrols or cameras anywhere. And, lets be honest. The map of Los Santos is huge and ing EMPTY. There are just about 0 interiors that are readily available for you to venture into, and you cant purchase extra safehouses. There are like 14 or 15 properties you can purchase but theyre all just liabilities. BUT WAIT! THERES ONLINE MODE! Same except with apartments, way too expensive vehicles and items, unenjoyable grinding forthat some  is gonna blow up within the next hour, and  heists. AKA Tedious Simulator 2018.  this game.
