On 25th of August, rockstar started to take legitimate grinded money from PC players accounts and so far refuses to address this issue by shutting down every ticket with a bot response despite the amount of people complaining about it in every way possible. Many PC players are being affected by this and share their stories on reddit and multiple different forums.No response from rockstar yet and doesnt seem like they are going to fix this. Many players  lost countless of grinding in a matter of second.Definitely as of right now this is game is not worth buying because even if you play the game as you should, rockstar might still punish you and dont give a damn about your complains.
