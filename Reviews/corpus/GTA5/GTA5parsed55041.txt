The singleplayer stops being fun after the story unless you mod it and now the mod scene died due to Take Two.The multiplayer is a grind full of microtransactions, long load times, full of hackers, and admins who will ban you for almost anything.I see no reason to own this game now unless you like spending 60 bucks for an unfun singelplayer and a tedious multiplayer.
