An overall good singleplayer offline experience good, but not great. Too much content was locked behind a horrid online system cars, missions, cosmetics, etc, and these are unable to be used at all offline. On top of this there is an awful PaytoWinonline system. Rockstar also has a terrible stance against mods and the offline community.During Sales periods, especially closer to the games launch, GTA V often increased in price so when it was 25 off it was the regular presale price but marked down from a fake higher price that it was never at.
