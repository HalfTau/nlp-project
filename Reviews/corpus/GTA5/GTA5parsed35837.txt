Game is fine but some things still makes it unplayable1. Modders, ers everytime  up the fun we trying to have with friends.2. Online ingame prices, i mean bigplane for like 6 million dollars and doesnt have anything special not even armored enough to survive more explosions.3. R Need to update sharkcards prices ir value you get.ofcourse im not buying them because of this and im not that person who spends money to get ingame cash lol I mean you pay 100 euros just for 8 million  which is spent in like 5 minutes on new stuff. old stuff yeah i dont complain, cheap worth 8 million but new stuff is like nothing special for that 8 million. Atleast lower prices of these sharkcards or remake the value you get for that 100 euros.
