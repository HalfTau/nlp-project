Im one of the ones that bought this game multiple times. X360, PS4, XB1 and PC. I only bought it on PC for Mods  dont care about GTA Online  I have console friends for that. To shut down the community that helps keeps the single player version of the game modern is a shame. Take Two  Rockstar should be ashamed that they are shunning a community that strives to make a great game better. Im sure its an effort to prioritize shark cards for current GTA Online and push for paid mods in the new Red Dead like Bethesda is doing for its games. I wont be buying any Rockstar or Take Two games until they fix this mess. There are options for games out there  really great ones. TT  Rockstar think they can do this because they have such a market for this. Time for me to revisit a game like Saints Row.
