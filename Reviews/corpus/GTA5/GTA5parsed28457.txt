SInglePlayer story mode was great and well done. Multiplayer was just okay considering the hype and now if you wanted to spice it up with a little modding it doesnt seem likely. Hopefully they can sell a few extra cheat codes for their credibility! Also anybody paying attention to Bethesda and creation club? Maybe jump on that too ya junts.
