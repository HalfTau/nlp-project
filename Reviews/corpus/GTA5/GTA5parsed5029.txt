The game is quite nice thanks to the vividness of the open world, graphics and details, but I think the script part is awful. GTA IV and the previous games did not give me the excitement. I was not thrilled when I was playing the script. My stomach did not even play.In addition, the game will be much nicer without cheats in the Online part..
