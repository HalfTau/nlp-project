OpenIV banned, then once again allowed, with the constraint of the Liberty City mod being shut down as it clearly contradicts TakeTwos modding standards. Kiss my R and TakeTwo. Its obvious youre making a Liberty City DLC, and none of us will buy it after youve pulled this t. I regret giving you 60 of my hardearned money.For anybody interested in playing, the online sucks. The singleplayer is great, but honestly the publishers are just begging for you to go find a torrent instead.RIP GTA
