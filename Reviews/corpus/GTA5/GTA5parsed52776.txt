As nice as the game is, and I was actually excited for the new update because I love BTR/BRDMs, Take2 has just slit their fcking throat. Theyve made SINGLEPLAYER modding illegal, and though theyre obviously in the wrong, there is nothing the OpenIV devs can do because money. Take2 is an evil company at this point and should not be receiving your money. Do not let them have another fcking cent or another second of your playtime.
