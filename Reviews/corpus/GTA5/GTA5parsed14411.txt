Put 126 hours on steam and probably as many on xbox into this game. Honestly this game has such amazing potential but is wasted by the lack of support by R and the rampant hacking in multiplayer. Coupled with the fact that there hasnt been any single player DLC as promised by R over 2 years ago, your money is definately better spent somewhere else.Honestly either let me play missions with friends in a private lobby, get an actual functional anti cheat system, get dedicated servers and I may come back or any or all of those. Until then... huge potential even bigger let down
