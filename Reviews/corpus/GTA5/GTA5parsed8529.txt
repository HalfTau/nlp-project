GTA V storymode is alright nothing to wonderful or too spectacular, gta online where rockstar produces their money from and when your a new player theres no way to reach the top tier very fast things like gunrunning or ceo without the use of shark cards it would littterly take an entire 23 days to make a few million so for the new players who havent been playing a long time good luck making much money at all with out being killed repeatedly by high level players who have helicopters and planes to bomb theout of you while youre minding your own business oh and even better cant even be a CEO,MC or VIP while being in the peaceful mode or whatever its called so yeah get ed by other players or throw irl money at a  company who only wants money  this game.
