Now, I somehow managed to pull myself away from this game to write a review, the singleplayer is incredibly fun, and getting into the multiplayer, I havent had the best experience with its economy in other versions of the game, but this version, I found some people who invited you into clubhouses and other owned locations just to see if you could assist them with starting up their M.C. career.Pros endless hours of singleplayer and online fun. Limitless mods to put on it too.Cons SHARK CARDS.And to the Shark Cards, they are bad. R relies on this to make money from this game, now, microtransactions are in no way horrible, but when they only give you enough money to buy the DLC content if you dont want to afford groceries for the month, getting enough money to buy everything in the game could lose you hundreds of dollars!While it is quite ridden with these microtransactions, those are the only bad I can find in the game, beside modders. stay away from modders.Overall 7/10.
