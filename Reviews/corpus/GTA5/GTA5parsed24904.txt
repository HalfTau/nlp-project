It is a disaster. GTA Online is full of hackers. I have played everything produced by Rockstar Games but GTA Online is a failed product. Its a walled garden that treats hackers like kings, they banned real modders that created 3rd party multiplayers or they offer no support for them. Their walled garden is a cheaters paradise. Play the single player and stop there. Im very dissapointed in how R  handles this shady business.
