At this point they should not even publish a PC port. The controls are a nightmare example swimming, and to add insult to injury nothing is explained properly like how to swim UP. I spent probably half my game time in the key bindings settings trying to figure out how to complete the current quest. Then add the just disastrous decision to have three halfbaked characters instead of one good one, and all the little glitches like quest targets disappearing behind walls. Story is boring as hell compared to older GTAs e.g. Vice City. For me the second worst GTA of all time with San Andreas still number one. And instead of a real DLC such as The Ballad of Gay Tony for GTA IV they keep adding online modes.Oh and by the way, the world record on the airport race is 0.170 seconds at the time of this review. Yes, less than a second for two laps around the airport. Basically all the top places in all such modes, be it golfing or races or anything, are cheated. But Rockstar just does not care.This game is not worth the money.
