Where did it all go wrong?I used to spend a LOT of time on this game, practically went on it daily for a few months. While this game used to be semirealistic with amazing graphics which still remain recent modifications to this game have dropped this games creditability in my view.Banning OpenIV which operates the majority of the offline modding doesnt affect TakeTwo at all, adding overpowered vehicles online and just not caring about its player base really shows where this companys priorities are.It is such a shame.
