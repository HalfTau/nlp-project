Ok im sorry but i have gta v for pc and ps4 ive been playing my ps4 account for a while and want to transfer it to pc.so i loaded up gta v online on pc after the 100 attempts to fix the You are trying to join servers with altered files error. Then i found out you cant even transfer anymore. I know they want to stop modded accounts but does Rockstar ever actually think about people that play legitly and paid 4060 for this game and want to play online with there characters.
