Pretty in good, but could use a better story along with ironically more content. When you play it for 5 hours a day for two months, it gets a tad boring. Online is a grindfest not sexually, because later in the game, as well as early on, everything costs a metricton and takes about 4 days to purchase. Unless youre out of school, a loser with no job and is 35, or just have no life, i recommend getting 100 in the campaign before you try online. Lastly, DO NOT BECOME FREINDS WITH ANYONE IN THIS GAME, AS THEY WILL PROBABLY BE REALLIFE CANCER. Thanks!
