I think we can all pretty much agree at this point that the single player is fantastic and worth playing, but the online has become unplayable.Between the rampant hackers, greifers, and microtransactions, all seeming to go unchecked for longer than a half day, there  isnt much enjoyment out of half of this game. You pretty much cannot do anything online besides get spawn killed or hacked, once even effecting my PCs systems. So unless you plan on hacking/griefing yourself, skip online.
