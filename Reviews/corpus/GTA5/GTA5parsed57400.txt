TLDRGraphics  10/10Gameplay  9/10Story  8/10Customization  8/10Controls  10/10 Overall great game. I recommend picking it up if its on sale.GraphicsThe game boasts some beautiful visuals that look amazing even by todays standards in games. These graphics compliment the fairly large and hand crafted game world pretty well. The animations are smooth and well made, and they make every action you do that much more satisfying.GameplayThe gun play is nice and simple and the game even knows when there is an object in front of the gun barrel and the bullet hits the object, rather than going through and landing where youre pointing your crosshair. Although shooting can be a little clunky in the first person mode.Driving cars feel right in every possible way. Each car has unique handling and the appearance of most cars in the game is inspired by reallife cars which is awesome.StoryThe games story is pretty wellwritten, at times silly and hilarious. There are three unique playable characters, all with vastly different personalities. Side characters are also wellthoughtout and not just simple and boring.CustomizationYou cant customize a whole in the story mode. But in the online mode its the complete opposite. The character creator can be a bit lack luster, which makes it hard to create a good looking character, but it isnt too bad. There are lots of hairstyle, makeup, facepaint and eyebrow options, but when it comes to clothing and accesories there are hundres, even thousands of options to choose from. There are lots of customization options for cars. However, some cars can have very few options, while others have loads of them. Which in my opinion is a bit of a shame.ControlsBoth keyboard and mouse, and controller work very well. On PC you can rebind every key obviously, so if youre not happy with the default control scheme, you can change it to your personal preference.
