Tale two are a company that values their own safety and well being over their fans happiness, they are anti consumer and in the past have even said they want to get more money out of their customers, but as of a few hours of posting this, Take Two have ulitmately killed mods for their game, they have hit the creator of a software called openIV with a cease and desist and  Have ruined all chances of anybody getting any fun out of the game, using their own or other users content. This was a huge thing for many people as it can make the game better in some regards, Never in my life, have I ever seen a company be blatently so anti consumer so publicly.Not only this, but the game is full of hackers and cheaters, many stories have risen of users getting banned for no reason other then a modder has given them money that they couldnt get rid of amongst many other reasons. Rockstar are a good company, with good intention, to make games that people want to play and to make people happy doing so, but those stuck upover at Take two, can kiss the profit they wanted so badly good bye, as they go  themselves and possibly cry wolf.stay clear, not only for yourself, but for the sake of the developers and to teach Take two a lesson, care about the community more then the money, or the money wont come. ing sad.
