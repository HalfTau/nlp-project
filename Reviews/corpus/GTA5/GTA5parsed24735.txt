Honestly i have obviously had absolute tons of fun in this game. Its a solid game, the story is good.Its hard to reccomend if you only plan on playing online as it is a grindfest unless you drop serious cash. That being said, there is still a lot of fun to be had, especially worth it if you can grab it on sale.
