Servers for GTA 5 online have been down / limited for the past 6 hours, and prior to that I had cloud saving issues, meaning I wasnt able to buy any ammo, armour or food items for use in heists.Having been waiting for it to come online all day, Im still yet to see any tweet from Rockstar games on Twitter or any official announcement that something is actually wrong and being done about the situation.The level of customer support is downright shockingly bad, unless you make a ticket on their website, to which they will respond in about 7 days.The fact they havent come out and acknowledged the problem shows their inability as a company to connect with their consumers.
