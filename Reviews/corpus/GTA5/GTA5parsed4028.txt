One of the best open world campaigns I have ever played.The most detailed open world of its scale.Driving mechanics, weapon mechanics etc is all really good.Interesting characters that make you laugh unlike other games.The mission variety is great you hardly ever feel like you are doing the same thing over and over again.Online mode, its really fun for most but there is a lot of hackers and it is very grindy so its not super great.100 must buy.
