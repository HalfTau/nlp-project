This game is poop. The game pushes high volumes of cash on everyone, they expect you to sustain a fair amount. If you dont you have cash you can buy shark cards... wtf why do we need this crap. Not only that but if you dont get enough cash to start a MC or do heists or whatever Youll always be low on cash...
