Well everyone knows this game by now, no introduction needed. Great game everything about it was, but I will say that san andreas was more fun and this game really could have benefited from las venturas and san fierro But was still great. I will also say the modding makes it amazing and that when they removed it for only like a week it did not deserve the review bombing it got.
