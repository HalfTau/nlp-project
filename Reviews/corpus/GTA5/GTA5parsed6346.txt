Alright, let me get this out of the way. GTAV/Online is a great game, and Id say its worth the full price Even though the Shark card thing is annoying However, I do have a few issues with the game that Id like to point out. First, the wanted system is a bit annoying in missions. How do they find me when I only have one star and Im unseeable by the POV theyre at? Why am I still wanted after I die? Also, the incentive for shark cards is a bit too pushy, but it doesnt really matter much to me. Plus, the single player plot of GTAV is a bit underwhelming to me, and the swimming controls are However, the game is fun with or without friends and Id recommend it to anyone who likes being the antagonist, TPS games, stealing cars, running people over or any serial killers that have a steam account! Disclaimer I do not approve of serial killers that do not drink milk.
