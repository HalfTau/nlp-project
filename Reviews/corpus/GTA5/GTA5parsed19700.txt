its a great game people are just upset that they get banned because they arem in a modded lobby and get banned. They have full controll to get out of the lobby and it is there fault they get banned. the DLC is amazing, but a little pricey, this game makes it very easy to play and find players and friend them. the graphics r great and theres nothing really bad o say about this game.
