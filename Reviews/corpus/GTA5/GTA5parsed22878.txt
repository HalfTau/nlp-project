After playing this game on consoles and now getting it here... I felt like this is the most awesome game I have ever played! I dont really care about modding and stuffmostly because I dont want to spend time installing all this s and the rest is fine for me. I have a really high FPS on my crappotop and I get around 4070 FPS.
