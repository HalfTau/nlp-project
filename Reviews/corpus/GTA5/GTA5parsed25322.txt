Single player had a fantastic, enthralling story line. Greatly enjoyed it overall. Modding made the game fun even poststory line, with all sorts of fantastic additions To single player, of coures.Online however leaves a LOT to be desired. Load times are abysmal. Heists autocancel if anyone leaves or disconnects. The game is designed to be an absolute grindfest as to encourage you to give them MORE real money for shark cards trade for ingame money And to top it all off, sometimes they randomly deduct money from your account, claiming it was not from legitimate sources. Meanwhile the ACTUAL cheaters run wild and Rockstar struggles to keep up with them, with minimal success.
