There is a lot to say about GTAV. For clarities sake, Ive barely played single player because I couldnt get used to controlling three characters.All I would say about online is that it work best when you JOIN AN ACTIVE CREW. Otherwise, youll hve nothing but the toxic s h i t heads to play with.You can usually find them squabbling amongst themselves over on the Discussions page.
