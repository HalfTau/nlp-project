You know Grand Theft Auto V is a really fun game its got a great story a huge open world  fantastic graphics if that matters to you and the open world has so much ambient events. Occasionally you will see an unmarked cop car or a mountain lion chasing a deer and people walking their dogs at the park the list can just go on and on. The story mode is really creative and the 3 main characters are interesting themselves you will meet alot of strange and unique characters through the story some you will hate other you will like. And the mods there are so many amazing mods out there for the game modders put so much work and effort to create something new and entertaining for the player to install and experience. Mods like lspdfr where you can play as a cop and install many other plugins to go with it to get a better experience out of it so thats really fun to play around with. But now about GTA ONLINE it can be fun at times but everything in it is overpriced the only way to actually enjoy it is to grind for 14 hours a day or spend 100 for a shark card so you can buy that car. you will also have to deal with modders who are pretty common but not everywhere if they drop just a few money bags chances are good rockstar will ban you some people are victims of that but dont always believe the I DIDNT DO NOTHING posts because some people want the money. Online isnt that bad i dont want to make it sound like the worst online game in the world because its not but it has alot of problems but so does everyother game.
