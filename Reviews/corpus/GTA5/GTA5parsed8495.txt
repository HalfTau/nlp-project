Decent story, ing fantastic multiplayer content. Me and a few friends frequently just drive around on our superbikes and hold down major areas, killing wave after wave of cops as they try to stop us from taking over the whole city. I remember one time where I stuntjumped off a mountain and somehow ran some poor guy over, he hunted me down for a solid hour.Overall, in love it. 9/10.Nominated for the Soul of Vitruvius award for the character Franklin Clinton, one of three main characters and the first you play as.
