Take Two just destroyed this game. completely.and now theyre banning people who arent even modding. AT ALL!save yourself the trouble of spending money on this game.Initially due to TakeTwos bad actions to tackle the modding community, I wrote a pretty negative review, but after a while, things are looking pretty good, granted that there are modders in almost every lobby, but if you can find a quite enough session to do your jobs, its still a pretty fun game.
