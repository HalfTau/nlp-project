I like many other bought this game 2 or more times. I bought the PC version alone just to play the single player with mods, to be a cop to protect the law or be dirty and make my own path of justice. However this can no longer be the case. I will no longer play this game because why would I? I have already beat the campaign twice and I will not play the multiplayer on this version when I already have millions of dollars on my Xbox. Like many others we have no desire to play the multiplayer when we can make our own world so much better with mods. The single player has not been touched since launch and has grown stale since then. Take Two thinks they are solving a problem, but they are just causing one. The player base will fall shortly after people start to get sick of the new gun runners DLC. I DO NOT recommend that you purchase this game. The reason why you would want to buy this game is gone. TLDR Mods are gone, I am not happy.Edit Now that OpenIV is back I hope Take Two learned its lesson aboutoff legit people who just want to add to the single player. After all of this I bet some will still not purchase anymore games from Take two or Rockstar. Companies may have thought people see something shiny and buy, not anymore Yes some people still do people have become smarter when it comes to buying games. I know I have gotten better at this over the years. Hopefully evryone learned something. TLDR OpenIV is back and I rambled about some sort of lesson.
