I cant speak for the online portion of the game as I havent played too much of it.However, the single player aspect gets a thumbs up from me. While the story itself is nothing to write home about, the missions itself are mostly fun and varied.What I truly love about this game though is Los Santos itself. I actually enjoy taking a relaxing long walk through the city, often times exploring the alleyways and hoping to get mugged Sadly, not possible.The con for this game is also the city itself. Even with its great attention to details, Los Santos can feel empty at times. I always wish things would happen, like uh, getting mugged.Anyway, if youre looking for a game thats not too hard to beat and offers a lot of ways to relax, I totally recommend this game.
