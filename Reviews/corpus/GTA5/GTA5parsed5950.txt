Youre just waiting all the time. Waiting for things to load, waiting for people to join, waiting for a cutscene explaining the current heist because one dude in your party hasnt done this heist before. Waiting for this, waiting for that. Oh you want to do a heist? LOL here drive to the destination which is on the other side of the ing universe. but dont worry, Lester will fill the waiting time with unnecessary information and bad jokes. LOL he said he is fat and has no luck with women XD XD XD BAZINGA HAHAHAOH nice you finally arrived at your destination, here are some dudes to kill. ok nice you killed them. that was fun! now drive back.Just do this heist like 10 times and youll be able to buy a nice car! What, youre not really interested in owning cars? ok..well buy a boat or something idunno weirdo. BOOM oh man, some guy just exploded you with his flying bike. ing hackers man, I tell you. WAIT THATS ACTUALLY A REAL VEHICLE ROCKSTAR HAVE IMPLEMENTED INTO THEIR GAME. I BET NO ONE WILL ABUSE THISTO ANNOY THE  OUT OF PLAYERS. W T FYou remember the Photo Opportunity Mission from GTA San Andreas where you had to drive across the whole ing map to take some photos of some gang members with Cesar? GTA Online is basically this mission. Im tired of this for real. If you happen to be the only dude of your friends who has a PC/GTA 5 then GG. Either you meet some friends in GTA online or youre out of luck homie. Have fun waiting for randoms to join your lobby. Oh and be careful to change any graphic settings or youll restart the whole ing game accidentally.I really want to love this game, but I just cant. Its one of the grindiest games ever, but you cant grind half the time because you have to KEEP WAITING.
