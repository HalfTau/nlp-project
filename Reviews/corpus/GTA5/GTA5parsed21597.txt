A game that could be so, so good.How do i start this, I started playing GTA V when it was just realesed, i never cheated, or modded anything, local nor on GTA Online, then i join a lobby with a cheater, dropping money on all players in this lobby, ending up with around 100  mil, i contact rockstar support about this and got an answer there is nothing that can be done.A few weeks later, i get banned, everything removed and reset, even the shark cards i bought, and the bonus of money i got when buying the game, all gone.I end up playing again after being unbanned, just to find myself in the largest deathmatch, freeroamgame where all cheaters are teleporting, exploding, shooting, and humping everyone.So i start to mod in GTA Online, to stand a chanse of playing a game i payed for, but with no luck, banned 2 more times and everything removed, got around 20k  on my account right now.So, moral of the story?I was a legit player  Got ed.I turned and modded myself money  Got edTurned to rockstar for help  Got ed.Payed 60  for this game on realese  Worst 60  i spent in my life  Got ed.Over and out.Never playing this again.
