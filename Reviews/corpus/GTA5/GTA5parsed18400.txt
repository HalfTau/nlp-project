GTA V is one of the few modern masterpieces in PC gaming along with the witcher 3, uncharted, dishonored, and many more. It features a large diverse world to explore in, a very extensive story, great gunplay, and much more. Every GTA game has been immersive and GTA V does it best great graphics, wildlife, lively peds, amazing weather system, customizable cars, and the greatest level of detail of any game Ive ever seen since the game before it GTA IV. What GTA also does thats is soo amazing is the fact it is literally many games banged into one, it has gunplay and fps mode COD, BF, racing and numerous cars and decent racing forza, n4s, etc, lively, beautiful world walking sims, and modes like online and a great modding community   take two continued modding support. But although this game is great in soo many different ways, the true mess of it is online and take two becoming another greedy company. Online is one of the worser experiences in the game, micro transactions riddled in the system, modders and hackers all over servers  Ive literally seen atleast 1 in EVERY single server Ive visited, a almost downgraded world from sp  removed animals, and other things , and extreme levels of racism, nazism, and griefing Ik this is mostly community. Overall multiplayer isnt a bad experience and is pretty decent but many modes and things in it are very generic and repetitive. GTA V is one of the greatest if not the greatest game I have pretty much played and hope Rockstar continues to keep this trend of amazing immersive open world games and possibly improve it to a new level.GTA V is definitely one of the 10/10s out their and clearly deserves top 20 games of all time.
