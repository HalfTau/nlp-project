Take two ban singleplayer mods, I disagree with the decision but I can understand them wanting to profit off a game they put a lot of work into.BUT, to ban mods that have no affect on the multiplayer experience, yet continue to provide a terrible antihack that couldnt catch a hacker with a name tag is unacceptable. If you want me to put more time and money into your multiplayer, make it a fair game. GTA V is one of the worst multiplayer experiences I have had, and I played WarZ for a while...
