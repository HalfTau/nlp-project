I will never play this game again, my entire monetary supply was wiped out and i had not recieved modded funds whatsoever. This is purely a sickening, and greedy, attempt to force players to buy shark cards. there is nothing Rockstar could say, do or offer to get me to come back and i will never purchase another product from Rockstar again. ive been playing since day one in 2013 when it came out, and have had good times with the game. Since this is how i get treated and since theyre keeping it up by banning legitamate players while leaving cheaters and hackers alone, their futile efforts to milk the game to the last dime will be the destruction of the game itself. I am DONE.
