This review is NOT FOR THE GAME ITSELF. I love the game... on PS3. Unfortunately never got to play on PC because my computer couldnt handle it even though it met specs, but since it took 3 hours to actually load the game and start it, Steam wouldnt let me refund the game. The absolutely useless game that I cant play and cant give it to someone else. I wish it was in big, bold letters before you bought a game that it was 75GB because I wouldnt have actually wasted 50 bucks. An absolute ripoff.
