Honestly brilliant game! 170 hours Great story Brilliant main characters Multiple choice endings Brilliant graphics Story is 30 hours or so Its quite a beefy game, I couldnt even play without lag and it crashing when I first got it If you suck at particular mission, the game eventually gives you the option to skip it If you have friends to play with its pretty fun, plenty of jobs to do and places to go on the map Character customization It can get boring quite quick, especially if you overplay it Cheaters and modders who ruin the experience for everyone else stealing/giving money, bombing, killing, teleporting everyone Modders can get you banned Rockstar support is not that great As soon as you spawn in you will have a target on your back and probably be murdered within 30 seconds Money is a hard thing to get a lot of unless you buy it with real money Cars/planes/helicopters etc areexpensive
