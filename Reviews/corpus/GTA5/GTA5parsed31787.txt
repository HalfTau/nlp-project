All these people giving the game a negative review because of mods.Heres an idea. Play thein offline mode, and maybe you wont have an issue... I almost guarantee 99 of these people that are ing about the mods, are the ones that ruined multiplayer!!! !I support Rockstar 150, and I couldnt be happier to see the modding community FINALLY pushed back!
