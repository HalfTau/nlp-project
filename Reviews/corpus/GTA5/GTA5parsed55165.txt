SingleplayerHours of fun in the campaign with amazing replayability, the world is full of things to do and ways to mess around. When youve 100 the game 3 times on 3 different platforms and run out of things to do there are mods. Mods in GTA are everything and with the slight hiccup with OpenIV Greedy devs. The modding scene is stable somewhat and adds many many more hours of playability.tldr Amazing and worth your moneyMultiplayerIn 1 word, Broken.Multiplayer is a broken grindfest of a mess. You will spend tens of hours grinding to get a single car or object you want Or spend money on a shark card. You will rage because your shipment you spent 10 hours grinding for was destroyied by a player for a minute reward. But you could have bought a shark card. And when a new DLC comes out you will need to grind for absurd amounts of time for the tens of millions of  needed or buy a shark card. Oh and then there are cheaters but thats another can of worms.tldr Multiplayer is basically a paid free to play model game.GTA5 singleplayer is worth your time and money, GTAO is not.
