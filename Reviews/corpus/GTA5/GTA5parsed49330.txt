After over 100 hours of gameplay, I was watched a best of GTA V mods video and finally decided I gotta try these things.  Why had I waited so long to begin with?  I went to download OpenIV, only to learn that the embargo was enacted 5 hours before I had finally made the decision to unlock the games full entertainment potential.  Go suck a grundle TakeTwo.
