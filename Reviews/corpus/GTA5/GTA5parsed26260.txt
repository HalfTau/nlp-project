The singleplayer is a lot of fun, but No Linux support The publisher is fighting mods The multiplayer is a microtransaction filled grindfest.So I cant recommend this game. Too bad, because it had a lot of potential and the singleplayer is pretty fun. Although, the single player alone is certainly not worth your 30/30
