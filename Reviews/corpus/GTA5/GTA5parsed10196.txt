I have to say, despite the good graphics, humorous writing and gameplay, the game is seriously let down by mission glitches. Countless hours spent waiting for something to happen, or trying to activate the next mission. I spent almost as long on Google trying to find out how to progress the game. Some enjoyment but ultimately a frustrating experience.
