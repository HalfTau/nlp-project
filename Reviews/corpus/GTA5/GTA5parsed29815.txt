Take 2 Interactive and Rockstar Games have killed the Grand Thef Auto franchise by not listening to their community base and removing features from the singleplayer and multiplayer aspects of the game. Specifically, modding. Modding was a HUGE portion of the single player and many players, including myself, enjoyed the halrious and great time I had in single player. Its really what kept the fire of playing Grand Theft Auto alive for so long. They have absoulutly flooded that fire with water now, by removing the one thing the community liked and enjoyed, you kill your franchise.
