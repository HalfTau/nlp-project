GTA5 is in and of itself a great game. I am leaving a negative review for two major reasons that have to do with the way rockstar treats its customers.The first issue I have is the modding scandal they and take two tried to pull with Open IV.The second issue I have is that this game has a verification check in offline mode to combat piracy. This is an issue because the entire point of an offline mode is to be able to play when you dont have a connection. How am I supposed to verify my copy when im trying to play offline mode? It defeats the purpose entirely. This leaves me in a situation right now where I wont have internet on my main PC for the next four days, and I cannot play the game that I spent 30 on because the developers decided to implement this ridiculous feature that randomly doesnt allow you to play your game. It is insane that this feature is allowed, I spent money on this SINGLE PLAYER GAME and I cant play it offline.
