Are you only interested in the singleplayer? Go ahead, GTA V feels like a worthy improvement over its predecessor for most of the time.Do you want to play with other people? Halt! Dont expect that you are going to play a game that had an initial cost. This territory of the game follows a freetoplay scheme. Its astonishing to see Rockstar  Take Two get away with such a heavy microtransactionbased system. If you fall into their trap, you would only be supporting their shady behavior to expand in the next installments.Its not like this is a cooperative online game, either. No. There is hardly any collaboration between strangers. All everyone does is mindlessly kill and bully each other on freeroam mode. Missions are not great either. Granted, the gameplay feels awesome. But the implementation of a leaderboard system in which only the winner gets the spotlight ruins the feeling of accomplishment if you dont finish on the front. Oh and lets not forget about the half of your time that was spent on the loading screen.I rarely feel like I made a mistake by purchasing a game. But I wish I was able to refund this one.
