This is a great game but it has one major drawback... THE LOADING TIMES. they are insane. each time i login to gta online guess how long it takes. Roughly 5 minutes. this is the longest i have waited in a game. The game constantly crashes after heists. The singleplayer is perfect. It only takes about 23 minutes to load in and the singleplayer is really fun to play, and that is the only reason this is recommended, but most people only get gta v for multiplayer and the experience is really trashy. I hope they fix the online.
