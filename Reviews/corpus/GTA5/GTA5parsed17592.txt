This game had so much potential to start with when i played on the XBOX 360.The story was amazing and the online was better!But when hack users trolled multiple lobbies it became worse to play!!However the biggest sore point was when i purchased 100 worth of in game money and some hacker decided to drop money on me in a lobby.Naturally i wasnt bothered as who can complain about more money, but when my account was reset the following week not even crediting the money i had purchased i was extremely mad!I spoke to a member of the online ticket team with no luck so called their support line..Both told me they wouldnt even look into the issue and ended communitcation!Moral of the story, ROCKSTAR are greedy scammers who have no care for their players at all !!
