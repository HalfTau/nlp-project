Ive had the game 8 months now on PC and what I like most is modding the game to have realistic graphics and fun as hell gameplay. Theres constant updates that turn out to need more updates that fix the updates from before. But over time the updates do a lot of bug fixing to the world of GTA 5. So to me, the updates are good things. Not much I can find that I dont like about the game. Most of its problems are usually just temporary.I more than recommend this game to gamers, I think its a nobrainer to add to your collection if youre into this type of game.
