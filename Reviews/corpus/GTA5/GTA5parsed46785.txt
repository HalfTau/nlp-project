UPDATE Thank you R and TT for solving the issue with OpenIV and listening to your most loyal fans.I love your work and with single player modding back I can recomment GTAV to everyone!Take Two decided to basically forbid Single Player Modding after allowing it for four years, destroying the entire community in the process.The reason given was some vague relation to OPENIV being also used for MultiPlayer cheating. This should technically be impossible, so the real reason behind it is probably to draw more people into MP and ultimately to sell more Shark Cards.Objectively speaking, I dont think this is good business. Take Two should work with the community and enable them to deliver highquality mods Mod Kit and not against them. I believe there is much more to gain if Management decides to embrace the Modding Community. Over protectionism of a brand never helps.I personally dont care about MP. I have never played GTAO and never will. I do however enjoy SP content a lot and I love the mods out there. Killing SP DLC is a huge blow to me and probably a NoGo, even though the game is great.R and Take Two promised SP DLC in the beginning, but never delivered. This wasnt great, but it wasnt a big deal either since there was plenty of Mods for SP to choose from.Killing mods ultimately kill my GTAV experience, because I like to mod my game into reality Real LA, and so on and to have real Cars availableI do not recommend buying the game anymore.Would you like to know morePETITIONSMORE INTEL
