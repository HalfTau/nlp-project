Im very dissapointed. I really really liked the game. played on X box 360 and now PC. Saved up 3 years to build a pc just to play GTA 5 due to LSPDFR. Enjoyed LSPDFR and GTA Online so much till my dad Who is definitely too dumb to hack XD got falsely banned. Final nail in the coffin is the fact that the LSPDFR i used to play is illegal now. Most are angry about this situation. But honestly, im just sad and dissapointed Take 2.Ive loved you for so long but i think my love for you has legit died now .
