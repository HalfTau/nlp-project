Grand Theft Auto ends here. One of the best franchises that has spanned decades has been ruined by corporate greed. The base game was fantastic but all future potential has been stamped out by shark card microtransactions. Single player DLC has gone up in smoke and rarely do they add anything new to it. Everything interesting is instead exclusive to the terrible online mode where youre forced to either grind countless hours for enough cash to buy anything or spend real money on some shark cards.The only silver lining was a budding modding community which Take 2 is now threatening legal action against. Dont support companies like this. I wish I hadnt now.
