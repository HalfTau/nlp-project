Take 2 is a ing  company getting rid of harmless SINGLE PLAYER ONLY mods because someone somewhere else is hacking like ing Neo with entirely different mods online. Stamping out mods makes me not want to get the next GTA, on top of that therell be more fee to pay transactions in it from what the company says. If they dont undo this, GTA5 will be the last GTA I buy and should be yours too. Cant say I didnt see this game turning toafter a week or two ago.
