TakeTwo/Rockstar are actively trying to stop SinglePlayer modding, because they want YOU to play GTA Online and buy sharkcards.This wasnt always the case, but sadly this game became a grindfest. Unless you want to spend evening after evening grinding mission, to be able to buy a single new car then this game is not for you!
