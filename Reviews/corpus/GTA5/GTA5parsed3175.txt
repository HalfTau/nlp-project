Dont buy this game for GTA Online ! Its a waste of time1. The modders  In GTA online, there is a lot of 8 years old kid who cheat... Like a lot !There is three type of modders The one who gives money to everyone neutralthe one who create event Correctand the one who simply destroy your fun by spawning explosion on you Imagine, you make a 300 000  delivery with your friend when, suddenly, someone spawns behind you and explodes you until you find new sessions2. The broken AntiCheat system, where innocent gets banThere is a lot of innocent player getting ban for no reason, and when they try to get unban, Rockstar doesnt give a  about them and keep the banNo, I never got ban from GTA, but my friend did, and if you dont believe me, just go into the GTA V discussion 3 there is post about that.3. If you dont have friend to play it, good luck doing a heist !There is a lot of people who dont know how to play a mission without dying... And there is a lot of people who ragequit because you fail the mission one time.So, in conclusion, if you planning to buy GTA only to play GTA Online, its a very bad decission. If you dont like my review and want to buy GTA online anyways, just read the communauty discussions before !
