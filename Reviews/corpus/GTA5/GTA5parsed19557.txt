This is a great game and lots of fun.But more and more Rockstar is expressing their insatiable GREED!!!!!!!!!!! !They tax you to death on business you cant sell if you change your mind, charge you insane amounts of money for the fun vehicles and necessary properties, and then make it very difficult to make good money unless you have a skilled group that puts in a ton of time. They also make you play in groups or with open world griefers which severly limits your options to earn and have fun solo.All of this is so they force you to buy their extremely expensive Shark Cards. I will never play another Rockstar game again unless they fix their destructive GREED.
