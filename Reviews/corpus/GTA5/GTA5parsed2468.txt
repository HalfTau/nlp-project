Honestly it has became to much of a grind.... Its gotten to the point where I dont even want to put more hours into this game anymore! Rockstar is stooping down Greedy Dev Status. I do not expect them to change their minds but when they do this review might change. Its just scary, if GTA V is this P2W, think of what might become of RDR II!
