This game has a long history with the modding community, but now it seems to have decided to cut those ties for a little bit more money on online, even screwing over people who only enjoy singleplayer.Now theyve encouraged people to pirate a older version of their game to play with mods, i dont get how can they be so stupid and money grabbing, if they would have done it in a smarter way..Ill list the decisions that ruined this game there may be more or they may be in the wrong orderNot adding a single DLC for singleplayer since initial releasebut theyll add new stuff for you to buy on online with their sharkcardsBanning people for modding on online freemodeIntroduction of shark cardsReduction of payout massively in every mission possible to encourage buying sharkcardsNot giving a single  to what their community says,Not adding a ACTUAL antihack since releaseBanning Open IVStill having the same glitches, bugs, loading screens that take more than 30 minutes, crashes, so on.Horrendous Online and Modding policies
