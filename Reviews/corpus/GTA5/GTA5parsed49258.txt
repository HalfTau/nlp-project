This games singleplayer is actually really good I already had this game on PS3 and got it again on PC because its that good and ofcourse for modding as well, however the online is a cash grabbing pile ofand the fact that they removed Open IV which did not harm them in any way is just infuriating and I cannot over look that fact that is why im just not recommending it.
