Killing your player bases ability to enjoy the single player game because youve neglected it in favour of pushing your multiplayer mode so you can make more money is disgusting. OpenIV didnt break any of the rules nor did it allow people to use mods in multiplayer. I dont see any reason to keep playing GTA V if Take Two doesnt want me to play it how I want to.
