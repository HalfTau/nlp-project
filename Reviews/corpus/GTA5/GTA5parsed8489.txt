You want to shoot?  You can.You want to race?  You can.You want to do sport? You can.You want to jump out of a freakin plane at 3000 feet and parachute on your 3 million dollar yacht? And than dive in deepest deeps of the ocean with your octopus to find guns on sunken ships?  No problem.What the hell do you want more!?Do you MAYBE want to rob a ing bank in downtown in middle of a day, and than spend all the ing money in a strip club!? Guess what... You can do even this... You madman!There you have it. The game with all genres. If you didnt play GTA, you are not a gamer.The online portion is messed up with greedy microtransactions, but fortunately nobody is forcing you to spend money. At least not direct.
