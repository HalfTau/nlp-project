Gta 5 single player pretty fun, not worth 60 bucks though.Now that they killed single player mods there is no reason to go back to single player.Gta 5 multiplayer cashgrab, they should honestly rename shark cards to whale cards because that is how rockstar sees you, as some casino whale they can squeeze every last penny out of. Every new update has several vehicles that are in every way better than what has been out previously, but ofcourse these new vehicles come with a price tag anywhere between 1 and 5 mil, and guess what? 71 euro for 1mil ingame.Besides the cash grab online has had issues with hackers for the longest time, do you enjoy getting randomly blown up along with everyone else on the server? play some online.Okay lets ignore freeplay and do some races against 5mil custom vehicles that you have no chance of winning against.Be warned though because your loading screen is going to take about 30 minutes, but atleast when all the custom cars leave you in their dust you can have a cruise around the city, because for some stupid reason the game loads the entire map for every single race, ever wondered why the loading screens are 30 min? Its because ofstupid decisions like that.
