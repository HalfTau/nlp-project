The single player campaign is fine, but even before the Open IV scandal, Take Two and Rockstars attitude towards mods was weird. If I had it to do over, Id go back and not buy the game just to protest their stance of modding of single player content.You dont have to make it easy to do or give us tools but dont try to tell people what they can and cant do with their purchases.
