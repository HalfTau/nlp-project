Up untill a few days ago, I would had said a positive review for this game. Even with all the modders in online that exist only to grief players.Even when they keep purging the money modders give you, I still say this game is good and fun.Even when they banned single player mods that are unusable in online. I would still be positive for this game.But a few days ago, they corrected my online account, because they claimed I had modded cash. Said modded cash was a frigging Sharkcard, which had a 40 bonus money.Thats right, Rockstar REMOVES money you legitimately buy from them.Even EA isnt as scummy as this. Those actually respond to tickets.
