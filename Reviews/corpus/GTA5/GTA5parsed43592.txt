R.I.P OpenIV. 2008  2017.  you TakeTwo.EDIT Open IV came back like a week later that month. If you dont want deal with tryhards spamming the orbital cannon or flying around in hydras and weaponized jetpacks because they have a more disposable income than you, stick to single player. Many different mods and scripts and other stuff such as all dlc vehicles and weapons you can play around with by yourself. For free. Without the hassle of grinding 24/7 or scraping up money to buy sharkcards. Such a shame that Rockstar turned online into a Pay2Win.
