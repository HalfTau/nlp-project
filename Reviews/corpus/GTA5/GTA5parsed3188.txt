Ill be honest and recommend the game for single player, but you really dont make any progress during onlie play because Rockstar are basically turning this into a mobile game, where to actually enjoy it youll need do make microtransactions if you call 80 dollars a microtransaction at all. Reducing the amout of money you could get from sellig a car or completing a mission and skyrocketing the price of everything in the game is completely unfair and made me regret spending money to buy the game. I might play online one day or another, but i really refuse do inject actual money to be able to enjoy any game. At the begining, rockstar nailed everything they needed to make this game good, now they got greedy and started milking it. I would like to invite everybody to complain about this like they did with openIV untill rockstar makes this enjoyable again.
