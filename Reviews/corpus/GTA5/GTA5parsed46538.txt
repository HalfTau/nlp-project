Absolutely do not recommend.Singleplayer postlaunch content was promised leading up to release, but all thats some out is more things to spend real world money on in Grind Theft Auto Online.Its garbage, youll play for hundreds of hours, half of which spent looking at loading screens, all so you can afford a car BECAUSE YOU CANT STEAL CARS IN ONLINE OR GET GOOD WEAPONS ETC.I genuinely hate how they ruined the legacy left by GTA 4 with great DLC and freedom in the online mode.Not to mention the increasing crackdowns on mod content.I dont feel like I got robbed for paying AAA prices, I feel like I got robbed, then spat on.
