Due to the recent issue with Take Two and OpenIV, Im going to have to give this game a negative review.Modding is a HUGE part of GTA, and keeps the game refreshing and not stale, while being nondamaging to the online players.OpenIV doesnt affect multiplayer whatsoever, and solely focuses on interesting additions to singleplayer.Fix your Take Two.
