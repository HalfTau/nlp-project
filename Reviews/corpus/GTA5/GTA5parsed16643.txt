Got banned for a month for modding. First Ban. Modded in Singleplayer which is allowed in the tos.Next ban is a perma ban. Wooohoo!Actual modders flood the servers and kill the entire server.Are they ban?Probably not.Random Money adjustmentsWhether its legit or not.Rocktar periodically will change players money. Some may lose all their money. Millions that were legit. Some will lose small amounts.I have friends who have never modded. Get a cash dropped on their head and they cant do anything to prevent it.Where are they now?Banned.Lastly. Customer Support is a joke.Anyone can get banned. No appeal process but they give an option to appeal.ALL BANS ARE FINAL. EVEN FALSE ONES.You may be next.So enjoy.Character Resetted for nothing. All my money. My cars gone. Have to start new.My level 200 character from PSN and my level 30 for PC. Gone.Both Gone.So if you care for a decent game. Look elsewhere
