TakeTwo has taken one step back from their War On Modding, which brings me one step closer to recommending this game. Lets be real though, the approval rating on this game will probably never go above 70 ever again.Online is too much of a grind, unless youre one of the many many players that added funds to your account through the innumerable various nonlegitimate methods that are available. The most recent update to Online only reinforces this, forcing players to wait hours for a timer to run down just to unlock the ability to purchase an item unless theyre willing to spend big bucks.I only recommend buying this game if youre interested in the single player campaign. The single player mode is incredibly well polished and entertaining, and probably worth the current Summer Sale price 50 off. The game is definitely not worth full price in its current state. Try to ignore Online modes existence when making a purchase decision because it will lead to nothing but disappointment.
