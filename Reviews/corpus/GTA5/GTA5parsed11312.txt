Their is not much to say other than this game is still one of the exciting fun games I have played. I have played this game on both PS3, PS4 and I have now moved into the PC world of GTAV. With all the experience I have had with this game I can tell you it still holds and will probably still hold in the next few years. The only downside is I had to actually start from scratch again on GTA online since Rockstar discontinued the transfer process. However restarting your whole GTA online progress is still fun since as soon as you reach rank 120 what else is their to do? When I saw this game on the steam store I looked at the page and noticed that it had mixed reviews. Upon further inspection I noticed that the negative part of the review was due to the fact that the player could not mod which is not a justifiable reason to hate the game. If you want to mod play a game that was actually meant for modding.
