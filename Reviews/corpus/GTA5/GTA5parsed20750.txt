Despite the fact that I still play GTA Vs Online it just really isnt worth it anymore.It just takes so long to get money to spend on anything anymore theres a neat car thats just shaped like a ramp thats fun to mess around with friends but its 3,000,000. but you still need to spend another 2,000,000 in order to get a suitable place to store it which you cant even buy until you also buy a 2,000,000 Office building.Thats 7,000,000 for a below average car shaped like a ramp, 100 real life dollars will get you only 8,000,000.The servers are so insanely fragile and Ive never seen a game have these same problems, I have never ever had to open any ports for any other game and Rockstar insists its necessary for Online and it still doesnt fix any issues anyway.Its impossible for new players to get anywhere in online now because Rockstar just milk the game for money.The only time the game gets anywhere near fun is if youre using over the top high end vehicles which are near impossible to get without spending extra money on them.Rockstar has put very little effort to get rid of any of the negative parts of the games and only puts their effort into more and more cars with arbitrary limitations that you either must spend more money than you spent on the game itself to GET STARTED or grind out the same missions over and over and over again for a fraction of what the time spent doing it is worth.The game honestly just isnt worth it. the servers are so fragile and it just takes so long to earn anything that comes close to fun that its just not worth playing the game at all.
