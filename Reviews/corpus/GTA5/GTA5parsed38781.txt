sigh I havent even got a chance to play this yet beyond a few hours.Developer  on fanbase  highly unrecommended. Had I not bought this long ago, Id be asking for a refund just based on their removal of modding.Its a sad, sad day and a ton of lost respect for a company I previously held in incredibly high regards.I will be looking VERY hard at future releases this careless abandon for your fans has left a very poor taste in my mouth and likely will take my money elsewhere in the future.Shame on whoever was responsible for this.EDIT Uninstalled game until this is suitably addressed, if that happens.
