The latest DLC just completely unbalances the game and makes it impossible for anyone not interested in it. The explosive rounds are just impossible to avoid and give no prior warning like missiles.Take 2 can shove their microtransaction greedy game up their . Especially as after all their antimod ideas, I still get my weapon wheel emptied and my game ruined by hackers. Great work done by idiots in suits.
