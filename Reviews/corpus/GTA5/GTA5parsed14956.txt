The GTA V was ok, but dont bother with GTA Online. Between the hackers, the worst customer service, and huge costs to unlock new content, online gameplay is more trouble than it is worth. The game itself should really only be 20 at full price since it was released over 2 years ago, and online is basically justbeing painfully poor for days of gameplay until some hacker gives you money to spend until customer service resets your account which is really just a matter of time because whoever staffs their customer service really doesnt care, they just look for suspicious activity and might not check whether youd bought a shark card or gotten a log in bonus. Once they take action, they dont trust you anymore either.Youre gonna have a bad time
