DISCLAMERThis is my personal opinion on the game. Dont get butthurt please.Good game but you need friends in order to have fun. I mean you can almost do anything from selling coke to stealing cargo in order to sell it on the stock market. But solo is boring AF. At least 3 people required to have a good time. EDIT StoryThe story is ok. Not better than GTA IV and not even close to GTA SA but its ok and its fun, even though R still own us a fcking Story Mode DLC but whatever.OnlineAfter a month After the new update I can say that the Online experiance is out of fcking controll. Before Doomsday Heist the game was OK. It was fun with friends and all but after the new update the game has gone to sht. A game that you suppose to start as a Hustler and slowly progress in order to become a Kingpin has gone to Nuclear Warfare and WW3. Hell, this aint GTA no more. Its ing WW3 simulator. FFS R the online has gone to absolute SHT.ConclusionIf you are looking to buy the game grab it while its on sale cause this game aint worth more than 25 bucks anymore. If you pay full price you just wasted your savings. You will enjoy the Story but you will find the Online kinda weird. Old school players like me that we used to play on Old Gen PS3, Xbox360 will remember the good old days of hustling and grinding.Peace. Im out.
