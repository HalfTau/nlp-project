Until you guys post a definitive statement about modding that actually tells me that you wont try to half take it away again, I will not give you a positive review nor buy any more of your games. TakeTwo/R, stop hiding behind legalese and be straightforward. If big companies like Microsoft and Google can do it and be cut and dry, so can you. Until then, I refuse to buy any more games published by TakeTwo.The dumb moneygrab instituted by them in the form of asinine shark cards, along with a HORRIBLE builtin P2P multiplayer drives me away. SAMP at least has communities that are very good and supportive, along with good RP MP. You guys had 10 years to get what SAMP and MTASA did in less time as far as MP goes.DO NOT buy this game, dont subsidize their moneygrubbing. At least EA is honest when they rip you off.
