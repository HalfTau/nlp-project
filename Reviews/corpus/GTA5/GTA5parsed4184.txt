Story is great, online is kinda meh but it all depends on whether youre playing with friends or by yourself. People online can be either unreasonable or friendly. Again, it all depends on the server you end up in. Admittedly most of my playtime is on GTAO. A complaint I have is that everything even remotely nice you can buy online is incredibly expensive, and getting enough money to pay for it all is easier said than done. Overall, though, almost 500 hours later I am still finding new things in Los Santos to mess around with, and I have yet to be truly bored. Would definitely recommend to anyone willing and allowed to play. 9.5/10
