Now that I cannot usefully mod the singleplayer game, the game is essentially no fun. The base game is fun for 45 hours, and then runs out of enjoyable content. The multiplayer mode can be fun, but the microtransaction model is ridiculous. As of June 18, 2017, I would not recommend anyone buy this game.
