Holy crow, i just noticed i have oover 1000 hours played on GTA V combined with Console...This game is a very fun game of running around killing people, and destroying their precious cars. Beware of the very common, very deadly twelve year old. If you destroy their cars, you probably just blew your eardrums out since they literally autistically screech at you.You have been warned.
