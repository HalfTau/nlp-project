I only play thisfor the heist thingy, got a buggy game with a buggy heist. Even if they answered their customer service, that wont help this game. They even wanted to get away by banning mod back then, what a shadyPSA Play this game with friends, seriously. Basically only 0.1 of the server people will help you, others?
