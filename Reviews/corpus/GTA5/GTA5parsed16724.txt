I just had to open my mouth about this game. since it breaks my heart.I absolutely loved the game at start ...Looks absolutely stunning.Great single player overal experience.Great online fun , having your own boat , aptThe above Pros still stand , so if you have an itch to try this game and its on sale, why not.But my interest has dropped dramaticly since the last few updates.They started with have your own office ... well ok was nice , unique cars , be a Ceo , new missions.Offices , overpriced but was still worth it their bloodlust for you to buy sharkcards grew.One hand in your wallet, they try to put a second one in , have your own Motorcycle club , yeeey.Oh wait .... its overpriced oh its kinda ,... a reskin of the office idea.SharkcardsSharkcardsSharkcardsSharkcardsSharkcardsSharkcardsSharkcardsSharkcardsSharkcardsSharkcards.When they thought they didnt sell enough sharkcads yet... They bring out .. bunkers .. same.thing.Not to mention they force you to go into public lobbys to get anything done for the office reskin overpriced stuff .. wich means yes you will be swamped by 12yr olds crying raging kids who arnt even allowed to have the game in the first place.It still has nice content , races , open world messing around with planes ...Id advise only buy this game when its on sale and you dont intend to buy shark cards but unfortunately its almost a must if you dont want this game to be an insaaaaaane grind .. and at least 3 friends that also play it since doing heists with randoms is a nightmare. oh and mute voip.
