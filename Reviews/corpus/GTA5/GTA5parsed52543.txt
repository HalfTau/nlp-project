A game purely designed to sell you shark cards by making it such a grind to earn money that a part time job is a more time efficient way to play the game. but now you take away single player mods just cos you feel undermonetizing on a peruser basis. you also claim that open iv is being used in multiplayer malicious, however from my experience the only reason people hack in the muliplayer is cos they dont want to pay to play  and rather lack luster content, what happened to a single player expantion? what happened to the heist the only real mulitplay content and the only way to actually make money
