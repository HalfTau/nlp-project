 you, TakeTwo.The only reason I kept playing this game was checking out new mods, but I guess you dont care much about your player base. I predict GTA Online will still be infested with cheaters and exploiters cuz they dont even need OpenIV to do so ,but without modding tool for good players that had fun in story mode. you once again, TakeTwo, and watch me downloading pirated version of your next game instead of buying it.
