Grand Theft Auto V is a game based in LA and its very close to real life. The single player story is really good and you play as three characters, Michael, Trevor and Franklin. Although this is an odd gameplay choice it surprisingly works very well.The online is good, but its the unrealistic side of GTA with flying motorcycles and cars with parachutes, its a lot of fun with friends. There are also multiple missions and heists that you can partake in.Rating 9/10
