A while ago ive written a negative review ostracizing R on their treatment of singleplayer modders and the like. While theyve gone back and rectified this, I still cant recommend this game.First off, the game has an abysmal amount of grinding. Im aware that GTA Online isnt the only one who does this, however it is one of the worst offenders. To the point that some items like a yacht that does basicly next to nothing, cost up to 10.000.000 of ingame currency which is about 75,. the most expensive sharkcard avaible. And with every update more and more expensive vehicles, homes and businesses keep getting added whilst nerfing the older stuff to entice people to buy the new stuff. And the new businesses that are being added barely make enough money to cover the investments that you made to set it up. All of this is being done just to sell more Sharkcards.And if that isnt bad enough, there are hackers in nearly every goddamned online session.Sure some are practicly harmless and give you loads of money, however the vast majority stops at nothing to act like a pain in the neck. Ive lost count of how many times ive entered a session only to get blown up along with everybody else in the session. Some people have even had their money taken away by these hackers and had their levels decreased. Any other company would have done their best to get rid of this menace as soon as possible protecting their investment and all that. Not Rockstar though, The worst thing that can happen is that these hackers get booted from Rockstar Socialclub. Only for them to go on greymarket sites and buy a key for 25, and do it all over again.I could go on and on about what is wrong with GTA Online, however that would mean id be busy typing this review till next year.In short if youre looking for a fun online game to play with your friends, look elsewhere.
