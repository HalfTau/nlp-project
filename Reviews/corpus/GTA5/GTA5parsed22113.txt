10/10 story mode, but GTA Online is too hard to get into. Ignore the reviews rating this game down for modding controversy, as its already been back for awhile now. You can STILL MOD THE GAME. Graphics options are amazingly optimized too. Even with a 2GB card you can run the game with most things high/maxed out and be fine.
