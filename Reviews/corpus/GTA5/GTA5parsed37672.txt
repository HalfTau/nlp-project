This may be painful to give such a rating but in support of OpenIV, my favorite modding program I must. Without OpenIV and Mods such as Realism Dispatch enhanced One of my favorites, and others I just cannot find the game fun. I never was much of a GTA Online player as I enjoyed myself much more in the singleplayer world and without alterations to the game it becomes the same boring old los santos it has been since 2013. The game doesnt even spark an interest without mods in my opinion but anyhow. I give this rating due to the blandness of the game without mods.UPDATE Due to the allowance of OpenIVs operationg I change my review to positive.
