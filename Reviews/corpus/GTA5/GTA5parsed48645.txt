TakeTwo is very zelous in protecting the broken Online component of GTA V.  The multiplayer is mostly P2P and short of them redesinging it, it will always be vulnerable to cheating. However, the biggest annoyance is the Shark Card crap. Its such an obvious cash grab when hackers can easily spawn in money since aformentioned P2P multiplayer issues.Single player is alright, but is disjointed due to switching between 3 main characters.
