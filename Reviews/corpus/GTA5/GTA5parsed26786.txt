I liked the game but as they seem to have no desire to give a damn about their community and think we are stupid. Takeing ligal action against a moding framework that has no effect on online play is an insult to the community. And they can take their damnd shark cards and shove them up their CEOsEdit Rockstar and their publisher have pulled back on this decision but that dosnt change the fact that they tried and lied about why.Edit Also as a gameplay review.Short review The Story is fun but dont expect story expansions they have no intrest in doing so. As for gta online it starts out as fun but as you slowly will learn all the fun vehicles are locked behinde grinding 500 hours of grinding the same heist over and over again or spending 100 for like 2 or 3 vehicles and all new content for it would cost 400 or 500 dollars to skip the grind and all the new content would probably beand this is a generous estimation worth 60 dollars.
