I am giving this game a 7.5/10... Okay, so this game is a MAJOR upgrade from GTA 4. This is mostly played for online, i havent played the campaign yet but i will update this when i do. In terms of the online, i think this game is okay. One major problem is the modders.. Some are okay and will stop if you ask, Some will rank you up, give you money, crash your game, spawn NPCs stuck on you, give you all guns, spawn cars. And some are cool in a way where they will make a race for you. But i think the modders need to be dealt with. This game also has one major fault... In order to buy say a mobile operations base semi truck with the trailer base thing you MUST own a bunker. The cheapest bunker is 1.2 mil.. plus over one mil for the MOB Mobile Operation Base.. it almost makes this game feel p2w Pay to Win..Then when some guy is flying at you in his delorean and your in your Lambogini that costs 5k to get back from the insurance co. it gets annoying... It also takes a while to be put in a session. And then when you finally load in, theres an annoying modder and you wait a while to find a new session. If you also meet the right people, you can have friends.. I met at least 3 people so far willing to help me make money legitly, show me the stuff they have such as cars, air vehicles, and more. Then others dont even care and just throw a sticky bomb on your car and KABOOM you gone..... And dont get me started on the cops..... Also NPCs driving, they will cut out infront of you and your nice new shiny million dollar car you just got, is wrecked.....I think that Rockstar needs to no matter how long or hard they have to try  get rid of modders... I know they are trying their best right now.. Also, lower prices for ingame stuff... I am saying yes i recommend this game because i have it above 5.. I did get the game on sale. If you dont feel like paying 60 for it, then wait for the next sale.
