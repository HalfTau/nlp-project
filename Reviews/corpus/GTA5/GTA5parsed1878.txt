Singleplayer is good, but the biggest part of the game is the online mode.The online mode is Absolute garbage. Its fun for a little while but soon you realize its repetative, uninspired, full of cheaters and hackers who can, and most likely will get YOU banned for even being around them, wether you realize or not..The heists in multiplayer has the potential of being amazing, but between the absurdly long loading times, the random people you often have to join up with unless you got 3 friends willing to wade through thethat is this multiplayer, the random people who more often than not in my experience either just  around and fails the mission, or just simply leaves/afks making you restart.And of course in the vein of the how that is EA, microtransactions out the wazoo. In multiplayer you WILL get annihalted on a regular basis by people who have paid to get fighter jets with lockon missiles, actual tanks and armed and armored vehicles, super weapons of all kinds, while if you dont pay youre stuck withfor, well... anything really, for the good 80 or so of your playtime on multiplayer, as getting that amount of money without paying real money is tedious at best.If theres a heavy sale, get it for singleplayer. Anything else is just not worth it, certainly not the full price.
