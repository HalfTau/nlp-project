One of the greatest single player experiences of all time.One of the WORST online experiences of all time. That is if you arent ready to drop LITERALLY multiple hundreds of dollars on a game in microtransactions. Or using hacks. Use hacks. More worth your while. Just dont abuse the power given to you. Also online sucks if you have less than 3 friends to do the heists or anything at all pretty much.But still ONE OF THE GREATEST SINGLE PLAYER EXPERIENCES OF ALL TIME.
