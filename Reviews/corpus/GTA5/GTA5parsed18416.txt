The singleplayer is really the only reason this game is good, which i spent a good 30 hrs on. Out of the 280hrs of play time on this game i would say 80hrs of the game was due to loading or freezing and another 50 hrs were spent just wating in lobbies becuase it is not a friendly community and most players are just greedy for money Cant blame them, thats what rockstar is pushing them to do. The Online has so much potential, but alas the way you recieve money is tedious and not enojoyable after the 100th time. The online asks for so much money real and in game currency with very little content.  I stopped playing about a year ago becuase it was bad. I came back to see the new content played for about 30 min and saw it got worse. People who buy this game in its current state will never be able to play the full extent of online unless they are willing to spend hundreds of dollars, or put even more tedious hours than I.
