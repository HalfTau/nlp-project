Although the thourough enjoyment I get whilst playing this game, The servers are full of cheaters online and it is a very pay to win game. The more money you have, the more power. I cant stress enough on how innocent players are getting banned due to Rockstar being lazy and having sht anticheat. Up your game Rockstar... Overall I would give the game a yes when it comes to recommending, however players must embrace the fact that they have a chance of getting banned if they have connections to cheating, whether its for the ingame currency or the leveling system. I personally have not been Banned Yet and hope not to be. Rockstar needs to stop these false cheating claims and needs to figure a way to deal with the ACTUAL Cheaters/exploiters...
