Ah, the grand GTA V. Once a fun game full of modding potential, now reduced to what it really was all along a money printer for Rockstar. Sorry that we dont like your crappy online mode where you either grind or fork over more money than you spent on the original game. I guess well all just go play something else.Rest in peace, GTA V.Rest in peace.
