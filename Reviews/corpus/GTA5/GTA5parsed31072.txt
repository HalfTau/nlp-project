I have hated Rockstar and Take Two ever since they stop updating the Single Player. But im finally over it because i can use mods to play and fully enjoy the multiplayer content, but then, they took it all away from me, from us, the modding community. Its like youve taken the biggest part i like about this game, and just as easy as that. Im not sorry for downvoting this game, because im truly disappointed at you, this game has many potential to be a great open world single player game that can be modded, but no, you just want people to buy your frickin game sharks.RIPOPENIVRIPGTAV
