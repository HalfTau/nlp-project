Single player was fun but when its over you are left with a multiplayer experience which will turn you off the game completely. In order to enjoy multiplayer at all you must invest hundreds more of your own dollars through shark cards due to rediculously expensive dlc products, add that with a huge hacking community and you have a game that once was great but now I prefer taking  that burn so much Im left in tears.
