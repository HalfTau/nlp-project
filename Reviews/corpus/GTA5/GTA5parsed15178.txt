Ive always wanted to write something interesting on GTAV,but also Ive been struggling with figuring out what to write and with my poor choices of  words.Therefore,Id like to apologize in advance in case my words dont appeal to whoever is reading this.Apparently,its one of the best game that Ive ever played.That I myself playing gtaiii since I was a kid left me unforgettable memories. Pity those days are gone.Enough with nostalgia,as usual, Im not gonna talk about how the story goes or analyse the characters within our 3 protagonist.There are plenty of articles on the internet.Anyways, apart from the long loading,which is really frustrating,it only took me a few minutes to immerse myself in this open and nonreal digital city. I do enjoy my free roaming and exploring.Later did I know the fact that there is no such city in a movie that we can see a world so detailed like Los Santos or even live to be so overwhelmed by its noise, loneliness and deprivity.And, Rockstar rocks.They made the best story and the best city there ever is.No one can deny.The last time I ever saw the characters in games such full of fresh and blood were in The Call Of Duty Modern Warfare series  Ghost, Soap,Price,etc. And now, here.You can see Los Santos is an imaginary city based on Los Angeles,but who are the prototypes of the Michaels three?Guess well never have to find outThreeMan Army against the whole world and became billionaires.American Dreams.Anyway,Roaming,fighting crimes, killing innocent,heisting,paparazzing,air force,tank,sports,motor sports,American Truck Simulator,Uber taxi driver,etc and even have sex.That size of game files doesnt fail its content, Gtav is a true masterpiece.Violence is the soul of the game,It has never changed.Just as violent as the story can be , instead of the NPCs, in Online Mode the perpetrators may be as far as the malicious players themselveshacker or perhaps the officials who ban normal players who never cheatof course hackers deserves to be banned for good.I can relate to how our prides are being deprived,how hackers mess with us by exploding our vehicles with us in it,how we get banned for no reason. Therefore,we send out our complaints and curse whoever there is to hell. Its not a bad way actually. On the contrary,how else are we supposed to do to make them hear us out more effectively?But violence in real life isnt the end, it seldom is the solution ,maybe it works fine in games.we cant play fire with fire, its us who get burned in the end.To Michael, Trevor, Franklin. Life has never been easy on them ,nor it is fair and just.Sometimes we are just like them,no matter how upstart we think we are , how we consider ourselves above the crowd,reality just slaps right into our face till we realize we are weightless, of little importance,like ants,except,many of us are lucky we have someone who loves us.Therefore do yourself a favor,avoiding trouble is advisable,actively leave this session if there are hackers. So a dilligent bee like me ,Id go registering as a CEO and steal vehicles then sell them .Speaking of which, a friend of mine has recently purchased some warehouse and started his own bussiness.How envy Im of him since a CEO in GTAV is the best thing I could do, or rather,I m not really suited to run a bussiness.The title may be the best describtion of it ,maybe not even close. I really enjoyed my time in this digital city with the other 3 of my friends, with whom I stayed up till late in the night heisting the pacific bank to grind currency and talking about trifles. And Ive also met a few really friendly players who helped me during my transition from an adorable stupid newbie.My gratitude goes to all of themThreeMan Army, we are military.And we made a great team.
