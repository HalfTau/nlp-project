TLDR  Real life money required to play online, Rockstar killed single player by banning all mods. Game Over.I have played this game for a very very long time and have enjoyed it. BUT, I have finally had it with their online pay to play scheme. In order to enjoy the new content never any new missions or heists they release you have to have millions of in game dollars. The only way to obtain this amount of money is hours/days of grinding missions and heists which they have not added any since release OR pay ridiculous amounts of real life money for their shark cards. 99.99 irl for 8mil in game? That wont even get you started. AND now the banning of ALL single player mods? The single player mods keep the game going for a large amount of the community who do not play online. Get the  out with that. Way to kill your fan base.
