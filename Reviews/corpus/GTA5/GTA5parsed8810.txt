The GTA single player in story mode is great. The game probably have the best looking graphics compared to games in 2017 and this game released in 2013. It shows that they invested a lot of money to the game.Hence why Im disappointed, because I think the multiplayer characters looks bad, especially the female characters. They are way too masculine. I dont see why you can create good looking NPCs with a lot of varieties but cant give players good character customization?I do not recommend this game if you are interested of playing GTA Online. The character customization is bad and there isnt much to do ingame IMO. Other than grinding money, I just bought clothes or played golf with my friends. I didnt have that much fun. Modding without harming other players could probably make it worth playing since you can morph your character etc, but it is not allowed.
