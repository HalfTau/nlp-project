Well, this game is in alot of ways good, but in alot of other ways it pretty bad. First of, the storymode is great...The first time you play it, the second time just feels kind of boring since you have already played it. Taking for consideration that the online feature is the main part of this game from my point of view this does not really mather. However. The online incudes alot of buyable stuff that you will have to own to get a decent expirience of the gamemode. This inlcudes a propper apartment so you can play heists, alot of fancy car, a yatch and aircrafts. All this is my opinion necessary to get a decent expirience of the game. DLCs are free. Well this means that you can download them for free but the content costs a fortune in game, and its ceeps adding on. You could purchase sharkcards, but you will feel less scammed buying a dead rat. So do i recomend it? Consider that i have played this game for nearly a 1000 hours on two acounts i do. Even if you would eventually get bored, and the pricetag might not be worth it so i recomend buying this game on sale.
