Ive purchased this game on x360, XBONE and finally on PC, FOR MODDING.The recent actions by TakeTwo have aimed at destroying this cool playground of a game.If you are looking to purchase this on PC, stay well away until the modding issue is resolved.Sorry Rockstar for adding to the negative review. Your publisher dun goofed.
