I love this game so much, its single player is well developed with a great story line and lots of content to do off story. The thing that ruins this game for me is the online mode. It feels like almost everyupdate you have to spend money on something that gives you ingame money to even buy most of the cool things they add. If you dont want to buy ingame money then have fun grinding missions heists for about 2 hours to be able to just  afford a new car or something that allows you to do something else Air hanger or Bunker. If it wasnt for the online basically being pay2win id play it more often.
