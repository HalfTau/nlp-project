Just bought this game 3 weeks ago on PC after playing on console since original release in 2013, and man Im not sure if I made the right decision. Rockstar does their best to remove any and all fun from this game in place of getting people to buy shark cards. They have said as much in financial earnings calls. So unless you have about 200 of real money to spend on shark cards, getting started in GTA Online will be very hard.They make it so difficult to accrue money, and for those of us strapped for time it makes the game unfun because we cant grind for days or months. The decision to remove mod support is another reason why you should avoid this game. For those people who cant afford to play Online, they want to have fun with mods, well no fun for you! says Rockstar, because mods cant be made any more. They want you ONLINE BUYING SHARK CARDS, NOT playing around with mods.
