The fact that they banned mods on this game is unacceptable. I would understand not wanting mods online but they targed single player only mods as well because they want you to go online and pay money for the cool stuff.SpecsProcessor Intel i7 6700HQ Quad core 2.6GhzGraphics Card Notebook GTX1060 with 6GB VRAMRAM 16GB DDR4
