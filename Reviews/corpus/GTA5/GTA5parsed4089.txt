Rockstar support is the worst of the worst. I preorder this game way back when it released in 2015. GTA Online polluted with a bunch of  cheating, dropping 2k5 money above players head and attach props to you. Yet, I got banned on my main accounts because of that reasons and itsme off.I wrote an appeal ban ticket and they just use an automatic respond bot saying they wont accept any ban appeal because there is million number of a factor causing you get banned. Even modded client like FiveM has better anticheat than R anticheat.GTA ONLINE is utter pay to win. This game is boring when you playing alone, i bought this game again just because I wanted to try FiveM RP servers
