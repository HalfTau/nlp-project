great game, its a shame those in charge of multiplayer are such money grubbinghats. As I type this, rockstar has a big sale going down, the game itself is even 50 off. Yet the only deal on the shark cards is a 10 discount on the 50 card. The game is good, but it is so much more fun with friends.... not so fun when you dont have the money to have fun, though.... as a matter of fact once youve played for a few hours the lack of cash takes most of the fun right out of it and it just becomes a choice of either grind money, or pay real money for a game youve already paid for. Thanks take two, you know just how much we love the shaft, dont you. Next time, at least take us out to dinner before you  us. How about a kiss first, too.
