Broken by modders and rockstar themself for only adding expensive stuff in the game that you cannot afford without playing for endless hours....or buy sharkcard from rockstar for real life money. It used to be fun, but i can no longer recomend the game to anyone if you plan to play online. Still i gotta say that the solo campaign is pretty fun
