I love this game.Its a great game.Countless hours of fun from launch until now,If you were going to buy this game, you would buy it on PC.Why is that? Why PC over other consoles?Because what made this game great was the modding community.I remember at launch, mods were still allowed online with a simple file swap, everyone was using trainers and noone in any lobby ever died because they were all immortal. The reason I have so many hours on this game is not because I enjoyed grinding out heists and/or buying shark cards so that I could have a baller car It was because when we were broke, wed spawn more cash. When our car got scuffed, wed fix it with one button. When we were behind in a bike race, wed hold NUMPAD9 and zoom off into the sunset.Once they took mods away from online, I took a ban or two and moved to the other fun modding adventures.GTARP was really fun and absorbed quite a few hours of my time.LSPDFR showed a lot of promise and I followed that mod from square one until a few months back.Single player was also a ton of fun with all sorts of sandbox type adventures to be had.Then they do this.They discontinue support for OpenIV and deem it illegal.This not only ruins the chances that future PC gamers have to enjoy the sandbox that GTAV was, but it also means that OpenIV needs to shut the doors on their whole operation.This is a great game, and hell, it might even be fun without mods but if we let TakeTwo get away with this, it hurts other games too.Do the right thing.Vote on the petition here.
