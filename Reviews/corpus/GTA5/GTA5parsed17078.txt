Single Player was one of the best experiences in gaming that I can honestly say Ive had in a while but TakeTwo has completely changed gears on their initial focus to both SP and Online and has turned to milking as much cash as they can out of Online by releasing free updates but price inflation from shark cards has ruined any chance of actually earning them. This game started out strong, it really did. But they have driven this game into the ground with greedy cashgrab tactics. Do not buy this game for online, youll only be wasting your time. Also, so much for that SP dlc that was promised almost 2 1/2 years ago. Guess they didnt deem it profitable enough.
