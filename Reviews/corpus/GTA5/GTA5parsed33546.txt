Every single lobby is riddled with modders. Wiping cash, and weapons, teleporting you, blowing you up with their ing minds. This is the most sorry excuse for an online game ive seen. The saddest part is they claim their anti cheat system detects hackers, when in reality it detects money droppers. If you cheat and dont drop money, Rockstar doesnt give a ratswhat you do, but the second you attempt to help people grinding for months to get 10 mil, you ban their account forever. The fact they released this DLC is a slap in the face, no, a ing SPIT in the face. If theyd fix their  online experience maybe the people who enjoy playing legit would come back and buy more shark cards.
