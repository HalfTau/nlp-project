After the continued actions of Take Two, including banning mods unrelated to Online in an attempt to stop Online hackers and the blatant cashmilking choices to make every purchaseable thing in the game cost so much youre essentially required to pay real money for Shark Cards, I cannot recommend this game.At first I had so much fun playing this game, but the single player has been stagnant for YEARS and the constant highprice updates to online requiring extreme grinding or microtransactions to take part in have killed the game. Its just boring now, theres nowhere new to go, nothing new to do. Take Two are trying to squeeze every last dollar out of this dying game, and they did so by nuking the only part of the game that is actually interesting mods.Dont buy.
