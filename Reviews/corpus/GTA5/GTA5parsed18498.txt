If youre wanting this game for huge mods such as LSPDFR, ScriptHookV, EMS Mod, as well as others. I would heavily advise you not to purchase this. Rockstar has ruined mods for this game. Rockstar shoves GTA Online down your throat, with the recent siece and desist order on a major modding tool about OpenIV, modding for this game in my opinion doesnt have a future in GTA 5.
