The game was good a few years ago but now.. Very, very dissapointing. Online is just a waste of time now, say out of every hour you play you have to endure 20mins of loading screens/crashes. Its not fun anymore, rockstar are not not making the game better, just harder to enjoy and a hell of alot more expensive. Dont get me wrong, Ive spent around 300 on this one game multiple platform copies, shark cards, other t which is beyond pathetic. Now with rockstar taking your ingame cash because you were given modded money and spent it it is beyondto play. Ive had enough of rockstars t to ever want to play their games again, let alone buy them. off Rockstar, you horrible, money grabbing s.
