Its fun to play with friends but it went tosince R became greedyand started ramping up the price of everything to unimaginable heights 10,000,000 for a gold airplane which literally serves the same function as the basic one to sell shark cards cards you buy with real money to get in game money.Its a 60 game, yet they still feel the need to make EVEN MORE MONEY. Theres literally a shark card which costs more than the base game at full price. The job payouts are total trash if youre not doing a heist/the leader of one.Car exporting payouts are alsodespite being the 2nd best way to make money in the game. 100k with 20k costs of modifying the car for a top range car thats worth 2 million on the market. Also its in freeroam so either NPC s are gonna spawning everywhere trying to damage your car which will make you get even less money, or other players will straight up blow your car up.Its a fun game with loads to offer but it got swallowed by microtransaction hell, until something is done about that, this review will stay negative.Oh also the story is pretty good i guess
