Both the online and story mode is very fun and have lots of hours of content, but the amount of infinite loading screens is really annoying, especially when the loading is about 36 min. but the amount of fun i have had with friends i can really recommend this game.EDIT Ok, so after a while gta online has become more and more unplayable mainly because of infinite loading screens maybe 23 every day and god damn fung modders EVERYWHERe. i ttry to have fun with my friends, but that is impossible in gta online because of modders, either they kick you of the session , they have an explosive loop on you, make the game unplayble by adding certain props to your character that wont dissapear even after switching sessions and going in and out of story mode. what am basically saying dont buy this game if you wanna play online.
