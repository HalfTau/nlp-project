This game has done some pretty questionable things and left some fans like myself, to wonder why this/that are not in the game, why its buggy, why cant they change it, ETC.Campaign was fun until you reach the point of boredom. You would have moved on to Online or played around with mods. Ive always wondered why Online had so much more content and was never added to Singleplayer. It would make their DLCs better with some sort of new story line of Micheal, Franklin, and Trevor doing more. Even more, I want to know why most DLCs items Vehicles, Clothes, Weapons, ETC arent in Singleplayer. At least with the help of mods, they can be added.If we move on to Online. Its horrible... Sure, you get all the DLCs, make your own character, and mess around with friends in fun mission modes. You will end up dicovering a bad side of Online. Hackers rule GTA 5 and innocett players are banned permeanently for no reason! Its obvious that moderators cant patrol all of the Online servers, but that doesnt mean you have to have a buggy antihacking system ban you for 30 days or permeanently. If you have mods on Singleplayer, it could potenially bug out and be brought to Multiplayer for 1 second. Of course, the system will pick up on it and you will be guilty of modding/hacking. Rockstar Support cant even say anything about it. You ask them your problem and what can you do, they will brush it off as if you were a immature hacker.For right now, Rockstar need to do better on moderation than new content.
