 This game is just a grind to get money so you can grind for more money or buy shiny and EXPENIVE useless toys The player base can get pretty toxic The gameplay is stale and clumsy with the only fun parts being the gun play and driving but this still feels bad due to poor net code also your character is slow, you might not notice it right away but you will with the amout of run/walking you will have to do. There is nothing to do in the open world but be a kill a or grind with roleplay if your into that If all you want to do is grind, thewill make your experence a living hell if you play solo and you cant escape it because in order to make an acceptable amout of money late game you will need to play online with random people With every dlc the expensive useless toys get more expensive Lots of the concepts for these toys are really cool but are as previosly stated useless, like a submarine car with rocket/torpedoes but nothing happens underwater so there is nothing to do with it or a large ambibious plane that has vtol capabilities, rocket boosters, a gunner turret, and bomb bay but its easy to blow up and many other faster, more durable, cheaper, with higher dps planes exist. The list goes on and on with most aspects making them usless are Slow, useless weapons, easy to blow up, and that it takes to long to spawn then get to. But the worst offender to this is the yatch, an very expensive boat that does nothing but sit in the ocean beacuse you cant drive it. Yeah its a home but you have leaving and coming back takes up so much more time that nobody wants to live on it, in fact most people forget they own one. You will forget you own a lot useless Other then the toys the devs put in many ways for you to waste your money Charater creation is bad All the mini games are not fun, unpolised, and/or not played because it doesnt pay enough load times are atrocious The devs only change the game if it makes them more money so no quality of life changes Most cars become obsolete after a couple dlc updates They stager the dlc releases so people waste their money This game is no fun when alone There are better shooter and driving games out there that dont waste your time and/or money
