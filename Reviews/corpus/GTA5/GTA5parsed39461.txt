The game itself is good, but not that good.Crux of the matter is that modders were told to cease and desist by a legal team... am I reading this correctly?I remember playing MTASA, SAMP, GTA Rumble etc. more than the standalone games themselves. Have they gone mad? The multiplayer in GTA 5 is well made, but it still falls flat when compared to MTASA w/ map editor from 11 years ago. Despite the amount of pleasant trivialities and customisation, it manages to be less fun, on top of denying the next generation both the entertainment and educational value of modding.
