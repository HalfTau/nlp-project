Singleplayer is ok i guess.Multiplayer is a big steaming pile of fecal matter.Grindfest deluxeBugfest deluxeOh, and btw. I would recommend you to create a new accound so you can hack the game and get s of money. Its more efficient to buy new games and then cheat every time you need money instead of buying ingame currency or doing missions.
