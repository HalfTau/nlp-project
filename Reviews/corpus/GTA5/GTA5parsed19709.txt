This game is just an excuse for the online mode. I enjoyed the story, but it was incredibly shorter only 69 missions compared to other gta games which had about a 100 missions to all others, and thats unaccepltable considering that we also had THREE playable characters, so just 23 missions each. Just consider the fact that Gta 4 had 94 missions plus two DLC with 22 missions... and even if the map was much smaller, it had a thousand more things to do. So, we tried to make this game funnier and more replayable with mods. But NOW they declared them illegal. Rockstar just left us with this 20 hour completable game with no Dlc and no replayability, just to make us spend money on the online mode. Which is ok, because i had a little fun playing it, but you cant enjoy it without spending money. And if you make me pay 20k for a stupid haircut, how should i even pretend to buy a nice car? I enjoyed mods i SP because i could use stuff i wouldnt have ever afforded in the online mode, but thanks to this greedy s, i cant do that anymore. THANKS ROCKSTAR
