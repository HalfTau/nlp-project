The game is great. However about 3 months ago they came to the end of the hacking years by toughening up their system, unfortunately their system has twigged me as a hacker for some strange reason when Im genuinely not. They have banned my account for 30 days and wiped the profiles so I have to start again. The game is great, enjoy it, but be wary that you may get banned and wiped despite not actually committing an offence. Their decisions are final, apparently human error doesnt exist and all at Rockstar are perfect angels.
