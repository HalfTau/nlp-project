I use to love this. Use to. Well now I can even ing play it anymore thanks to them slightly changing there sytem requirements and making its impossible to play now as the game locks up and informs me my system does not meet the requirements. Well  you too rockstar, I could run this game before and now youre telling me I cant? BullBesides that the amount of grinding I did barly got me anything. If I wanted to get everything I needed X and Y then thats an extra 300 hours spent on just Grinding just to get one thing then another. The only real way I saw people getting rich was from the little hackers who gave people money so they didnt have to play the game of Monopoly. Ive never spent a dime on sharkcards and mostlikely never will. But when a friend had there sharkcard cash Yanked away from them durring the GTA Cash Apocalypse, he was disapointed and furious and stopped playing. 6 Million dollers removed, he paied and earnd for all of that and they removed it. Not cool Rockstar. Not ing Cool.In conclusion, GTA V use to be a good game. I missed most of it but from what friends have told me it was a great time to be around, But now Its killing it self. Killing it self with overpriced Cars, Planes, and Buildings that cost thousands of hours just to even get. And Even more money spent just to even get them. I Do not Recoment this Game if youre getting it for Online in its current state.
