i hated gtaonline bs from the start. it was . hackers will still be in the game no matter what they do. they just ruin single player.. im guessing they want ppl to quit single player to play online only so they can buy their bs cards.cuckstar and taketwodiks ruined the game for all us single player people who didnt even play online because they are greedy piles of donkey dung. you should refund everyone who you screwed over since it was a main selling point to have mods and most people only got it for the mods and since it was advertised to be able to play mods and you have taken away what your customers have paid for you owe us our money back for breaking it.
