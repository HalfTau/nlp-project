While the multiplayer showed a lot of initial promise and there has been several content updates the game is a constant grindfest and blatant cash grab. Additionally, the lack of effective response to cheaters /hackers is made all the more insulting by the ineffectual hostility they have shown to modders of the single player portion of the game. This game continues to move to greater and greater levels of mediocrity with each update as they continue their relentless attempts to pursuade players into buying ingame currency.
