Rockstar makes everything 30 times what it should cost and does not provide any legitimate way to make enough money to buy the dlc. Then, rockstar blames modderd for modding when, in actuallity, modding would not be nearly as much of a problem if one could legitimately make enough money to buy all the fun things in the game. Never, NEVER buy this game. it is just a greedy excuse for an online game.
