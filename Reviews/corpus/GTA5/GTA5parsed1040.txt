This game is very good. I mean, VERY GOOD. We alll have been waiting for this to come out for so long time and now it is so old. I have great memories from playing this game and I can certainly recommend this to you./ PROS optimalization telling the story in a different way switching inbetween the 3 characters big open world filled with people doing various activities length of the story multiplayer and coop missions massive improvement from older GTA game/ CONS timeconsuming
