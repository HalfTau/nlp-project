Another event...Another hundred thousand people jumping on the bandwagon to drop negative reviews disregarding most if not everything about the game itself.Putting aside the whole OpenIV fiasco, the game itself is great.Singleplayer is great. Online could use some work but by no means is it bad. A bit grindy, maybe.If youre a fan of the GTA series and youre not into modding this game is a game youd have a lot of fun with.If you were thinking of getting GTA V for the sole purpose of modding, for obvious reasons dont get it.I dont care about mods personally, I am having a good time with the base game. There is plenty to do both multiplayer and singleplayer. The world of San An is lovingly crafted, down to some extremely fine details. Gunplay feels great both thirdperson and firstperson using Free Aim, anyway Story mode is well done imo. I love the aspect of having three main characters I can switch and swap between at will, each with their own distinct personalities and lifestyle.Mods are gone, yes. it sucks. But with it the majority of modders ruining the online lobbies will also disappear.
