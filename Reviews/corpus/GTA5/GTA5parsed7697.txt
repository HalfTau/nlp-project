I would recommend this game but the community is extremely cancerous. Ranges from 12 year olds that have but 500 dollars worth of shark cards thinking theyre king of the session trolling people, and so cool to adults that say youre trash when they are like lvl 150 and they keep spawnkilling you with their friends. Try not to play in populated sessions beacause youre experinece will be quickly ruined
