Worst game on steam hands down, every lobby is full of hackers, kids in GTA call them modders but they are script kiddies, spawning stuff in, giving everyone free money.  And if you think the terrible copy paste console game on PC was laggy and bad..... wait until you have an issue and have to open a ticket to rockstar support...... there is no such thing as rockstar support, they close your ticket, mark it as solved and tell you to go FK yourself. 0/100, worst game ever made. Made even worse by the pathetic excuse for support that these amateurs provide. Rockstar Support is run by the same 12 year olds that are running around in every lobby modding and blowing everybody up. Cancer looks at Rockstar and feels good about itself
