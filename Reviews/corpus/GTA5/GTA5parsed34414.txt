THIS IS JUST AS BAD AS BETHESDA RELEASING PAID MODS, TAKE TWO KILLED THEIR OWN GAME, AND THEY WANT US TO PREORDER RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2, LMAO  OFF. THE VERY IDEA THAT THEY WERE BANNING MODS AT THE RELEASE OF THIS GAME ON PC WAS SAD, BUT NOW THIS IS THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN,  YOU TAKE TWO, AND  YOU ROCKSTAR. ALSO, THE IDEA THAT THIS IS STILL 60 ING DOLLARS ON STEAM, LMAOOOOOO, ING SHECKLE COLLECTORS, TRYING TO GET AS MUCH MONEY FROM A NOW DEAD GAME, YOU CANT EVEN FIND FILLED SERVERS ANYMORE.
