EDIT I am changing my review to positive as a thank you to Rockstar for returning support for OpenIV, as it seems they have turned face upon realizing how much this means to their community. Take Two Interactive, you have some serious work to do, and its going to take a lot for me to respect you after that bull. GTA Online should have been a seperate game as whole, and not pushed as a part of GTA V. From my own perspective, they are two seperate games with different methods of play, and you should NOT bring real world money into something that supports modding, they are two things that will always clash. Let GTA V be its own thing, and GTA Online another.PRE OPENIV CD REVIEWAll the time Ive spent in this game having fun, modding and being entertained by the things people come up with, from custom cars, to scripts that can better the single player experience as a whole. Open IV was a tool for people that enjoyed the experience of making their own world in single player, and you, Rockstar and Take Two, have taken that away. You destroyed the creativity of a community that supported you, and cherished the fact that you let them do as they pleased without limit.What a pitiful waste of everyones resources, time, and money.Goodbye, GTA V.
