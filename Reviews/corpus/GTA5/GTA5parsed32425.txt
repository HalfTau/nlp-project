Since the mod ban this game feels like a crappy F2P game and I dont say that lightly because there are some legitimitely really GOOD F2P games out there these days with nothing more to offer than maybe a fair 25 hours of online enjoyment... If it was free. If all you care about is single player I would wait until it hits the 85 off bargain bin
