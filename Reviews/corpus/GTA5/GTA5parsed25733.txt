Mods were like 60 of the game. They know that Open IV had nothing to do with online hackers and they were not ashamed to lie to us with straight face about this. GTA online is boring, frustrating, grindy piece ofgame, that forces players to spend irl cash on in game currency, since the ingame payouts are pretty much nonexistent compared to what the released content costs. Take2 and R have figured that mods are about 10 billion times better than their lazy cashgrab GTAO can ever be, with its skewed up, anticonsumer business model i.e. shark cards. Therefore they had to shut the mods down, just to get people to play GTAO and buy shark cards.Imo tho, they are shooting themselves in the leg, in the long term. R had reputation of beeing one of the last really good and honest big companies in the gaming industry, but they showed their true colours. They are no better than likes of  EA, Activision, Ubisoft and all the others. Just a bunch of cashgrabing walking suits.But at the end of the day its gamers fault. We cant fault a company for wanting to make more money. We are feeding them billions for their lazy overhyped and overpriced online DLCs and even when they do something like this, there is an army of mindless fanboys to defend them. No wonder they think they can bend us over at their will.There is only one thing we can do to reverse this, the only thing they will ever listen to  their wallets. STOP feeding them cash, stop buying shark cards, it ruined GTAO and now it ruined mods too. And dont buy their games, cancel the preorders. Hit them where it hurts them. Thats the only way they will ever care what we have to say.
