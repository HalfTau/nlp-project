EDIT  All i do now in this game is mod and for that its amazing but online you will get banned offline moddingwow. A few months ago i started to play the story alot more  after playing 250 hrs of online  and i installed a few mods  car mods police mod ect  a few days pass and the new rockstar update comes out saying you are not allowded to mod anymore. I turn all of them off before going online and i have a 2 week ban. Wait the 2 weeks all of my money is gone  all legitimatly earnt  and I have to restart everything. My friend wanted to help me out by putting some money in my account  illegitmatly  and puts 5mil in. tbh i didnt really care not thinking anything was going to happen but i get a ban. Perm. I ask my pal and his account is fine. Turns out i was actually banned for modding in offline during the period i was banned for modding offline. Now its been fixed i ask if i can have my account unbanned but apprantly it is against their T.O.S to unban a perm banned account. Thanks Rockstar now i have to pay 40 to play with my friends. I was level 160 aswell.
