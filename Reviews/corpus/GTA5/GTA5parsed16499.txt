The singleplayer aspect was awesome, in true GTA style. Howeer the online version, in the beginning was horrible. I decided to try i again as a few of my friends have started playing it. So far, its not bad, and their is lots to do. i just wish their was a bit more PVE elements, and possibly some more solo capable missions, or the option to hire  NPC gangmembers to help.
