Ok i bought this game on sale,i started playing singleplayer story was fun but only with Trevor at least for meplaying other two was boring as ,multiplayer is chaotic and full of modders and cheaters and some idiotswho are just idiots by nature.Fun part was when i discoverd LCPDFR tons of fun,then OpenIV changing your weapons to realistic ones, sounds, cars etc.But now u cant mod your singleplayer anymore,multiplayer is ing trash ,and game right now is one big pile of crap so guys dont waste money unless its like 10 euros.
