I mean, whats more to say anyway?Rockstar did such a great job on GTA V that I dont think I could put it into words to describe just how amazing this game truly is.What I can say is that Irecommend this game, especially if you enjoy Rockstar games in general, because Im sure itd be one of those everlasting games thatd still be fun even if you play it in the next 10 years.So, consider it as an investment for the future.
