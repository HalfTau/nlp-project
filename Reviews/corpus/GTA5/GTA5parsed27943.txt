Appearently Im Undermonatized and need to buy some shark cards. This entire company is shifting to become a money extracting parasite. I am assuming that they wont care about single player in any game in the future and have proven that they will actually activley kneecap the single player because it is not as profitable. No amount of money is enough, pay to play and pay more and more and screw anyone who wants to have any fun without paying their dues.
