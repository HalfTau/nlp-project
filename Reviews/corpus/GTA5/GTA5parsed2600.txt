Grand Theft Auto V Graphics are Excellent, Music Their is a ton of music in the game Ill say its Great too and Sounds are Pretty Good. Story mode is Awesome, Online is fun but their is a lot of Hackers, Cheaters and the community is toxic. I try to stay clear of full servers because of the TOXIC Players out their! I still injoy running around online with Steam Friends and Other Players. Their needs to be more ways to make money online not in Heist Missions style just in freeroam, Like safe cracking in the back of convenient stores, Robbing the small banks, Robbing the Armor Trucks, Looting ATMs machine and Toll Trucks jobs to name a few things they could add for the players. Now Down to Business Grand Theft Auto V is a 8 out of 10
