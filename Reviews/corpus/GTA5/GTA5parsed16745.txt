GTA V story mode is fun at first, but if you really want to enjoy it, dont play Online until you have finished the story because is just flat out boring when you compare it to Online. The story is confusing and has bad pacing and in my opinion, the 3 charector system, while working well, is bad because it tries to have 3 seperate stories all at once and the joint one and does not focus enough on the individuals unlike GTA IV. Online is ok for the most part if you are willing to spend hours upon hours grinding for money if you want to use the extensive list of expensive vehicles, or of course, you could always find a modder. The game itself is one big microtransaction, you cant do anything without money and money is a pain in theto get unless you buy the also expensive shark cards which will give you a maximum of 8 million for more than the game costs itself, even then 8 million wont last you a day unless youre like me and are a money hoarder.I would recommend this game as long as you have the patience to deal with the annoying players who half the time just wanna blow you up and ruin your job.
