Since modding has been banned in this game because Take Two thinks that these mods have security flaws, just means that Rockstar and Take Two are going down the tubes so fast that GTA 6 may not be any better and may be in fact, worse. I loved GTA 5 so much that I bought the XBox 360, XBox One and then the PC version of the game. However, I sold my 360 and One to switch over to the good side and that was PC because I was under the notion that you could mod the game and have fun with the mods. However, after what Take Two did, my respect for Rockstar and Take Two have gone right out the window.The same day, I noticed that I had a warning from Rockstar stating that they were cracking down on modding online because of the money cheats the modders were using. Then I got another warning stating that I had lost 2,119,000 from my account because it was considered, illegitimate. I called Rockstar Games who did not help because they claim to have ways of looking at these sorts of transactions. Mostly what they do is they look at how much you deposit and assume you illegitmately got those funds. However, what I tried to explain to them and they still didnt listen to me was the fact I bankrolled 3,000,000 in one lump sum because I just didnt think about it at the time and continued to do missions Online. I was ripped off 2,119,000 of my hard earned money on GTA Online and Rockstar didnt even give a crap.Overall, GTA V is a good game, just if youre a more creative soul like I am and mod the hell out of it, you will hate it and if you dont want a game that is heavily secured and if you even breathe wrong, youre banned, then this game isnt for you.This game is going the way of Minecraft, Skyrim and Fallout. These games were forgotten because of their creators banning mods on the games.
