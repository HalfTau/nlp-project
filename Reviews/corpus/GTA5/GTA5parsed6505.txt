Extremely fun multiplayer  story mode, lots of races, maps, and just crazy overall mods. I would recommend this game to anyone who has friends and a good computer. Sadly my computer can no longer handle this game or I would playing hours upon hours on this game and definetly would finish up the story mode, as it is also extremely interesting. However, once again, it is extremely hard to run, so do not buy it if you are 50/50 or for sure not getting a better computer any time soon.
