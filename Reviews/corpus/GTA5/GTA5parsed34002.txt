WowTheres a whole lot of hate of this game because of Mods.Who knew that the potential of mods made this game a popular choice?Ive never used mods Because I really dont know how to use them and how to get them in GTAV since its difficult, but for me, the game itself isnt that bad, just a little lacking. If only there was more, and not just the vehicles and weapons.If you dont care for mods and like the game, go on a head and play.
