Changing my review since Rockstar stated that they have thought about the situation and talked about it with T2. They now say single player modding is legal. Rockstar has also moderated T2s position and said that they are in contact with GooDNTS from OpenIV. Edit OpenIV is now back and the CD that T2 and Rockstar sent to GooDNTS has been reversed.
