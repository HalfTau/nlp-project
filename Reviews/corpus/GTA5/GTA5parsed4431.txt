TO ANY NEW PLAYER DONT GET THIS GAME UNLESS YOU WANT TO GRIND FOR THE REST OF UR LIFE TO GETi got this game purly because it WAS a good game but i joined this game at the end of the inport export dlc.AS a new player you have to grind so hard in order to get the essensials e.g car housed bussinesses As soon as you have finished grinding a new dlc comes out and you have relised you have barly just got the content from the old dlc.SO the cycle starts again and after hours of grinding you have only managed to get a bussines which lets you get a other thing which lets you upgrade and get the one thing you want E.G you need a bunker to get the MOC to be able to buy and customize the oppressor.MY 224 hours of constand grinding have got me a hydra, moc,bunker,oppressor,appartment,office,and a garage for inport export. BTW I BOUGHT SHARK CARD AND A MODDER DROPED 2 MIL ON ME AS WELL AND I STILL PUT ALL THIS TIME IN.2 or 3 more dlcs came out before i relized it will take me a other 200 hours just to be able to get the 2 other vechals i wanted and i couldnt be bothered for more grinding as most of my time on gta was grinding.I WISH I COULD GET A REFUND FOR THIS BAD GAME AND MY SHARK CARD AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
