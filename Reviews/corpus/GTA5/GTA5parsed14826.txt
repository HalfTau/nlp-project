I am so SICK and tired of the ing 1520 minute loading screens it drives me up a wall. We get frozen doing heists because of these loading screens and honestly it makes me HATE opening up gta v because theres no point. The heists are sometimes the best way to get money but NO ONE JOINS OR DOES THEM so its a waste. Most of the time people are too busy being jerks or begging modders to give them stuff so theres really no amazing point to playing this game /
