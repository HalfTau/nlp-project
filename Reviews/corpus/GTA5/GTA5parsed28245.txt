boycot take two in effect.the reason because they add nothing for the singleplayerand push people to play multiplayer and buying their so fun shark cards that are a BARGAIN! sarcasmbecause singleplayer does not generate shark cards they have now decided to ban modsmods is what made GTA a success.take two is going the EA route thinking about the cash and not about the players.
