Only recommend it for the SinglePlayer and I still demand a DLC.Other than that just give up on Online, Rockstar.Cheaters heaven, way too expensive stuff that you get bored of 20 minutes later. VERY expensive shark cards, 8 million for 75 euros are you mental? And the worst part is that you cant even buy them in Single Player, AT LEAST, only with Trainers.
