My first Rockstar game and certainly the last one.This is really only worth some of the radio stations, which you can record holding your phone against the speaker at some quiet place ingame.Singleplayer pointless story, unlikeable characters, plus a handful of easily done heavily scripted missions boring world with nothing else to do except 3 asinine minigames dart, golf, tennis idiotic torture sceneMultiplayer biggest grind abomination ive encountered so far, completely worthless doesnt even work right disconnects, cheaters, stupid missionsIts really a mystery how this game got such a good rep, being the waste of disk space that it is.On the Plus side, they got quite an ok engine for driving and gunplay, but thats about it, they did nothing worth mentioning with it.Awful overhyped game.
