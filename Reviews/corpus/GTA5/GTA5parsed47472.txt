Well they fcked it up. First off they all but abandoned the story mode single player and then kicked the modders to the curb that make free content that keeps the game alive and fun to mess around in. I couldnt give a finger pull rip about onine as the whole MMORPG thing is just more of the same grinder crap for me anyway. When will these devs realize that we BUY our copy of the game and not lease it. They dont even give you the courtesy of asking whether or not you want the update but instead just act like they own your computer, internet and your paid copy of the game. Imagine if they ran a car company. Open sand box games like this and Skyrim stay interesting because of modders and NOT of the lamecontent the devs offer. Often times its the modders that make better content than the devs and fix bugs that the devs are too lazy to fix themselves. Skyrim would still be a bland POS if it wasnt for modders and would have died out back in 2012. I bought this game because of the mods out there that made it fun to mess around and take my real world frustrations out on the good citizens of Los Santos. Anyway good job Cuckstar for fcking up a fun time.
