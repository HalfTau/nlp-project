Cant justify recommending this game. Sinlge Player is a great, recommend playing that.However, Online mode is absolute garbage. Spent nearly 3 hours trying to play online, every lobby had someone hacking. They need to make the online content avialable in a friends only mode or offline. Too many hackers wasting your time.As far as i can see, Rockstar has made no effort to curtail the amount of cheating.
