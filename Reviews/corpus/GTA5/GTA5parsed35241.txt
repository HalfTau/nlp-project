Horrible move by TakeTwo. They will go out of their way to shut down modding, but cant invest in adding new content for single player mode? They go out of their way to do this, while still not doing anything about their servers and the hacker problem? I smell a classic business move to kill the replayability of this game while at the same time, a plan to implement a potential scheme to nickelanddime us via payed mods. This move has come on the behalf of gamers, as many of us have purchased shark cards and whatnot. TakeTwo thinks that were stupid, so its time to show them whos boss. I recommend a boycott of all products associated with them until they get off their predatory high horse.
