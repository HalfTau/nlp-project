GTA V was at one point great game. That much is clear. Now, however, the Online mode is full of hackers and engineered to make you pay for microtransactions. Now, TakeTwo sees it fit to ruin the fun and replayability of the singleplayer mode that can come from modding. Most people who play this game already have a copy, so the entire purpose of having a PC copy is to use the mods. When TakeTwo tried to shut down OPENIV they made a big mistake. Unless you want to play the vanilla singleplayer experience for the first time, this game is probably not for you.TLDR Online is a cashgrab full of hackers and mods are now almost unusable in the singleplayer.
