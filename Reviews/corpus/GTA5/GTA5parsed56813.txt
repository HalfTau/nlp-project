If youre reading this, and you haven yet bought GTAV, then Im sorry to say, that you really shouldnt. The game is great, however its the publisher, Take 2 Interactive which is the real problem. Recently the send a cease and desist to a modder whom made one of the most essential mods to GTA V, practically making modding illegal. This is not right, and by buying this game, you are supporting that. Take a stand, and speak with your money, if you care about whats right.
