If it hasnt already reached the finish line, Take 2 is fast progressing on the road to becoming a games publisher that is worse than EA. Their frankly disgusting practice of trying to control what people do with a game they purchased by employing nefarious means under false pretence would be akin to Electrolux coming to your home and stealing the door of your freezer so you can only use the half of the appliance that is the refrigerator, if Electrolux ever did such a thing. Only Electrolux doesnt do that because they are not a bunch of odorous e. I encourage anyone alive, dead, and yet unborn to never even consider the purchase of any product Take 2 might possibly make any profit from, as this will be my policy going forward until the heat death of the universe.
