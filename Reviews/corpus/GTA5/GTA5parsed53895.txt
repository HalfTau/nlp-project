Have played every GTA and loved everyone, Amazing game in itself. Used to play the Game on Xbox 360, then got for Xbox one, Then got again for the pc, because modding made the single player AMAZING again after the game is finished, beat the game on the xbox, all 443 hoursso far on pc is Modded single player. a whole different vision of how this game could be and ENDLESS hours of fun. the excitement when i get some time off work and can play this modded game.  You for trying to hurt another loyal customer of yours.
