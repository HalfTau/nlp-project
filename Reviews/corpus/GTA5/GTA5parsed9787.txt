I liked this game a fair bit, its a much better port than 4 was, with much better gameplay overall, and lots more fun toys to play with and more shi to do in it, and gtao is fairly fun up to a point, but seriously, the most expensive shark card costs more than the game itself. All I have to say to that is look up the penny for your thoughts Calvin and Hobbes comic. But yeah, in terms of porting, it doesnt have the shity jerky aiming that 4 had, it aims very smoothly and responsively and its very easy to shoot things. Not fond of the way the camera autocenters all the time. Its pretty fucen annoying. I can see the road a lot better when the camera is tilted downward rather than straight ahead.I also want to mention that I liked the story and characters of 4 better than this one. Its not bad but I didnt find it nearly as compelling as Nikos and his NOBODY FUCS WITH MY FAMILY rampages and whatnot. It is a lot more lighthearted and goofy at times though. Whether thats good or bad is up to you to decide.
