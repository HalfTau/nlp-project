Come on, I love this game so much. The Main story and also Online function are great.As a gammer I recommend for this game. But for the action of TakeTwo I think its not fair for Moddler or any GTAV player.Just one mod that using OpenIV API can break security that not means OpenIV should obey your command.BTW, Online with no cheat is more fun and challenged. Online Cheat for NOOBs.
