Personally all the hackers and toxic players aside,Gta 5 for itself and what its designed to be is just in my opinion a beautiful  game with 1 all the mechanics and all the options you have now including dlc like the high life dlc etc i think that gta v is worth the 70 or what ever you pay since im in aus but if your thinking about buying this game but you have a few other choices i would choose this game since it also comes with a passive mode for againts the trollers and hackers  i rate this game 9/10
