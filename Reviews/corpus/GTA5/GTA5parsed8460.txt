Let me start off by saying that the Online has clouded the amazing story of this game.I loved the story and it was so much fun to play through as well as funny but everyone is down voting this game because of the Onlines microtransactions. Now I agree that microtransactions are stupid and they ruined online for me but we cant simply forget how much fun the story was.So I will give this game a positive review not because I support how TakeTwo is milking this game for money but because the story is one of the best that Ive played.If your considering buying this game do it for the story and not for the online.
