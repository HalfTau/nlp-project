 Let me be clear to point out the fact that I played and finished this game back in 2013 on the PS3 and that this game wholesomely receives a recommendation MOSTLY due to the singleplayer aspect alone. Everyone knows this game by now, so Id rather choose to ignore discussing about singleplayer, despite the fact that its absolutely one of the most enjoyable stories Ive had the pleasure to partake in as the 13 year old kid me back then and even now.Theres a recent inflow of gamers these days where apparently people only have 30 minutes of dedicated playtime. The pricing in Online is not as horrible as people make it out to be, its just like any other game that requires you to farm to get what you want. People want things too easy these days aka every cnt ever that complains about how things require time and dedication. News flash, bud, oh boi the flak Ill get for defending Rockstars pricing.Id say the primary issue I have with this game is that its hard to consistently earn money if half of the time what youre doing is staring at a loading screen. Doesnt matter if you have the game installed on an SSD or HDD, it just relies on connectivity, but its still fcking awful, 12 minutes just to disconnect from a mission session.First Person View gets a huge plus from me, its like playing a new game.Game is worth every penny you paid for it, even just for the singleplayer alone.
