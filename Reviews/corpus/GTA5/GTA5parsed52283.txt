GTA 5s singleplayer is one of the, if not the best singleplayer experiences I have ever had. Even without the missions, there is so much to do in Los Santos. Each characters unique ability also makes it all that little bit more fun. Theres also modding, which kept the games sales going up and kept the singleplayer fun, even after 100 completion. But of course, TakeTwo is trying to shut it down. So, you can stop harmless SinglePlayer modding, but not cheaters in Online? Disgusting.GTA Online is also a really great multiplayer experience  or at least it was  until the mod menu users / cheaters came along and started blowing everybody up under the name of random people and trapping them in cages. As I said earlier, instead of stopping harmless SP modding, stop the cheaters griefing every lobby they come across! Now, Ill talk a bit about the updates this game has had. I love them all mostly. I see a lot of people going omg this military crap isnt gta anymore flying cars wtf. Personally, I think these additions are all very cool, the only reason people complain about them is the way they get used by tryhards, griefers etc. The Doomsday Heist update added a new and amazingly fun heist to the game, which also let you experience the new vehicles added to the game just incase you wanna test drive them or something. Sure, R might mess up now and again and add a griefing tool to the game cough cough orbital cannon cough cough, but its mostly pretty fun but expensive vehicles, weapons, properties, etc. Again, to sum it all up, I really like all the military stuff they have added into this game, keep making these updates R!Game itself is great, TakeTwo and cheaters are not.EDIT Recently R has cracked down on the cheaters, step in the right direction, also have updated the GTA Online portion for the recent updates added to the game.
