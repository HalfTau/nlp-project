I have been a player just like everyone else throughout the years, the multiple game purchases and even these insane grinding tasks just to earn what people with shark cards could have in seconds. This game is not fun anymore especially due to the inflation in the games currency, and the hackers.... The hackers.. Youre almost guaranteed to encounter a hacker every game online. I have multiple screenshots of my bank office with two full military tanks inside of it, and some scripter also spawned a barbell to my character model so its constantly stuck to him. This game sucks rockstar, it used to be good, but loyal honest players dont stand a chance between the Pay to win players and hackers, its near impossible, and i may be done playing this game for good.
