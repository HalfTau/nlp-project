Its pretty much a dead memeIts all about doing the sameforever because the actual mission profit is so low compared to the average content price, it feels like a formula that leaves you with little fun without actually buying the goddamn shark cards, and even those wont really afford you anything past one new rideTalking about new works just like dead meme revival, update comes out once everyone is shitwith the current state of the game to cover up for it and it feels like it, at first youre like whats that and then you see its the samereskinnedAaaand drumroll the least expected reason three simultaneous drumrolls on why this game isdrumroll drumroll It bans everyone except for ing modless normiesGoodbye playing singleplayer for longer than a day, I will miss you. You too replay value, you too.JK I spent my life here bc I preordered and paid extra cash so that I get that extra million that was gone in a jiffy. Nice mind games, tar. Good thing theres modders letting players experience the game anyways. Probably the reason games so alive. Oh, and if no one noticed, they banned OpenIV bc they didnt know a better way to fight cheating modding. As in they couldnt catch the online griefing modders, or cash spawners, so they just went for the easy way. Pathetic.
