I guess its time for me todo a review on this game. Even though i only have about 300 Hours of recorded gameplay time on stream. I first started playing the game on Xbox 360, I also then bought it for PS3 So i have played this many times. Even with what Rockstar Games did with modding of it. Im leaving that out of a i rate the game. With all the updates they are bringing to Multiplayer is great. But i think they should add more stuff to single player and it would be nice if the add mod support for Single player only. and make it so they dont for Multiplayer they are smart enough to figure out how to do that. And allow the modders to make great Single players mod. like LSPDFR and some of the great skins for the cop cars and stuff. and mods like the Real life mod is a great would be cool to see those intergreated to the game and into Multiplayer. Rockstar Games you should listen to ur players and see what they want for single player and Multiplayer and work with modders to put some of there mods into Single and Multiplayer because i think if you could all add LSFDFR into Multiplayer and allow us to pull over Players and AI players. Make it so we can call in backup and Call SWAT and Millitarty into help us take out players, Also make it so when as a Police officer we can get Police Jets So like most things Normal players can get We can get it as a Police Car.
