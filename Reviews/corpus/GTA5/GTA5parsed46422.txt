GTA V Is a great game and the single player story is exciting, funny and well written. Rockstar games did an amazing job.The fact that all of the focus for GTA was placed into their GTA Online and locked behind very grindy paywalls to entice the user to pay for ingame money, also was not too bad.This was due to the vast amount of modifications available for the Single Player Experience, allowing users who didnt have the time, or who didnt want to play with others online, to enjoy the game to the fullest capactity, long after they otherwise would have stopped playing.The Publisher TakeTwo has recently banned OpenIV The main modding tool that enables and assists modders in making singleplayer mods Not online hacks or modifications With this they have single handedly kneecapped any future mods that would further provide enjoyment for singleplayers.Final Line If you want to stop this stuff, then ban mod support right off the gate or not at all, dont do it when you think you can milk your players for more cash by forcing them to play online.
