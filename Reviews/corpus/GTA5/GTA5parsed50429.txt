Let me be very clear companies that practice unethical and anticonsumer methods do not deserve your money. Rockstar/TakeTwo Interactive has apparently decided to be giantto the customers and their fans. I bought GTA V twice. Once on the Xbox 360, once on PC. I may only have 115 hours of it on PC, but thats because I had already gotten burnt out on it somewhat by the time the GTA V PC release came around. And because modding was a pain in theand because of constant updates which broke said modding, I got tired of playing it.Well, Rockstar and TakeTwo have formulated a plan in their infinite wisdom if they shut down the modding teams and offer lackluster online support and updates while doing nothing to stop hackers while banning people that hackers have targeted ingame, it will make people want to come back....No, Rockstar. No, TakeTwo. Pound sand. If I could get back my 120 Ive given you in the past 4 years, I would. I dont want your games, I dont want your services, and I dont want to give you any of my money. And I wont.Talk with your wallet, people. If you were buying Shark Cards, stop. If youre buying Rockstar/TakeTwo games, stop. Buy other products instead and gloat to those developers that theyre getting money instead of Rockstar.MAKE THEM POUND SAND.
