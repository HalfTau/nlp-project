On behalf of the team behind OpenIV, I would like to urge you not to buy this game. Modding is why most people wanted a PC release in the first place, and to have TakeTwo suddenly decide that they dont support the modding community and hitting the creators with a cease and desist sounds like something Nintendo would do. Do not support this game until OpenIV is back online and its creators are allowed to operate without the fear that they wont be sued into oblivion
