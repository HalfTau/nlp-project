What I really like about Grand Theft Auto is that it has a great free roam gameplay. Im not a fan of the story mode but I do like it, I really like the Online Mode though. You can play with your friends and do what you want. You want to infiltrate a military base and steal a jet? Then go on ahead and I advice you to play with your friends. You can go crazy on a rampage killing everybody and ramming npcs over while you see them fly off. But there are still bad things about the Online Mode. There are always hackers who could just troll you especially with Money Drops and you could get banned for something you didnt do, unless you ask for it xD. Also you need a lot of money in this game if you want to fulfill the potential of Online Mode. It willl take some time doing it but also you need to level up fast if you want to unlock mods for guns and cars such as the minigun, rpg, GT Wing Spoilers and other sorts of stuff. You could also play a lot of different mini games such as the one part of the new Smugglers Run DLC which is Motor Wars. I particularly favor the Deadline Mini Game myself. Guess thats about it and even though this game costs a lot, Id say it is worth it. If your on a budget, you should wait for a sale because there is a chance you could get the game for half the price. Thanks for reading and have fun playing!
