I have played the GTA V story multiple times on all platforms, and it is nothing but fantastic. If you want a great GTA singleplayer experience, just buy it already if you havent by now. Do it. If you want any sort of multiplayer though, do not bother with GTA online as its boring and 99 pure grinding to get anywhere at all.The negative rating is on behalf of the unacceptable multiplayer experience, and lack of Singleplayer DLCTLDR Singleplayerfantastic, Multiplayerutter garbage
