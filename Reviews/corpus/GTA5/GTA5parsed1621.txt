I was skeptical whether this will amuse me like GTA San Andreas. Kudos to devs that they even took this to much better level. Enjoyed playing story thrice. Twice on PS3 and once on PC just for the graphics. I upgraded my PC to a beast with GTX 1070 just to play this beauty of a game on the 3rd time. The amusement bars only crawled high with pure Eyegasm.  Highly recommend this game to anyone. Please ignore the negative ratings for this game as its got nothing to do with the game but with block of OpenIV mods and people getting angry of Rockstar for blocking it.Story was Epic. Great Gfx. Good sound design. Lovely characters Mike, Frank and Trevor. 3.This game is must have in your library whether you play it or not. I would give 10/10. Multi player was fun but I play other intensly competitive games like CS GO and Tekken 7. So MP not much into it.
