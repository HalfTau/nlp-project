GTAV and GTAO are loads of fun but the way you are treated by the creators of this game is really sour. The banning of mods in the single player game, and the microtransaction focused online game is enough to leave you disgusted and frustrated by the end of every play session. Dont get yourself involved with this unstable lovehate relationship my dood.
