GTA became a popular game due to the unlimited modding ability. Due to Take 2 become a greedy, heartless company like Bethesda, they have decided to say modding this game is now illegal. As such, do not support this company until they reverse their asinine demands. Modding is what makes PC gaming as amazing as it has become and allowed this to become one of the top ALL TIME selling games.Rockstar should suck it up, rebuy themselves from Take 2 and rebuild their community. Until then, they join Bethesda on my list of never getting my money again.
