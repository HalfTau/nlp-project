I would totally recommend it 9/10, the game is fun and interesting with friends, but some of the people you meet online arent that nice D The graphics are good, the story was okey, but the multiplayer is awesome. I wouldnt recommend buying it for 60 dollars tho. Wait for a sale and buy it! Its worth it.
