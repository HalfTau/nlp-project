This here was old and in my opinion it was fair but tbh just ignore everything I said down here...These are going to be the two most frustrating parts of the game which you will in counter while playing the game and everybody who has played GTA V will also agree.Whoever was the people coding the network structure for GTA V online, they need to be throw out of the window. I just cant get over that rockstar employed these people who dont understand on how to properly and securely do client side and server side netcoding. facepalmIts so dumb on how easy it is to mod on rockstar public servers, so when trying to have fun on GTA V online you will come across alot of modders since all you have to do is drag and drop mods into your gta V folder. facepalmDont get be wrong I do like the modding community I think its great, but it should be done on FiveM, on your own dedicated server just like MTASA or even IF Rockstar was smart enough you could mod on GTA V online but you would only see it on your client side cough cough MTASA.Yet again, facepalm whoever coded the loading screen your also going to be thrown out the window with the other lot also. Its just stupid that modders can cut the time around 80 for loading but Rockstar cant. Rockstar could just very simply look into the FiveM source code and see how they have gone about it but NOPE!Note If I could pick yes and no I would, but steam has not added that feature still.. L
