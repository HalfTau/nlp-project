Today I Ran around the city wearing only underpants, old style pilot hat, goggles and a flasher coat. Robbed a corner store at gunpoint and shot the owner for fun. Twice. Carjacked several people and sold their vehicles at a crooked auto shop. Sniped countless randoms in the head from a great distance for no reason. Bought a variety of firearms without a license or paperwork and killed more random people. Snuck up on someone who was not paying attention and beat them with a hammer. Then again with a pool cue. Went to the strip club, paid for dances from 3 different strippers, and touched them when management wasnt looking. Enjoyed back alley shenanigans with a hooker I picked up in my stolen ride. Checked up on my lucrative weed, methamphetamine and cocaine businesses, robbing supplies for each on the way.After doing all of this, I went home and played GTA V Online, the best game of all time. Practice makes perfect.
