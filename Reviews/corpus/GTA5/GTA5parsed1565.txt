A very solid story mode. Good online mode too! Lots of heists to pull off, races to join, etc. Would recommend this if youre into Open World games in general. The efforts that Rockstar made just to make Los Santos feel more realistic and interactive is IMMENSE. Honestly, 59 isnt even close to what this game has to offer. Its worth it for sure.
