DO NOT BUY UNTIL THEY HAVE GOT THEIR ST TOGETHER. Unfortunately take 2 have been extremely selfish to tell rockstar to get rid of openiv modding, due to this people cant even mod single player because the mods are not compatible. this was a very stupid decision because many people make a living from playing these games on youtube and now they have lost their job and fan base. People like me who have had the game since the day it came out also get bored and play with mods. now this has taken away most of the fun from gta v so i do not recommend buying this until openiv is re opened and released back into the gta community
