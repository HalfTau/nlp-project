This game would be so much fun if it wasnt for its hours of waiting in its online loading screens. You literally just spend 2/3 of your time just trying to find and connect to a nice event you want to participate in. I would say, dont even try to play online if you arent going to play with friends in 2018 or later. The story is nice tho and you got enough to do for a single player. But for the love of god. Just update the game so loading wouldnt take a butt load of time.
