dont tell momits grand theft auto fricken five! how could you not expect this to be a good game?the single player is well made and have some replaiblity with the options to aprroch each heist and 3 different endings.modding can be a little tricky with Hooks and files ontop of files as long with the risk of being banned off onlineonline is certainly a hell of a grind, taking alot of times to unlock mid to end game content. i even contemplated if i even should play this game anymore while i was trying to deliver my 80th car. but if you want to play the game casually with friends and mess around, youre in a great time.
