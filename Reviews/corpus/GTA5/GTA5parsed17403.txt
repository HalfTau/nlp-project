Great game i love Grand Theft Auto V this is the best one yet this is the third time buying this game PS3,PS4 and now pc the  best platform to play this master piece  game on to its full potential pros  cons for mePROSgreat storygreat gameplay mechanicsgreat visualsso far on PC but it is amazing how rockstar made to look great Evan on  a old system like the PS3great online player baseall online DLC is free and always something freshconsmicro transactionsRock star supportno DLC content for Single player mode unbalanced weapons online mode alot of buildings arent accessible only 19 i believe you can rob lack of gangs not an issue for most but ive always been a gang nerd when it comes to gta games and only seening a few that you can run into in the game is disappointing to me not as many activities as it seemed to be promied by rockstarinablity to rob banks/pull off own heists in free roam cops randomly see through walls but sometimes dontnew wanted system is flawed while i like the whole each cop has its own rader idea, 1 star is very annoying to get rid of and takes a while
