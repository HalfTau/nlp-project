Negative thingsThere is a lot of cheaters in MP, still you can find some bugs..In multiplayer, Its all about working hard for some money and then spending it to craps..This is all about! Im tired of it.. everytime I join to some season, I get fcked by higher levels because they own freakin tank/helicopter/aircraft.. But you can create your own season and play with friendsPositive thingsOptimalization, graphics, events, fashion, cool easter eggs, cool and interesting story in singleplayer and a lot more!Recommendation 85
