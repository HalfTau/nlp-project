Rockstar Needs to look at Their games feedback. If taking away hard earned cash is your way of fixing hacks then Its pointless to even try. Rockstar doesnt try at all. They said they added a PUBGlike update. turns out to stink boogers. When we got first person the animations werand still are. Now we have NO mods and hackers that spawn money and trap you in cages. After you get tired of the garbage you just want to uninstall the game. My first hacking experienceLester pulls up to me in a lambo.Lester gets out of the car and apperntly can walk.Shoots a firework cannon.DiesWhat Im trying to say is, GEt you ingtogether.
