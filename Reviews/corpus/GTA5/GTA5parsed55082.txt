GTA V was one of my favorite games. all it is now is a money hungry antigamer peice of To even be able to progress in the multiplayer you have to pay. They make it extreamly difficult to make any money whatsoever without by there shark cards! And as of today, they basiclly banned mods by sending a cease and desist letter the the OpenIV mod wich is the framework mod for almost all mods in gta v... What... the... actuall... f. They banned mods basically so they can force more people into multiplayer so they can shove more microtransactions down their throat. They treat their gamers like crap.
