Always liked the GTA series but after what Take Two is doing to the modding community, I cant support the franchise any longer, or any game that Take Two puts out. Its a shame really, instead of embracing harmless modding in singleplayer only, Take Two has decided to wage war on the modding community for no good reason except greed. Im all for companies making money, but theres a way to do that without spitting in the face of the community that supports you.
