Sticky cover has never been and never will be an acceptable function to implement in your game. It sucked chode in GTA4, and it sucks chode here.Also deliberately creating frustrating experiences in online isnt gonna make me want to drop money on these pathetically deflated cash cards to bypass the pain, it just makes me glad I bought this game on sale so I didnt have to pay R the full cost of admission.
