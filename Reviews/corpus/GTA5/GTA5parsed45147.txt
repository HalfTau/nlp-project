One of the best single players ever,should be one of the best mutiplayers ever bar three thingsthe endless loading screens and bad netcode that go with them, the lost rewards and the frustration of just sitting there, in 2017, waiting on a game to do something games 20 years ago could do flawlessly compared to this.the  time spent/reward balance. Honnestly, things cost way more than youll ever be able to play to unlock, and the predatory pricing is definitely to make you buy shark cards.  them. Im not saying everything should be free or anything like that, just that by playing, say, 6 hours a night, you should be able to get somewhere to get what you like in a week. I wouldnt have so much of a problem with it if shark cards were not so much of a rip off. We are talking about pixel things....selling the dlcs at a fixed price to unlock their content, at say, 25 euros each, would be much, much cheaper than using shark cards to do the same. If you would want to unlock the fun stuff all at once, i suspect youd have to pay more than a few hundred euros. No game is worth that much. Period.they are also cracking down on modding the game. I paid for this game, i wanna do what i want with it, there is no competitive pvp element to it, like youd have in say CSGO or overwatch, so  off and dont touch mods. Having the option to be Iron Man and stomping cards like noboduis buisness is my idea of fun, i bought this, leave me be.I will not be buying Rockstar games anymore, at least not until they are worth what they are becoming less than 5 euros on sale, so you can throw your copy in the fire if they feel you are not playing like they want you to play.
