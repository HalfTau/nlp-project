Grand Theft Autos recent Gun Running dlc is a blatant grab for microtransactions, costing millions of dollars of in game currency.This would be bad enough in a freetoplay game, but I already paid 60 for this title.GTA Online has demonstrated an increasingly level of greed, incompetence, and mismanagement, all of which represents a betrayal of the games fanbase.
