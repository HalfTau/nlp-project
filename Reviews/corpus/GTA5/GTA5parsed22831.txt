The game is good. Take Two is not. GTA Online is a massive grind that pushes you to either mod or microtransactions making the Online community quite nasty. Get a group together, get into a public session with just you lot in and the game can actually be enjoyed.P.S. Singleplayer isnt that good anymore because they dont really support it. So much content added to the Online but nothing to Singleplayer? Not even the ability to raise the visor on a ing bike helmet? ?
