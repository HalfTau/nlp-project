Owing to Rockstar and TakeTwo now reneging on the modding ban, Im satisfied enough that this game and others in TakeTwos stable are now worth buying again.That is, so long as TakeTwo and 2K realise that the modding community hugely benefits their sales, and wants to be left alone to do their own thing in the offline game modes.If they continue to hold up their end of the deal, this will be a positive review. If they do not, well...Grand Theft Auto V without mods is not a Grand Theft Auto V that I consider worth buying. Not even Gunrunners and Heists in Online make up for it, and I played on console mostly to avoid the hackers and account modders from ruining everything.Do not buy this game during sales. Do not buy the Shark cards. Dont do anything to even tacitly support 2K Games/TakeTwo Interactives decision to shut out the modding community because they cant secure their online multiplayer properly. Not playing it either is also an option.I repeat, do not do it. Wait until 2K/T2 renege on their tremendously shortsighted decision. This is not OK, and this is not what the community wanted. Its only what the publisher wants and thinks is best for their bottom line.
