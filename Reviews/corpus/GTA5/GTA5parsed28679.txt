rockstar is too quick to ban people... and i honestly dont even think its that at this point. At any inconvenience they have rockstar will just quickly come in and ban people hoping that it wont be heard as an overall mass of people. But its actually getting a bit t. My friend bought a shark card and didnt get the money for a week. So he tries for a refund like a normal person would. Then rockstar gives his steam account a bad review or some bull . now he cannot use steam with a credit card and MUST use a steam card to get any funds into his account. Overall terrible company and they just messed up
