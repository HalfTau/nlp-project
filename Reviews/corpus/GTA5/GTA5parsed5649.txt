DONT BUY THIS GAME! Its not fun, its glitchy, its a grind, a pay to win, and a lot of other issues. They keep adding little heres a small amount of money that cant buy you anything events so you keep playing but it wants you to pay more money to buy stupid vehicles to  around in the multiplayer. honestly the single player is okay, its okay, NOT WORTH 60 THOUGH!
