Game does not have modding support anymore, a core element of the game. I will not be spending anymore money on another rockstar product until they choose to listen to their community instead of extorting us for a giant cash cow. I was looking forward to red dead redemtion 2, or a GTA VI, but I can give another company my money who will spend it better.
