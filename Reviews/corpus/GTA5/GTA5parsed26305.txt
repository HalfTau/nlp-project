R.I.P. the mod community. And I do really mean that but tbh  modders. I mean I got nothing on the singleplayer modders because I do belive singleplayer games should be modded, but not ONLINE games. In a way, I am relieved that modders are gone because I dont have to worry about unpresidented money drops, I dont have to worry about some  crashing my game, blowing me up, turning me into a toilet okay to be fair, its a little funny. And what do you mean Rockstar bans you for modded money that you didnt ask for, recently in the loading screen they say we noticed your account went through weird changes, well get things back to normal SO THAT YOU DONT GET BANNED. Regardless, GTA V is an excilent game in every way. But, I have to admit, as hard as the developers are trying they are either not trying enough or are a bunch of s.
