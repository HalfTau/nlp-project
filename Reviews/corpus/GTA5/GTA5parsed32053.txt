There can be no tolerance for this kind of destructive behaviour. TakeTwo, stop messing with players and modders increasing value of your games. They are doing it for free and to have some fun. You better do something useful and fix the GTAOnline which is a  garbage. There is no other game that gives me more headache than this. Its literally a loading simulator and playing with a friend is a bloody nightmare. It is completely counterintuitive and we are always laughing with a friend when something works for a change that its probably a bug. I am serious, because of the way the interface and game work online this is by far my worst online experience. Do something with that rather than preventing people from enhancing your games.
