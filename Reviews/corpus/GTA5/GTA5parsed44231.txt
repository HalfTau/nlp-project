From the point where TakeTwo decided to take down the modding sites and pretty much get rid of any modding in any form from the game, including single player, I cannot reccomend this game to anybody. This was a great game when it originally came out, and now R has taken a great game, paywalled it toand flushed any good credit they had of its sandbox potential down the toilet. Do NOT support a development studio that is so full of crap like this, We want unlimited possibilities in our games, not get them taken away.
