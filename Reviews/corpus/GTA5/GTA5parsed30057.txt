Singleplayergreat storygreat charactersgreat satirical view onto americagreat npcsoverall you can get lost in the singleplayer alone for hours and if you follow the story with the great cut scenes you feel very immersed into the world/storyMultiplayerYou can have fun with friends and you have soooo many possibilities to earn money buy houses cars etc etc. BUT with recent updates which get more and more expensive every time just compare prices of former best super cars and the new ones and imo its just time for Rockstar to let it die out its just sucking the last bit of money out of the shark card system you should never ever buy oneAlso the games like races or car etc mini games deathmatches etc are fun as hell with your friendsEven though i mentioned many negative things about the MP if you can grab this game on sale buy it and enjoy it alone in Singleplayer or with friends in Multiplayer you find enough modders online or scripts so you have enough moneyoh and yeah this game looks gorgeous
