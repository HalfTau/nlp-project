Well I really Like This Game. There is nothing wrong with it...except for 3 things.1. I will never forgive Take Two for removing mods even though theyve undone that. And yes I know its not rockstars fault  but still.2. The Online Aspect is too much of a grind and they push shark cards way too hard.3. The Online load times are atrocious
