Terrible support of the modding community. Take Two Lowkey hates the modding community and will come up with bs reasons to shut it down. The only reason 90 of people who play gta 5 on the pc bought the game is to mod it. The modding community was pretty much shut down. They literally butt  themselves with this situation, but will they fix it, HELL NO!! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible,  terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, and did I mention terrible people who give 0 craps about the community and its players, own this damn game. With all due respect, it would be much appreciated if the modding community could get some support, so please take 2 seconds and sign this petition
