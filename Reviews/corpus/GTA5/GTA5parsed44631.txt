If you cant stand people modding your game, dont develop games.  Will NOT be buying Red Dead 2 or ANY other Rockstar/TakeTwo game unless the CeaseandDesist letter is revoked and an honest, public, apology is made for violating OpenIVs fair use rights as stated in Section 107 of the Copyright Act.Fix thisor go down the same path other  AAA developers are headed.  Examples you ask?  EA?  Hows Mass Effect Andromeda been selling recently?  Not getting a release in Japan I see, underwhelming sales in the UK and US, hmmm I wonder why?  Oh, Ubisoft?  I cant hear you over the money Ive saved by not purchasing a game from you since Far Cry 3.Youre next Rockstar/TakeTwo.
