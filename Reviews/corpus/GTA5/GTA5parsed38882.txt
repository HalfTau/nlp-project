Its a fun game, but if Take Two and Rockstar are going to release Gunrunning as a massive grindfest with ridiculous prices to make players buy Shark Cards then send ceaseanddesist letters to OpenIV then I feel that playing the game and supporting their shady business practices just isnt a good idea. OpenIV was a singleplayer modding tool and their press statement about it being a tool that enables harassment against online players is complete bogus. Take Two is a scummy company and I hope Rockstar can break free from it.Who knows? Maybe they can see how badly they ed up and undo everything and apologize, like OVERKILL/Starbreeze did when they added microtransactions to PAYDAY 2. But this isnt the first time that Take Two has fought game modders before, such as the guys who were porting the GTA San Andreas and Red Dead Redemption maps to GTA V. you, Take Two Interactive and tar.
