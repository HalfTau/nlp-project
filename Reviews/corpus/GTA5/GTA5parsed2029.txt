 Great graphics and sounds Plenty of stuff to do Constantly updated content Easy to play you can learn it fast Helpful tips/tutorialBut ONLINE can be annoying and frustrating. Why? When you see a modder/cheater you need to find new session because it will suck if you stay on it and if he gives you any money you need to tell Rockstar about it so they take it away from you and you wont get banned, blah blah. Also they spawn random stuff on map and put you in cages and ... People constantly leaving jobs in some cases you end up 5vs1 which is ... they should make a punishment system for a better ONLINE gameplay such as not being able to join jobs for 12 hours REAL TIME or SOMETHING. When someone gets DC or leaves a job there will be a chance of game ERROR, Freeze, Crash and then you need to Alt  F4 and wait again that long loading screen even on SSD. Sometimes gets buggy. Some players are annoyingIf they would put more effort in it for ONLINE it would make lots of money and millions would play it.
