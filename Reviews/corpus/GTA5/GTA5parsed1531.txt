this is a beautiful and amazing game and i love it so much, the single player campaign is amazing and fun and the online multiplayer is amazing and fun, but there is one problem, and thats making money. having money in gta is what makes the game fun, wihtout moeny you are broke and have no fun toys. and money in this game is not easy to make, it can be hard and takes way too long to make enough to buy what you want. and also everything in the game is way overpriced making it even more difficutl when ut comes to money, but seriously other than that one issue this game is amazing and i 10/10 would recomend to you and all of your friends if you are looking to have a fun time messing aroun in the open world masterpiece
