NIce Game but owned by a terrible companywasnt planning to leave any review for this gamebut what Take Two did is just wrong and killing the fun in this gameFor single player storyI quite like it tbhit is very enjoyable like a lot of previous titlesIts a shame R shut down the development for futher single player story developmenthowever GTA online is really a bummerthe price for everything is too expensiveinsanity long loading screenshtty earning from missionsA lot of hackers to deal withthats not how a Grand Theft Auto game supposed to bebut R seems to love it so much and continously having update and stuff that I dont care about anymoreSmugglers Run is probably the worst dlc ever. It is so miserable that everything are very expensive and u probably cant buy sht, if u could buy the hangar, congratulations on wasting ur money and time on it, it is the WORST busines EVER, mission is not the easiest and not that fun at all but the paid out is definitly the lowest.
