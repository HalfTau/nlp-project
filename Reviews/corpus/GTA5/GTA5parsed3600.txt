GTA V is a great game. Yes, it has downsides, which i can get into later, but it is simply a great game. The visuals are great, it runs well, and the actual core gameplay is very fun. If you have friends that play this game, you should get it now. if you plan on going solo, maybe you should wait for a sale. The online is also very fun, my only problem being the microtransactions and insanely high priced items like vehicles and properties from DLC. I think it is very hard to get started without at least buying a shark card, which shouldnt be a problem in a game like this. The game is now only about money to Rockstar. This being said, i still think the game should be bought, even if you dont plan on playing online. The story is great, funny, and long so prepare yourself. I reccommend buying this game.
