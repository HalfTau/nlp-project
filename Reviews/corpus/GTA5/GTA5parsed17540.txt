If you wanna play singleplayer then this is a nice game.. but then you can download it ilegally rather than buy this.. r are money hungry s who just wanna sell sharkcards. in online it exist alot of hackers who will either drop you money or just  you up at other ways... and if they drop you money its better to say bye to all your money you grinded for a dlc or some and this game is so expensive. the only great thing about online is that you get all the dlc for free which will drive you insane when hackers just get it in 1 sec after the release and kills you 24/7 with it... better go to piratbay and play just play singleplayer. but the dlcS doesnt come to singleplayer so better find out how to get mods
