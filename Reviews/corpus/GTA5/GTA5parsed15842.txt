Solid game even today. Got it last month and damn is it fun to ride around in a car. Yep, thats basically why I got so many hours. Not the story mode, cause I didnt feel like playing the story mode and... Lets just say Im glad the internet exists.In any case its really fun. Now, I shouldnt say to much since I have put some money into the game cause the online mode is admittedly prettywithout friends or friendly players good luck. But with the great white shark card its pretty easy to earn money once you put like 15 dollars into the game you can buy a company and do some deliveries. If you do have friends you can do some missions to get you started! Honestly, its heavily pay 2 play. But I like to call it pay 2 have fun.Once you got some money, maybe a company and a house/apartment youre set for screwing around pretty much. But time is money, and if you arent a heavy pay2play its gonna cost you A LOT of time! In fact, I think you could spend 100 hours doing the hardest mission and completing them but still dont have enough money to start screwing around.TLDR Online is the real reason to play unless you like being alone.. and while it can be pay 2 play it is fun with friends. I would recommend to those who is ready to play this game for hours. Not a unhealthy amount of time, but time is needed for this game if youre not pay 2 play.Heres how I rate the major parts of the game.Graphics 10/10 The graphics are too good that even with a GTX 1070 I cant go to the highest without lag TControls 8/10 Sometimes I am annoyed at the different interact keys and how some things wont work some timesStory 3/10 Didnt actually play it, but from what I have heard it wasnt all that great to begin withPlayer base activity 9/10 if you try hard enough, you can find a empty sessionPersonal enjoyment 8/10 Good graphics, wonky controls, crap story and a hacking player base, but a active one none the less
