just bought a GTA II for my PSONE on the 19th of JuneI constantly told people Rockstar was a bad company but never expected them to go this low.I never expected to see this extraordinary ammount of greed from a dev this big. Rockstar has priced GTA V to 80 and reduced it to 60, then removed the ability to buy the game by itself so that it could only be bought in bundles with extra crap no one wants. By bundling the game with the micro transaction money, anyone who purchases it cannot ge a refund. Not only is this a violation of FTC regulation and EU law, it is the biggestmove I have seen on steam yet. I would have rather had my 60 go to the WarZ devs than this crap Since then, rockstar has added the ability to buy GTA V alone for 60. Truly a noble move. They dont even have this level of garbage buisness on consoles. Lt. Commander Bright
