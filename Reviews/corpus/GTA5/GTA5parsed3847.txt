The story mode is amazing but once you try to play GTA Online with your friends nothing works. Logging in takes forever and you constantly get connection errors.Almost every activity takes you to a loading screen where you risk getting disconnected from the online service when saving fails.There is no proper party system for you to be able to start missions together with friends, so you end up repeatedly joining games and hoping youre the host so you can switch off matchmaking and invite your friends instead.The fact that Rockstar has the cheek to sell Shark Cards for suchpoor online services is an insult to the consumer.
