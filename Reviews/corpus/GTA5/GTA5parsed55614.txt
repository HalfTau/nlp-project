I do not recommend buying any product that has a Take Two label on it, and to be honest, Ive only bought your game to mod in singleplayer, Ive not invested more than 10 minutes on your GTAOnline service which was a horrible experience and thats alright but ruining the Singleplayer modding scene more than 2 times by shutting down GTAMP, FiveM and now OpenIV, is not something to be taken very lightly.Thank you for ruining modding for me and many others and with that youve lost a potential customer for your upcoming games.
