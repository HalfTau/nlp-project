I played 300 hours of this game, like 4 of those are online. The mods are the only thing actually worth using in this game. taketwo.EditSo now that the OpenIV fiasco has subsided, still  this game. I played singleplayer for 300 ing hours and playing online is a goddamn mess. Beware new players, just dont play this online.Unless youre willing to shell out another hundred bucks for a goddamn virtual car.
