about a year or so ago i was in a lobby that a modder gave every one free money and he was standing on my car so every time i would get out i would get a million dollers each time...so i stoped playing  it about a week the i jumped on and then it said sorry you account is banned..so i called up the support and told them what i am telling you even i dont mod i dont like modding the guy on the phone again i dont remaber his name sorry for the miss spelling but in the short of it he told me i would have to buy a new copy and make a new rockstar s club log in.and i remind you i transfer my stuff from the ps3 and i spent real money on shark cards for this game.so if you want to be wrongfully acoused for modding then pick the game up but i would not recommend this game for the pc and i been playing since gta 12 all the way back in 1998.and this has nothing to do with the rescent take 2 about modding thing..i just cant belive they do this to there custmer base.
