This is a game that I could a write a 10x10 essay on, and still have things to say about it.Its a game, that when unlocked with mods you can do whatever you want in. I have played some GTAOnline though I did not find it to my liking, this game allows you to find other multiplayer mods, that might have different gamemodes that GTAOnline do not support. Such as servers solely for roleplay, racing, killing etc etc.. Too many to name.The story itself is okay, wont get in to it, as its only one part of the game. Though you might have to play through some of the story to gain access to everything in the game. Such as tattoo stores, property purchasing etc.Its a really good game, I havent regretted preordering it and owning it. Had several hilarious moments in it.Really recommending it.
