Decent enough game, but Take 2s takedown of OpenIV a singleplayeronly modding tool under the explanation of addressing multiplayer exploits is unacceptable. Im extremely hesitant to endorse this game until Take 2 resolves their hostile stance against singleplayer modding.UPDATE OpenIV is back! So, Im tentatively changing my stance here. But its still a bit insane that this happened in the first place.
