Despite the bad reviews I think personally that this game is very good, there is a lot to do and whilst I have only played around 80ish hours I still have not completed single player and I have not found online to get boring yet. I worked hard enough to become Ceo and get a motorcycle club etc and rockstar adding new things in all the time I currently dont see how it could get boring. There is also a large range of mini games and heists you can do. I would definitely reccommend this game. Yes rockstar have clamped down on modders especially onees who drop money into servers but I dont see that as a problem anyway. My only dissappointment for this game is the recent antimodding even in single player which I dont think is necesssary. Still a very good game tho and full of content anyway.
