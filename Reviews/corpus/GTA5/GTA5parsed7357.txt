Great game for jumping on for a spare 20 minutes or spending hours and hours on it    . Even better getting it at sale prices    , even now    . Anyone who enjoyed playing any of the older gta series will love this game    . Do missions and complete the game or just go on it to cause mayhem for short periods of time   . Its totally up to you    . Graphics are excellent and the game is really enjoyable    . My kids play it more than i do but with sound off because of the language    . Sexual content is non existent unless you seek out the very few strip bars as far as im aware but from any point of view an epic game    .Online mode    ..............Ive heard of cheaters    , but to be honest    , ive rarely played that side of the game to be able to comment    . My younger brother    , who is at collage has though and loves it    . Enjoy    .
