Singleplayer experience not getting any attention or updates, online being a money grab with long load times and subpar action.Its a big world to explore, but the offline experience is suffering due to shark card strategies and the online experience is often frustrating due to slow pace long load times, long travel time, bad Heist system.Even setting up so the online world is only played with your crew is painful.If you want the action and Heists, buy PayDay2.
