Incompetent dev could not ban those modders in Online GTA for years. Online still remain infested and plagued by griffers and modders.Now they want to ban the good modders in Single Player. Why? you could not release a single player DLC and now want to ban the SP modder?If you have some brain or capability left ban the Online modders and griffer. Incompenent Dev.Never going to buy anthoer ROCKSTAR GAME EVER.
