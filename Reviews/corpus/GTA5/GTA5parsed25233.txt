I bought this game on 3X different formats with the latest being for PC modding in SOLO MODE, but TAKETWO was greedy and betrayed us LOYAL customers by going after OpenIV and the modding community. I could never recommend this game for the online mode because it SUCKS! Now I cannot recommend the single player mode because TAKETWO RUINED that experience.SCREW YOU TAKETWO!! !
