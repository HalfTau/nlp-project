GTA 5 modding has recently been declared illegal by its publisher TakeTwo Interactive.TakeTwo Interactive has sent a cease and desist letter to shut down OpenIV, the biggest singleplayer modding tool for GTA games since 2008. This has effectively killed modding for GTA 4, GTA 5 and Max Payne 3, and may affect modding across the entire industry.Unfortunately, Rockstar seems to be supportive of this decision to ban modding for their games, as there has been no opposition on TakeTwos decision from their part.I will not be buying another Rockstar or TakeTwo game until this is fixed. I urge you to consider doing the same if you believe in the value of the modding community, not only for GTA 5 but for any game.
