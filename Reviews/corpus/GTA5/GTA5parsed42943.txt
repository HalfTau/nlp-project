You know, like how I feel towards America about Trump being president, Im not in utter hatred of TakeTwo. Im just ashamed. I hope TakeTwo can listen up. The series you and Rockstar have been in charge of is incredible, and we all deserve to be thankful that the modding communities for the many games in the series have become so huge, but we also deserve to try and show you that modders are trying to help improve the experience youve spent just about as much effort into making it as they have with improving it. I just hope you can work this out, and I hope you work it out with the OpenIV team and their petition, which Ill definitely sign. Please, though. We all hope to play your game in the future, and we hope this isnt permanent.
