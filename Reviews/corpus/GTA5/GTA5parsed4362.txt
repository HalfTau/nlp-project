Rockstar will do anything to sell shark cards even at the expense of the players happiness. If you want to have fun in an open world games there are so many others that are 100 times more fun and do not try to force microtransactions on the players as a way of life in game. One example of a fun open world game is Ghost Recon Wildlands if you want a fun open world game I strongly suggest it of course you could take my words with a grain of salt, but with 50 hours of play time I think I have been able to catch on to a few things this game and this company does to its consumers.
