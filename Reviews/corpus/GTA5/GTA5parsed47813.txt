GTA messed up, dont kill the mod community or the mod community will kill your game!UpdateTakeTwos actions were not specifically targeting single player mods. Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody,... We are working to figure out how we can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players.What rubbish are you talking? OpenIV was almost purely single player, if anyone used it to mod into online you should go after them not the source. Taketwo, you hecked up.
