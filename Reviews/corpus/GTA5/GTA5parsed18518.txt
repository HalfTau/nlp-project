Do not buy this piece of garbage. Got online for the first time back when they first introduced their improved anti cheat system and got banned for a week. Why? because I had fraps and msi afterburner running. Stupid me even tried to plead in their forums to get unbanned. Nothing. Yeah. Never touched the online section since. havent finished the story either, that just ruined my mood to ever play any r game.
