Only reason this game has longterm survivability is mods, without them this game is worth the pirate to finish the story, multiplayer gets stale over time and the launch of big expansions that take 30 hours to get literally everything in the dlc, mods kept multiplayer and single player fun and exciting because it helped make the game into a different game, bad game no mods.
