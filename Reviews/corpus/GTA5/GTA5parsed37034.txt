I were statisfied by the outcome of this game for few years ago.No one can scratch on the game itself.Rockstar Games have a creative team gathered and they know exactly how to make a great game.But the lastest decision to fight their own community by forcing openiv to close their project. Has shown like many times also besides this that Rockstar Games is a bunch of smugs.GTA was modded since GTA3 on PC, so you have obvious a fact to plan within your game release, which have been not done, so far.This horrific decision to attack the whole modding community and declare them all for cheaters is insane. Instead of addings a semifunctional anticheat tool like EasyAntiCheat or VAC, you attacks your own customers and fans...Rockstar Games will surely pay for this.PS I was been permanently banned, because i have collected alot of money from a modder on server. This nonsense also happens, try to manage this nonsense propertly please and do not attack everyone randomly.
