I remember when this game was good. I could fly around as Iron Man, freezing time at will, while I watched the Incredible Hulk jump around causing devastation before getting bored and flooding the entire city.That was back when this game was good.Now that modding has been essentially disabled, this game is unsupported years old singleplayer, and  grindy multiplayer. I wish I could refund.Take Two? Go f yourselves.
