This product is near worthless, with a hint of potential ruled over by a blatantly money hungry corporation, who do nothing but sit in an echo chamber all day, smelling their own flatulence, and getting a buzz off of gasoline fumes, until they believe that the public would be okay with all of their autistic, anticonsumer decisions. I feel for the multitudes who were duped by the fee2play cluster  of an online mode, and of course there was that whole mod fiasco. 2k, and by extension Rockstar, have proven that they will continue making asinine choices, time and time again therefore I will make my voice heard through the only means a corporation could hear, and thats through my wallet. Adios Rockstar, I feel a pain in my heart for knowing that your maliciousness will find a way to destroy RDR 2.
