Since they treat this game like two entirely separate games in one GTA V and GTA Online, Ill review mainly the online mode seeing as its the only thing they really care about putting time and effort into these days since its probably easier for them to milk the microtransactions that are Shark Cards than release any sort of singleplayer expansion.If you play it without buying more money and mainly coop with friends, youll find it incredibly boring and repetitive, and itll take you forever for you to get basically anywhere since it takes around 20 so minutes to make around 20,000, and everything thats worth buying is millions upon millions of dollars.I dont play public lobbies so I cant make use of any of the CEO or biker expansions, but really the Go here, blow up this vehicle, pick up the box, drive back missions are a small price to forfeit for avoiding getting banned from some script kiddies messing with your account.Missions will always come down to which ones you can effeciently complete quickly and for a lot of money, the heists are okay but getting people together for them is a pain if you dont play with strangers and they really feel like they were just slapped in so the community would stop complaining about no heists for online.Overrall just a really mediocre experience in my opinion, cant recommend it.
