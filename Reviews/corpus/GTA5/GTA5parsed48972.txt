I preordered this game and Ive played it a ton now, but now, in midlate 2017 they ruined the game completely. They made it a pay to win money grab trash game. And dont even forget the loading screens, the loading screens are the most t time waster of all time, probably the longest Ive ever waited for a game to start up. I usually wait about 1020 minutes starting up this game. They really could revive it and make it a lot better but they just ruined it for themselves and everyone else. Pretty much the only way to make good money is to find modders, which isnt very hard of course, but nice modders. Almost every single modder Ive seen boots you offline or kills you over and over. Once the modder blamed me for exploding the whole server and I got kicked from the session and probably reported by most people. Anyways back to the t money system. Getting money in this game mostly consists of grinding countless hours and only getting a fraction of what you need to buy good things. People may think Im just lazy and dont grind but the jobs and heists barely give you any ing thing. If youre going to buy it, buy it when people are saying its getting better.  I dont even know how I keep sane while playing this. What a trash ruined garbage game.
