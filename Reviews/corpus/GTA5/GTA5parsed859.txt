Its good, always new content, but they raise the prices on the vehicles and items each dlc and never up the money on anything. They are inflating prices to try and get you to buy shark cards. They dont actively hunt scripters to the game is filled with UFOs and God mode. Beyond that the game is well made and the heists are fun once or twice.
