Take Two have milked this game dry. Microtransactions Shark Cards that grant currency for GTA Online are their main motivation for keeping it up. The servers are peertopeer, which is terrible and cheaters are rife. Instead of making dedicated servers for the game, tthey decided to cheap out. The cheaters were able to modify your bank balance, explode you and everyone else in the lobby and alter the killfeed to frame someone else for the kill amongst other things. Instead of revamping how the servers operate in an attempt to make it harder for people to cheat, Take Two has decided to outright ban people from modding their game. It doesnt even matter if you only mod the game to affect Single Player since going Online with mods enabled will get you banned from GTA Online unless youre using some kind of cheat that bypasses this check, anyway, its still not allowed. This is a heavyhanded, and downright stupid thing to do.In addition to that, with each update, items such as cars, clothing etc are priced outrageously, to the point where youll probably need to fork out real money in order to afford them unless you want to grind out repetitive missions/heists.The single player section of the game has been neglected for years. Weve been waiting on DLC for it to hopefully expand the story like GTA IV did with The Lost and Damned  The Ballad of Gay Tony, but this hasnt happened and probably wont for the foreseeable future.I did enjoy this game at launch and have put hundreds of hours into it, but I cant support what Take Two are doing. Im very concerned about how theyre going to handle Red Dead Redemption 2s multiplayer. I feel as if microtransactions will also be prominent there.
