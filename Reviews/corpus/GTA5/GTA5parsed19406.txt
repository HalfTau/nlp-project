This game is structured as a F2P, only you have to pay 60 ing dollars the game is 3 years old, still full price. Nothing you do in GTAO will ever be profitable unless you pay out the the items get more expensive and the payouts get worse, so your only option boils down to buying a shark card which dont even give you that much for what theyre worth, this game used to be good and fun until Rockstar decided to milk it.
