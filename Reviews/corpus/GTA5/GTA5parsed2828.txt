Ultimate garbage of a game. It looks fun from the outside but after you buy it you are gonna realise that it wasnt a hole all along, it was a stick.Ya lets use P2P on a game that made billions so we can save up more money vby not running our own servers so we can make more DLC and Oh whats that? hackers running around killing people and throwing then in the air? Naaaaaa its just a prank bro im sure the other players will understand xdddddd. But sir, they are giving away free money this could hurt our shark card sells. Ya just ban those guys then leave the rest. And the million bugs that need fixing? Hey dude listen, if its nothing to do with us losing money from shark cards or dlc then I dont give a , now get the  out of my office and find a way to make people buy more dlc.
