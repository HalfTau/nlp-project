GTA Online is a  experience that is based around money making opposed to actually having any fun. All it is is stressful and a lot of people arebags online and try to kill you when you are trying to have fun. This game just pisses me off and it is not worth buying. The company are a bunch of greedy s who want you to buy shark cards instead of actually letting you have fun.
