Pros stunning map and open world, amazing graphics excellent story mode campaign if not slightly short, good replay value some really good and fun online modes contact missions, heists, races, deathmatches, captures, wide variety of different adversary modes, ... a huge variability and freedom in how you want to enjoy gta online great game to enjoy with friends online rockstar editor is easily one of the best features of the game, and basically allows you to shoot your own movies using game assets superb creator mode for making custom online races, deathmatches, and capturesCons gta online is basically broken due to modders and hackers everywhere  rockstar has no handle on the problem, every public lobby has hackers and people begging for money drops too many things are far too expensive and are totally unrealistically priced  this actually encourages people to get help from hackers and modders everything seems to be designed to encourage players to buy shark cards examples ingame propaganda, game characters that keep harassing you to buy expensive useless stuff, dripfeeding of expensive cars and items, and so on rockstar occasionally bans fully legitimate players due to errors in their modder detection system  the hard truth is that nobody is safe from their banhammer, even if you only play in inviteonly sessions and never use hacks I know various 100 clean people with 2000 hours of gameplay getting suddenly falsely banned fortunately all overturned in a few weeks once they realized their mistake, but no apology or explanation, and all legitimate money taken away without compensation dreadful support  often, tickets are automatically closed without a proper reply, you may never ever actually get a real person to look at your tickets, and when they do, they are clueless and dont properly read your issue, until like 4 or 5 iterations, making it very tiresome to try to interact with rockstar support outright hostile attitude towards the creative community  in July 2017, Take 2 screwed over the entire creative community, by legally threatning honest developers who actively do their very best to play nice, and who contributed enormously to the popularity of the entire GTA series, apparently aiming to kill creativity altogether, in a completely unnecessary, brutal, and nasty way rockstar editor and editor mode are super cool but have quite a lot of limitations, it would be nice to see some work in this area unfortunately the rockstar editor hasnt seen much love, only one minor update ever, and a lot of issues are still there  this is a real shame no more new exciting contact missions or heists, new DLCs are just silly adversary modes, boring missions to grind for money, along with plenty of expensive useless stuffAs much as I hate to say it after having spent countless hours of fun in every GTA game since GTA III, I now turn to say please dont give these guys your money. Take 2 has turned to the dark side. Rockstar is unable to control the hackers and the modders, and worse, actively encourages it in various ways, and even bans legitimate players, in a way violating their own EULA. They are just squeezing every cent they can, instead of focusing on what really contributes to the game experience. Its a shame.
