The singleplayer for this game is amazing but we all know that.The online mode would be just as amazing if it wasnt for all the modders on PC. If you buy this game to play the online, dont do it. Play on console instead. You will be spoiled regularly by modders that just want to mess you up because they got nothing else to do in their life.Rockstar is apparently very idle in their reaction to the modders and for all of theses reasons, DO NOT BUY THIS IS ON PC if you plan on playing the online mode.
