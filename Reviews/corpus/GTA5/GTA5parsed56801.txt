Good game ruined by corporate greed. Ive hated what Take Two has done to this game even before the OpenIV dilemma. LETS ADD A ON OF THINGS TO SPEND MONEY ON, BUT NO WAYS TO EARN MONEY EFFICIENTLY BESIDES SHARK CARDS. Turned Online into a cash grabbing disgrace. I genuinely fear for Red Dead Redemption 2 because the same morons are in charge. Dont support these s. Im glad I didnt spend a cent on their stupid shark cards.
