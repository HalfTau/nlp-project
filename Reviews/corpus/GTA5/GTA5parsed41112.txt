Online is ridden with hackers, but you cant just play with your friends.None of the promised single player content has come, but you can have a saints row, flying, rocket shooting motor cycle! If you play online with hackers for 20 hoursThe core concept and polish that made the series has been ruined by a focus for multiplayer geared toward children who should not be playing.The single player is worth it if you can catch the game on sale.100 of real money cannot get you the most expensive stuff.Oh, and they killed mod support because they thought the backbone of modding can be used for cheats It cant. Gurantee nightmare is a hellholeSold like butter cakes on PC but you dont get Red Dead becasue Sonys suits paid for it!Stay away.
