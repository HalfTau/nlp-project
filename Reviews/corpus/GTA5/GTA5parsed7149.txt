Never had a game crash so much! SLI doesnt work properly and overall a thoroughly hateful experience. A big Fyou to Rocktard games for making this P.O.S.  Id rather put out a campfire with my face or run through a forest blindfolded than go through this ultrafrustrating experience again. Do not buy this game ever  you will regret it.  Mothertrucker, if I ever come across a Rocktard programmer Ill rip his arms off and slap him with the wet ends! Anyways, I must make like a fetus and head out....
