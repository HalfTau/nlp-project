Alright, first let me start off by saying the single player and graphics are both great, but can be better with mods. On my other account a politically incorrect pelican I have 400 hours of gameplay, pretty much all of it online. I modded on multiplayer and got banned for a month and a character reset. Fine I never modded again. After grinding myback up the the turd that has become gta online, my account is perma banned and I am FORCED to create a new steam account and buy he game again to play with my friends. Please dont buy this game for multiplayer, go elsewhere because gta online has become nothing but a race to get banned by the jackasses at Rockstar.
