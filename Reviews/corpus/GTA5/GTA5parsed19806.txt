The whole mod and shark cardis redic, theres no reason RStar and Take2 should be so greedy. I dont care if mods are back or not GTAV still deserves a bad review. Lets see if they can figure it out with GTAVI. We dont pay 60 bucks for a game to later have to pay hundreds of dollars to more enjoy the game bc nobody does any missions to acutally make money. Then get banned or sued trying to modify the game how you want it to be....you know, after you paid 60 dollars. Almost a scam in my opinion. Since when is 60 dollars not enough to enjoy a game? Glad Im not one that got sucked into paying extra money for literally the same experience everyone else is having. Learned my lesson on League of Legends p
