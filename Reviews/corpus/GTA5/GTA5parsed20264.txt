Never played it on PC so I dont know about this version but Grand Theft Auto V is by far one of the best video games to ever come out so far. Its not just a Shooter, Its not just a Racing Game, its not just an exploration game, its everything combined making it the most open Grand Theft Auto ever to be released.ProsVERY moddable. Story ModeAmazing Online mode unlike anything youve seen.Great music on the radio plus an amazing ingame soundtrack for both Online and Story Mode.LOTS of cars that can be modified.Lots of guns that can be modified.This game doesnt have that crappy driving physics like in WatchDogs 1/2 or Just Cause 1/2/3.There is a lot to do in both SinglePlayer and Multiplayer.Good story. although maybe not as good as IVGood Graphics. could have been better if not released on last gen consolesVery funny.ConsMap is too small and boring.Online Sessions need a higher player cap. Maybe 100?Driving physics are not realistic but still not too arcadey like WD or JCIf your were to drive a car straight into a wall at 100mph, it would look like you hit it at 30mph. Cars are pretty much made of steelAutoaim is abused way too often Online resulting in constant deathmatches in the city.Online modders are a thing and they will either bully you, ruin your game by spawning stuff, or give you x amount of cash so that Rockstar bans you.Everything Online is overpriced and requires you to either grind youroff or buy Shark Cards.New DLC is no longer being ported over to SinglePlayer.Once you have done everything the game gets boring.Notice how most of the cons are for Online? Grand Theft Auto V is a great game, Grand Theft Auto Online is okay. even though there are more things to Online.Overall I think this is an amazing game that you should at least try. It has its ups and downs but so does every other game.
