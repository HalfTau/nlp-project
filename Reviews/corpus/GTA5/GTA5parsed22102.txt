First time playing the GTA series. After downloading all 72GB, and wading through signing up for a Social Club account, and changing my display settings from 800x600 what year is this again?, I finally got to play. Then I find out that the rifles are rendered without magazines half the time, even though you can still put rounds downrange. I couldnt find a subtitles option. Sometimes, the controls arent really responsive.I uninstalled all three of the GTA games I bought today and will likely not be playing them again. I feel like I could have been doing something constructive, like counting the hairs around my belly button.
