Ive played this game for 2 years on PC. Great game and the mods are ... oh wait ... ING GONE! My single player graphics mods, are gone. Mods is one of the major benefits of PC gaming, graphics being another. I can no longer mod the graphics. you TakeTwo, ing scumbags. You made a great game, we waited for the PC version, just to screw us over later down the line, because youve made your money right? Well  you. Change this now before you reputation is tainted forever, if it isnt already.
