GTA 5 Has devolved from a quatiy game to a Micro trasaction swiming pool of money for Rockstar and Take 2. they no longer care about making quality content and fun exspernece, but rather stupidly grindy, frustrating and repeditive game play and is not worth the 150 I put in to bouth Pc and 360. They Disregard problems in the game like moders, nad insted chose to punish people who just so happen to be in a sererver with one, all to try and force people on to the shark cards. And now this hole bissness with Open 4 and the new update where I get spammed in game about once a minute by texts emails and calls untill i buy a new bunker wwich at least 1.1 million for the closest spot and then get spamed to by an paring veichle that I have to have to proceed Is making me want to unistall a game that I could play for probably at least another 100 hours I have 175 on pc and probably 300 on the 360 in the next year.It is not a fun game anymore
