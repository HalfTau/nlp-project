Really rockstar? I already have this game on ps4, and xbox one, and I bother to buy this game yet again for your greedy asses just because I want to explore the mods. and you do this? I understand you dont want mods in online that kind of makes sense, but really? REALLY? Cant even use them in single player anymore? Also when it comes to online, let me tell you, you all are money hungry S! You want me to buy a card with real money to have virtual money, and if I dont you force me to sit there and grind for literally HOURS just to get a fake car? Plus you say you ban people, but I see people with level 5000, and 140,000,000 all the time in online, so its really unfair to your legit players like me. I have so many hours into this game across all 3 platforms, but after this it is official. You have lost a loyal Player you money hungry s!
