They finally did something to prevent cheaters at the cost of removing mods from the game completely. After 170 hours there is still content to finish with some major achievements. I dont really give a ratsif there is no more mods. Im sure most of the people complaining about mods did not even get close to finishing half of the online content. It is money well spent.
