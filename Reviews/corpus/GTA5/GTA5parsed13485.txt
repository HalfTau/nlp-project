This game is a very fun game and i would recommend it to everyone. But there some problems, One to many modders, it seems like every session i join theres a modder in it, and R doesnt seem to really care. Two its to much of a gride, i spent hours and hours, just to make money and only got a mil to two, its just to much work, and requires a lot of playing time. Three GTA Online is very unblanced somethings are to overpowered while other things are to underpowered. there really no even match. But other than thos big problems its is a really fun game,
