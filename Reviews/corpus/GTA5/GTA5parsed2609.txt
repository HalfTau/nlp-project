Story Mode Not even close to the catching stories of GTA3, Vice City, forever in our hearts San Andreas or even GTA4. I found characters flat, plot doesnt really make much sence and I didnt found myself interested in fate of anybody. Lamar says  way too much.Online Full of , insane loading times, game is broken. Half of the time I cant even log in. What the fck Rockstar.
