Awesome game but there are flaws. Story mode is a bit bland because they stopped updating it with the newset content from online. Online can be bad SOMETIMES but other times its awesome. In online people can be very hostile and everything is very VERY exspensive and takes a long time to get money if you dont mod Witch is practically impossible now but as long as you have some people to play it with, it can be a very fun game.
