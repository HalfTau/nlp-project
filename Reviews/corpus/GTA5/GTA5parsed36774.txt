This is the last GTA title I buy. I havent logged online in months on this title and Im normally on closed sessions when I play. My hard earned  is apparently only there for later removal by an anticheat program. Honestly Im willing to bet this was intentional those corporate hacks assume profits in the midst of this little mess like war lords gun running in 3rd world countries. Worse than EA.
