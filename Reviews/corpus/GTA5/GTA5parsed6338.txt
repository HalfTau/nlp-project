Buy a shark card amirite, Ivan?STEP TWO?We add a bunch of cool new high tech vehicles like back to the futer mobile and other lesser sports carSOUNDS VERY NICEThen we put coolall over the cool u.s. film delorean and jack the price up to 4 million dollarDECOMISSIONED WILL BE THING, YES?Oh heaven no, Ivan. Cheap alternatives lesser our chance of caving the player to spend human hard earn penny on game.As for other sports car. Since it is used to attack our soviet friends, then we shall make it only be submarine with painfully horrible handling when under water. Tedious is the new fun, IvanWHAT ABOUT THE COOL NEW HEIST?Ah. You see why make something cool and exciting When you can spam the same looking guy and make haha Funni clone gag with Lester. It will be so random of him to make the funni outburstATLEAST ANY NEW ENEMIES?Oh of course. We arent heartlest money hungry criminals so we shall grant them a new enemyIt shall be a Juggernaut type enemy with big gun of high damage and fire rate. They can even go invisibleWOW SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD ENEMY TO STUR THINGS UP EVERY ONCE IN AWHILEYeah, but i was thinking, why only use one every so often when you could have 9 of them spawn at all angles during an escort missionUH, I DUNNONo trust me, it will be fun. I thinkWELL ATLEAST ITS CHALLENGINGOh thats not the challenge. The challenge is surviving the very distant and spaced out checkpoints. Very tough for little players. Like pulling little baby teethsAS FOR THE FINALE?Do you like hallway Ivan? Be honest with me.NO NOT REALLYWell thats a shame, scrub. Did I say that right? Is that what the Millenials say now?Anyway. Imagine there be big bomb go boom. You must stop evil geek and computer kiddy. How?Very simple. Fight big juggernauts with heavy weapon sniper rifle machine gun in tight hallways baron of any free space. And to add a dash of challenge. Weve mad checkpoints almost non existant for the first and hardest part of the heist. We have also taken liberties to make some of the spots you can take cover behind blow up if shot too many times by 7 juggernaut menJEE THAT DONT SOUND FUN. WHAT OF PAYOUT?Final heist after 2 day grinding spree. Why not 1.5 million dollar. Not like, per person, but split between all peopleGOOD GAME GOOD UPDATE GUD GUD GUD
