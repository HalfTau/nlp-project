Didnt play the multiplayer yet so this is for Singelplayer only.Fantastic game. Really, quite a masterpiece actually. One I wont soon forget.The story is immersive and well written and the main characters are very likable. Something that put me off the older GTA games was that we always had to have this mafia / gangster clich going on. For once, GTA isnt just about crime all the time. GTA V lets us do other stuff which is actually relevant in the game world. Youre focused on a more realistic interpretation of a person with each of these characters, getting involved in their lives and ultimately caring about their choices. I really hope we see more of Trevor, Micheal and Franklin.Now for the revolutionary stuff. This game blends 3rd person with 1st person like nobodies business. You can gracefully transition between views during pretty much any time, giving you unprecidented access and control over what youre doing. First person in this game is just so good and feels natural to use. Youll get to see the world in all its detail through the eyes of the characters.The game world is beautiful and feels boundless. Runs smooth as butter on the PC and didnt cook my card.A memorable moment for me from this game would be taking a breather, after speeding down a highway whilst avoiding cars, panning my camera up to see Michaels son dangling from yatch on a trailer  also going 100 miles an hour  and watching him sheepishly drop into the back of my convertible. How I pulled that one off in first person, I do not know. But it was possible, and it felt great.Come for the story. Stay for the sandbox.
