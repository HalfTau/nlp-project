GTA V was turning into something special until Take Two decided they didnt want us to have mods. You have to grind and get griefed by script kiddies in GTA online or shell out money to buy Shark Cards. This is what Take Two wants just more money, they dont care about your experience online. This is why they had OPEN IV shutdown. Everytime i join a multiplayer session there is at least one script kiddy, never fails. If you are looking for a great online experience do not buy this game.
