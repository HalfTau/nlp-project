Fun game for adults, drops a lot of F bombs but generally speaking, modern generation doesnt care.GTA Online is what I enjoyed most. Much more flexibility, playability, and overall fun. Story Mode is fun to mess around on occasionally or just use cheat codes and become the god of the universe.The game will be fun for an everlasting period of time, worth the 50
