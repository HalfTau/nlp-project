Really Rockstar? I dont even play GTA 5 anymore because you just abandon the core elements of GTA for crash grabbing micro DLC, but now you went and screwed with the modding community? I think you shouldve looked at Bethesdas PAID mods and see why you shouldnt mess with the modding community. Shame on you for ruining a fanbase that has been the leader in gaming for the last 20 years. Poor, poor poor.
