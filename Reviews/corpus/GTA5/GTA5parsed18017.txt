PROSGreat Single PlayerGood FPSEngaging StorylineGreat GameplayWhat you would expect from a GTA game in general.CONSThe Multiplayer is a big grindfest.You hardly make any money doing missions yet everything worth having is expensive as !.The hackers earlie on made themselves rich and flaunt their wealth and toys online.The fact that their multiplayer is set up around their Shark Cards is pure trash. They want you to give up on trying to make money and buy a freaking Shark Card! Its just another way to exploit their playerbase even after charging full price for the game.Most of the online community is pretty toxic.Greedy Developers. They might have spent 265 million to make this game but it made 3 billion dollars in sales so ask yourself this question. Does this game REALLY need micro transactions? I think we all know the answer to that question...
