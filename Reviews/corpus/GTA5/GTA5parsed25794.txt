One of there selling points is a open world game that you can do what ever you want. Thanks take two for taking that away. OPEN IV IS FOR SINGLE PLAYER ONLY! Single player mods is what made this game series great not online. On behalf of everyone that used mods for single player use only,  YOU Rockstar and Take Two!
