Three years after launch. still full price. my friends get banned for no reason. High paywall. dear god why would anyone subject themselves to this mental torture. if you want to buy this game, do yourself a favor and wait for a sale so you dont pay full price. oh wait, theyll force you to buy a shark card. youll pay more durring the summer sale. This game is greed incarnate.
