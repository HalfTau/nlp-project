This is so sad... it could be such a great game but cheating is so common, and you cant play on a private server. These limitations are a huge gamebreaker! Please rockstar... fix this! You have a loyal fan base that is stating to grow tired of seeing your energies only in getting more money through micro transactions... free the game so players can experience it how they want to. .. please
