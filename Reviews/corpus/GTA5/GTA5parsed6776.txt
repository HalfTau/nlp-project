Didnt enjoy playing it for a while and stopped for about 1 year on pc, played it first and thought it was t on ps32013 since online had to grind a LOT, on pc2015 is the same, tho with better graphics and a firstperson view.Currently i dont enjoy playing it for the most part on public servers since i usually get nuked by someone with a hydra.Playing with friends is great as long one of them has the money to buy new content otherwise is just a waste of time.Right now with doomsday id say the heists are great, but as i said, only if you can buy new content.I cant recommend it for someone who wants to have fun, since you will not get it on online, but if you just wanna drive a car and listen to self radio, then maybe this game is KINDA good.Single Player is great btw
