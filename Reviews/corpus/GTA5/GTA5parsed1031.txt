I would recomend it because the single player is awesome and the story is also great.some people might say that GTA online is bad caue of the grind but its not true online is also so fun.and if u think about the moders then all of them are not so bad.let me tell me a little storywhen i was new on the game i saw a guy who was moding.i said,r u a hacker he said yes ,he is a moder.he was soo nice and friendly.he said, lets play together. i said ok.then we played for almost 2 hours.together we ware killing all the other players.it was soo fun he was teleporting and i was shooting.we became friends.then a nother player wanted to join us so we let him and 3 of us ware destroying other players.other players ware soo mad that all of them left the lobby.we had so much fun. he also gave us a lot money in the game.i bought an awesome car with that.  soo yea.if u dont want to spend 50 then wait for the steam sale it gets down to like 20.
