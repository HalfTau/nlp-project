Online takes 5 minutes to get into after the game has loaded.The new update has broken online play. You have either the hackers or the people who buy the rip off shark cards that have all the upgrades for the new gear. They are extremely overpowered compared to what was in the game before and it makes trying to do anything agaisnt them impossible.Also, even though Rockstar and Take Two have allowed mods again. Take Two is still a money hungry company that doesnt care about anything else. And despite appearences Rockstar is this way too.
