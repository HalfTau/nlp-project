Singleplayer was fantastic, Multiplayer is absolute garbage. There is nothing to do online other than grind for money and RP. Every single purchasable item in online is ridiculously inflated in price compared to singleplayer and money is slow to earn. With literally nothing to do in the online side of GTA, many of us turned to modding singleplayer. Rockstar seems to think singleplayer mods are eating into their microtransaction profits 500 Million  and decided to put a stop to them altogether. Simultaneously removing the last reason I still play this game. Seriously Rockstar, go  yourselves.
