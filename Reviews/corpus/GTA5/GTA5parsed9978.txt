This game succeeds at what it strives to accomplish, it has a strong story that most would call the best in the series which is then complemented by solid gunplay and driving. The story was strong enough the catch my interest and keep me going even through tedious and formulaic missions.Aside from main missions it has competent side stories that mostly follow the same formula that the main missions would have, this being to kill, follow or chase a person through Los Santos, it does throw in a few collectibles that directly tie into missions, one being where you have to collect several spaceship parts for some guy that lives in the middle of nowhere.This game isnt only a single player experience though, most of its players lurk within the online where the developers constantly add content to their almost 5yearold game. Most servers are almost full at least at the time of writing this and the community is active.This game is packed full of content, both offline and online. Its a decent story and expansive open world complemented by its everexpanding online scene has made it well worth the price of admission.
