I can say that Grand Theft Auto V is the best and finest work of Rockstar! I have been playing this game for 4.5 years since its release on PS3. Its not just about killing people. Its a life simulator. But it became worse since the release... GTA Online became a mess after the recent patches. If you want to have full experience of Online you either need to buy Shark Cards or use Exploits to gain money. This doesnt make sense. Simply... SingleplayerAWESOME... MultiplayerDepends on how you play...
