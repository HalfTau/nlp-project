This is going to be my very extensive review on this game. Lets get startedSingle PlayerThe story is fantastic, and it really connects you with the characters NOT GOING TO SPOIL THE STORY PA lot of missions too, and they are really fun and some of them are really intenseWhen youre bored, buy a tank and go on a murderous rampage, or go into the military base and steal a jet.MultiplayerNow multiplayer is a different story where its like a love/hate relationship, and you will see whyIn my opinion, GTA Online is fun, but like everyone says, there is modders, but if you avoid them, and find a new session, its a lot of fun.
