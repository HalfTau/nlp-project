In case any of you are wondering yes, you can mod GTA V with Open IV. If I was to rate this game on its story then Id give it a 8/10. If I was to rate this game on its multiplayer 2/10. The microtransactions are awful. Every DLC item that looks cool costs like 1,000,000,000. Get this game for the singleplayer not for the online.
