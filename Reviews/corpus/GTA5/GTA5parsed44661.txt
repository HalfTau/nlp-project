First of all, this is a great game. The online is a horrible pos that you can never afford anything in so personally the single player is all I ever play now. This game for me is only relevant with mods it has helped extend the playtime for me. This game could quite possibly be the greatest play area for mods just because of how the world is set up but now take two games the parent company of rockstar has issued a cease and desist order on a key component of most mods for this game making this game now just anothergame I will never open again. I will change my negative review if they allow the nodding community to actually keep on making mods. As of today I will have a hard time buying any rockstar game in the future because of this.
