A week or so after I purchased this game for PC, after waiting what, 2 years for the PC port, then another few months for my birthday  Rockstar dropped a patch that made the game unplayable for more than 510 minutes at a time.A month later, they released a patch claiming to fix this problem, to no effect. I reinstalled the game, steam, and even Windows with no luck, so I uninstalled and tried to forget about the 60 lemon in my library. A year later, some unrelated patch caught the problem, and I was finally able to play through the game, three years after it was first released and a year after I bought it.A few days ago, Rockstar began removing mods from the game, and Ive uninstalled it for what I figure to be the last time. The game is still 60 dollars on Steam, somehow, but Im not sure I would recommend this game for 10. I will likely never purchase another GTA game after this protracted negative experience.
