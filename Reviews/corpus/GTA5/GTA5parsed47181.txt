Before the first week of June 2017 I would highly reccommend GTAV due to its good story, okay online scene and fantastic modding. Now I highly reccommend that you stay away from GTA V PC and Take twos games as a whole. They have ruined modding for us and as they recently got the rights to KSP they are going to shut down those soon as well. Until they have rethought about modding, refrain yourself from buying until further notice.
