So for a long time I use to play this game both online and single player I would have recommended it if not for recent actions taken by the Take Two CEO. Awhile back this CEO has stated basically that people are not buying enough microtransactions on the online portion of this game, to counteract this for awhile they would release content that you could only play on multiplayer, however you can get around this with modding and this is were Take Two goes to far and crosses the line for being greedy scumbags. recentely a cease and desist order to OpenIV. If you dont know what OpenIV is, it is the back bone to modding in this game, if you have seen any  video of someone jumping around as hulk or playing as iron man or flying something that isnt in the game its because of OpenIV, essentially they want to get rid of it so that more people will fork over money for shark cards. If you want a more indepth look at what the CEO said about microtransactions jim sterling has a great video on it I reccomend you watch itEDIT So Take Two released a statement saying that OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA online experience, a small quote from the statement released. This is false however since OpenIV doesnt interefere with online play at all in fact its pretty much impossible to play online with mods and in no way does OpenIV effect online as its strictly single player.
