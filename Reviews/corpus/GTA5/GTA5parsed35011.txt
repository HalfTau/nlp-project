What started out as a quality game, has rapidly degraded into a cash grab on the part of Rockstar. The single player was excellent, and I was looking forward to the announced DLC. Online, microtransactions were unobtrusive, and content was accessable with reasonable effort.However, the game has gone downhill from there. No singleplayer DLC was released, and content released online began to be restricted from singleplayer. Prices rised on items online to the point you would assume the game was free to play, as the focus clearly shifted to selling ingame currency.This was frustrating, but not a dealbreaker. However, the final straw was rockstar killing the single player modding community, clearly in an effort to drive more players online, and to buy ingame currency. The modding community was what made GTA V such a fun game, worth sinking hundreds of hours into. I bought several shark cards, the ingame currency to support the developers who at the time were creating more content, in addition to creating a sandbox for modding.Unless somthing changes, I will never buy a Rockstar or Take Two product ever again.
