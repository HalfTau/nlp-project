They robbed me of one million dollars earned from selling one of my own vehicles and when I opened a support ticket, they said that the money was illegtimate and closed the ticket so I couldnt respond.To become involved in any of the features added in the last 4 or so updates, you must be a CEO, which means you must own an office building, which costs up to about 6 million ingame dollars. Want to traffic cargo? Buy a warehouse. 35 million more. Want to traffic cars? Buy a vehicle warehouse. 46 million dollars. Gunrunning? Underground bunker, 6 million dollars. Air smuggling? Buy a hanger. Another 36 million dollars. All the vehicles added in these updates range from 500,000 to several million, and any planes you store in your hanger now cost 1000 to replace every time you destroy them, which is pretty much every time you fly something in this game. Oh, and you have to pay a daily salary for your mechanic, your CEO Office assistant, your power and water bills for your properties, and your gunrunning employees. This adds up to around 11,000 a day if youre part of everything. Meanwhile, a 20 shark card microtransaction only gives you 1,250,000. Let that sink in.GTA is an extremely fun game, but its also the only game I know of where hackers are praised to the level they are, because they give people the cash required to even enjoy the content.
