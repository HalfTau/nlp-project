Great game when you can play, Between having to jump sessions cause hackers pull u to them drop cash then blow u up. Meanwhile tossing de sync messages up so you cannot quit the game. I litterally had to hit the reset button on my girlfriends PC to get it to stop her client was so messed up. Hackers are ruining this game for the people who actually want to play it properly.. One of the best games i have ever played online but i cannot give it full recommendation until the hacking problems are gone..
