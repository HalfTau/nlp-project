The game as a whole is amazing experience. Single player is a lot of hours of great fun. Multi player is also fun, however its filled with grind as TakeTwo Interactive has told Rockstar Games to kindly put as much grind as possible so people have to buy Shark Cards in order to progress quicker. In its current state, progression in this game feels like a FreetoPlay game because of absurd amount of cash and time required to get access to anything good. And you probably already heard that recently TakeTwo have decided to completely ban all modding for GTAV clamining that mods influence GTAO and it ruines experince, when this is not the case. Mods dont to anything to GTAO simply because they have a saveguard that doesnt allow you to go into GTAO with mods installed. Trainers however, do. Because of TakeTwos inability to understand the difference and how not to transform a Guinessrecordholding game into a paytoskip experience like its a freetoplay game, I strongly recommend not to buy this game. Not because of the quality, but because of the shady business practice of owners of Rockstar Games. Avoid spending any money on this game, dont fuel their business practice. When, and if, this is over  its a great game to enjoy for many many hours, but as of right now, dont. Spend your money on something more valuable, like food, drinks, or maybe some other game that doesnt have worsethanEA business practice.
