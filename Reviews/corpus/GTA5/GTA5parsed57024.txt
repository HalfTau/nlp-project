This game was great ... once.Take Two have outdone themselves in their neverending quest to antagonize their PC playerbase by sicking their lawyers on the one piece of modding software which had absolutely no effect on their microtransaction revenue. Rather than shut down those chancers charging money for online cheating scripts such as Menyoo and Force Menu, they instead go after the single player fans by shuttering OpenIV. The very cornerstone of SP modding, a toolset which has extended the life of both GTA IV and GTAV and brought joy to many fans for almost a decade and not without the blessing from Rockstar, now lies in ruins.Take Two Interactive, I sincerely and truly hope you all die.
