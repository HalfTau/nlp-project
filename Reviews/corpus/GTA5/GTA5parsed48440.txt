Rockstar, Take2, you guys are fantastic at making games. But the games become terrible once you bully the loyal customers that you make billions of dollars off of. Why did you ruin the modding community and why did you take away the freedom to do what we want as long as it doesnt affect others? I thought you guys loved making games because you loved games. As it turns out, you only love money. Rockstar, Take2, you have killed your best child, that is, GTA V.
