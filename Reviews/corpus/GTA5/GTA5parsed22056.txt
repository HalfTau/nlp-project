People are downvoting this game because of some decisions made by the developers, which they do not agree with. I think that is a very lame thing to do, especially since this game is so well made and even those people downvoting it invested very many hours into it so you can argue all you want, but I am sure you had fun.With reasonable computer specs this game looks beautiful, I have yet to find another game that looks this beautiful. Even in 2017. If the GTA genre is your thing, you will definately love this game. The single player is great and can have you hooked for over 30 hours, which by itself is already worth the 29 bucks. The online aspect of the game is even bigger. You will start off with no money and it will take some time to get higher up, but once you get there, you can earn money a lot easier.New content is added all the time. I love Heists in particular these are coop missions you do in a group of 4, like robbing a bank, or breaking someone out of prison. Other features include starting your own motor club, becoming a CEO of your own company, setting up an arms bunker, or if you like stealing cars and selling them that is possible too Be honest guys, this is one of the greatest games of all times and you are not downvoting the game, you guys are angry at the developpers. Maybe contact them instead or go to their forum but do not come here downvoting a game that is great.
