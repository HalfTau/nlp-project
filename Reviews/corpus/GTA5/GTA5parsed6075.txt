Amazing and Visually Stunning!There is so mcuh content to this game that it deservers the 96 on metacritic,However, there are some flaws to this otherwise perfect game Some of the driving scenes take way to long and just get boring after 50 hours of playing it The flying in this game is really hard especally on a keyboard it tookme 5 minutes to get used to the controls The cop ai is absoluteI can kill someone right behind the and they dont even notic, but this is a good thing There are not enough cheet codes The ambulance ran over me to go save someone I killed lol The drinking and roller coasters are soooo boring  The ifruit app just feels forced and uneccesary did not stop me There is a lot of dark humor The movies that you can watch are so unepreciated they are beter than what we got in real life The credits are way too long The Online has sooo many moddders that it almost makes it imposible to play in online The Yoga is sooo anoying Tennis could be better There should be body building minigame The s and strip clubs are unnecesary in this game which a 10 year get their sticky little hands on and get confused on how real life works There shoulld be more attachments to the guns There should be a make your movie minigame where you can make a movie chose topics and genres, get to cast and do auditions The parashuting feels fake Often people do the mistake of thinking that San Andreas was better than this even though it is not and does not even come close to what this game has to offer...
