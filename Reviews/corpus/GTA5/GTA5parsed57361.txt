Really sketchy company behind this game.  Sending cease  desist letters to a 10 year old modding developer? Weak and cowardly.  Do not buy if you expect to do anything outside of just playing the vanilla game, which is mediocre at best.  Mods are what made this game great, and Take Two fails to realize this, thus they are going to cut their nose to spite their face.  Screw Take Two.
