It started with having to sign up to a service outside of the game and Steam, then froze my PC once the loading for the storymode finished for the first time. restarting fixed this.Movement is generally quite sluggish and the tutorial doesnt explain a lot of mechanics such as snow slowing you if you walk in it, the proper controls for avoiding car turns becoming donuts, and the tutorial was vague at best when it comes to clarity of controls. For a console port, it runs fairly well, but I still cant recommend the game at anything above 50 of the price it is at the time of this review.I got enticed by the nostalgia of the old games, but this one is nothing like the classics such as Vice City or San Andreas.
