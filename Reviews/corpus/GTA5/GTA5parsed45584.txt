This game was pretty sweet until they too the ability to mod it away... why on earth would someone want to buy a game with less functionality than it initially had? More importantly to me why would anyone want to play a game that has less functionality then when you initially purchased it? If I could get a refund for the game now that they have decreased its playability, I would. Its like bricking a phone for no good reason, just leaves the consumer with a useless item....Needless to say, I am not pleased with this game
