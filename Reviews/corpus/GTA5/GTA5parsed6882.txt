Okay, this game is super great and is awesome to play, but the only problem I have is the mods and addons. I always have to add and remove the addons I only play in single player and its super annoying, for example the flash mod you have to download script hook, etc... and I just wish there was a workshop since like gmod you can turn on and off the addons. But for GTA I cant do that I have to directly go into the files just to play with a player model in story mode. Overall the game is really good and I do recommend it.
