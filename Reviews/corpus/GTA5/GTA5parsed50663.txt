Take two attacked the modding comunity for this game on either an incorrect assumption on how the main modding tool actually worked or to try to help boost their lousy, microtransaction laden multiplayer. either way until the stop I cannot recomend this game, as i only bought the pc version for the mods, no mods... no reason to play.
