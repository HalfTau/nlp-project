Its just about the microtransactions at this point. No mods, ever skyrocketing prices for everything. Its just not GTA anymore. I dont feel like Im a criminal anymore. I feel like Im grinding to pay rent. Would have recomended this game a year ago, but with its change in focus over the past year I just cant anymore which breaks my heart as a long time fan from the begining. I really hope Take2 is paying attention. I may not buy future games if theyre all going to be like this.
