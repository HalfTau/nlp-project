Take Two Interactive basically KILLING the modding community under the guise of stopping cheaters is unacceptable. If OpenIV is the utility used so that cheaters can use their cheats as they claim, they can at the very least patch the part that allows cheaters to use cheats so that they no longer work, all the while leaving the good things OpenIV does alone. Until OpenIV is allowed to continue development and be released to the public again, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game anymore. They need to understand that they have profitted off of modders UNPAID hard work which has created a longevity for their game ala Skyrim. They need to feel how much the modding community means to their userbase.
