It is a fun game in many ways, both single and multiplayer. If you got friends to mess around, you probably wont never run out of something to do. You can achieve almost anything by working youoff but it requires many hours of grinding which isnt fun in the long run. Community is alive and its not too toxic. You can find hackers from almost any session. Sometimes they are hella annoying but usually they just mind their own business. So hackers, grinding and the lack of mods are my only problem with the game. Everything else is very well made!
