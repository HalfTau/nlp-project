I will still love Grand Theft Auto V for its superb single player, and its alrightbutdying online mode.But, with TakeTwos current attitude towards the modding community, something needs to be done. The killing of OpenIV, a 9 year old modding tool, is unacceptable and unwarranted. The reasons given for this action make no sense!So, I shall join the negative bandwagon and leave this review for others to see.there are probably a lot of other reviews better describing the situation than mineI just needed to do this though, okay?
