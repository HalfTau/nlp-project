Just read about what Take Two has done as a result of issues surround modders within multiplayer. The destruction of the main community and individuals that will essentially keep your game alive for years to come is not a good way to solve a problem that causes your multi billion dollar company to loose a bit on a 4 year old game. Very dissapointed that Rockstar could allow this to happen.
