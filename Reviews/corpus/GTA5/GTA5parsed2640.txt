The game is definetly overestimated. The Station setup in Prison break heist doesnt run, cuz no one can connect. A friend of mine cannot even create a setup. Really hard to find any technical support btw. Plenties of cool games, but you wont find players to play with. I would still recommend this game, but there are some things to fix, but... 4 years passed after game released, shouldnt it be fixed yet?P.S. plenties of cheaters in freemod sessions.
