Dont get me wrong, I love this game and almost everything about it. But until Take Two Interactive and Rockstar Games reverses the torm they are creating with OpenIV I will not support them in any way, shape, or form.Sign this PetitionEdit TakeTwo Interactive has reversed their decision to order OpenIV to cease and desist. My review is now recommended, great game.
