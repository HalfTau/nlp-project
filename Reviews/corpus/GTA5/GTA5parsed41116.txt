Rockstar and Take Twos stance on the modding community for GTA has sunk to such great depths, I refuse to support any forthcoming properties from either company in future. I have purchased GTA V on every available platform bar the xbox one and spent about 100 in shark cards, I have every GTA game  and have adored the mods throught the years which only extends the longevity of the games... What happened to singleplayer DLC? ... What happened to Rockstar? Greed.
