ive played this game, ive enjoyed playing this game, but i cannot abide by what rockstar and taketwo are doing to mod creators. the openiv shutdown has left many in the dark and it is becoming clear that the reason is most likely paid mods in the future. please do not buy this game or consider holding off of your game /ingame currency/dlc purchase until these companies get theirtogether and do something right for the gamers.
