i love gta 5 because the story mode. its amazing and fun it has a decent story, though i the first time i played i didnt play for the story mode i came for the online.Unfortunately the online is not what i expected. i used to play gta online on the last gen console, i had ton of fun. But now its just all microtransactions, vehicle is expensive even if you buy the Gunrunning, Doomsday, Etc. vehicle you still have to pay for the bunker,facility,Etc. and the extra money for the MOC,Avenger, its a waste of money.Additionally hackers is almost everywhere. I got banned once because of a hacker, but when my account is back it just reset all of my character and its stats, plus i have to grind everything from the beggining again. The good part is they refunded every money that i have D.I give a 8/10 for story modeand 7/10 for gta online
