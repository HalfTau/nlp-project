This is my 500 hours review.Single Player Huge stunning map with the best details you will find in a video game Interesting characters AMAZING gameplay Lots of customizations Beautiful graphics Confusing story yes, I found it confusing... May get boring after a while Lack of clothing yes, I am VERY serious No Single Player DLCOverall, the Single Player is really fun to play. You will get to play as three amazing characters with each having a different personality. Itll take you about 40 hours to complete the main mission which is around 60 of the game. I personaly found the side missions a little boring so I didnt complete them all yet.GTA Online The same map you get with SP Even more customizations SO MUCH CLOTHING! Really fun missions Free DLCs HACKERS although they do get banned right after reporting them The map isnt as alive as it is in SP Microtransactions EVERYTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE! Asshlole players Loading screens that take foreverGTA Online is the main reason I bought this game and it definitely met my expectations. Its a really fun game to play with a varitey of content. I really recomend this game to anyone who is looking for a game to invest many hours into.
