This is by far the worst Grand Theft Auto I have ever played. I had been a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series since I was introduced to it back when the second in the series was still popular. Although in the days of San Andreas, Rockstars decision to try and block some controversial mods were understandable, they are now threatening developers with potential lawsuits over small and innocent modifications. The introduction of shark cards was the beginning of the end for the Grand Theft Auto series because the moment I saw Rockstar take their initial steps toward becoming a pay to play game  I left  and so did many others. Since the beginning of these negative changes, I have begun to look elsewhere for openworld games. Good job on losing your once loyal fanbase.
