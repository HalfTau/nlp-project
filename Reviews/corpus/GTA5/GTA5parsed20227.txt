Game can be fun at times but when you spend 80 of your time in loading screens or in lobbies waiting for missions to start, just to have the mission end 5 minutes in because the piece ofservers took a dump and one of the players got disconnected, its hard to justify wasting any of my time on this game any more.Having my character wiped for money dropped on me by a modder while a friend who modded his own characters to lvl 4000 and has hundreds of millions of  still has all of his characters....I bought the PS3 version launch day, played GTA online as soon as the servers would let me, built a PC with the specific intention to play GTA5 just to be told my character cant be transferred over because I missed some arbitrary cutoff date from rockstar and this is how Im thanked.Dont adress the rediculous economy in game, just squeeze for shark cards and ban anyone who gets a drop of fun out of the game without paying the R tax...Any money you do manage to somehow get is then ripped from your hands with multi million dollar vehicles and daily fees from every side for every property so even after they have your money they keep taking more.The launcher doesnt even work, its faster to start up story mode and launch GTA online from there.The find a session with friends does not work, have to go to friends list and specifically hit join friendThe options change themselves have to set game back to full screen about once a weekThe matchmaking is useless, basically play with a set group or have fun failing every mission because the drooling mongoloids youre matched with play in traffic or just spam random garbage in chat... and thats IF youre lucky enough to get into a mission period.Hosting is worse, start mission, hit autoinvite, leave pc for soulsearching journey backpacking across Europe, come back, still havent got a full lobby together.And even now, years after lauch and the game still doesnt actually work caught in the infinite limbo of starting missions/heists/sessions just to be disconnected and thrown back to story mode.... getting fun out of this game is a chore and Rockstar needs to start trying to fix the PLAYABILITY OF THEIR GAME  INSTEAD OF PROFITABILITYThe true shame in all of it is how easy they could fix it1 Stop being greedy and bring down the in game costs, the costs of everything have inflated so much the only way to physically play half the content is to mod, or grind for hours a day to be allowed to play the game content they paid for.2 Stop banning people for /RP amounts, be it increases or totals. The fact of the matter is they are punishing 100s of innocent bystanders for every legit modder they catch and at this point I prefer modders over the unjust overreach of rockstars policies. A modder did not flush both my characters which I put dozens of hours into, Rockstar did.3 Stop acting like GTAO was the sequel to GTAV and actually do something with those billions of dollars of revenue and make some single player DLC, its only been multiple years since release and im kinda sick of monthly hot wheels packs with 0 actual content.4 Stop reusing your ideas over and over again, making the players pay each time for your unpolished,soon to be abandoned ideas. First the CEO crap, then the bike clubs and now the gunrunning. Same different sparkle and guess what   staggered release so you buy the first one like oh wow, cool, finally some actual CONTENT so you spend millions on property and vehicles and you do missions that suck to unlock the missions that dont suck and then the bike clubs come out which do the exact same thing but with differnt names on the objectives and you got some stupid biker roleplaying fluff that does jack, but make sure you spend millions of dollars on this too cuz gotta buy it before you can see just how crap it is. And now we got the gunrunning which is the final dear god I hope, not as fleshed out, run your own business sim which is actually just another pain in the drive all over for little to no actual ing mission content time waster. LIKE SERIOUSLY, CAN YOU GUYS JUST SIT ON AN IDEA FOR ONCE AND NOTSHIT IT OUT ONTO YOUR CUSTOMERS HALF BAKED AND FULLY PRICED.I tried to like this game, I really did but it just feels like the most expensive freemium game Ive ever played and every time I start the game its some new t getting in the way of actually having fun with it.
