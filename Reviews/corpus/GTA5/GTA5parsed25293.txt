I used to quit playing GTAV for a year now, I dont use mods, to be honest I dont really like this modding things that much but it seems that a lot of player loves it, Modding is what brings GTA a life and the other thing is its not that everyone will feel the same to me and goddamn this is not what you shouldve done, You are slowly killing everything.I know that bringing down the rating wont help bring anything back, The big company wouldnt waste their time giving a singleof one group of person quitting their stuff. Therell be a lot of players that doesnt care about the world will keep on playing the game and theyll keep going foward, I know this is just a some sort of a  logic but seriously, Giving norecomment review and insulting them is all you can do, Nothings gonna change, Theyll do whatever they want and you cant just point a finger telling them what to do, Youre just a customer and customer used to bring in the income but its just not that a hundred, thousand or any other countable amount so they would care about you so your job here is to take what they gave or  off, Im not in the any side by the way dont get me wrong but this is the truth, Feel free to hate me, my ego is big enough not to give a  about it.
