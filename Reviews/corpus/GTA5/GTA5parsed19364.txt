I love this addicting game! But, be like me dont Create a gta online account until the hacker problem is dealt with so you dont get banned and money spent to buy this game is not wasted. I currently play singleplayer and use FiveM to play multiplayer. Atleast FiveM has its own lobbies and has modded servers and you get to have more fun. FiveM doesnt ban you for no reason unlike poopstar.
