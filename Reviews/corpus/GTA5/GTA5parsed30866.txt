Honestly  TakeTwo, they dont deserve a company as talented as Rockstar working under them. First their skinflint, money grubbing reptile of a CEO gives a speech about how they dont monitise their customers in GTA online, a game where doing anything for a new update means grinding for hours on end to be able to afford the new content, or waiting for a kind hacker to drop you money. Or just shell out some  for a shark card which also happen to be overpriced Then, take2 goes and decides to drop down a CD on the mod OpenIV for abetting cheaters which is bs because OpenIV doesnt work online. Basically, screw Taketwo and their anticonsumer bs.
