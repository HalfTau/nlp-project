Its Completley ing Its so t, you can literally sit in your house and blow people up!.If you have money, you can buy a flying ing car and put rockets, miniguns, probably a ing nuke on it.If you dont have that much money and dont want to hack/buy the money, 75 for 8Million in game cash, you can just waste some of your life grinding missions and get like 10K per mission/race, depending on how much lifetime you are willing to waste on thisWould I recommend it to people that are willing to spend a half fortune on this game just to be able to ruin the game for other people? Yes, lets put a check on that. Would I recommend it to people that saw the trailer and was like, Wow! That sure looks fun! And It has online too! It must be so cool to play Gta with your friends!? Well, No, since you will get blown up by a 11 year old kid sitting in his bunker and eating candy, but unless you want to get blown up and shot to death by a explosive sniper with thermal sights, probably heat seeking bullets too, then its like this game was made just for you!
