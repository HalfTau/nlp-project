Grand Theft Auto 5 is GodTier, GTA online is garbage.Every new Free Update That comes out reqiures millions of dollars just in buying the facilities and for the new feature/way to grind to make money of spending before you can even hope to start profiting after grinding the hours away. Not to mention you need a high rank as well to get all the cool stuff, no thank you, i dont want to get a second job playing gta 5 just to afford flying bikes with rockets just toon someone elses day doin their mission grind to get millions to buy the cool things.To actually make a good amount of money off of heists, you need a very good team that already has all the best things in the game, best armor, best weapons, most hp, really high ranks to get all that stuff... than after a solid day worth of grinding with your buds will you have money to spend on the wacky overprices things.
