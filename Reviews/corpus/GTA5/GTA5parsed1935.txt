Well.. what happened rockstar?The single player campaing? Simply amazing, GTA online? garbage, dont get me wrong, i love gta games, but greed has taken over, it costs milions for useless crap in game, sharkcards are a scam, really? 100 dollars for 8 million in game? you can like.. buy 2 planes, maybe, it has bacome a massive grind, which is just boring, theres no sense of progression anymore, uselessyou need to buy to enjoy the free dlc, its not free, its wrapped around a bunch of paywalls, rockstar, you dont want happening to you what is going on with ea, do you?for the players, id say, get modmenu and play on singleplayer, very displased
