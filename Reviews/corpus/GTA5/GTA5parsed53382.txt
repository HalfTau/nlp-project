Rockstar sent a cease and desist to OpenIV, making GTA modding effectively ILLEGAL. you rockstar.this game is e, good single player, but the company wants to squeze you for micro transactions. they outlawed mods, to try and direct players to the online micro transactions. why play as you want to, when you can play as you want to after paying the company for that privelege ? take two !Take two Interactive can go to hell Take Two can sell all the DLC and cards they want for GTA Online, but why mess with SP and modding?Good game but not recommended to give them your money.This game is great and i love every hour ive played. i never needed modding and i think the bashing of the game recently is petty and stupid. its a great game with friends 3Take Two can shove it. I had already decided to never buy one of their games again over a year ago when they actively sought out and banned moderators on modding forums from GTA Online...moderators who had not even developed mods nor used mods in multiplayer. This most recent transgression just further highlights T2s despicable corporate culture. Lads, take a note or two from Valves playbook.Never  with our mods again.An amazing game that deteriorated due to hacking/cheating and greedy developer decisions.Wuvit was hacking and didnt get banned...and then tIMSY tries a singleplayer mod and gets a perma...
