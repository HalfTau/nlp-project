Murder the most wellknown franchises in the world, the most sold game, the biggest SP modding community just because of your own greed. Great job, T2. Gunrunning update was the biggest cashheavy update, every single ingame day you pay 1020k  just on maintanace. Research  pay to win. Im one of the biggest GTA series fans, grew up with it. Good luck with losing 80 of your playerbase on this dumb move.
