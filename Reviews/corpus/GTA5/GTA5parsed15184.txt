GTA Online Review GTA Online is a game about slow progress, you want a nice car, you have to play a bunch of heists, adversary modes, races and more. If you like everything instantly available to you, you may want to spend money on shark cards which are overpriced to get the money you need in game. I personally like going over missions, heists and the occasional double money adversary mode to earn my money however I recently purchased a Great White Shark Card 11.99 for  1,250,000 ingame dollars and this is the only shark card I recommend you buying. If you love this game and are willing to spend the extra money, I wont stop you. I dont recommend this game for people with bad computers or poor internet connection.
