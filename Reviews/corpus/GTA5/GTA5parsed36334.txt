Modifying games for me are about personalizing an experience. Think about all the things we modify in life. Our cars, houses, clothes and yes even games. While the vanilla game is tons of fun, having the ability to tweak a games system tailored towards my desired experience makes it even better. Anyone to say modding is stupid should live in Russia where everyone pretty much lives the same. While I abstain from modifying anything that will effect online play, it is unfortunate others couldnt do the same so i understand why they took this route. Hopefully they come up with a better solution that helps everyone.Update they have since allowed OpenIV and the modding community do what they do best and that is to make a great game even better! Thank you Rockstar for listening to your players. You have my support.
