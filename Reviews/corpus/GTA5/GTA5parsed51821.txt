Wooooow! Really? Weve been allowed to mod this game in single player since release, Rockstar enjoys the modding community greatly and encourage them for years. But now Take Two has decided were no longer allowed to use mods on this game. Very sad and downright enraging. Truly disgusting behaviour. I dread to think how much time and effort youve taken down Take Two. Suck it Take Two.
