Bought this game after a long time. Last version I played was GTA3.Overall it is still exciting and interesting. Only played the single player mode. Dont have time for online, but will give it a try some time.The story line felt a bit short, and ended too quickly. Other hobbies and features keep it interesting for while longer. I did not feel the urge to play all over again.One short coming that I did find was that the random events of hitch hikers should not stop. I did not knew that they could be fed to cannibals, so I have no way to experience that part of game, unless I start over.Making money on stocks is only useful at the very end. Would have been ore interesting if players had to purchase properties during the story line, rather than at the end.Overall I would give it a 7.5/10.With moderate settings, I was able to play it on a Dell laptop with i5 7th Gen and Intel HD card, and 8 GB RAM. Some graphics were choppy, but it worked.
