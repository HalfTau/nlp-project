This game is an ok game, i played countless hours on xbox360. i bought the game on pc excited to play my good old character i dumped all my time into. to my shock there was no record of this young Hispanic anywhere, unfortunatly i had learned rockstar took away my ability to play with the character i worked so hard on and use the cars i bought in flashy pc master race glory. I hope rockstar listens to there fanbase and brings back character trancfers soon so my fun may return.
