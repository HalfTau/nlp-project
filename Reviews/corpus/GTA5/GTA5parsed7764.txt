Horrible pc port horrible controls. Not optomized either.Also, my experience with online has been horrible so far. I entered a race, but it was not just a car race but a race with every vehicle. Anyway, it turned out I couldnt finish the race because of this weird Eveel Kenivle part where I have to fly a motorcyle across 50 football fields. Needless to say, I couldnt do it. No problem I said. Er, atleast thats what I thought. I tried to quit the race but I just couldnt figure it out  even when trying to google it. So I summarily rage quit and commenced writing this review.
