This game has been out for over a year now and every update is just to make players buy more sharkcards or to do tons of tons of tons of missions and heists. Especially latest two updates. Also they fix clothing glitches which are harmless on my opinnion. Money and RP hacks and exploits i understand, but why do they take away every single thing that have been for ages. This Take Two thing literally made my blood to boil out of my veins, but there is not much i can do, beneath to sign that petition. I have been enjoying playing this game with my friends and i still will, but that was hard hit to most of the GTA V players...
