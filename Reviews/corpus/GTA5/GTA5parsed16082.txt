Anybody whos had trouble being online has truly been doing stupid stuff that has been clearly outlined in Rockstars Terms of Use agreement. Its an awesome game to just mess around with story mode and online. This is one of the only games I have that I play constantly and dont get bored of after time. Suggested for anybody who doesnt necessarily take games seriously for achievments and stuff like that
