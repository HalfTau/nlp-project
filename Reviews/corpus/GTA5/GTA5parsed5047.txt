This could have been a GTA 4 with just better graphics and more detailed world, but as it turned it only has the better graphics and more detail, but tossing aside systems that worked great in GTA4. One of the most memberably annoying systems in either single player or offline is the Police/Wanted system. Police somehow more retarded then they have been since GTA 3, but the game cheats by spawning new ones 2 inches in front of you. There is no logic or immersion on how the police act in this game despite it being good in 3, SA, and 4. In all the previous games it was actually fun to run away from police. Now it is just an excercise in annoyance and anger management.Online is atrocious. Loading for days and loading screens as often as possible. Which would be nice if you could avoid them by not doing all the story missions, and activities but you are kinda force too since there are no good ways to make money in free roam.Finally, and regardless of how much I continue to play the game in Online mode, the reason this game still deserves a thumbs down is because despite being the best selling game in history and all the microtransaction p2win sht in this game, R still thought it was okay to not have dedicated servers for this game. There is no excuse for this not even in a biz sense, since probably a lot more people would play the game if it had ded servers thus leading to more people using the pay2win options. I dont mind p2win as much as other people but the lack of dedicated servers is totally inexcusable from any prespective. It is also the reason the loading takes so long.Also this game doesnt have good PC control support, for example you cant bind even more than 3 mouse buttons ingame. It also has no support for flight sticks or HOTAS systems despite flying being a major part of the game.
