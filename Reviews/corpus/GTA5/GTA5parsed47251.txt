We buy our games to have fun and support the Devs ... but if the devs think they are anything .. It is because we gave them our hard earned money , so if they are willing to go to war with the community that made who they are now , the same community cant take them down ,GTA is what it is because of the modders out there creating stuff for themselves and otherstake that power of creativity and the Fun factor from the game and you will end with an empty shell that holds no meaning and replayable value.and I think the community will make sure you think before you act  later on.you have earned my negative reviewwhen you think there are some great studios out there, and you find out its about control , arogance and of course Money
