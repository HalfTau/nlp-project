GTA 5 is one of the best games available. Deep story, great length of the campaign and a huge amount of topics and items to see, tackle and do.But Take 2 has now decided to screw over the complete modder community to monetize their product even more by closing down OpenIV.They should fix their Multiplayer and not harrass a community, which is strongly supporting their game and creating hours and hours of more gameplay, for which people bought GTA 5 overall.If you dont know what I am adressing, Google is your friend.
