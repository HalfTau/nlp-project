Ive owned this game since its release on the PlayStation 3 and Ive loved it all the way through the PlayStation 4 and the PC. Rockstar outdid themselves with the development of this game and the story was decent enough for me to complete on both consoles but became super predictable once I came around to playing it on PC. GTA Online has always been a major point in this game and it shows with all the content added through updates thank god its not DLC you gotta purchase.The multiplayer was pretty fun even before any big updates were released for it, but as time passes, people have been reporting of hackers/modders that spawn and give money to other players just to ban them and it gets even worse when it comes down to people needing to spend cash to recieve tons of ingame money. Players have complained that earning money through missions, heists, and even the CEO missions is a very slow process. There have even been some cases where people take weeks and even months out of their time to earn enough ingame cash to purchase a yacht which falls around 8 million just to get banned after they start up the game again.TLDR The story is good enough to try but there are a lot of problems with GTA Online and Rockstar stealing peoples money with shark cards. Maybe theyll come up with something to fix it in a later update?
