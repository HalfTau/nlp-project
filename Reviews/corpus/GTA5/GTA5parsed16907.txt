DISCLAIMER From all of the friends I know who play this game, it seems that only a few are getting crashes and similar but not as frequently. you might not experience problems, and if you can avoid them, the game is AMAZING, you will undoubtadly if that is how you spell it get an endless amount of hours in this game.At first i thought that Rockstar Games was one of the best companies and I still in a way think that because of my lack of experience so take this review with a grain of salt. I always thought that 60 dollar games arent worth it, however i made an exception with this game. When i heard of the amazing reviews this game had i thought why not give it a go? In the begginning I hade amazing thoughts about the game even though the tutorial for online alone is longer than 2 hours so once you do that, you wont get a refund. I was addicted to this game even though the amount of bugs i have experienced. I have been finding the usual bug here or there and that was ok, but getting TEXTURE GLITCHES AND GAME CRASHES so frequently. I have done everything to fix this, I have searched through forums and forums and still no fix. The cherry ontop of the cake is that after 80 hours in the game, GTA Online is glitched and cant seem to fix it either, and everytime i start up the game its like starting it up from scratch. Thankfully I didnt lose the game files as other people have. I have read about that and the answer that everyone got is to save their game files on their pc EVEN THOUGH there is an option to save your game files to the cloud. Theese arent all of the problems i have experienced but just a few and for a 60 dollar game, it is disgraceful. However if you can avoid the problems somehow this game is a steal.
