Online is a grindfest. Forcing you to buy currency. The only good thing about this was Singleplayer and moding it to oblivion. Well they made modding illegal so the only thing that gave replayability to this 3 year old game for still 60 was taken away. GTA V has shown a lot of anticonsumer practices buit this was over the line.
