Definitely one of the best open world games, but not as good as I expected. The game handles very similar to GTA SA, however, I still like the GTA IV control better, especially when in a vehecle. The game is worth buying on offers. If you are looking for realistic, then get GTA IV, V is NOT as realistic as IV, its just more exciting to play.
