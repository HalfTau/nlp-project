First I want to say buy this when its on Sale for 30 or less its not worth 60 if you are like me and already own it on a PS3 and PS4, yes the PC port is good but not great. The pause menu has some lag here and there its not a big deal but still noteworthy, also at the moment there is a memory leak in this game meaning its not taking full advantage of the hardware so it doesnt matter if you have a GTX 770 or a GTX 1080 ti this game will punish any card if you crank up the settings and resoultion up its one of those games like Crysis that just is crazy taxing on any system as of Q4 of 2017 maybe one day not so much, The Story is great and has multi endings depending on your choice near the end of the story, driving is very nice also too many games try hard to be this game and most fail compared to this, Watch Dogs 1  2, Mafia 3 and Tom Clancy Ghost Recon Wildlands all have nothing on GTA 5 this game puts all of them to shame hands down, the driving is better in this game than all of those I mentioned also you can mod the hell out of it in single player or in FiveM, I dont like GTA Online that much but Im sure theres people that will love and enjoy the grind or have tons of real money to blow on the Online, The gunplay is good but feels cluncky and akward at times, I would stay in 3rd person most of the time, 1st person is cool but gets old fast so your mileage will very on that end of things, Trevor is by far the best one out of 3 characters you play and is the most fun to run around as, Micheal is a train wreck at the start of the game and he always finds a way to be up to  creek and is very cringey of a person all around, and last also least Franklin is the most Sterotypical lame and boring out of all three of them, Trevor when you switch to him is throwing a bike gang member off a edge of a bringe, Micheal Either Crying inside his car or driving one of his family members around in his ride, Franklin is Ironing his shirt or typing on his Laptop, lame asf they couldve made Franklin way more intresting but played it safe, the Cars go anywhere from a smart car to a Bugatti Veyron but they renamed it Adder prob to save money, also you can Drive Tanks, Fighter Jets, Monster trucks, ATVs, Dirt Bikes, normal bicycles just like in San Andreas, mopeds, To BMW Motorcyles look alikes, Lambos, Ferraris GTR look alikes and Muscles Cars all USA ones, you can pimp your ride at any chop shop, buy guns, go hunting, go swiming or in a submarine, fly a chopper, crop duster, have a yachet, own a garage full of cars own houses, own an airport, steal a commerical plane, have a dune buggie those are fun, have a mad max looking muscle car, change from many outfits and shoes and hats, get tatttos, buy local buisness around the area have make  on the side from that, rob a store or help stop a robbery, course steal cars duh, and shoot a ton of gang members, law enforment and miltary than I can remember and anyone else that stands in your way in this game, its about 4 times bigger than GTA 4 im guessing maybe more or less depending on who you ask, the support characters are very cringey all of them and live up to the streoyptes youd expect and the cutscences are some of the best all around, in short this game had a massive budget and they def messed up here or there but still a solid game overall
