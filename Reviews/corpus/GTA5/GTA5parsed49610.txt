It is absolutley unbeleivable that your are trying to remove mods from Gta V. This is the only reason I bought this ing game, was to mod, and to use this platform as the ultimate virtual crazy playground. Ive been loyal to this franchise since GTA 3. To see Rockstar and their affiliates become so greedy as to remove mods to intise more to play on multiplayer, and eventually spend microtransactions, which your greedy minds have lead your team to believe, is beyond ed up. Dont fall down this road.Truely,All GTA 5 PC users.
