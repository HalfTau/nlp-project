I think that the singleplayer part of this game is very fun to play. Online is ok however all of the new updates are designed for the player to purchase shark cards since everything in the updates are ultra expensive. Not to mention I even once earned 1 million dollars legitimately and rockstar emptied my online bank account. That is why I no longer play this game I would recommend any one who plays this game to procceed with caution.
