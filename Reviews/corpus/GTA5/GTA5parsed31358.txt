 shark cards they havent updated singleplayer so you cant get the new vehicles or any content from multiplayer in singleplayer because sharkcards are more profitable THEY BASICALLY BANNED SINGLEPLAYER MODS no single player dlc like the episodes from liberty city we got with gta 4Honestly I dont know who should catch the majority of the blame for this, rockstar or take two the publisher. Let me know if I have any of this information wrong
