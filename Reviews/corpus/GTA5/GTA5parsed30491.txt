GTA series used to be great, not only the stories and design, especially because of its freedom and openness, which leave players with possibility to extend their gameplay experiences by adding varies types of mods.However, from now on, it may no longer to be able to install mods in the future since Take two has desisted the best mod editing tool OpenIV from any further activities. This is a dumb and irresponsible decision, most of PC players bought PC versions on account of the modding abilities and this action has just deprived half of the joys on PC platform. Besides, it has no help to against the cheaters online, there are still dozens of hackers in public session, seems they are not affected at all in spite of all anticheating methods, yet most of regular mods are based on story mode, its meaningless to ban OpenIV if Rock Star wants to avoid the online modding activities.Anyway, its no longer worthy to buy it, although its bad to say so, go find a pirated version if you want to add some mods to your game.
