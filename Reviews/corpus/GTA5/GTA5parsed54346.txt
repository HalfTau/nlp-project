what a fun game so addicting so many things to do on the game, Missions some with 2x RP 2x money we grind Missions all the time over and over I just got to level 100 a few days ago.I have done a few videos and live streams on this game and always have a great time.this is one I did on the fully upgraded weaponized tampa in 4Kright after getting the Vigilante I figured out we could launch cars into space and made a video about doing this and its so much fun we made a few games to launch a small car into the air from both sides while the people inside the cars are trying to shoot the other one while flying, I dont have a video of this yet but I will show the game pretty soon and where the best place to play this game is.at first when I got this game it seemed really boring especially when hackers take over and ruin your gameplay, they are constantly on the game and its really somewhat annoying when your grinding missions or just trying to have fun on the game with friends, thats one of the biggest problems in this game is a hacker or modder who will ruin your game experience in 2 seconds.leaving a session to escape a hacker  modder waiting for it to load in just to find another hacker in the new session is really annoying thats why I love Just Cause 3 more than this game.
