Great game, for people that say it is P2W I dont think so.With the latest updates where you can steel cars and then sell it you make a lot of money. It was better at the beggining when you could steel and seel all day, now you have to wait for next delivery but still good profit.The only thing that could be improved is the the lobbies where balanced. It is not good to find 1000 lvl players when you are lvl 30.
