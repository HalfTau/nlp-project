okay, its 2017. Alot of things have changed since this first came out.I see alot of complaints about the online mode. YES, there are cheaters and there is not alot Rockstar Games can or just dont want to do about it. But come on... they are coming up with new ways to play the online game almost each month now. And HOLD THE PHONE!!! there is a way to create a private session so you can play with your friends and not randoms.So instead of going in for a potential ragequit. Just create a private session. Explore, and have fun.Dont need to say anything else about the single player experience. Yall know it was good and still is.I give this game a 5/7, perfect score
