I loved this game. How much? I bought it on PS3 at launch, then bought it on PS4 at launch for the higher res textures before finally buying it on PC. That said, I cannot and will not support TakeTwos decision to disable the largest mod of the game. This flies in the face of PC gaming. I will no longer be purchasing any TakeTwo games, which is a shame because my Steam library of full of them.
