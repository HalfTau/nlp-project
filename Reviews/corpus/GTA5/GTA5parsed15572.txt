i wish this was  a better game ,i wish that hacking it was not so easy,  no matter how hard i try to enjoy the offline story of the game i am met with racism , racebating  and cultural appropriation. also the injection of thinly veiled politics is how do you say BS in cyrillic  .  horrid online play , if you are a hacker i assume its fun  however i have to joine  muitiple servers just to find there is someone that just  loves to spawn kill or cheat in a  jall gondola cabin cell for your  new in game home  ... i remember  a good  if not superior  story in previous interations of this series .that being  said there are fun adversary modes  of this game ... but as a whole  it get a failing grade.
