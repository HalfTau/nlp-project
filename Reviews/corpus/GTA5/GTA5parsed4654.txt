Singleplayer campaign is great and has a lot of content. Trevor is the best character ever, he makes the story interesting and unpredictable and he has several comedic moments. I feel like Franklin lacked a bit of personality. He seems too calm and doesnt have that many moments of note spoilersuntil the end of the game/spoilers. Michaels temper drives the story forward, and his relationship with his family is intriguing. The heists are fun, and the game having multiple protagonists makes it feel like as if all of the responsibility isnt being shifted onto one character for heists, setups and other missions.Online is good, however it is a bit of a grind early on. I recommend you do Heists with a group of friends early on as it is very fun and gives you some good money. Once you develop a good way of making money, freemode becomes fun as long as you dont get harassed much. The main problems I have with Online are just related to the grinding early in the game, the hackers that you may encounter every so often if youre in a full game you probably will have at least one, however whether they use their hacks to annoy you or not depends and the amount of trolls who just want to see you suffer, and you need to use exploits to create a solo lobby so that you can enjoy freemode and make your money.Ive noticed that a of of reviews ignore the singleplayer which is like the core of the game, even if it isnt getting major updates anymore. Singleplayer totally makes up for the price if you have a bad Online experience.
