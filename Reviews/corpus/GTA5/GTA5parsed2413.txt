If your looking for a good multiplayer game, this isent the one. You have to grind so hard to earn a little of the cash and dlcs just ruined the game. But as the singeplayer is very good, the story as well is really enjoyable. You can even mod in singleplayer. I dont think this is a good price, try to get this game at a discount. Only worth the price if your looking for to play FiveM wich is multiplayer with mods so theres like drift servers, rp servers and etc. Its also worth for the singleplayer.
