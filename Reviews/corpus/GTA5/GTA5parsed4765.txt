Grand Theft Auto 5 WAS a good game yes WAS let me explain why.I Love GTA V Single Player and when you add mods to it, it makes it evan better allowing to play as part of a gang or the police and that is where most of my game time is not so much online. When GTA V first got released Rockstar said that they would be releasing Single Player DLC howoever after they released there first Online DLC they announced the single player DLC wouldnt be happening WHAT WHY???? They said it was because they notied that most people were online and this might be true but there is still a lot of people who play Single Player and i am one of them. The reason i think they didnt release it was money just that age old thing money! How many people daily spend 100 after 100 dollars or euros or whatevever curreceny on the online. I dont know exact figures but i bet its a few Million pound worth if they released single player dlc they couldnt do that.So if you want to play a game just for the online and want to spend a load of money just to stand a chance then Yea go for it. but if like me you want to be able to play a good Story and Then have more hours on extra story mode and then maybe hop online and be able to do things without buying a 82 sharkcard in order to get some weapons and cars or to start a company then dont get this game!!GTA V has been Ruined for me with all the Online Micro Transactions and no focus on single player and i understand that they have to make money to fund for servers yes but im pretty sure they have made enough to release a couple of Single Player DLC for free!
