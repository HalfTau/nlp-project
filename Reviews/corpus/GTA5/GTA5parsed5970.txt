Its a good game, the storymode is   very good, lots of things to do, and much more. The loading times is insane though, when Im AFK from my conputer, it doesnt make any noice Im in, and I would be happy if I could turn off the music whrn it loads.Exept for that, its an amazing game! I recommend buying it on sale, if you dont wanna spend a ton of money to buy this game.
