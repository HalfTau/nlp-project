DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE GAME!! Rockstar and Take two Interactive are greedy and only in it for the money. There are so many rules ingame that it doesnt even feel like a Grand Theft Auto game. Recently, TTI and Rockstar decided it would be a good idea to kill the game once and for all by making it ILLEGAL, yes illegal, to use mods in SINGLE PLAYER in order to try and make players play more online and purchase more of their crappy sharkcards in game money for real money. So basically, GTA V is dead thanks to the greediness of the developers and their lack of care for the consumers. I mean its not like any of us purchased this game on PC for the modding or anything sarcasm.
