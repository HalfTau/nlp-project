GTA Online is a great game to play with your friends, you can also find a lot of people to have fun with, but youll mostly find yourself running away from s in jests and attack helis.With the introducition of the Doomsday heist DLC we also have to deal with orbital cannon which can trace you in a heli, jet etc.Another downside of GTA Online is Rockstars overpricing of the new content which is understandable for things like a stealth tank or attack heli, but making a regular car cost over 2mln GTA is just not okay when you get about 300k for a heist.On the bright side you have a lot of races, missions, heists, parachute jumps, deathmatches, etc.In addition with this years DLCs you have a lot more ways of making money but they require a lot of work if youre alone Bikers stuff, CEO crates, exporting cars, weapon manufacturing and air freight missions.If youre not interested if the multiplayer Im sure you know about the story mode and i dont have to talk about it so Ill just say its great even though I havent played it a lot on PC.Overall if You dont want to waste your money on shark cards and have more fun then just driving around in a stolen car getting killed by s on public session  bring some friends, its a lot more fun to play and you can make money easier and faster.
