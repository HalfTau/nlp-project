This game is a masterpiece of physics and graphic engine, the map is huge and full of places to explore. The story mode is very well written, there is almost no glitch in the game and its very well optimised. What ruins this game is the online mode full of cheaters, every lobby you join theres at least one modder who tries to ruin your game experience, another bad side of the online are the constant calls you receive, like advertisment every 5 minutes some bot calls you interrupting what you were doing, i have a really bad stuttering issue although ive a pretty decent pc i7 3770 3.4ghz, 8gb ddr3, gtx 1060 g1. I really hope these issues will be fixed any time soon, but im also sure it wont happen.
