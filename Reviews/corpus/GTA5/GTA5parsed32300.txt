The majority of my hours was spent playing with various single player mods, thanks to openIV. Now its all gone and its very sad how Rockstar/TakeTwo decided to remove any chances of modding. This game gets worse and worse with so many DLCs that are so expensive. It would be amazing for Rockstar to allow openIV to operate. For now, rockstar, im extremely dissapointed and I hope you do the right thing.OpenIV team, stay strong, you have the modding community by your side!! 3
