Pff.. Good game but its massivly let down by the amount of people hacking.. There seem to be more hackers than legit players. Gta V staff seems to not care at all.. Tonight I played for around 6 hours and must have met 8 hackers. Now Im not claiming people are hacking because they killed me, I know their hacking because they teleport into my car and teleport me else where on the map.. Or maybe its the time they teleported all players to the same location and started throwing us around the sky. Or maybe its when they spawned like 1000 motorbikes throughout the map.. oh or maybe its the time I just went and done a heist when I was level 64 and the hacker spammed me with EXP and bosted me to level 81... I have reported the majority of these players but sadly I know nothing will happen to them.. I have requested my player level to be returned to what it was before the heist but I know they wont bother... This game is been ruined and its only getting worse and worse every day... If you have a bunch of friends to play with then you should be ok if you join a private lobby but then you cant do and bunker supply runs which is a great way of making legit money.. My advice for anybody thinking about buying the game right now is to either not bother or wait until they sort this cheating crap out... How their anti hack software doesnt notice all this stuff and istantly ban is beyond me... If this is not sorted soon I will be demanding a refund as its massivly game breaking.
