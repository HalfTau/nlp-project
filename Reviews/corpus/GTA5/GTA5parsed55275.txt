Hey! Hows it going? Already didnt like Rockstars business model. Started off saying no PC or next gen consoles are going to get this game... Then BEHOLD!!! out of the kindness of their own hearts or slow down of sales They miraculously brought it out on PC and the new consoles. That already ticked me off.Kept this game at 60 for far too long.......and now, as you can see, the icing on the cake is now going after OpenIV. You go after the modding community when it comes to single player content then you are dead to me. Later Take Two.... Later Rockstar. I would have enjoyed Red Dead Redemption 2
