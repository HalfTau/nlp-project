While I did enjoy the game for its main campaign and the original online experience When it wasnt taking ages to load missions, heists, or even the open world... I am rather upset with the recent decision TakeTwo Interactive has made to go after moders for GTA5 as a whole Online/Multiplayer makes sense, but to do that to singleplayer is absolutely unacceptable.While Rockstar has seemingly been in favor for mods since the dawn of time for their games frankly, its one of the biggest attractions to PC GTA in general, its upsetting to see that they have to watch their creation be gutted by their overlords.This decision has made me rethink my decision on purchasing the upcoming Red Dead title.Enjoy your microtransactions guys. Ill be back when you change your stance on modding and bring us a singleplayer DLC. The DLC content for GTAIV is what made me repurchase the game again on PC as well as PS3 and XB360 at the time.Good luck, Rockstar.TakeTwo is a joke.
