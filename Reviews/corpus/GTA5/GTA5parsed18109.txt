i have been a huge fan of GTA games, but ive found this one to be terrible the was no flow to the story mode, and i have often found myself just looking for something to do even though i was just beginning the game.the characters are terrible and either boring af or too over the top.and driving cars felt terrible and klunky. i really regret the money spent on it /
