Great single player game.    The online Microtransactions milking customers for every dime is another story.   Its not just Rockstar doing this.   But is an industry wide plague creeping up in all new games coming out.  Developers are designing game play to maximize their profits not by creating game play that is fun and enjoyable but rather grindy and boring so you want to pay them to avoid the grind.   Youre basically paying  them not to play the game.    I dont see any end to this trend dark days indeed
