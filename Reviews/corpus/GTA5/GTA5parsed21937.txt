Ive only had this game for a couple months and have put in more than 200 hours on just Multiplayer alone. Its an amazing game and even better if you have a group of friends to play with. Be prepared to grind a lot on online multiplayer if you want to have all the cool stuff. Only con I would say is that theres modders plaguing the online community but if you know how to get into a solo public lobby you should be fine.
