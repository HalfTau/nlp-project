this used to be a good game, until the final update. now it is clear that their anticheat policy supports hackers, cheats, n all manner of greifers. average players are now responsible for everyones crap behavior. and only nonhacking players are responsible for being punished, bankrupted, banned n all around handicapped so they can be softer targets for greifers, cheats, n hackers.
