I have bought and played this game for more than 2 months, and spend over 500 appr. US 75 extra money for Shark Cash Card. However, R Star just suspend my online account 30 days today for no reason, because I used the cloud storage, I cant even play the story model. I cant appeal and all my progress will be reset. R Star is just a bully, there is no way to treat customers like this. Seriously, Communist Partys censorship is even better than R Star social club! I am done with it, hope R Star goes bankrupt soon.
