Well it finally happened. A big publisher started suing their own mod community because they think somehow the people engaging in that labor of love are cutting into their bottom line. Mods are one of the things that make the PC gaming community great, and as such I cannot reccomend this or any other game owned by Take Two.As for the game itself, its great. GTA Online, not so much. It used to be better. But for the love of god dont support sleazy business practices by buying it.
