Buy this game when it goes on sale! DO NOT pay full price!Story mode is great if you like the GTA series. A lot of improvements from previous GTA games. Once story mode is complete the game is hardly worth playing.DO NOT even go online unless you have friends to play with/help you. Cheating/modding is crazy online!! The ratio of real money to in game money is INSANE! Youll need to drop another 60, at least, just to get a couple fun items. The package deals and shark cards are a joke, Theyre useless without friends and EVERYTHING is priced so you have no choice but to buy them. Those that have been on since the begining dominate every session. Being a noob to the game at this point basically means VERY few people will take a chance on you. I get kicked from teams constantly, becasue Im new. ALso, no one will EVER keep you in a crew, MC or whatever.
