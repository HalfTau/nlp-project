Grand Theft Auto V. How come you havent realised that the modding community actually made your games sell more across the world by making an increddible amount of mods for it. After 3 years of weak, costly updates I still believed that GTA V would see a miracle shaped by the modding community. After all your bullDLC, I had a vision in my mind, where GTA V would become a sandbox game like GTASA. Where everything would be possible. Making people still want to buy your game even with them knowing you are only after one thing. Our wallets.And even that, you managed to  up.TLDR if you still dont own GTA V, dont buy it. If you want to buy everything in GTA V online it will either cost you 20 sharkcards or a million hours of farming about 300 million ingame currency. Oh, and modding is ed.
