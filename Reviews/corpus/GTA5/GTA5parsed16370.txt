Hackers... I have played this game on xbox 360 and 1 and now on pc the pc version is filled with hackes almost every lobby has one usally more. The worst part about it is that it seems like most of the the lobbys im in the people there seem to want them to be there it can be fun when there not griefing and just doing harmless things like spawning ufos but most of the ones I run into just grief or just straight up kick you from the lobby. I would say this game is worth the 60 but if you are looking to play online the pc version is kind of a lost cause because rockstar doesnt seem to be doing any thing about them considering I was punished for getting money dropped on me that I didnt ask for I emailed rockstar support and they didnt help much and 1 day after smuugglers run hackers were every where again. But if you wanna play only singleplayer with mods or something go for it.
