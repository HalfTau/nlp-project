This isnt about the modding shut down, this is about online in general. There is a huge problem with modders online, so I can understand why Rockstar tried to deal with it, but more annoyingly is the fact that you have to spend all this money to unlock missions with CEO and motorcycle clubs and things, but you never actually get to enjoy them. You can only play them in public games where you are constantly killed no matter what you are doing, people hunt you down just because they can. You never get to enjoy the game with friends or complete those missions because someone either blows you up, or just spawn kills you over and over. Or hackers get in the game and shut everything down on you. ONLINE IS CANCER AND ROCKSTAR ISNT FIXING IT!
