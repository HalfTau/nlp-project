After playing this on the Xbox for thousands of hours, it looks so much better on PC, and shooting with a mouse is so much better. Driving with a keyboard on the other hand kind of sucks, thankfully I can seemlessly switch between my Xbox elite controller and keyboard/mouse depending on the situation.
