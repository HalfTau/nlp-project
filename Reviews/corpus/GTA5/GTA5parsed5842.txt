I got the game since my brother and friends were playing it, and wanted another person to play it with. The problem is that none of my progress ever got saved no matter what I did both singleplayer and online. Ive had to do the same starting mission for the online portion 4 times. Nothing I found about how to fix it worked, and Ive asked for a refund. The game usually works great for my brother and our friends, but Id recommend checking to see if your progress actually saves before you play past 2 hours. I wouldnt recommend getting this game imo.
