This game is totally unfun in multiplayer, and thats what it pushes you towards, with TakeTwo Interactive doing everything they can to make the singleplayer even less fun  for example, issuing a cease and desist on a huge singleplayer mod platform, basically disabling most mods.Absolutely consumer unfriendly behavior. Just look at the microtransactions for multiplayer, and the grind if you want to avoid them.
