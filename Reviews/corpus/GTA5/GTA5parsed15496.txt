If your playing for the single player story then its alright, but Ive wasted hundreds of hours on GTA Online collecting money only to have R drain my account because of suspicious activity even though i havent been online for the past 2 months. Imagine all that hardwork and taking a long break only to log in one day and find that it was all for nothing. Welcome to GTA Online! GET YOUR SHARK CARDS HERE!R all I can say is there is no bitter enemy than an old friend. Pls Go  Yourselves.
