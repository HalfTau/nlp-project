As a person who preordered GTA 5, multiple times, and got 100 on it, multiple times, I will say that the single player game is great, while the Online game has become a microtransactioned money siphon for those in the right positions. When GTA Online first came out, there were things like half a million dollars given out to players who played while their character saves were having problems. The focus turned from customer service to profit margin when GTA 5 was released for the current gen consoles. At this point I already owned four copies of the game, on PS3, Xbox 360, PS4 and Xbox One, with achieved or near 100 on each. Yet due to economic balancing, and the focus of new content in Online, buying this game on Steam for PC was only a purchase for the mods. Rockstar has recently posted a comment strongly urging Take Two to change their stance, but when has your boss turned down profit margin just to make you happy? They still havent released any statement themselves.I hae spent over 5600 dollars on physical and digital copies, as well as Shark Cards, over the course of 67 years. With this new developement, as with Activision with Destiny years ago, it is a clear indication of where the market has been heading for years. We are now in a time when the video game industry is run just like that, an industry. Pressure is being put on Rockstar because of these negative reviews, but Take Two is still just sitting back making money, and laughing at the fact that everyone complaining with most likely buy in to the next game Red Dead Revolver 2 or silly surname that has already been confirmed to be built around the same microtransaction economy as GTA 5.
