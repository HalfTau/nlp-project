Im tired of rockstar ruining my fun with mods.If they werent such cash cows stampeding modders because their worried theyre gonna get less sales on shark cards they can do more reaseach next time on if its a single player or multiplayer mod first.Sucks because they game is fun but until rockstar can pull their tail from behind their butt I have to rate this game poorly.
