I used to love gta 5, but Take 2 did it for the modders. Rockstar says Unfortunately, OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody. There is proof that when you mod and try to join online the game states You are trying to join online with an altered game Rockstar is wrong and they know it. For the makers of openiv i hope someone will change their mind.
