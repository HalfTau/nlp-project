Pretty crappy anticheat actually. I remember putting a .txt file in my gta v directory and i got banned for 1 month. Now i have LSPDFR in my directory. If i go to online i get a ban. So if i want to not get a ban then i will have to uninstall gta v then delete all the stuff from the directory. The game was pretty good overall, but if hackers wouldnt exist it would be better. So if you see a hacker and take 100 from it youre getting a ban instantly.
