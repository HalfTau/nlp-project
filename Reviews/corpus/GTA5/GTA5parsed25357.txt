This game is alright, only issue is that for a GTA game it really disappointed a lot of its fans. Yes, there have been updates since its release but theres not much to it. For a game thats 60 dollars, Id say you could just as easily spend that money on a better game or several games for that matter. If you do buy this game, get it while its on sale. Not while its full price.
