Great game. However, there is an occasional bug in single play mode whereby when you invest in stocks your investment isn displayed in your portfolio. In fact it the money youve invested just disappears completely. This has resulting in some irritating game reloads.Also, the games online mode gets tiresome very quickly. Servers issues in which the connection keeps dropping are bad enough. But juvenile hackers and modders always have the upper hand and tend to pick on new players. They have all the advantages in terms of money and weaponry so you can forget having any advantage over them, unless youre willing to waste 20 on rip off shark cards that give you ingame money.
