All the focus is on GTA Online and not the singleplayer. GTA Online is microtransactin glaore. You have to grind for hundreds of hours just to get the fun weapons and vehicles in GTA Online. TakeTwo Interactive have also recently shut down 75 of the mods for the GTA V singleplayer mode. This game is a cash grab. Avoid it all costs.
