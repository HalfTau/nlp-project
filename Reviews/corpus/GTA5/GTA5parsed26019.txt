I wish there was a neutral option because this game is a love hate relationship. If you didnt get this game release day for the PC or console. The prepare to die in online mode because everybody is at least a level a 100 and has fully upgraded weapons and hydras. Online is filled with s who literally cant control themselves around a player and not kill them. Everybody uses homing launchers. Has a tricked out ride. And a million sticky bombs. And if you retaliate. They get all pissy and will not leave you alone for the rest of your time playing. Online is a  filled with hackers and modders. But most of the time theyre cool and just spawn in money. Although you can get banned for picking it up. Which has not happened to me but has happened to other people who have written reviews. If youre looking for a review for the single player. Im gonna make it quick. It gets boring as soon as you get to play as Trevor. Its funny but repetitive and garbage. I only bought this game for online. A lot of people changed the reviews for this game to bad reviews because of the modding situation. I could honestly care less. Because mods for single player are pretty bad. The trainer is the only good one. At the end of the day. It is a good game, dont worry about grinding for money in online because youll get money from a hacker one day.
