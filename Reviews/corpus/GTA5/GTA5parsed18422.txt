This company make great games and transform them to a tool of sucking real life money from the players .. by giving  high prices on evrything inside the game  and by fixing nothing serious like the infinite load screen or some white screens that appears for hours  after some heists finale . Releasing new staff only to price them high and take the in game money by millions while in the last heist you make max 500600 k  with proper sharing  , so they force you to buy shark cards , in the age of 2017 thats a customer abuse and rockstar has to be punished in  a way for that .
