Online mode has become a F2P gta knockoff from the apple store that is riddled with cancer microtransactions. Buy this game only for the single player and dont even consider spending a single cent on the multiplayer.Other than that the game is a nice installment in the gta series and the singleplayer is really fun.Only recommend for the singleplayer.
