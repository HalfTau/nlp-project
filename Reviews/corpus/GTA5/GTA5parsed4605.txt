I played this game for a little bit and quickly realized that money isnt as hard as you would think to get. Grinding to get money is more fun than annoying. In 2 days I had 550,000 and 1 car and an apartment. It isnt that hard to maintain money and after spending its a little different going back to grinding. There arent many people that kill you. And if this is a problem then there is always invite only sessions. The mini games are fun and it isnt really even as bad as people think. Its not super horrible and I think anyone about age 12 should be fine.
