UpdatedTheyre working on bringing back OpenIV, stop giving good games a bad rep Ive even seen this on Kerbal Space Program. Leaving a bunch of bad reviews wont do  all. Especially when you do it on games that have nothing to do with GTA 5. Grow up. The singleplayer is good, multiplayer is a bit grindy but with a couple heists you can get most of the stuff unlocked content wise, like CEO/Biker stuff. Not going to give everyone a bad name but there are alot of people leaving bad reviews just because they cant use OpenIV to cheat in multiplayer anymore. Those that are doing it because of singleplayer mods, I get it. But at least keep your ing and moaning to the game in question. Spreading it to games that TakeTwo has even barely breathed on KSP for example is hurting nobody but those developers.TLDR ignore the negative reviews about OpenIV, but dont buy it unless its 50 off or better.
