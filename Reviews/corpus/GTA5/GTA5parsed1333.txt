Servers ruining entire online experience!The game itself is quite enjoyable, once entered, but, unfortunately, most of the games online experience consists of server issues and loading screens.Despite the rather long time since the release nearly three years for pc, the server infrastructure setup to keep up with the players online interactions is insufficient.Disturbungly long loading screens after missions  even infinite loading loops  occur often enough to really make you desperate.Especially when, after giving up and restarting, another heartwarming loading screen of up to 10 minutes welcomes you to its glory of waiting.If these issues would receive any further recognition, maintenance regarding server performance improved and loading screen times could be cut, the online mode would greatly benefit.
