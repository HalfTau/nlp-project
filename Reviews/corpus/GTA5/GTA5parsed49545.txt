Fantastic game. Absolutely Fantastic. Those who made it were geniuses. However, the current management if thats what you could call it are diabolical. The online is so money grabbing it hurts, you pay 60 dollars for a game and thats apparently not enough, the online is crippled through microtransactions without which is utterly dire. Do Not Buy This Game If You Value The Gaming Community. Fix the Modding, stop the hackers, make the online viable  and maybe GTA V can still be one of the greatest titles ever released.
