This game used to be great. I remeber first playing GTA online with my buddies in middle school on my xbox 360. The first time I logged in nobody had a super garage with 64 vehicles stored inside. it was survival in the streets of Los Santos, everyone was scrambling to create their gangs and there was a mad rush to get the more powerful vehicles in the game buzzard, rhino tank etc.. It was an environment unlike any other I had ever seen in the gaming world, It was amazing. But alas all good things must come to an end. Once they started coming out with these ridiculous DLCs with blatantly op weapons, guns, vehicles and so on it really ruined the game. And now they outlawed our mods? these guys. They dont deserve any of the money theyve earned and I have no clue why this game is 2 on global top sellers in 2017. Very sad. Pirate this game to play the single player but please dont pay any amount of money for this monstrocity of a video game, its not worth it.
