Story mode relatively OK.GTA online  tty long loading for everything SSD/HDD  still same  5 minutes for first join on GTA online...Next case, online mode is only for  kids with rich parents. Without money from store in online game newbie can do only nothing  everytime death by bazooka or other cancer toxic idiot gun from player with random extreme armor, random extreme fast car, random extreme everything...PAY TO WIN  Game for agresive kinder  which can not win by using the brain..GTA V is worst product which I bought forever. I hope, I never repeat this again.
