Well, was really looking forward to Red Dead Redemption 2 and GTA 6 but not anymore. Single player mods are the best. Even more fun than playing online when my friends arent on. I have the steam version which I use for single player mods and the Social Club version for online. Was also looking forward to all the upcoming mods but those are no longer going to happen. Oh well. Time to move on to another game anyway.
