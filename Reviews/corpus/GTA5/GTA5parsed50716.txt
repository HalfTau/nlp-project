I loved this game, it gets super boring without mods. Rockstar and TakeTwo literally just ruined this game on PC by shutting down a mod tool that is only for singleplayer modding, it disables online entirely if you try to use it online. Why shut it down? I have been disliking the developer and publisher gradually for years now, but this? This is where I draw the line. I am DONE with this game for good, regardless of the platform. I refuse to buy shark cards or play the same mission for several hours just to earn something, I do not have that kind of time to waste until I go insane from boredom just to go buy me a hypercar to mess around with online. Absurd....modding added a lot to this game, and now they go back on it entirely.Rockstar needs to do something about their anticheat program built into the game and stop screwing everyone else over by shutting down yet again, a SINGLEPLAYER modding program.
