This game is a grindy, hacked mess. With every dlc comes new vehicles, planes, jobs, and other utilites. But guess what, each individual item costs 3,000,000 each, totally nearly 300 per update JUST TO EXPERIENCE WHAT WAS ADDED.What the hell is this? Why are we being force to work jobs and earn our money in GRAND THEFT AUTO. Make the planes spawn in. Make the new cars spawn in. I have a job already, why the  would I want to work another one when I come home just to earn virtual t.
