OpenIV is back, yes.HOWEVERRecently the entirety of GTA online has been farming for the 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 planes that arent even good.Modders have incredibly increased with the recent smugglers run update,NOT EVEN KIDDINGAround 3/4 lobbys i join, there is an obnoxious modder ruining the game.The singleplayer of GTA V is really good, but online has become a cesspool of farming, modders and fighter jet / apc / minigun trolls.
