I enjoy this game, but this negative review is caused by a triple wammy of cancer due to the latest hacking issues. So Take Two shut down OpenIV, scum as, hope they burn for it, but still I launch up GTA because on occasion it can be fun. Then Im greeted with a welcome message that essentially says, We will ban your account at will ,  you Im not a child dont treat me like one. Then finally upon entering an online session Rockstar have the nerve to inform me that their social services have corrected my balance by over 1000000. They took everything, none of which was modded money, it was all from grinding out CEO missions because this microtransaction hell hole is only manageable through endless grinding, which for me now is worthless. Get bashed Rockstar you cucks.
