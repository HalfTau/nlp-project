Gta V is an amazing game. This is a proven fact that we as gamers all know well.The recent ordeal regarding the ban of mods from Gta V completely is also no stranger to us all.However, finally after almost a week and a half of hard fighting, R finally did what was best for not only them, but for the whole Gta V community as a whole.They made Take 2 TAKE back the cease and desist they placed on openIV.This is exactly what i expect from developers nowadays and i have nothing but respect for R and T2s decision to undo what they have done.lets hope what happened here is a good statement for future developers of the gaming industry as a whole.GG R and T2. you dun good.If you havent played this game  the singleplayer at least  by now, what are you waiting for?youre missing oooouuuuut.
