I have put A LOT of time into thhis game. I preordered the PC version and loved the game ever since. the first summer it was out on pc, you could not play in a public lobby without modders ruining the game for everybody. So by christmas of 2015, they cracked down. by this point, my friends list and I had menus and we were able to kick people in the lobby with it so we would kick other hackers and that all we used it for and maybe some money, but who wouldnt?. then we all got banned for ten days. I have not cheated since then and have not revieced a ban. i got my warning and learned my lesson. But now you see, theres the problem, you let people off too easy who dont care about getting banned. i did so i stopped but clearly others dont, and clearly you dont rockstar because instead of punishing those who cheat with an actually GOOD anti cheat system which is where your money should go instead of hiring lawyers to right a cease and desist to a modding company that makes SINGLE PLAYER MODS which you said in the beggining you supported, and also you cant acces online with them, it says you have modified game files. Dont punish the modding commuity for your mistakes. I hope you enjoy losing all the customers you justaway. In the end, yes this game WAS great, now they ruined it. id also like to mention, they add content that you have to spend your entire life to save for just to spend on a system like gunrunning where you wait 5 hours and maybe make 100k. its t and thats why people chea. i get you have to spend money to make money but you just make us poor so we buy sharkcards which i will never do!
