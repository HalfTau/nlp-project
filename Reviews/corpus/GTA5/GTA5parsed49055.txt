I strongly suggest anyone thinking about buying this to avoid it, the single player experience only lasts so long and then youll only have regrets.Theres so much wrong about the online section of this game, GTA Online is wrong from the start, being an boring and slow grind, anything requires ingame currency and nothing is cheap, everything literally costs millions of ingame dollars with the more expensive stuff being in the billions, they literally force you to buy shark cards in order to do anything unless youre willing to grind for hours for each step you want to take, that is if you dont get banned or have cash or items taken from you because of suspected cheating or misbehavior, in reality you dont even need to log into the game and someday when you come back youll notice something is gone or youre banned, thats how good sarcasm the anticheat is on GTA Online, the other problem is how Rockstar is turning from an company that did not cared about controversies to an company that does not cares about the consumer, if anything happens and you need support, expect an scripted bot awnser and nothing in the way of help.
