Honestly, Im not big on the GTA community but after hearing of the cease and desist against modders, I cant think of anyone who would recommend this game. Its not modders who ruin the game, its the lack of anticheat. All modders do is add more depth to a game that is already there. If you ban all mods, youre going to have a plain game that most people will get bored of.
