The singleplayer is amazing, the online is also amazing, but beware they will ban you forever... that game that you just spent 60 on, yeah, now you cant play it because rockstar deems you unworthy of playing their game, you cant even buy it again, you have to make an entirely new steam account because they wont let you unlink your steam and rockstar accounts.
