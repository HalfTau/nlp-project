This game was great. Read was. It used to be that you could create your own experiences using the wonderful world that was created here, but that is no longer the case as the biggest modding tool has been shut down. I cannot abide by the actions taken by Take Two this sets dangerous precedents for modding and the future of it. I would not recommend buying this game at the present time due to the malevolent actions taken by the publisher.In short go  yourselves, Take Two. You may have my money from me buying this originally, but youre not getting any other cent from me.
