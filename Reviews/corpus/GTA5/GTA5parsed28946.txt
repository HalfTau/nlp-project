A great company would work with the modders to eliminate the parts that conflicted with the online multiplayer and then patch the game accordingly so that the single player could still be modded and the multiplayer experience has fewer cheaters, all with the implied acceptance of the company.A good company would crack down on the specific mods that allow people to cheat in multiplayer and let single player modding remain a grey area.A bad company uses legal tactics to bully a dedicated team of loyal fans into killing a project they love because they think all mods are bent on destroying theonline section of the game.If Take 2 is telling the truth, then they at least have a valid motive even if what they are doing is wrong. The problem is that I dont think anyone believes that they are telling the truth. If Take 2 ever comes forward with a detailed explanation of how Open IV can help people cheat in multiplayer or even better video proof then I will belive them. But even then, it will not fix the fact that their response to this was quite possibly the worst way to respond to something like this.From a business standpoint, it makes sense for Take 2 to value GTA online above GTA single player. From their perspective, one makes them money, and the otherdoesnt. That being said, one part of the game should never have to suffer for the other to prosper. You have a right to make something profitable, but you also have a duty to your customers and community to make sure they can use what they paid for.For many people, Take 2 has intentionally failed that duty.UPDATEIt appears that Take 2 has allowed RockStar to work with the team developing OpenIV to find some kind of solution. However, I still feel like Rockstar is the abused child of Take 2 in the sense that Rockstar has not been more forthcoming with information that any developer would love to give to their fans. I will not change my recommendation until Take 2 allows Rockstar to speak without threat of being whipped with a belt.
