GTA five is an excellent game, not the best but still rather good.The story is engaging and lasts for quite some time.However that isnt why this is a negative review, it is a negative review because of the god awful multiplayer.Sure it is great fun to just muck about with your mates for a few hours but if you want to do anything that you see in the trailers The DeLorean, Import Export cars, ect. youll need money, thats expected but with the introcuction of Shark Cards a few months if not a year or two back everything is alot more expensive so unless you are willing to grind for hours on end Ive personally done nearly 40 hours of grinding the only option is to buy ingame money with real money, this is something normally seen in freetoplay mobile games where it is understandable because the game was free.This is a full price game that is almost 5 years old, ill say that again. This game was released in 2013 and still costs 60.This is the second time ive bought the game it bought it on the 360 when it came out but my xbox acc broke so no multiplayerThis brings me neatly onto the state of GTA Online servers, you cannot connect to the online 3/4 of the time, for example today I tried for 2 hours to connect to GTA online all to no avail, it takes 6 minutes when it does work and when it doesnt with no retry connection option at the end.The DRM Social Club is AIDS you have to sign in twice once when you start the game and again when you are loading the game. This is why Piracy is still a thing, not for the cost but to avoid the often broken DRM. Sure its illegal but the odds of you getting caught are far outweighed by the convenience of not having the stupid broken as all hell DRM.If you want to play a multiplayer GTA game try GTASAMP its a mod for the best GTA game that adds in multiplayer that is free to play with more than one server and hundreds of different gamemodes. Most importantly it is fairly priced as in the cost of things matches income unlike GTA Online.I rest my case.
