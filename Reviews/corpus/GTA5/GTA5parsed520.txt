Close to 25 hours to complete the campaing I say this game is worth every penny. Their choice of three characters instead of just one was perfect. When ever I get fed up with , personality trait I have a choice to simply see Whats going on with . They mastered the art of making the city and the character feel alive. Once you switch to another character the previous toon you had control simply goes on with his life. Ive found Trevor in all sorts of weird funky situations all along his character traits. I can say the same about Frankly and Michael. It was trully a joy to play. I do have one gripe though... Some times I would equip a vehicle with all the bells and whistles drive it up to my garage and then use it to get to a mission only to find out the game would delete the car. That was quite annoying but I was probably doing something wrong. Idk, Idc and honestly it didnt bother me enough to find a permanent solution. What I did instead was I simply pimped out the vehicle the character comes in. Done, problem solved!This game is an instant classic. 10/10. Buy it.
