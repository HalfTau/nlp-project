PROS1. Addictive2. A fun and big online experienceCONS1. Cancerous players kids to be specific shooting and killing people for no reason just to fill their bloodlust2. Its hard to grind money because of the small amount you get when finished playing certain missions and literally too much things ingame are pricey AF3. Last but not least.......A MICROTRANSACTION TYPE OF GAME YAAAYYYYYYY  U ROCKSTARFinal conclusion  just buy the game, truly recommend it because it is fun but dont ever take this game seriously. Cuz Rocstar wants you to hand over all your money for them just to buy their Shark Cards.
