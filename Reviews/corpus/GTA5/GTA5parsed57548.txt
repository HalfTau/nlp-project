Take Two just killed the game and its community. It was a good run while it lasted, but apparently our relationship is now over. When a publisher starts fighting and makes legal threats towards its own customers then its time to move on. Any company that tries to kill its own modding community deserves no support. Spend your money on someone who will appreciate it and continue to deliver the products you want rather than deciding for you how you are allowed to play.For those who have a craving for more open world action I would recommend the Just Cause series or Saints Row, as the companies behind those understand the wants and needs of the playerbases and will instead encourage them to do all the whacky shenanigans they desire.
