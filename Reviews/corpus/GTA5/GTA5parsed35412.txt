Gta 5 used to be fun, usually because of the updates and the fun of playing with other players. Gta 5 story mode is great but online is crap, I got banned twice for hacking despite the fact that i wasnt hacking, other fellow hackers in the game have the power to crash your game and ban you, its ridiculous, gta security is crap.
