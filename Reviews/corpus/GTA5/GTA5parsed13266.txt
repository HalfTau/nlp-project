story mode very good.on line multi player wow so much to do and play keep the missions coming love it the bunker so cool thats rock star, the bat car was also just released.dcl with all these missions makes playing the game lots of fun unlike the frist person shooting games that are boring as you run around in circles shooting other players with no real point or mission. for year the deveolpers have made these boring games we always wanted more and the other companies would never do this because they say that ther is not eought turn over and that perople only play the games for a short time and then die that is why they make new games very year. the deveolpers siad that the ceos what very little invested in the games and new ones yearly sdo that they can make the project costs. making new games keeps money coming in and peolpe will buy new games ver old ones.rockstar realy did a good job making all the missions and different game play, giving upgrades to new mission and having some point to accomplish a goal not just aimlessly running around and shooting each other i now that you do have a 1st or 3rd person views and you can have first person shooting in gta 5 but thier is so much more to this gamethe missions realy are the gold the bunker which is newer than the biker dcl this updates or DCLs how every you want to look at it and it seems that as the newer dcls are coming out they are getting better with more to do go rockstar.the complexity and game play is frist of its kind and is the best i have see in a long time.hopefuly rock star will continue to make deveolp or put out more updates/ DCLs with more missions and thigs to do and accomplish and not just aimlessly running around shooting each other with no real mission or things to do.so nice to see on line game play for solo and multi player remember some mission say you need recomded two or more to do this job, doing it solo and also lets of fun and challenging they are giving the opions to do it solo this is a good thing because manyy times it is hard to find player wanting to do the work or missions.all said and done thanks rock star for the great game play and all these great mission on linenote addedthe game has grown with lots to do missions, races, ceovehicles and cargo, motorcycle ceo, hanger mission plus your office planes etc... run bussines to make money in the game also doing racing makes maoney in game,  new to us vip work hiring , take cars or find them in game to trade them in for cash at custom auto and much more to much to list.get missions that can be do solo and the other players  some time it is hard to find the right poeple to play with because many are doing Bad Mods and or hacks for cash and or attacting other players  thier needs to be a sperate server set aside that should pull them to it keeping bad players in there or something. lots of poeple are complining about it. side note wish you could turn off the bad langue or change it to say cleaner stuff.the game is deveopling into a great place to go and have fun with an open plate form to grow adding more  DLC / missions / updates / it is really nice to be able to do solo mission with or with out others we were waiting to see who would final start to build games where its not every year buy a new game with rock star the story keeps going and gives you a lot to do and play with friends and solo.really you can have alot of fun, we have seen truck shows between the player and other vehicles they own and camp fires on the beach this was done in privte session so other remdem player did not just go around shooting the other players  many poeple dont like the other players mods and game play hope this helps others  just start your own private online session invite who you want.Last note  if you see the Bad Moder / Hicker just report them Rock Star can see and tell WHO is causing the problems repeated problems form others will help norraw down the trouble makers PS ....everyone is telling us to leave the room as soon as possable then the Bad moder  Hacker thing is happening to you. qiut the game come back   they are setting poeple on fire and so fourth etc.......happy game playing hope the review helps others online contiunes to grow and this is good keep up the good work deveolpers programs and the poeple running the platform to all casts amd crews that work on rock star thank yu for the game thank you...
