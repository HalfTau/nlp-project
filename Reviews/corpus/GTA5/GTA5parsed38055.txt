Thank you Take Two, you did the right thing by letting the development of OpenIV continue.Old, negative review I liked playing GTAV when I had it on the PS3. I bought the PC version so I could play with some mods. Unfortunately, Take Two Interactive decided to be  and sue mod makers for making mods. I didnt take notice for a while, but then they crossed the line and gave OpenIV a Cease and Desist. Grand Theft Auto V is a great, ambitious game, but as of right now, if you want to mod the game, Id recommend against this for now. If things change for the better, Ill remove this review and see about making a good one.Sign this petitionAlso, everyones thinking Rockstar was directly involved, but it was really Take Two Interactive thats responsible for all this, so direct all hate to them, not Rockstar.
