Let me start off by saying this is a GREAT game. Rockstar has consistently updated the game since its release and the single player alone is worth the asking price of 60 in my opinion. However, the publisher of this game, Take 2 interactive, has recently banned all modding IN SINGLE PLAYER, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, of fanmade projects such as the remaking of gta 4s world in the gta 5 engine, being shut down. This was done in an effort to get you to buy the SEVERELY overpriced shark card micro transactions. I am completely against this anticonsumer practice and am ashamed of Take 2 interactive. I hope to see Rockstar find another publisher in the future. That is why I am obligated to give this negative review of this otherwise outstanding game.
