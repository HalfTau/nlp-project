Personally I feel real bad about leaving a terrible review on my favorite game also my favorite game maker after a few days or weeks to cool down I can say that the R team does listen to us. In some instances I was absolutely wrong in my review as well as the community still posting bad reviews but I can say that the game is a amazing game to play. The game still has flaws that really need to be fixed but for now I feel like I can be more patient with R and not rush to my keyboard when something is wrong. Played the GTA since San Andres on the old PS so really seeing how it evolved makes me feel way old but happy.
