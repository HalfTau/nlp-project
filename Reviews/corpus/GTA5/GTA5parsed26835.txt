I frankly enjoy playing this game. Online is by far my favorite because single player does get boring. And thats why we have mods. When I heard that T2 gave open IV a cease and desist I could tell that the community was gonna lose it. OpenIV is a major thing to the single player community. For online modding. I am an ex modder who got banned. The people who throw tempter tantrums about it need to chill out. Rockstar does has implanted punishments if your caught. If youre caught youre automatically set as a rank 9 offender. In other words you can make no many selling cars. You can only sell 1 car every 2536 hours. This offender rank also goes down every 9 months. So thats over 5 years for my rank to be set to zero. If youre the type of modder that is abag you deserve to be banned. If youre a nice modder then you do you. Thats my opinion on the modding situation. Now for regular player online yes you do have to grind for money. If you have friends then that makes it easy. Also the best heist to do is obviously Pac Stan Pacific Standard. Now if you still complain about cash then you havent heard about the glitch. Do recommend this game. I do. If you  about the money and the shark cards I hope you realize that rockstar will randomly give you half of that money back. So if you buy 1 mil in shark card money then youll randomly get 500K back. If you just dont like the game then why the  did you buy it in the first place.
