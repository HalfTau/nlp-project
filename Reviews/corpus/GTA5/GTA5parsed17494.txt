I have not been playing this for quite some time.I found the mini games to be the best part of it, the rest is mostly painful.The load time between parts was silly.I bought shark cards in a bundle cause the bundle was cheaper than just the game.Shark cards make the game pay to win.This game has caused me to avoid buying other games from 2k.Buyer beware they publish under different names.
