I do NOT recommend this game for several reasons. Firstly, the online mode is FILLED with hackers who constantly make you unable to play the game at all. Ive played the game for a few hours and Ive found myself to be hacked several times. This includes being turned into a baseball or a guitar and fly around the world without an ability to do anything. This doesnt change even when changing into another server. Secondly, today on December 25 while playing online I was told by Rockstar Games that I could buy a free car  from an ingame shop. I did, and even while buying it from the store it said that it was completely free. I proceeded to acquire the car for free, but then I found out that over HALF A MILLION ingame dollars had vanished from my account. I had purchased the ingame money with Shark Cash Cards which cost quite a sum of money and now I have apparently paid 7,49 euros for a car that was supposed to be free. I have lost my respect for Rockstar Games completely and I make a personal promise that I will never buy any of their products ever again. This game is a waste of money, literally.
