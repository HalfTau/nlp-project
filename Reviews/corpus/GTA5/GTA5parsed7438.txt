Pretty damn good game.Throw to the side the fact that you need a monster PC to run it at 60 fps, there are workarounds and I wont lie to you when saying I played this on my Xbox for months straight. Cant run it on my PC lol Also, you rob banks, do heists with friends, shoot civilians, everything you dont have the balls to do in real life you can do here.
