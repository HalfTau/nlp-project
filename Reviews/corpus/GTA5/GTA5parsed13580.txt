After being out for years, this game is still great. I just got it on PC after playing it on Xbox One for a very long time. The story is amazing, and Online is tons of fun. My only complaints are how stuffs getting extremely expensive. Ive also heard stories of people getting money stolen from their account, but this hasnt happened to me. Overall, I love this game!
