Despite this games obvious merits as an atmospheric, storydrivenmaybe narrative, with gorgeous nextgen graphics, the fiascos and various small flaws add up.Prices for all things have increased, turning multiplayer into either a harsh, lonely grind, or a paytowin system.Pay to win in two ways, for me either I pay for my friends copies of the game and play in lobbies with them only, or dole out the same levels of cash for ingame money that wouldnt even get me as far.Removing the modding capability from the games singleplayer will not /stop/ modders, but rather it will influence them to pirate earlier versions of the game and mod those. Removing the modding/hacking capability from multiplayer will not stop those players either. Code evolves on both ends, and things are always evolving.Isnt fighting tiring? Cant we just make a game thats fun for all sorts of players, disregarding their levels of cash and equipment? Even just creating separate lobbies for those playing with mods/hacks would be a quicker solve. Hell, Id join. The best times Ive had on this game were with completely benign modders, who only did it to make people smile, as far as I saw. Its what Id want to do, as a developer, for headaches on my end and inevitable workarounds on theirs.Its a fun thought to entertain... For a game about theft, the developers seem to have taken that notion to heart.
