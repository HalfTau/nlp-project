T2 and R are not doing anything to endear themselves to their userbase by shutting down Open IV. Pretty much shot themselves in the foot with that move, there.That said, if you want to have the exact same singleplayer experience with higher or lower framerates depending on your hardware that a console player would, go ahead and play GTA V. If you want to have the same online experience, good luck, because GTA Online is still full of hackers and modders, and killing Open IV didnt help that.Thanks T2 and R. Of course, I mean that with massive amounts of sarcasm.  those guys.
