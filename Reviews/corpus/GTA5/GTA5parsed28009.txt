So, this is gonna be a mixed review. It may be negative, but there is still reason to buy this game.Alright so, first things first, the campaign is this games biggest strength. The cast of characters are funny and well crafted, there is SO MUCH stuff in the campaign that even after beating the main story there are still things you can do, and the modding community for singleplayer is amazing. However, GTA Online and how Rockstar is treating this game is whats making my review negative as of now. GTA Online is riddled with hackers, pay to win elements and a ton of grinding. In nearly almost every GTA Online session you go in, there will be hackers ruining the fun for everyone or dropping people loads of money which can sometimes get you banned. Along with this, making progress in GTA Online is a pain in the butt because most missions barely give you any money, and all the fun missions are inaccessible unless you buy a CEO, a big apartment building, or a bunker. All being VERY expensive. The only way to do really fun stuff in that game is to either buy Shark Cards or hack and give yourself a bunch of money. Other than that, you are very much going to rely on other rich people who can start things called heists. But even that doesnt give that much money and not having teammates that die 24/7 is very rare.Not only that, Rockstar/ TakeTwo Interactive attempted to shut down singleplayer modding some time ago by giving the creators of OpenIV, the tool used for GTA 5 singleplayer modding, a cease and desist. Thankfully it was pulled back due to the amount of backlash that GTA 5 is still recovering from to this day. Its the reason why the reviews, as of writing this, are mixed. They used to be overwhelmingly negative.So yeah, buy this game for its amazing and highly replayable singleplayer, but try to stay away from GTA Online.
