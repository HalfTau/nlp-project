As much as it really hurts me to leave a negative review of this game, I have to. Dont get me wrong, I love this game. But as is, there are too many issues that make it not fun to play. You lost me the second you added those OP explosive rounds, but now flying cars???? Seriously????? Rockstar needs to stay in their lane and stop ripping off other companies. Every day, I feel like GTA becomes more and more like Saints Row. I love Saints Row as well, but like I said, Its NOT what GTA shoud be. If you want a real GTA, go play San Andreas or GTA IV.
