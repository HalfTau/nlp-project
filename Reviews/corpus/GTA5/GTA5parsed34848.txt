Over 3 years of playing this gamer, on PS4, Xbox 360 and on PC, I will say its not worth the buy with the new state of the game, it just being a money grab or a grind fest of days and days for something thats not really that satisfying.The updates Before they actually met something, with the updates that added Import/Export and the Heists, they were great and it actually felt satisfying to get the things in these updates, but now, the things they add are either 1. Overpriced, 2. Not worth the money or 3. Doesnt feel fun like the old things they had added. Now they just add more and more explosive things making the game either unbalanced or just uncreative in general.The Weapons They were something before and unique to the game, but what they added with the new vehicles and the new upgrades to the weapons, it makes the game unbalanced or unsatisfying, all they recently add are just related to explosions or bullet hells, with the explosive HEAVY SNIPER, a sniper that takes no accuracy or skill to use, once was just a sniper that might of instakilled but took some skill and reflex to use, and with the vehicles, they just use automatic explosions and unkillable vehicles, I was excited for the updater which added bomber things, I felt it could actually be balanced, but they messed that up, making the explosions too little to actually hit anything, I thought it would be fun to burn a Veitamese village but the only thing that could take skill to hit the targets, they messed up, with the OP vehicles littlerally costing a arm and a leg to get and all you have to do is aim your mouse for a bullet hell of bombs, and the only thing that I that would be boring on the plane update, the explosive bullets that are automatic, are the only thing you can actually take things out with, making the only way to win the game now is not with skill but just with a bullet hell of explosion.Creativity They are just uncreative now, like I said just adding overpowered, overexpensive weaponry to the game instead of things that take skill or atleast have some creative values. Before they added things like the rocket car which is fun to use but doesnt kill with something that does kill like the blazer or something even older like the Insurant Pickup which is very hard to kill but you can still manage it without something super overpowered unlike they have now which needs a vehicle or something even better to kill it with, unlike before you could just kill it with either  skill or tactical value, being mostly impossible now.Singleplayer Singleplayer is the only good thing left with GTA 5, has a very fun storyline, but R and 2K are not going to be adding a DLC anytime soon, because theyre too busy with explosions and overpriced garbage.Pricing ingame and the buying price If you want the singleplayer, it is worth the 60, which has not chaged in the 4years its been out, so dont expect a price drop in the next 20years, unless its on sale, but with multiplayer it will either cost you real money or a year of your life just to get some of these things ingame.Hackers and the community While I know the customer support is utter garbage, for not repsonding for days and days, I dont know if the hacking and banning has changed, for I havent played this for months, I know some people still and complain about the hackers so I assume so, I dont know if it stayed the same or is worse, since before modding was literally every lobby, also if you get banned wrongfully dont expect to get unbanned since the customer like I said is bad and they either will be unhelpful, wont cooperate or wont respond.With the state GTA 5 is in now, I dont recommend this game, even with my long time I have played this game, GTA was ruined with the most recent updates, unless you want to play singleplayer which if then I recommend get it on a sale dont buy this game.
