When i bought this game, i was uneasy, whether i wasted money on this game, or not.My answer is This game is definitely worth it. The online isnt ridden with that many hackers/modders as i expected though i am in Europe, so i cant speak for NA/Asia, and you can easily switch sessions, so if you see one, you can switch.Singleplayer and its story is amazing, and is worth the money itself.Online is also nice, to be honest to really be able to enjoy the online fullest you need to get 700k, though you can get it easily through heists and their first time bonuses. And people complain that the community is toxic, though i disagree with that. again i am in Europe, so i cant speak for other regions  Ive met my fair share of friendly players that i like to play with. People do sometimes shoot on sight in freemode, though that can be avoided with passive mode. People do sometimes kick low levels from heist lobbys, around from rep. level 19 though you can easily raise levels at the start with races and solo missions.The only thing i dislike about Online is the Doomsday futuristic vibe. I like the concept, a heist with setups in freemode, thats a nice change, but i dislike certain vehicles like the Deluxo, as it is a bit OP.TLDR The singleplayer is awesome, the Online is great too.
