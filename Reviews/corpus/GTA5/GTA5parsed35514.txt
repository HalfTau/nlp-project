So, I tried to give this game chance after chance. Yes, single player is so much fun, yes playing with a few friends in a private online lobby is a lot of fun. BUT PLAYING ONLINE IS ONLY FUN IF YOU ENJOY CHEATING AND HACKING OR BEING KILLED EVERY FEW MINUTES. Rockstar needed to clean this sht up four years ago when the damn game came out. I hate playing GTA Online and I hate having had paid for this game. Fck take two, rockstar, and all you money grubbing lazy fcks.
