Single player was great but too short. Game developer only update on Online mode.Online mode item are all overpriced and all newly added FREE content cost millions to enjoy and basically F2P player will not have any chance to enjoy all new game mode if they dont grind hard and keep repeating same mission over and over again.Not recommended for Single player focus or F2P Online players
