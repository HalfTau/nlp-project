This is a great game.I absolutely love GTA V. I had it on PS3 and i bought it when it came out on pc. The story is brilliant and the game looks amazing. Sadly however, TakeTwo have gone out of their way since realease to make the game as unplayable as possible. The online mode is sometimes enjoyable, but most of the time its a hellhole. Their recent policy, it appears is to attack the most dedicated fans of the game. These people have put time and effort into making mods and even the users of those mods have gone through a how to get them installed. All this to build on the great game that is GTA V and keep it alive. Rockstar and Take Two however, are not to pleased with this because it keeps people away from the online portion and thus does not make them any money. Those poor developers and publishers... They only have one of the best selling games of all timesI will keep this review as not recommended as long as mods are not allowed. This is the final straw.EDIT Mods are okay again, still a microtransaction
