Im standing up for the people that enjoyed modding this game, although I didnt do it myself, I find this a stain on creative freedom and the hours of fun people threw into this game.Look at Skyrim.. its still alive because of modding... Terminating this wouldve been a lot less bad had you come up with a steamworkshop or some other solution rather than just lazily killing it!
