This game is inherantly good, well the singleplayer is, the multiplayer is just a microtransaction fulled hell hole, and i like most people modded the singleplayer but Take2s recent actions involving openIV and their statemet saying that theyre  not making us pay enough through microtransactions tells me that they really dont care for their customers and arent interested in creating an enjoyable experiance for people
