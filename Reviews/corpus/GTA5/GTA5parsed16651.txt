I downloaded it a while ago. Worked perfectly fine, installed some mods and all was still going as expected. Then I rebooted my PC and dragged GTA 5 with the mods across. It still worked like before until I tried to install another mod Ambience since then my game wont start even after completely reinstalling it for 3 times. Its really nerve racking considering its an awesome game even more with the mods. But spending 70 bucks for basically nothing in the end tried many fixes btw is not very pleasent.
