Its not R banning mods and making everything obsurdly expensive, its T2 to blame. Because of this, I wouldnt recommend buying the game since the publishers are greedywho already earned 3 billion and STILL want more. I hope the amount of negativity this game is getting will set them back in the right mood. For the moment being, do not purchase this game.
