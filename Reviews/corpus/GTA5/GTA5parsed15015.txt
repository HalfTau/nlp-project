The game is fun to play but OMG the loading time I went had a shower,made a sandwich,eat sandwich,made a coffee came back LOADING XDJoking aside let me run this down for you.1 loading times are to long2 the community is as toxic as it gets3 dont join anyones heist for setting up cause they wont invite you for the last even when you helped them through every setup.4 hackers and cheaters on pretty much every server5 one off the biggest real money hogs in the game i was lucky got a free shark card when it was on sale soon goes.Seriously all my heart for anyone thinking or wanting to buy this game DONT seriously. Your gonna save yourself a lot off hassle.
