After more than 500 hours I come to realize that the game was worth every penny. I didnt pay Full price for it but I would. The comunity has been described to me as very toxic, but it is not really true. Most of the time ppl are nice to you if youre nice to them, but every game has a few rotten apples. Only thing missing is another heist update with more heists. Make it happen Rockstar.
