GTA Was one of my first video games, It holds a very special place in my heart.  Dont let my steam hours fool you, I have several hundred scattered across different consoles.  Why Cant i reccomend this game?  Take Two for one, the modding community wont be the same ever again.  The story... well kinda sucked in my opinion.  I had a hard time relating to any of the characters unlike other GTA games where NIko and CJ became an extention of myself.  The whole script left me feeling like Im playing a bad written action movie with OKAY graphics.  Yes just okay, it all seems plastic and bright Maybe they were going for that because it takes place in L.A.  Dont even get me stared on shark cards and the most Toxic gaming community next to League of Legends and call of duty.  I could go on, and giving this a negative review feels like im breaking up with my old girlfriend.  But I rejoyce as the new Red Dead is upon us, and rockstar was not the one who shut down open iv, even so at this point I would much rather play the waiting game than this...
