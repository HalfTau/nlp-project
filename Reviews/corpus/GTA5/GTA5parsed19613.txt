So I had already made a previous review on this game that was a lot more basic... But now that Ive been expieriencing some other problems, I got some more stuff to say.So, my general thoughts with this game so far is that I completely and utterly wasted the 20 dollars I payed for this game thank god it was only 20. Why? Well, when I first started the game it brought me through this long and painful social club setup process, and then after I got through that, it then made me confirm the license key...? that apparently came with the game. Odd process as I have never seen it for any other game. Anyways, upon loading into the actual game for the first time, it set all my graphics to lowest at 800x600 despite my graphics card being able to run much higher.. Then I had to wrestle with the game to turn my settings up because it kept turning it back to lower resolutions. When I got into the first mission of the story mode I got the absolute worst screentearing despite the FPS sitting at around 80, so to fix that I turned on vsync. Once I got to drive a car for the first time I started to notice this awful stuttering that would happen any time I went under 60 FPS. I started looking online for solutions and didnt come across much. I was messing with the nvidia control panel to turn on vsync in there instead when, to my horror, the game launcher started crashing upon trying to start it up. I, again, looked online for solutions but nothing there worked either. So I just finally gave in and decided to reinstall the game forgot to mention that the game is giant and takes about 8 hours to install for me, not very impressive. When that was done I tried to launch the game again and, low and behold, the launcher crashed again.Im not gonna play the game again not like I can anyways until this gets fixed.
