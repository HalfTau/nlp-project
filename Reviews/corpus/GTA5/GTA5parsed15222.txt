Recently got banned for using cheats.I aint mad because I did cheat.But my review is still negative for the following reasons.While Online really is great with friends , it is unbarable to play.Its grinding forces you to either spend hours and hours of playing just to buy what you need to defend yourself against an onslaught of high leveled players and cheatersbuy shark cards for real moneycheat at the game and get moneyI know a company needs money to run , but when you force me to spend so much time just so I can have fun , work myfor hours just so I can get a car if Im lucky , then I have a problem.War Thunder has similar grind but that game is free , not 60 bucks.Plus if youre gonna make us grind for hours , at least do a proper job at banning cheaters. Rockstar just lets loose almost all the cheaters in the wild and does little to nothing about it.I have played games with cheaters once , but GTA V Online is the game where Ive seen the most.While Im still talking about online , does everything have to be so god damn expensive ? I mean GTA gets fun when you can do dumb stuff and have little work to put into.I dont want to spend my week getting a CEO office just to get blown off by some  in a hydra everytime Im going to do a mission.As for the Singleplayer , I dont know , I didnt enjoy it.The violence is very inconsistant , they accept to show you some stuff , but other is deemed too hot topic.The characters were boring to me. It felt more like fan service to me.Apparently everyone moved to San Andreas for some reason.The missions were long and boring. Aside from the heists , those were actually fun.Its too easy. Like really , thats a GTA game ? They used to be harder than that.In the end , its a decent game if you get it on a sale.Although I certainly wont recommend a game where a lot of people are reduced to cheating themselves just because they cant go in a public session without dying from one and where my singleplayer is just boring.I did have fun. But remember. I had to cheat to get it.Have a good day.
