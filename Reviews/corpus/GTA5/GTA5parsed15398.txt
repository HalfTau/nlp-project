This game never ceases to amaze me.  Even after 4 years, I still enjoy playing.  Started palying with friends on my PS3 and moved to PC when it released.  According to Rockstar Social Club data, I have over 450 hrs total play time by far my most time consumed game to date.  Counterstrike Source coming in a close second at amost 350 hours also havent played for years.  Ideally, I have gotten my moneys worth in entertainment value.
