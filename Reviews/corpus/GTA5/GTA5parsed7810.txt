I watched a bunch of youtubers play this game and when it finally went on sale, I took the plunge. I would like to say I enjoyed this game but I cant even play it.I keep getting the 202 error, and the last 5 hours trying to solve this issue makes me want to tear my hair out. I cant even start playing this game because I cant join the social club and I cant download the latest version of the social club because rockstars support page is buggy and unresponsive so I cant even send in a ticket to request help!This whole experience has left me feeling frustrated and angry. I want to try this game, it looks amazing, but until rockstar acknowledges that it has a way to go with customer support, there is no way I can give this a good review.It may change if I ever actually get to play the darn game.
