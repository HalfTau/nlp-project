SP is solid and I have a lot of great memories from GTA Online.However, only online DLC is made and only to push customers to buy their shark cards since there is no way you can buy all the stuff they release for currency you earn ingame. I dont mind supporting a game I like but it is really getting out of hand with their pricing for the new stuff.Deciding to completely ban SP mods just because the way SP and MP was made allows for hacking P2P, no dedicated servers is a really  move. If they didnt want this issue they shouldnt have been so greedy when creating their online gamemode.If you are only looking to play singleplayer without mods it might be worth it when it is on sale. Otherwise I cant recommend it
