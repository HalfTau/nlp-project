Between the cluster  that is microtransaction and people getting banned because of other people hacking in money this game will certainly make you hate Rockstar even more. The rocket bike is 40 irl citation needed and if Rockstar legitimately thinks that I will spend that much money on a virtual bike then you honestly need to rethink your life. Yes I know that there is the argument that if you are just going to complain about it then dont get it but when you join a lobby and every other person has APCs that can literally shoot down anything in 2 shots but can eat 5 rockets the game seems a little unbalanced.Joins lobby thinking that I will just fly around in my hydra and do some missions for funCall in hydra and start to flyBefore I can get off the ground get 1 shot by an APC and some kid shouting about howI am at the gameWant revengeCall another hydra but this time further awayGet in it and surprisingly make it into the airFly across the mapGet the littlethat killed me right in my sightsSelect the rocketsFire 4 rocketsThey all hitNothing happensTurns gun and one shots megg10/10 would be forced to waste my money to enjoy a game again
