Im a huge fan of the Grand Theft Auto series and have been playing since Vice City. This one hit it out of the park. My only complaint is single player pretty much got forgotten when GTA Online came out, with no updates or nothing new for single player, which is Rockstars bread and butter. I hope a new game comes out soon or Rocstar realizes that players love new content and wouldnt mind paying more for some DLC.
