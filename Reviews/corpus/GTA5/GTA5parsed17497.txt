Rockstar robbed me of 650k and wont even tell me how I obtained illegitimate money.Because even I dont know.All Ive been doing ever since I bought the CEO building maybe a couple of months ago has been warehouse missions. Mainly Import / Export after I unlocked it.Of course I get put into solo public lobbies because my connection is too poor cant connect to other players nothing to do with router / firewall settingsRockstar is just greedy and wants to stir the pot with legit players meanwhile modded players run around with billions still. As well as modded ranks.Thanks Rockstar, youre trash.
