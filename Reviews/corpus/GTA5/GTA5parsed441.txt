story is fun likeable characters funny dialouge and overall great open world but some missions are boring but overall great,gta online isnt as good its basicly just a cash grab at this point it was great at first but there is so many pointless dlcs oh and theyre free but requires you to play alot or spend real money on in game money just stay away from the online.
