OkayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyWhere do I start?Well, first of all. This game is worth the 40 surprisingly so thats nice. Its fantastic that Rockstar gives you technically free dlc HOWEVER. The prices of items has been so badly inflated by shark cards it hurts. For people who dont want to waste money on them just have to grind so much money just to get one thing, never mind all the damn upgrades. At this point in time Im level 85 and I still have lots more to get and to be honest after a while this game just tires you out. Its one of those games where you take a break from it, go back into the game saying Wow! Why did I ever quit this game! and a few weeks later youll quit again. But the game just keeps on enticing you to come back.So in conclusion this game is certainly worth it however DONT BUY THE DAMN SHARK CARDS. Youre giving what rockstar wants 3
