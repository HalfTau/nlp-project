Single player is excellent. Problem is that it has no recurring revenue generation like GTA Online. This means if you do not mind playing with at least 2 hackers per lobby, ginding for cash, or paying real money for fake money then this game is for you. To be honest wait until a huge sale and enjoy the single player, just do not expect them to expand on it. I am going to give it a thumbs down simply because they have alienated the PC by stopping the modding community. The only reason PC games survive as long as they do is because of the amazingly dedicated modding community. It is a shame because this could have been so much more.
