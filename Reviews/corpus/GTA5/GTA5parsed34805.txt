EDIT Rockstar is fixing the problem TakeTwo started. Review changed to positive for nowIve played over 430 hrs of this game with mods, 100 complete the story twice, and loved it. BUT, Take Two is now shutting down the major modding tools, such as openiv, . This means that there is no reason to play the game anymore. There is no single player DLC, and the online sucks. Fck you, take two. Leave Rockstar alone. They know better than a video game company with a CEO that avoids playing video games.
