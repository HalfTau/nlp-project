For some reason this game still costs around the same as when it came out 4 YEARS AGO, and you will not get your moneys worth of fun in this game, the SP is fine but its surely not worth that price since you can complete it in a week or so yes you still have stuff to do after that but that gets boring pretty quick And the multiplayer is  the most fcked thing ive ever seen in a game.First of all you need to spend countless hours in game to afford even the simplest things and as a beginner youll get killed by higher lvl players all the time which makes it even more frustrating. And you cant afford any protection for yourself either since all the stuff that could protect you costs so much. Everything is so ridiculously overpriced that you would have to play this game 12 hours a day to afford something fun once a week, and the way you would make that money is just playing the same missions over and over and over and over again, or you could start a business, but wait you cant since it costs so much that you would still need to sell your grandmother to buy shark cards and to afford  the stuff needed for that, and even then rockstar would propably just accuse you of cheating or modding and take all that money away and ban you from the game. So if you are just starting to play the multiplayer i wish you good luck with your mental health because you are going to lose it either when you realize how toxic the community is and that all your hard work barely pays out in the end or when you realize that Rockstar doesnt really give a flying fck what you want or if the game is fun to play or not..It looks nice and the general idea is fun and since the GTA francise has such a good reputation people still buy this game for the ridiculously high price that it still has, but its not worth it by a long shot.
