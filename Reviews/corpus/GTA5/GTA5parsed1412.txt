Like every other other review says, the campaign is 10/10.But thats only half the game. Online is a very fun with days of content and its a great time with friends. Hackers are a problem but most of the time ill just find a new session and avoid them. And a lot of the newer content is very expensive but you dont need to buy everything in the game, just working for the stuff you want and it makes this a very rewarding game.
