Its ok. The game is a bit over rated. Sure the game world is huge, but you cant interact with 99 of it. Whats the point of having apartment buildings and super yachts if you cant go inside them?There is some pretty bad DLC advertising in the game as well, every 15 minutes you get called to buy the DLC, whats up with that?? You already payed for the game and they intrusively call you in game and send you spam in game. It sucks.The single player is pretty good, but multiplayer is rough around the edges.I kindof felt like the last mission in single player was unexpectedly stupid. I guess the writters went on strike or some idiot CEO made a call.Its still a good game. I played it a bit but I just feel there is no motivating reason to continue playing.
