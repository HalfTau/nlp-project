Story Mode The GTA story is really good in quality and is decently long which is nice, but I wish R would add like a expansion packOnline Mode GTA Online use to be about stealing various stuff such as cars, drugs or peoples virginity but now its about bombing small African villages with your 6.5 million dollar bomber plane.So overall gta is a good game for the price, but they really need to do some work on the story mode instead of countless multimillion dollar updates to the online mode.
