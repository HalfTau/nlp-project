After the recent banwaves banning innocent players for picking up modded money, something that cannot even be helped when its spawned remotely on you. I can say with solidity that this game isnt worth the overly expensive price. There are a lot of much more fun sandbox games out there with more freedom and fun...PS If you REALLY wanna waste your money on this game, wait till its on sale, I promise you youll be happy you did.
