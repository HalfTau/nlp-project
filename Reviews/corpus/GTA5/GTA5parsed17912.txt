Third party launcher is unimpressive, wasnt really able to play for a few hours after purchase due to difficulties with it it could just not be a thing! wow!, also very aggressively markets its online component which this review wont necessarily cover as it wasnt hasnt yet? been my cup of coffee.Visuals are impressive and performs well on higher settings with my 2 year old hardware.Particularly impressed by the lighting  shaders, i hope whoever set that up was paid real damn well.Modern  interesting story in the always excessive GTAverse, I preferred the focus on a singular character from previous games and think connection with characters  immersion in events suffered due to the multiple main characters  switching mechanic, but that the story itself was somewhat more refined than previous titles if a bit less ambitious.Buy it on special, if it ever happens again
