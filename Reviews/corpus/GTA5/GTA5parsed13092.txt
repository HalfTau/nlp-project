Edit Rockstar restored my account, but i think my points still counts.Played all story mode. 10/10 a game ahead of its time btwWent for online.Having a good timeGrind....Proud owner of an organizationloads of connection errors, but had a good time w/ my friends100 hours later Selling a car for securoserv.Got my car destroyed.Killed the player who destroyed it.... killed him 5 times actually, lost all my guns, all my money, dead cops started to rain.Got kicked.11/10 gg rockstaryou have a good game, but you only want to make more money out of it.you try to make people spend their money in sharkcards but does not fix crucial problems like connection issues or hackers.The worst thing is that i cant even report the guy, because they kicked me out of the session.I really want to like this game, the story mode is one of the best that exist, but these little problems with the gta online keeps adding up you know.This event with the hacker was the last straw for me.I mean... i had other random encounters with hackersGot trapped in a cage.Dodged money bags and quit the game.military vehicles started to rain.But, i have the impression that gta online now is just one big grind.And people are getting toxic because of money.I can see that in myself too, when i got my car destroyed, i coud just changed the server and started doing the process again 30 min, but i gave up in the rage and started killing the hacker and his friends in the organization.The problem is, i can see rockstar using mobile games tactics in gta online.Money is the key for everything.to get money is a non stop grind.things get more expensive with time.the game encourages you to get more money.to have good gear you need to have more money.you can buy sharkcards with real life money and skip the whole process.In rockstars mind its just about getting that pay to not play mesage to the player.And as a collateral damage, players get more toxic because they just want more money.And this ends up with people cheating in the game to get that cash.Even in races, people will do anything to get in first place, to get that extra money.It is inpossible to have a fair fight or a fair race anymore. its just about the money, because with money, you can buy better guns and gear, and with money you can buy faster cars, to then get more money in races and fightsDont get me wrong,I enjoyed my time playing gta online, but now i can see that the game is going downhill.Well... i guess ill have to go back to GTA 4, to play some bowling with my cousin.Anyways thanks for the reading this review.If you want, you can add me as a friend to say what you think about the review or about my experience with the game.Have a good day everyone.
