Great game,seems no shortcoming.But my account just be banned cause i pick up some money package on the ground.4,GTA5steam500rGTAGTA510GTA6 VR67VRGTA VRThis game has been published for 4 years.but in my mind,there is no one game can beyond GTAV.I played a lot of games, this game is the only game which gaming time is more than five hundred hours.It brings me unlimited joy and leave me an unforgetable memory.Such as T dressed like a woman or M find his wifes affair...GTA means a lot to those who never been to US before.Maybe only in this way can he feel like living,to be exact,combat, in US.Except most developed country and China..almost every developing country doesnt have a grand city like L.A.so the game to those countrys people is not just a game,but more like a desire for morden and better life.About GTA future in my oponion.I belive GTA VR is coming soon,probably RStar will continue to update GTAOL and in the mean time,they develop GTA VR.Or released GTA6 first and we can play GAT VR  in the next generation.Whatever,im looking forward to GTA 6.Strongly recommand.
