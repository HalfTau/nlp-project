An amazing single player game. good graphics pared with an amazing story.The multiplayer is a different story. if you didnt know already, the Rockstar staff are scam artists. 100 in real life  8 million in game. To put that in perspective, all the good cars are over 1 million, some as much as 2 million. so 100 real life dollars for 4 or 5 virtual cars. This puts players in the ironic situation of actually liking the hackers because most of the time they give you money.honestly, the only reason I am giving this a positive review is because the multiplayer is fun once you get money.But dont give a dime to Rockstar for in game money.
