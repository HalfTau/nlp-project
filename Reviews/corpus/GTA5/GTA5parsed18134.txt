Single player is awesome, had so much fun, online on the other is terrible after a while, first i enjoyed it, but then i discovered how expensive everything is, bought some buildings after i spent a lot of hours getting that money, then i discovered that i have to buy more things to use this buildings for smth, for example office, bought it and then i had to buy extras to do missions, wtf rockstar, the only way to have fun in online is having lots of money, which can be either bought in real life money, which i highly doubt anyone is doing or hacking, and oh prepare yourself, theres hackers everywhere and only 1 out of 100 is good, and actually gives money instead of bullying
