This is apurchase. 1st of all my account setup wasnt complete on the social club and i encountered a black screen. In short my account was created but whenever i try login in, I get invalid credentials. To much to my suprise i was able to access the account online perfectly fine. Steam has not given me my money back. I want my money.
