I enjoyed this game for what was. I havent played this game in a while though since my laptop sucks and I have no friends. I still recommend this game if you dont mod games. Im no modder and I hadnt put much into this game as others did. So, the singleplayer is great... The characters are ing weird and awesome. Its really cool that you can use your own music to listen to while you drive around.Multiplayer is meh without friends. I like playing dress up with characters and thats about it. I recommend this game but I dont think its worth over 90 NZD anymore.
