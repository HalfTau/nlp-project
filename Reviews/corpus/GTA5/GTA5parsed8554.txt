GTA V is absolutely amazing and one of best games Ive played. Theres a metric ton of content, the world is huge and looks fantastic. The game is very well optimized for PC, there are options for everything you can wish for and the controls are great. Ive never seen such a good console port and a game that is technically so close to perfection.
