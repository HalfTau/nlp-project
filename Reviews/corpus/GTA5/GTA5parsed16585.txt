So ive been playing this game for a while now, not just 50 hours like it says on my profile, ive been playing since the launch on Xbox 360. The game has a great story, best one so far if you ask me, I have not completed the story on pc, barely touched it, but I did complete it on Xbox 360 and it was great. On pc there has been some additions I believe, like the ability to become an animal by drinking an unknown formula, and also some known bugs has been fixed I believe. Aside from the story theres the online mode which allows you to experience Gta 5 with your friends, this is not the storymode tho, here you are free to take whatever path you desire.When I returned from Xbox 360 to PC rockstar had removed the funtion to sync characters 1 month before I got it for pc, so I had to start over in gta online, if you are a returning player I advice you to concider if you really want to start over before buying it for pc.Gta online is very pay to win if you ask me, but not nearly as pay to win as it used to be, back on xbox 360 you earned very small amounts of money so u had no other choice than to pay to win.Example you want a car that costs 2000000 but you only earn 16000 per mission.These days you can either pay or play the game.Example You still want that car that costs 2000000 but now on pc you can do heists which you could at the end of xbox 360 to, but not at the start and earn up to 300000 per heist but you can also do ceo missions and collect stock up to 1000000 per full stock.Gta online is extremelly fun and I recommend trying it out alot.
