This USE to be a good game. GTA III and San Andreas were the first games of the GTA franchise that I ever bought and I thought they were great! Fairly good story, only a few bad missions, a lot of stuff to do in between, and endless hours of fun. Around the time of GTA IV the internet became a place where gaming and playermade content were starting to meet and one of the best things we saw was the introduction of Single player modding in the form of LSPDFR.Rockstar since then has Favored microtransactions rather than developing new content. Refused to actually deal with the hackers and instead blamed the modding community for their inability to prevent people from corrupting the multiplayer area reason why I stopped playing despite the fact that most if not all modding goes to Single player.Rockstar USE to have a great game. They need to realize they are starting to travel down the same path that Payday 2 Devs did and we can still forgive them if they stop the madness.
