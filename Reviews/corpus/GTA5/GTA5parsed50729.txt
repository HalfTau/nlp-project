Single player is a masterpiece and the game is well worth getting for that alone during a sale!However multi still has endless loading screens and is rife with hackers, issues that have persisted since the console launch, nearly 5 years ago! 3 out of 5 games you play will have a hacker. The brazen nature of their hacking seems to suggest that R isnt doing much regarding banning them. On top of this the community is incredibly toxic and makes playing thoroughly unpleasant. Also, everything is geared towards getting you to pay for the ingame money though the notsomicro transactions or face a gruelling grind putting up with obnoxiously kids who are too young for the game and hackers spoiling that process. The online was amazing when it fist arrived and worked on both console and PC but now is honestly something you can pass up if you arent desperate.As said before, single player is great though!
