Really enjoyed this game when it first came out, but it seems like Rockstar and Take2 are doing all they can to kill it and suck the playerbase dry of their money.The singleplayer is fantastic, and it may be worth 60 bucks to you. The multiplayer on the other hand, is a crapfilled grindfest to do literally anything fun. That is, unless you buy shark cards. The game is basically no fun if you dont have millions of dollars to blow, and its basically impossible to grind that money naturally.Not to mention the recent thing with Take2 sending cease and desist letters to prominent modders and such, which is the lifeblood of the GTA community and has been since the franchise began. Its sad to see.Dont buy this game for the multiplayer, and I really wouldnt recommend you buy it at all.
