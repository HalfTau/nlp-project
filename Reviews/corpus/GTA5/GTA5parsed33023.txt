Modding was a crucial part of the GTA V experience, it wasnt bad for the game and actually helped the community to grow. Now Rockstar and TakeTwo feel like they do not get enough cash out of this game and ram their giang throbbing s into theof the community only to change that.I dont want to support that so take this glorious german middle finger in form of abad review. Change your buisness practices and I might change my review on this game.
