Take Two killed my point in making GTA videos with the killing of OpenIV. Sadly I dont feel like playing the vanilla game because it has been out for 4 years and quite frankly it is insanely boring by now. Latest DLC offered me 3 days of fun but OpenIV would get me more than I can imagine myself. Take Two is better to fix this now because this will affect GTAs future in rather a destructive way.
