recently taketwo have taken away the only reason i paid for the game, mods, no not online mods, not cheating in online, no, mods that allow you to have a better time in single player, car mods, map mods, menus to have fun with IN SINGLE PLAYER and taketwo interactive the money theifing gits have taken that away from me and everyone who had bought this game on pc, this is a bad reiview and taketwo are trash for ruining this game for many of its consumers, if you, like myself paid for the game, i suggest we fight back, and hit them were it hurts the most, theyre wallets. cheers
