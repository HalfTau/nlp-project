Great game, but if you want to mod it, dont bother. Take Two Interactive just bent us all over with that one.EDIT Take two reversed their decision to put a stop to OpenV important for textures and such so once again a positive review.The game itself is wicked, I personally cannot play it without the LCPDFR mod plus plugins.
