Apart from all of Rockstars attempt to remove hackers and cheaters from GTA online and by attempt i mean they did nothing about it, and apart from how toxic the community is litterally up there with games like LOL, overwatch, Dark souls etc. I still think it was a great game in the Story Mode area. If youre looking to buy this game, i recommend just playing singleplayer and modding the hell out of it to make it even more fun.P.S A big ol  YOU to the guys at Rockstar for thw worst customer support in history. Please continue releasing cool games but not doing jack all when it comes to helping the players.
