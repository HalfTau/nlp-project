OVERHYPED FROM DAY ONE. lackluster mechanics and gameplay that gets boring halfway through the story. never once have i played online or gotten a connection, due to the fact it might take 10 ing hours to connect for all i know the longest ive waited before giving up on their servers was an hour and a half no joke.
