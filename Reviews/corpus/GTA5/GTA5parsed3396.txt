Great game, story is totally worth it but the online just takes thewith constant disconnections, friends leaving, heists crashing and so forth. It wouldnt be to bad if it then didnt take another 10 min to get everyone back in the same game for it to just dc everyone again.It took me and some friends FCKING 3 CUNTING DAYS TO DO ONE HEIST, ONE BECAUSE EVERY FCKING TIME WE PLAYED IT SOMEONE WOULD DC AND WE WOULD HAVE TO START THE STUPID MOTHER FCKING HESIT ALL OVER AGAIN.Generally has worse servers than Ubisoft and that is taking the fcking pss especially for a game that has been out for years and if Ubisoft can get there fckingtogether and fix one of their excuses for servers then why the fck cant rockstar do the ing same.Good day
