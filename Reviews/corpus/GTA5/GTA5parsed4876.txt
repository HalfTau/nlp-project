I have played this game a lot across three seperate platforms. PS3, Xbox 360, PS4, and now PC.So, up top, I do not recommend you buy this game if youre just playing multiplayer. I played the multiplayer a lot on console, and I cant say its worth it. Ive also read plenty of stories about Rockstars awful AntiCheat system that takes money from innocent players, so no, I dont believe you should get this game for the multiplayer.The singleplayer is a different story. Everything from the writing to gameplay is nearly perfect. The main three characters are funny psychopaths that you somehow end up liking, and the gameplay between the three really does feel different. Each one has different skills, different houses and different vehicles, and theyre all great.The story is a lot of fun, and can be pretty emotional at times. Most of the famous Heists are really amazing, definitely some of the best heists in video game history.I played this game with a Duelshock 4 controller, but I did play about an hour with my keyboard, and in my opinion, the keyboard controls suck. I would recommend playing with a controller.Thats all you need to know. Didnt talk about the flaws because there really arent many of them, but even though the game is amazing, the price is very steep. Wait for a sale if you dont think its worth the 75 USD.I would recommend.
