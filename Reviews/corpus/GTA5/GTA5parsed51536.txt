Game has an extremely good singleplayer story mode but they dont give a hit about it anymore.  They said theyd give us more dlc to expand on trevor, michael, and franklins story back in 2014 but have done nothing.  Instead they only expand on the online mode in which they give free dlc thats really not free.  You have to rely on modding or other modders to get said money just to be able to buy anything from the dlcs or you can spend about 200 of your real money to buy shark cards to be able to buy all items from one dlc pack.The online play would be fun if you could use mods without getting banned and if rockstar would actually protect you from ahole modders that crash your game.   Funny thing is Its really only playable if you have a mod menu that has built in protection to keep said aholes from kicking you from your game.  The best part is before GTA V came to pc they said we could mod our game and then after like a month they started banning people for modding even if it was just a fov slider.If rockstar had actual servers and on said servers would implement some sort of protection service i wouldnt have a problem with them selling overpriced shark cards but because they blatantly dont give a hit im fine with modders giving us free money.
