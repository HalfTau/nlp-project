For many GTA has been an icon of our childhoods for 20 years. Why exactly is that? Because it was a game of freedom. A true sandbox where you could do as you pleased. In this era, adding multi player components to your game is pretty much madatory. Especially a game as big as GTA. However, they completely went the greedy developer way with their lousy system of shark cards while keeping in game money a pain in theto obtain. In the online part of the game, the most important aspect of the immense sandbox feel that nearly every GTA brought with it, disappeared. A cancer on the industry.This was fixable. Through mods. I could play the game, with friends, in a private session and we could just do whatever we wanted with mods. Thats where the absolute fun came from. We didnt like the original GTA online. We liked just having no restrictions and play in a massive sandbox. Now they shut down one of the best mod tools for GTA.And all I can see is . YOU. I know you got plenty of filthy casual normies behind you to just ignore this and move on with your crappy attitude on the gaming market, but real gamers will not forget. May the normies disappear and your company go bankrupt. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
