This game has been ruined by the recent updates. Do I like that they are updating the game? Yes. Creating new content for players is a great thing to do. However, the way of making money has changed dramatically. When I played for the most part, I played on console, where you got money by robbing gas stations, selling cars, doing missions, etc. Now, they are trying to base the entire game around microtransactions to progress. These microtransactions give players clear advantages and really fire away from the possibilities of a sequel coming out. If you dont spend money or cheat now, then you dont have flying vehicles that can shoot homing missiles. I mean, it is just ridiculous. Unless you cheat and risk your account, there is no point in even playing this game anymore.
