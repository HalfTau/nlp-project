Grand Theft Auto was a great game.Its full of incredible detail and amazing scenery. As a gamer I was blown away by everything it had to offer even before it came to PC. Then when it finally did come to PC we were promised an even more impressive game that could be personalized to our liking through mods.And to take that away from the community just seems down right stupid. Let us enjoy a game we spent money on , let us do with it as we will and for the love of god stop banning people because they got stuck in a lobby with a hacker!P.S. Sign the petition if you havent already.
