Have you finished the Singeplayer and want to enhance your game with mods to get more out of it? Dont you dare having fun with GTA 5! Take 2 is going after the modding tool Open IV via a Cease and Desist. I bought it for PC only for the modding possibilities, despite having it on console and now that Take 2 and R have collected their money from users like me, they ban mods.Singleplayer is alright, I prefer GTA 4. Multiplayer is abysmal and GTA 5 deserved a negative rating for it before they banned mods.
