I know 1,000 other people have written the same review. But stay as far away as you can from this game and its developer. They have completely lost site of what is important in a mass money grabbing effort.I have had hundreds of hours of legitimate grinded money stripped by the developer, friends banned for no reason with no chance to have their side of the story told. The long and short of it is this company is a massive piece ofand doesnt care whether or not you enjoy their product. They only care about the proffit margain.Considering this game has already proffited more than almost any other. Take 2 cant possibly justify this behavior.Vote with your wallets people. For the love of god make them pay for this garbage.
