The story is great, and the gunplay is great. The characters are really likeable, and since the game is so long, you can just as well start a new story. It does have different endings, and thats always a plusAnd it looks GORGEOUS at ultra settings.As for online, its great if you want to play with friends. Public server still have a few hackers.Edit Original Review was ve due to the OpenIV debacle
