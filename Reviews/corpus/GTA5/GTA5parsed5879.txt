Awesome game no matter what system you play it on and it keeps getting better but honestly i miss the prearmored car days/modders where everyone had to grind and take pride in the choices they made with thier money! show off thier custom cars and race! carshows ! now its still fun but for new players plan to spend hard earned real money just to get back at those fake lvl500s8000s that never had to work hard they buy all the newest stuff max it out the very same day TRYHARDS! and then grief the double digit honest players who never truly had a chance to begin with but anyways love you R ps please come up with some sorta of age verfication too many unger 18 players crying all the time! lol over 200hrs PS4 100hrs XBOX X
