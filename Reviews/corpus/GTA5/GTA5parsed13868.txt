Hadnt played in months, I mean MONTHS, never once have I ever installed any mod or any software related to GTA V besides the game itself in my life, opened the game, changed my graphics settings, went on multiplayer to do a race, did it by myself, closed the game, later I got an email saying I was banned from playing online for 30 days.Uninstalled.
