RIP OpenIVCongratulations R and Take Two. You have Mannaged to crush the last ounce of fun from this game.The online expirience is tewrrible, and the socalled free DLC is such an obvious money grab attempt. Never again will i waste my money on you stingydevelopers. Best of luck selling your worthless shark cards now! s
