Recently Rockstar ordered a DMCA takedown of the popular modding software OpenIV. Most of my hours were in story mode spent modding the game which now I cannot do because Rockstar has put profits in front of its fanase. I cannot reccomend this game if it is run by a greedy company. When they come to their senses and a real solution is worked out that allows OpenIV I will take down this review but until then I urge you not to buy the game.EditSign the petition on
