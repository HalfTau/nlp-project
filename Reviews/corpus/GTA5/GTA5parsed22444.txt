The online is t filled with hackers and everything is expensive enough that you wont be able to enjoy the game unless you buy a shark card, which is their objective in doing this, get some money cheating or spend countless hours in the game, I played the online a lot in my old Xbox 360, spent 800 hours in the game, Im not rich, I dont even have enough money to buy the things from the new DLCs that come out for the Online. Besides, they addthat absolutely ruins the game, I was fighting against 3 guys with a friend of mine and they were blowing us up with bullets, they could see us behind walls and even had a bike that could fly and shoot missiles, all of that sounded like cheating, later I found out that all of that is content from the game that was released a while ago, they ruined a game that was alreadybecause of the hackers and the extremely expensivewith new content that makes people who buy shark cards equal to the hackers.Theres also theTake Two did to OpenIV, so  this game.
