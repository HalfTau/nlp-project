Buying this game from preorder and still playing until now. Its a game that entertain me when Im boring, when I tired of playing another game, or when I want to play game that can just chill and make some mess. And I really enjoy the story, perhaps, the stories. One thing that I really like is it keep update until now, that make me feel its really worth to buy. So, it doesnt let me get bored.
