Another example of the greedythat run this companies they make a lot of money on Shark cards but they keep just making away more content and very expensive content just to keep the money coming.This is the PC platform folks expect people to mod and make your game better either because theres was room for improvements or because you are just to lazy to fix yourConsidering the foundation of the Online on this franchise started with GTASan Andreas and the community created that mod, and everyone loved it, so when it came to launch GTA IV you enabled online play and coop and so on but you still released 2 more single player experiences. When it was time to released GTA V rockstar just when full greedy mode and now they proceeded to murder the modding community, the offline modding community because the online is full of hackers and no one gets penalized because they cant control the situation.You should just gone the bethesda way since they seem to embrace modding just to milk skyrim as much as possible and because they are stupid  that cant fix there own game so modders do there work for them, everything a game has is its community Rockstar if you lose your players you have nothing, PC players have been disrespected and left out over and over again, for example took you 2 years to launch GTA V on PC thats just ing outrageous and when it comes to other IPs of your company you just dont bother to develop them to the PC.I like this game, but this is just another insult the community cant take, no modding support, no extended gameplay.Rockstar is just to greedy and blind to care about this platform its obvious that this game is turning into a GIANT cash grab.Honestly FU YOU ROCKSTAR.Yours Truly.Slizie
