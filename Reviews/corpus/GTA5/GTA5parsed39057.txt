Creative community for this game has pretty much been shot in the head and dumped into a mass grave courtesy of Rockstar.I get it. I used trainers i deserved to be banned evil scum etc. But there is no option for those of us that do want to cheat to do it outside of official servers. Rockstar has not implemented nonanticheat servers and every attempt at 3rd party projects have either been shut down witha cease and desist, or are probably going to be eventually.The best way to describe Rockstar and TakeTwo? Reverse Bethesda. Games like Skyrim, Fallout etc. encourage creative development while Rockstar and TakeTwo froth at the mouth whenever support for 3rd party content is considered.Rockstar have been pandering to everyone who gets money rained down on them by banning all 3rd party content and tools under the sun. Somehow they managed to completelyoff both noncheating players looking for a good experience and 3rd party content creators looking to make the game different and better and sometimes both.About the hackers Rockstar has been trashing their own community to kill? Still there, strong as ever. Good job Rockstar.This is the part where i tell you that i wont buy anything from you ever again unless you fix this and embrace your community but....1 Your never going to change Rockstar and Take Two. Stay classy2. Even if you did supposedly change your ways i would never trust you enough to throw my cash down the toilet again.Rockstar, not another gigabyte on my hard drive, another cent out my wallet and not another second of my time spent in GTA V. Goodbye forever.
