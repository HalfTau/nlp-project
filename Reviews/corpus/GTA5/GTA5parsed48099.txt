With the shark cards, this game is already pay to win. Now with Take Two destroying the modding community, I cant give my word that this game is anything above sub par. I highly recommend not purchasing this game, as all added content is the same grindy missions over and over and over and over. The only people who are getting anywhere are using hacked money, or paying to win. Take Two is toxic to the gaming community, PC and consoles alike.
