The single player is enjoyable but short, and there isnt much else to do once youve completed it. There have been no updates to the single player as the only mode they care about is the hellhole that is GTA Online.Shark cards make a load of money so now they no longer care and just release overpriced stuff to give you a reason to spend more money. I had fun with online at first but many of the recent updates require you to be in a public session to play the content, where you will be constantly blown up by those who have cheated or bought their way to the best stuff. Its incredibly frustrating and the only way to do anything about them is to grind endlessly or spend real money.Its very likely I wont be playing again unless the single player gets updated.
