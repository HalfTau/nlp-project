Grand Theft Auto V will always have a special place in my heart.GTA V is one of the most detailed, comprehensive games that I have ever played one that still puts current AAA games to shame. The single player is really fun and well done, and the worlds detail is incredible. Still worth the money, imo. GTA Online is also very fun and entertaining, but its severely flawed get ready to be banned for no reason, too.However, due to a horrible support team that refuses to lift bans that are often given to players by mistake, and their strong antimod stance, Im gonna have to give this a thumbs down. The game is great, but the company and customer support is absolute garbage.EDITAfter intense community backlash, Rockstar has announced a new stance on modding, and while it is still pretty harsh, it is a step in the right direction.
