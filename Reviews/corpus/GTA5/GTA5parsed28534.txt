I bought GTA 5 on Xbox 360,Xbox One,PS4 and pc i had the most fun on PC because of mods now there gone and i dont even want to play a game that i have spent over 300 hours on all platforms. and i understand that modding the game online is a issue but you didnt have to get rid of the single player mods . You have to understand you made a great game but after 3 years the singleplayer gets boring and you dont want to keep playing it over and over part of what makes PC games last so long is because of there modding capabilities.
