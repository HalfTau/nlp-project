Hackers are everywhere. Every single session Ive joined has one, and you cant do anything with even 1 around. Theyll just kill everyone on the server endlessly. Online is terrible. Singleplayer is a far better experience for this game, needs a few mods so you can access all the online content offline, but you dont have to edit game files to do that.
