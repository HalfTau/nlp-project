Every time an update rolled out for multiplayer, I would navely see if even a few of the features were included in singleplayer only to be disappointed time after time. With the new company attitude towards singleplayer modification, what once was a selling point is now fading away. The game is fun, online is fun, but forcing this constraint takes away what the game could be, and indeed what the game I paid for should be.
