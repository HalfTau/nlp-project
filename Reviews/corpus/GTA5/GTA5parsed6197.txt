WARNING CANNOT TRANSFER ONLINE CHARACTER FROM CONSOLE TO PCIf youre new to GTAV, or plan on focusing primarily on the single player aspect, then this game is God, and you should buy it. But if youve invested time and money into an online character on a console......I can hardly think of a time when I was more disappointed about something in my entire life. Ive played GTAV since I stood in line at Gamestop for the midnight release. Ive put thousands of hrs into this game, primarily with my lvl 142 online character for whom Ive spent hundreds of dollars on Shark Cards. Across all genres, its has down the single greatest game Ive ever played. And after pruchasing 2 copies for console and now a 3rd for the pc, I now learn that Im unable to use my one time transfer to bring my online character from Xbox One to PC.
