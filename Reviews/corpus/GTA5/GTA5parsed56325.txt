Its nice to see the developer stand for the community on fair use of its product.  I never agree with cheating online, and never will, but I will never agree with draconian solutions.  The fact that Rockstar is listening to the community and trying to preserve singleplayer modding while keeping it off the multiplayer portion is impressive and pleasing.  Many companies would just refuse to work with the consumer, and this may have been the case with Take Two if Rockstar had not come in.Bravo, Rockstar.  My negative review is rescinded, and I look forward to playing this game if my laptop can run it.
