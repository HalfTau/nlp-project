whether you play mods or not, shutting down mods is very bad for whatever game you play. Mods are at the heart and soul of the gaming industry. Especially nowadays when we have lazy devs pumping out trash every year. Watch videos of people playing games on youtube and then watch people play modded games. While people do have fun playing games the way the devs want you to enjoy them, the people playing modded games consistantly enjoy themselves because they are playing the game the way THEY want to. That is something people dont think about enough. Anyway, I have played a bunch of Rockstar games mostly on console and this is enough to make me stop supporting them with my hard earned money. I mean, look  at this game. It still costs 60!!! It is almost 4 years old!
