I dont hate on this game, though I wish that I could. Approximately 100 hours of my game time was spent attempting to connect to friends over the extremely unpredictable and chaotic online system. Races were fun enough, story mode was quite a bit of a letdown, and the gameplay felt clunky as all hell. Still though, GTA.
