On behalf of OpenIVTake two can  off. The only modding issue on this game is online, and even then its not serious. Modding single player is completely carefree and doesnt affect anyone. Sod off take twoEDITStill not happy with take two threatening openiv, but good on you rockstar for pulling through and bringing back openiv
