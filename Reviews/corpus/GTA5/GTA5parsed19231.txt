People in gta just make the game terrible for others. everytime i spawn in on the new gun running dlc trying to make money im greated by super armoured cars / vans blowning me up and shooting me. so far spent most of my money on stickybombs trying so hard to make them stop. would only recommend this game if you only go on invite only with your friends. and do races. also doing heists by yourself and adding other people is like trying to walk an invisible dog its just not gonna work out. rockstar pls destroy this game. 3/10
