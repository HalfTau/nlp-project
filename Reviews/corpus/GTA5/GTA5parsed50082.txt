The campaign is great but the online is absolutely god awful, and getting worse. Its teeming with microtransactions and not just cosmetic ones despite being a fully priced game, and Rockstar continue to add more microtransactions.Ive been playing GTAO since day 1 on PS3, and theres still issues from day 1 that have not been fixed..Where are the UI, matchmaking and connection improvements? Who cares, add more microtransactions says Rockstar.As a game that has earned Rockstar one billion dollars in the first three days alone then youd think they could have put some of that towards making GTAO actually decent.
