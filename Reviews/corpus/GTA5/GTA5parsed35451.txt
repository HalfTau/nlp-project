If youre going to release a game for PC, you have to understand the PC environment. The main perk to dumping ons of money into gaming computers is the ability to mod great games in inventive ways while maintaining a higher level of graphical fidelity.Now, there have been plenty of hackers using mods to get ahead in the multiplayer mode, but that hasnt been nearly enough of a problem for people to be unable to just switch servers whenever somebody steamrolled through a playsession with a gamebreaking cheat. What this really comes down to is Rockstar trying to sell their Shark Cards which nobody wants in the first place but cmon, that obvious of a cash grab is utterly insulting to everybody its 2017 and this should be COMMON SENSE.So... even though I love this game and have always loved Rockstar games, theyve destroyed the PC experience with recent actions and do not deserve a good review. Right now you might as well go buy a PS4/Xbox One and play on those platforms for a better overall experience.
