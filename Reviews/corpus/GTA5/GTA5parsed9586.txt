This is primarily a review of Grand Theft Auto Online. While GTA Vs story mode is fun for a while especially with mods, the real lasting enjoyment Ive gotten from this title is in the free online expansion. Nothing beats knocking about southern notCalifornia doing crimes with your friends. It doesnt hurt to climb the illegitimate economical pyramid while were at it. the last heist, though. It is literally the worst part of either GTA V or GTA Online.
