The only reason to play this game now is the single player experience.  For years, the community has been involved with taking this game and making it into so many wonderful things.  There are communities of people that role play online, taking on legitimate roles of cops, citizens, etc.  It has also offered a wonderful experience in single player for people that enjoy modding the game.However, now that the developers and owners of this game have formally charged one of the best modders with a Cease and Desist, and are on track to press charges against many more communities, I sincerely hope that no one plays this game any more.The only reason to play this game at this point is for the single player experience.  However, that alone is not worth the asking price of this game.  I very highly recommend against purchasing this game.
