The crackdown on modding supports because of multiplayer modders just shows rockstars incompetent handling of modding, since the modding is only possible because of the multiplayer permission system being fundamentally not secured, thereby allowing modders to do stuff like spawning cars, spawning money, and even teleporting other players. In a proper multiplayer architecture, the gameclient couldnt get priviledges like this, thereby no matter how much the clients mod, only allowing for light cheats like an aimbot.
