Modding has always been an essential and crucial part of the GTA package  It allows users to customize the game in so many different ways to provide a unique experience tailored to the users needs.With the deliberate take down of OpenIV, it appears that instead of working on the security aspect of the multiplayer component, TakeTwo and Rockstar chose the lazy way out.From the mount akina mod in GTA SA, to the multiple car mods present in GTAIV and V, I cannot imagine a future in which GTA is restricted to such a narrow perspective for the offline experience, taking most, if not all, of the fun out of the game.
