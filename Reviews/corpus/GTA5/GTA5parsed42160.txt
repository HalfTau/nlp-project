Actually im not really into the GTA modding scene but the move from Take Two of banning OpenIV is just unacceptable. Modding games always was a fundamental part of the PC gaming scene and even if youre not interested into modding your game you should ask yourself if thats the direction you want PC gaming to go. I really hope some Take Two manager is not that braindead as they seem to are and learn something from the community reaction.
