If youre looking for a fun single player game to find your way through while youre bored on a Tuesday night, this game is for you. The single player is very fun and will bring 100 hours of gameplay before you grow tired of it. However, the Online mode is the biggest mess I have EVER seen in a game. The servers constantly crash, everything is far too overpriced, and modders will  you over all day.I played this game a ton with my friends and enjoyed 700 hours of gameplay. The servers were annoying and none of us could afford jack but we found ways to have fun. The game got very militaristic so we didnt play as often, as it just became a  unbalanced knockoff of PUBG and ArmA. Things finally came to an end after some stupid  spawned a  of fire, money bags, and cars on me. I died several times before leaving the game. I returned a day later to find myself at a 30 day ban. Way to ing go Rockstar. Their automated bans will just remove any player in its path, it doesnt give awho you are. Finally a long time later, I returned to the game once again and was playing alone in online, when some  with a lawn mower freezes me in place and bombs me repeatedly. I didnt have enough time to leave the game. All of mycrashed instantly. I reloaded the game and was greeted with a warm PERMANENT BAN. I tried to contact Rockstar support but got some automated message because their support is a ing joke.OverallProsFun singleplayer and storyLots of fun cars with good customization opportunitesA good game to play with friends, with a lot of variety.ConsServers are horribleOnline has become a war simEverything costs way too muchFlying cars and stupidbrTerrible Rockstar supportFree, undeserved bansNo longer able to play the game once you get into an unlcuky session
