Recent events suggest the anticheat protection of GTA Online have been bugging out, with hacking remains unregulated and ingame bank accounts of legitimate players being wiped for no appearent reason link.Contacting Rockstar Support, the official support site, would not help dealing the issue. They would just repeated the accusation of those affected player illegitimately gained the ingame money in question and shut down the conversation by barring them from replying. This kills any opportunity for tackling the malfunction / bug in the cheat protection mechanism of the game, rendering the achievement of all players possibly in jeopardy.This also indicates the unwillingness of the customer support in actually supporting its customers and leaving them in the cold.
