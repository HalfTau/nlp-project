I had this game on the PS4 before I bought it as well on PC during the most recent Summer Sale. I thought that my issues with the online part were maybe because of the PS4 community, but they were not. Heres what I found true about both versions.I liked not loved the single player campaign. With Rockstar spending pretty much all of its efforts on GTA Online, Ive given the online part of this game 3 tries, once on PS4 at launch way back in 2014, once again on PS4 in late 2015 and early 2016 and recently on PC 2017. It had SO much potential but after three times my conclusion is do not play GTA online unless you have a reliable crew of 4 people online simultaneously. GTA Online is fundamentally an open world game thats heavily instanced. Youll spent a lot of time waiting in lobbies and unless you have those 3 friends to count on, chances are the time spent after the waiting is going to be frustating as hell.The grieving is insane, no one is helping one another, missions will be aborted a lot because of people leaving, the occasional connection issue will pop up and being in a lobby does not mean youll even start a mission. The game does not lend itself very well to PvP compared to any kind of true online shooter both FPS and 3rd person, etc. The guild system AKA crews is no guarantee in resolving these issues. Basically, the potential youd imagine a GTA game would have online, this game has not. And the single player is guaranteed fun but gameplaywise, its nothing you havent seen in previous GTAs.In summary buy it in a sale if you havent played the singe player yet, absolutely do NOT buy it for the online part.
