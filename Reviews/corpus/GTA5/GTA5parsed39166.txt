As soon as I stepped into the game it felt hollow and desolate, no matter how many NPCs or PCs Id run into... The random encounters were repetitive and lacked any real depth, the story incomplete and multiplayer a buggy mess filled with microtransactions in a map you that you generally had to buy your way out of.Many people in the community see these shortcomings and seek to add in things to improve the experience, a lot of which are generally intuitive and inspiring projects  however, since the start, Rockstar have always been opposed to modding or providing an experience potentially more enjoyable than the original game. Its abhorrent to see a developer restrict the players creative control in order to retain longevity and profit on a failed game.If theres ever another GTA I pray they learn from this.Do not buy, if you wanna try it check then the trash.
