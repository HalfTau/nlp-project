I played the game legit for over a year and a half only to wake up one day to an email saying I was banned permanently, and that the decision to ban me was not only permanent, but also nonnegotiable. Ive been a lifelong player of Rockstars games and that was the catalyst that made me realize they dont give an absolute  about their player base.I tried filing tickets but they have bots that auto close tickets related to bans. I tried emailing their developers as they are the only ones with access to ban logs but they also have an email filter blocking out ban emails.I even presented the three hour live stream I was doing right before I got banned as proof I wasnt cheating and was only met with silence and denial.If this is how they want to treat a loyal paying customer,  them.To top it off, they tried to ban modding in a game that has finite singleplayer content. At this point I put Take Two on my wallet blacklist as well as Rockstar because its obvious both companies have their heads so far up their own arses that they have lost the ability to reason with their players.Im never again buying a T2 or Rockstar game until things change, which as I can tell wont be any time soon.
