like most of the people i bought this game to play with my friend and played a lot with them, but the online mode quickly became an absolute grindfest with no fun involved. Its simple grind for hours, even DAYS I am not kidding, or buy the ultra expensive microtransaction bllsh!t, seriously you could buy other game with the price OF A SINGLE SHARK CARD. Games like Titanfall2, rainbow six siege or even Fallout 4 are all cheaper than those microtransaction and will bring you entire hours of fun, or instead you could buy a shiny new car in GTA V that is the same thing as your 5 other cars but looks slightly different.
