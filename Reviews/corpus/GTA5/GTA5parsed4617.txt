After spending all these hours in this game, honestly, all I feel is frustration.After playing for this long, in multiplayer I have achieved next to nothing, besides a time killer.Heists are impossible to get into.Hackers.Grinding.And for what? So that I can sit around and wait even more for people to join some setup?Will I stop playing it? Probably not.But I do not recommend getting it for all the bull that exists in it, and so that maybe someone does not fall into the same trap and only get mad at everything when they have some time to kill.
