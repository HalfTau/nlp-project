Want to have fun? Play the singleplayer, or play online with friends. Dont expect much. Yes, the heists are amazing, but everything is an absolute grind, even by borderlands standards. Trying to use the business is even worse, as now you are just a target for others players, and even if you manage to get the packages back to your warehouse, now you have to worry about actually delivering them. This is near impossible, and and honest waste of time that has costed me nearly 50 hours to reach. Dont play this unless you are there to horse around with your friends.
