Damn, Rockstar, you savage. Even after I did the exclude bad reviews thing, people still say they goton... Should of stuck with PS, but apparently yall  on them too. Savage.That said, as a mainly single player person, I would at least get this on sale or something for that. But if I was Rockstar, I would stick to SP games for awhile, till you let go of what seems like a lot of douchy customer support and tech folks.
