The online game is the best openworld multiplayer Ive ever played. Its a difficult game to classify because it does so many different things so well. Its an autoracer, flight simulator, roleplaying game, and first person arcade shooter. It has scores of multiplayer missions, brawls and races as well as a series of fourplayer cooperative heists that serve as a fullyfleshedout online campaign. If cooperative play isnt your thing, there is more than enough openworld playervsplayer action to keep you entertained, as well as random server events and challenges.The campaign is also decent, if long.  Im not really a fan of switching between protagonists, seems gimmicky to me, but its still a good campaign.  If youre a modder, think twice before buying this game as Take2 is shutting down the modding community with legal action.  But for most of us, this is a five star title and youre missing out if you dont experience it.  It packs everything the GTA series has to offer, and takes it to the next level.  Its a title worthy of its place in the franchise.
