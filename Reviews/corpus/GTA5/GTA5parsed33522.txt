From sending a cease and desist letter to the team of OpenIV and banning modding from their singleplayer game, the games multiplayer is heavily setup in a way for you to spend money on their game at extremely high rates.Now I was never a fan of the online experience, from the loading time and the extreme You do what I say now starting experience.In the single player mode now, modding has been banned, meaning, no new content even though it is continually added to the online experience, in effect shoehorning people into their online experience if they want to experience the updates for the game that they still have to download.Everything is seemingly setup to try and get you into to the online version of the game and spend your time there, and everything in the online version is divided by levels and money, of the latter things are getting more and more expensive as the new updates comes out, making the shark cards look more attractive.
