I highly reccommend the single player mode, it is utterly stupendous.The story is pretty cut and dry, its basically Michael saying Okay, Ill work for the governemnt this LAST TIME! About three to four times throughout the game.But just because the story is use, rinse, repeat, doesnt mean the game is such. The gameplay is very diversified, with three main protagonists, all with different motives and personalities, it adds such flavor to the game. This game doesnt reuse gameplay elements either. It can range from a torture sequence, to using a cargobob with a giant magnet on the bottom. The cinematics are fantastic, by the way.Now the multiplayer.... The multiplayer is not gonna lie.Its a cesspool of hackers, little kids cursing and griefing, and a buch of domestic terrorists killing other players in overthetop jets with big ing rockets on them that their mom bought them. Iyou not, you can buy an orbital cannon and kill anybody anywhere just because why not.Buy this game for the singleplayer only. The multiplayer is nothing but griefing, loads of hacking, and microtransactions.
