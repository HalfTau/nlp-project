OLDI am joining the coalitionboycott against the BAN on single player modding.  I wanted to dive deep into modding for purposes of livestreaming the game and making YouTube videos, but this ban destroyed that dream.  I have to admit I still like playing sometimes, but its short lived and I hardly play like I used to.  Its sad ROCKSTARs GTA V is now in jail until this BAN of modding in single player is readded!UPDATE  Looks like they once again allow MODDING  just the way this game is supposed to be.  Due to the ABOVE BOYCOTT though I have moved on the other games.  Might checkout the next GTA VI?  ...but this game is all but dead to me.  guess I can RECOMMEND once again, but not going to play this anymore...Original rating  9.0/10.0NO MODS rating  4.5/10.0Rating after the nomodding phase  7.5/10.0
