What to say... GTA did a lot of things right in the single player, but the multiplayer falls apart very quickly. An overabundance of hackers and basic human nature make it very adversarial when playing alone.In the same vein, Rockstar has seemingly forgotten about story in favor of selling ingame currency, where the real money is.Also they and Take Two presume to not allow modding of the game, which is the final straw.
