What the litteral f did you do to OpenIV, you couldve gone a different route with this, for example, Menyoos is able to be used in GTA Online and you didnt close it! I think what Rockstar and Take2 are doing is simply greedy business! They eliminated OpenIV because they saw that it was making players enjoy more time offline, but they want the money, so now theyre forcing people to go online to play with these unique things, but they deliberately make them cost a fortune so they kind of give you no choice, you either play a quadrillion hours to get the money you need or buy a shark card, so naturally youll buy a shark card. But in the end were playing and Rockstar got our money so we should all be happy right?? ?See what I mean!!!!! They FORCE you to BUY shark cards IN ORDER TO PROPPERLY ENJOY THE GAME!!! !Ive never seen such a greedy move from a game publisher... You should be ashamed of yourselves, YES YOU GUYS AT Take2 Interactive!!!!!!! !
