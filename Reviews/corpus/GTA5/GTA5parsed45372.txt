A game that i used to love playing 2 years back. You know i was ok with a lot of t. I was ok with being false banned for two weeks last august. I was ok not getting my millions that i signed in to get for your events just to not receive a dime. I was ok dealing with angry man children with mod menus blowing me up every 2 seconds.But you took away the one thing that makes pc gaming great.Honestly  you and all these stupid sheep that support this corporate trash.T2 you are scum but the realscum are the people that support thisand shell you out for defending what belongs to you. The bilnd idiot sheep that think its ok for a company to do this to its consumer after 2 ing years.Ill gladly join the so called bandwagon and throw in my negetive review.Bilnd sheep will be always have briain damage, there is no fixing that so us normal humans need to keep the pressure up and downvote this game to hell.
