Everyone complaining about this OpenIV.. Just deal with it, Modders Hackers and some Glitchers are like a bad disease if you play the game normally and forget mods ever happened it will make it more enjoyable. Take it from me as someone who is unable to acess their online account because they decided to muck around with mods in single player AND had to reinstall the game 3 times because OpenIVits self and made my game file corrupt.
