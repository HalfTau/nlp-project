I thought the game was great on its own. It was a well written story in singleplayer and brilliant gameplay.However, online it extremely hard to progress due to megre payment per event forcing you to buy shark cash cards at exorbitant prices. This is a pain for someone who spent 40 on the game anyway. I understand they need to run the servers but this is just greed.As a sidenote I think TakeTwos ceace and desist for Open IV sets a really bad precedent for video games becoming money pits sucking consumers dry when rockstar has over 700 mil from microtransactions anyway. They claim it is because Open IV could mod online. This is not the case. Companies like bethesda with their creation club are butting in on the normally free mod community and if this becomes a success, cease and desists will be issued to all free mod creators and everthing will be sanctioned by the game developers and will all be paid. This will kill budget gamers wh want extra value for their money from free mod content and result in an already 40 becoming more like 80 or 100 if you want extra cool stuff which mod creators might even want to give for free.Furthermore companies turning their games into online only games as singleplayer becomes more profitable means those who value singleplayer experiences are left out. Online tends to be more profitable due to microtransactions for small content so companies spend more time on them and neglect singleplayer. The thing that makes singleplayer on GTA fun after youve completed it anyway is mods and Open IV was the foundation. I just hate what they are doing.
