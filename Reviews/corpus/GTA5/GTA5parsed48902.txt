TakeTwo Interactives shutdown GTA modding tool OpenIV..thats harsh!!! never played online and i never will. the only reason i buy this game is because of mods.they should embrace mods not remove them. i know its revenue in GTA5 online, but seriously. the people paying additional money on GTA online are not the people that are gonna use OpenIV.
