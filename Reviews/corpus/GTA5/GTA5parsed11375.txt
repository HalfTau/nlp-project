I bought this game to learn English language. Unfortunately dialogues are full of curse words like more curse words than normal words. Second thing online mode. I thought I will play online and talk with people enter buildings and learn words about house, furniture... but only place enterable was strip club. Uninstalled game after 30 hours of gameplay feels like waste of money. Partly my fault because I needed to do better research before buying it on other hand who would expect that GTAV dont have enterable buildings in online mode ..Appart from that I enjoyed some of those 30 hours because of story mode, improved graphics and physics.
