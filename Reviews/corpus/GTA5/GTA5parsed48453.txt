Look when this game first came out, even the first year this game was great. And really overall it ia an amazing game, but recently the game has been crippeled serverly, and im not just talking about the OpenIV ban, yeah that was a really horrible thing that take2 did. But I have more problems with the game then just the banning of singleplayer mods which is absolutley bogus by the way I dont even understand WHY they would ban singleplayer mods. Like really?But the problems with this game dont just stop there.Well lets just say the online mode is COMPLETELY FED.Why? Well, lets see here. How about getting banned for no reason? How about the online support being not helpful at all, and not caring at ALL if you get banned for false reasons? What about some modder just walking in, dropping you a ton of money, or modding your level, WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT. And whoohooo you get BANNED.You wanna know WHY people MOD? CHEAT? BOOST ACCOUNTS?BECAUSE THE ONLINE IS GRINDY AS FKTHATS WHY, all Rockstar and take2 want is their money. Their SWEET SWEET PRECIOUS MONEY.Thats all they care about, I mean its not like the game literally made over 2 BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF SALES IN THE FIRST WEEK.But yet they still FORCE you to buy sharkcards to get any of the cool new stuff that they release in the game.and they put NONE OF IT in the singleplayer.... yeah.At this point, if youve already gotten the game before back on Xbox 360 or PS3 when the game first came out, dont buy it on PC. You wont get any benefit out of it at all, sense their is no longer any mod support.Rockstar and TakeTwo really had a great game here. But they shot it in the foot for no reason.Unless you havent played the story mode before DONT BUY THIS GAME. The online isnt woth it anymore, sense you literally have to spend HUNDREDS of dollars in real life cash to get anything without playing the same money missions about a million times.
