Im leaving a negative review because every time i try to load online it says i must complete the prolouge again and i am 27 done with the story mode , i load back into story mode and then my game soft locks , so now i have to load story mode , load online , wait 3 minutes and accept the online requirements and then load in , it takes so long and nothing fixed this i deleted my save files even , also the game is horrible now theres so many t overpowered things in this game , its fun still but they need to fix it and stop adding flying cars that have an endless barrage of missles ready to fire
