I have been so excited about getting this game and playing it and becoming a billionaire in gta online. Do not buy this game unless you only want to play campaign or you have friends on pc with this game. I have become frustraded with all the bs with the biker buisness update you can sell the product you manufacture and sometimes get the money. I have done three unprofitable missions to sell the product and havent got the money to date. Gta online is a great idea but with rockstar making the price tags on stuff so high so you buy shark cards it is ridiculous. There have been many instances where rockstar took 10 million dollars from people who have 100s of hours invested thats screwing over your playerbase you cant give enough free dlc to make that right. DO NOT BUY unless you want to play singleplayer. Gta 5 is a great game worth the money but Gta online is NOT. Basically unless you have a large group of friends to play gta online with you and help you get started dont play gta online But buying the game just for the campaign is still worth the 60 price tag.I hope this helps you decide.
