When people vote without knownig all the facts this happens... Ive seen it already several times in Steam sadly.If you are out of the loop, basically, TakeTwo Rockstar Games publisher issued a Cease  Desist on a popular filemodificationtool, OpenIV. So now peoples are off  and say this is antimodding, and we all know how much people like mods and free stuffs. What people might or might not know is that this tool was used for singleplayer modding, yes, but it was also THE tool you would use for online cheats.Maybe it is unfair to punish players that dont cheat in online mode but use mods only in single player, but as always, one does the harm, and another bears the blame.Imho, any action against cheats, hacks, etc will only get the game better.I am pretty sure that 95 of the new bad reviews didnt even know about the OpenIV, they just red some antimodding comments and started to comment as well... Thats how things work around here anyway. yes, the other 5 are the actual cheaters.And because this is supose to be a review about the game, not about the devs, nor publishers. This is my opinion about the gameIt is not the best GTA of the serie, but this game is very recommended. The single player campaign is great. If you are a fan of the saga and played and liked the rest of GTAs, you are going to like this game.And for the first time, thank you R, GTA Online. An online GTA game! Ive been waiting a long time for this. You will love this mode, especially with friends to play with Ive been told. Very fun despite the hackers and cheaters you find from time to time. Maybe now without the hack tool OpenIV, things will get better.
