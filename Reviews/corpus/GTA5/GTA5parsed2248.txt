Money Grab. Rockstar is overpricing everything in game in order to get shark card purchases. Would take months to get everything from one dlc and they keep adding more and more. Somewhat pay to win because the items from a new dlc are much better/stronger/more efficient then the previous dlc. It was fun but now is just  with all the flying cars and stupid sht, feels more like a futuristic shooter than GTA.
