Every online game I have been a part of so far has had modders causing havoc.Some guy thats level 475 will hound me all over the map with a rocket firing jetpack, or a missile firing flying car, or a flying bike. Or just straight up snipe me with exploding bullets.Simply put, this game is near impossible to play online as a normal and casual player and it is for that reason and that reason alone that I give GTA V a negative review with a deep sense of resentment. Im just relieved I bought this game during a sale and not full price.
