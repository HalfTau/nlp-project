I got this game with my friends and we played it quite a bit, but after a while it gets really boring and you start to realize that its just a massive grindfest that isnt really fun. Open play was not enjoyable not only because of the scriptkiddies running around wrecking everything but also because just about everyone else in the servers were hostile. With every new update that adds content you start to realize that the prices of the new content get higher and higher so you would either need to grind/mod/buy Shark Cards in order to enjoy the new content. But we all know they just want you to buy the shark cards. Thats why theyve done away with the modding. Because as long as people are cheating in money they cant make a quick buck. Honestly, I loved this game. But it just gets really stale. I wanted to like it, I really did. But its apparent that Take Two just want your money.
