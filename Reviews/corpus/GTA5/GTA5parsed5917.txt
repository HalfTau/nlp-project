But, as previously stated, GTAOnline could be incredible if they would just lower the God Damn price of things.for ingame currency you shouldnt be having to spend MORE than the Worth of the intial game purchase. 59.99 is much too expensive for gtas8million.more realistically, i propose gta8mil should be 8!.1 x gta1000000
