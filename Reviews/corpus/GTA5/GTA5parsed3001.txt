Love this game so much. Everything about it is amazing, except theres one very obvious problem... modders. Modders are in about 1 in every 710 sessions, and they are really annoying. Good thing is if you see one, you can just look for a new clean session, but still its pretty annoying. Besides that, this game is amazing! Overall I rate a 9/10, would be 10 if it wasnt for modders .
