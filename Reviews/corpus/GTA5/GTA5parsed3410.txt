We all know GTA and we all can say it is an incredible game. But rockstar doesnt really care about the online gaming. They can not avoid cheaters somehow. Cheaters will always keep cheating in this game, there is no way. You can even get killed or get cash from random cheaters in your server. And rockstar would say you are a cheater just because that cheater gave you all that money. Gameplay is generally good but the way rockstar handle players is nothing like good. Plus, you can not really change it into something you want, the custom servers are very buggy I mean. Even the GTASA has a lot modded versions like MTASA or SAMP but this one, couldnt really turn into something like that.
