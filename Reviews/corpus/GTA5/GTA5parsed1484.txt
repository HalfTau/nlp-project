Best R game so far. Awsome singleplayer, story, weapons and cars. The online is also awsome, but it has some issues by far, the worst thing is that the player cannot sell his garages, apartments, bunkers or facilitys i hate that i have 6 places to start missions from/resupply/see the cars etc. sometimes, you can trade a garage when you buy another one, but thats not the point. you should be able to sell it also, we need this feature because some places/business are very bad and you cant tell that at first i bought a lot of things that i hate and i wish i could turn back time. please R, make that happen. another thing that i dont like are modders/ hackers/whatever you wanna call them a lot of them are ruining the lobbys and killing the UX. third and the last the players movements could be better. I mean, running, left/right the overall opinion is that the player is very very clumsy.Buuut, overall, a game that worth the money.
