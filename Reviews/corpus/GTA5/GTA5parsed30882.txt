Welp...they listened. They actually listened to what we said, cuz what we said wasnt at all positive. But hey, its gone away and OpenIV is back and I can full heartedly recommend this game to any and all. Modders online can be a problem but other than that it is an almost perfect game. One of the very few games which I could give 89/10. Play it, otherwise youre missing out. The story is brillant, well told and using 3 characters to tell one story is a brilliant idea and perfectly executed and the modding scene, oh dear lord the modding scene is wonderful. Native trainer is a must have once youve completed the story. The soundtrack is beautiful and the radio adds that little bit of life to Los Santos. This is also aided by the tons of life thats added to the town and surrounding areas which give it life.
