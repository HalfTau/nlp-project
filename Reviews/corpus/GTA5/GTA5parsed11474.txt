Just leaving this here to help balance out the reviews a little bit. This is a mostly a singleplayer review, screw online.GTA V is one of the best sandbox games Ive ever played. the story is entertaining and the characters and performances are superb. The gameplay is a step up from GTA IV in most aspects although I personally miss the car handling of GTA IV. GTA V driving feels too arcadey in most places but is none the less enjoyable.Cops can be a pain in thesometimes, but they still make for fun car chases until they blast you with 500000 bullets and you respawn and begin the process again. DGTA V offers a lot of ways to keep you entertained, singleplayer can get boring once youve done everything but its still fun to occasionally hop on and go on a shooting spree or even just to drive around. I tend to roleplay different scenarios as I go, makes it quite fun.Personally I avoid online like the plague, there are far too many cheaters and almost everything is a slow and boring grind unless you have a few friends to play with and enjoy the experience, or alternatively buy into shark card microtransactions which are not really worth it in my opinion, to each their own however. Public sessions are a mess, hackers, morons and children run rampant and love nothing more than to blow you up because they can.
