Was a good game once upon a time, and still is if you only care about single player, However the online multiplayer is trash now. Filled to the brim with hackers rockstar does nothing about, no good way to earn cash that doesnt require other people working with you which sucks since everyone is an  or an idiot. To top it off, money is a grind fest to get and everything is ing expensive as hell. Game is damn near forcing you to spend more real world money or grind hours of your life away in boring missions for money to have the cool things in this game. on top of that the game can take as long as 35 min in real time to load between missions. Have to downvote this one. Get yourtogether rockstar
