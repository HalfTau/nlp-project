60 for 8million in game currency... that wont even buy you the most expesive super yacht... for the orignal sale price. This wouldnt be so bad if it was optional, but even the most skilled crews would be hard pressed to earch more than 150k per hour each. Thats 53 hours of gameplay for 1 cosmetic unlock. ON TOP OF ALL OF THE ABOVE THEY ACTIVILY FORCING YOU TO NOT PLAY SINGLEPLAYER!!!! no single player updates in almost 4 years, most of the end game vehicals buildings and yachts are only available in multiplayer are hundreds of hours of gameplay or real . AND Take Two Interactive The Parent Company of Rockstar is now attacking the modding scene by activily targeting its creators and the mods themselves. THESE MODS ARE THE ONLY WAY TO USE THE END GAME VECHICALS NOT IN MULTIPLAYER!!! !This is a great game ruined by a bad greedy business model.
