Ask me 6 months ago and I would have said, Yes, Id recommend this game.Now that the publisher, Take Two, has decided Single Player Mods are no longer allowed, I would most certainly NOT recommend this game to anyone. They state that the single player modding tool is a threat to the safety of the GTAO community.Note They say this while modders/hackers are RAMPANT in GTAO. Good job guys.
