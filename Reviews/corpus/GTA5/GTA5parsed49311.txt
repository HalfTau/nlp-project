OpenIV is back!I want to believe Rockstar had something to do with this. Take2 is the suspect here. Rockstar was always positive about modding Think GTA 3/VC with playerskins. Now we can finally enjoy single player the way we want!OLD POSTIm sorry Rockstar.. but your publisher is an ahole. Ruining the game for us who prefer to play single player. Uninstalled. Oh I preordered GTA V btw.. wont be doing the same for the next installment until Im sure it can be modded. Thank Take2 for that. I dont recommend this game anymore.Bury the hatchet plays
