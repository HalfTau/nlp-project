Ive put only about 200 hours in this version, but about 400 hours in FIveM using GTAV. But now since apparently its illegal to mod, all of the fun is going to be taken away. No more single player flying around as iron man shooting cars. No more changing to a monkey and walking down the highway with a minigun ripping into cars. Just plain ol boring a single player bland gameplay.Way to shoot yourself in the foot!
