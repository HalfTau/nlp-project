Ive played GTA V for well over 2000 hours across xbox 360, PS3, and PC. having purchased 2 copies for PS3, one for 360m and one for PC I can certainly say I love the game. but take 2 has really crossed the line this time. They have been ing with the game for the worse for years, raising prices and pushing their shark cards, and they are destroying the company. But now banning OpenIV, a piece of software created to mod OFFLINE GTA has dropped to a new low and I myself wont stand for it. They have gotten to be so petty as to ban offline mods thinking it will bolster their online sales for their extremely overpriced content that I personally dont believe is anywhere near worth it. If you want GTA, dont bother, it isnt worth it anymore, take 2 has destroyed what was once an amazing thing.EDITEven with OPEN IV coming back, some, they still screwed up, and they havent met all promises from the past such as single player DLC, and the prices are still too insanely high. The game will always have a place in my heart, but i cant bring myself to recommend it at this time.
