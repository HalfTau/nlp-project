Absolutely love the game. The recent updates have made it more and more fun.But it would seem Rockstar and Take Two are more interested in finding endless ways to milk Shark Cards out of players, and sending CDs to innocent modding teams instead of banning cheaters.I definitely think the game is good, but this shoddy business model and modding policy CANNOT continue.
