I have Played GTA since the days of the top down game. GTA 3 was the point in which it made this game a Franchise. I remember Liberty city and had the city memorized...After the comments of T2 it feels completely wrong for some one to support them.Do I belame them for there comments NOWhy as others EA,Ubi, and countless others treat gamers like cash cows. They dont create games for the educated consumer but they pray on the young children where mommy and daddy will had over the credit card to shut their kid up.  if your my age think pogz or pokemon cardsI also belame us, the gamers for accepting this BS. Look EA releases a new madden every year, it the same damn game, and ppl buy it for 60 bucks or more...If we were smart we gamers wouldnt pay for it, make them offer new rosters as dlc for 20 bucks instead, untill they really change the game..Also please note  every time you buy ditigal content with cash, the company makes 1000 profit as it takes the dev team minimal effort to make it.So the Question is how do we change it? We need to take responsibility, which seems lost in the world today.And We must demand more from the game company and have legal repoisbilitys to the comsumer. I can bet that you local goverment probably does even know how toxic the bussiness practices are in the gaming industry. We have no rights with early access games, they can say one thing and never delivery and if they dont high tale it out of the game once cash grab is done, what ever they deliver is totally incomplete.All the BestBallsinacan
