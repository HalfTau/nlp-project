It is impossible to say anything good about this game after what Take Two has done to the modding scene of this game. The game shows what happens when a company is only interested about squeezing every penny they can get out of a game. Theyre trying to draw people to GTA Online which over the last 18 months has been completely ruined by microtransactions by banning modding on the singleplayer. This is unbelieveably scummy and Take Two must be told that this is unacceptable.
