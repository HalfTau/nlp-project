singleplayer is great, my GOTY when it was released on old gen,  TLOU  Bioshock Infinite.nobody buys it for that thoThe online is buggy, riddled with  UI, AI, Hackers, wait times and game modes that arent worth doing, arent fun and dont work  ultimately, modes that arent played  I havent done a race or a deathmatch in over 2 yearsyou should see it for what it is  at this point its an MMO, not something you can just goof off in like GTA4s multiplayer, tho you can still do that.So with that the only ways someone can have fun in online is with friends or by treating it like runescape lul. thats my explanation for my hourshacked cash is also a thing, people get banned some dont do what you will with that info
