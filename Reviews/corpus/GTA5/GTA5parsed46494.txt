Since the latest update, population on servers appear to have dropped. I am not loving the recent update personally.Because modders in the Online Sessions dropped cash on people prior to new update, RockStar wiped clear many character accounts of not only cash given, but cash earned or even purchased with SharkCards.The single player mode now greatly affected by the banning of Take Two.Cloud Sync Issues this morning gave me the time to write this review.
