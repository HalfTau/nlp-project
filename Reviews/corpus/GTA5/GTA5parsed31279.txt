This game is pretty good. However, you cant mod it anymore as take two has decided to basically ban mods. What that means is you will only be able to play the game in vanilla form. I am upset about their decision as I did use some mods, including the LSPDFR mod and the Redux Mod. So basically, if you are into vanilla gaming, then go buy GTA V. If you are planning on buying GTA V for modding, then stay away from it, as you will not be able to mod the game at all.Update 6/24/17 OpenIV has been brought back up. I am not kidding. Rockstar and Take Two decided to bring back Single Player Modding! After over 70,000 people signed an online petition to bring back modding, they decided to bring it back. Here is a link to a news article that explains everything.
