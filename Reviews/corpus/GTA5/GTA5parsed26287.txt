Played this for 500 hours the game WAS awesome but last week the game was destroied by TakeTwo nowadays its If you see this review at time this game is on sale DO NOT ING BUY THIS Like i said earlier I ve played it for 500 hours and I managed to get to 120 level and unlocked basicly nothing. But one day cheater came to our lobby and gave us money ......Rockstar banned us for 30 days. For these 30 days I have been modding in SP it was fun. But now SP modding in illegall. I ve got my accout reseted and then I started playing again. But there is a BIG problem in this game. Every new update is more expensive then the previous one. If you want to get every thing in this new update it will cost you like 40 milions of GTA. For a standard job youll get around 30 thousand. And modders can have 90m15m in ONE SECOND, this game is ed. Two weeks the game has 96 possitive rating. Now it has 63, 13 possitive in last 30 days. Even flash game is better rated. So please do not buy this game they will only rip you off. 8M in this game cost 75 and you can buy like 3 cars and 1 house and thats all. You will pay 3060 for this game and you need to give em another 100150 so you can enjoy the whole game. So why would you pay that much to enjoy 2015 game that is not optimizated that good like you would expect. And the conclusion is that if you dont cheat you will not enjoy the game that much but if you cheat you will enjoy it but you will probably get banned. I did not get banned .
