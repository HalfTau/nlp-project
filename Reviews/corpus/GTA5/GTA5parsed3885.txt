Games great if you want to play singleplayer. There is not so many ingame possibilities in comparision to previous GTAs, but the plot is really interesting.Multiplayer is unprofessional crap with the worst community worse than cs! full of wannabe gangster children, with ingame purchases.I play another games for multiplayer, bought GTA V for single player so thumb up. But I understand thumbs down for bans f.e. cheater throws money at you, so you get ban forever without any reply and ultra potato servers.
