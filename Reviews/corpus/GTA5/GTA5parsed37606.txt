Only way to send a message to rockstar/take two is to not purchase anything more from them for their complete disrespect to the modding community. Truth is mods make games relevant long after people are bored of them some developers realize that by adding in mod support. Rockstar has been against mods by not making their game mod friendly which is really dumb logic as the fans of the game are the modders. Want an online mode...fine but ignoring singleplayer dlc altogether this go around has hurt the franchise making... you guessed it mods more important.I hate this day n age that we dont actually own the game at all were basically leasing it to play at the developers whim of how they chose.  Some say well its free dlc yeah free mykind of silly when the amphibious little four wheeler costs over 1million... like wtf is it made of unobtanium. Want to sell shark cards.. fine do so but dont jack up prices so crazy that people have to grind like mad to even get anything worthwhile so their pressured into buying virtual currency.  Hackers abusing glitches is what has ruined online not the mods anyone knows that. Glitches.. yes the ones rockstar introduced to the game rushing all that new free content is really the villian here not openiv.
