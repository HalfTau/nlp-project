An overall really good game. Its GTA 5..... open world do what ever you want, story is pretty good and i love trevor. Fun gameplay mechanics, the vehicle mechanics are really good. Online these days is dead, everything cost to much money, and when you finally get everything paid off, another DLC will take over again and its the same thing all the time.
