I am making this review because of the recent news that Rockstar and other companies associated with the creation of GTA V have asked Open IV, a tool essential to modding the game to stop making the tool and basically shut it down. I liked the game, but about 60 of why I switched to PC was to mod GTA V, and now that isnt being supported so have no reason to play this game and this whole situation is making me hate the developers.GIVE US OUR GAME BACK!! !P.S  Make a negative review saying something similar and how this change has affected you. Share it with your friends to get the word out and make the modding community rise again! !
