I loved Grand Theft Auto and many other rockstar products and being able to mod my game is what made replaying worth it if it wasnt nostalgia, i tried GTA online and for a time inliked it but then the grinding got boring and left but now Rockstar and TakeTwo interactive declare modding illegal? Were thet born ? Modding is where your income comes from because come on, not everyone wants to buy a ing shark card and to shut down Open IV not only is that a slap in the face to us gamers and modders but you just ing hurt your reputation and Profit and i thought EA and Activision were bad, on behalf of both communities, go take a nice long hard think on yourbecause you are in a deep ing hole.
