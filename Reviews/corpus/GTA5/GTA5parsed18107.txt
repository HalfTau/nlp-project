I already WORKED for the REAL MONEY, and bought this game.  WHY am I having to WORK MORE, just to PLAY..!?Just go get into some other F2P / P2W game.  This one has a retail price, for some strange reason...I mean, it was fun when it came out the first time.  Hackers putting 2 billion bounties on people randomly...  there was nothing more exciting than seeing every dot on the map suddenly turn and start chasing the bountiful bounty...  So much money, though.  Many would eventually split the massive amount of glitched money around the other players on the map.  Hell  Not like I even needed the 30 billion that would pile up on me.But, that would only land many player in virtual jail, if even just receiving said glitched money.  Even a phone call to Rockstar support wouldnt change this.  I tell ya, being treated like a pseudocriminal is one thing, but for the very people I PAID for the experience, to treat an honest and faithful customer of many years like a REAL criminal....  Absolutely DISGUSTING.Yes, I am bitter.  May always be, at this rate.  If the game couldve just merited a little more attention OFFLINE a.k.a. where I dont have to fear the Rockstar Police, then I might feel a bit more offbase with a Not Recommended review.  However, this game is only getting development with the Online portion.  And that is quite literally a Paytoplay structure.  Gameplay Online is severely reliant upon having the GTA to afford nearly every aspect of the game.  Even other players can easily cost you money without even being cheaters.  Just the typical griefing of online MP.My final thought on this game online, which is all that counts to Rockstar, is the same thought I had countless times when playing, and struggling for cash to afford even some casual playing.....I already WORKED for the REAL MONEY, and bought this game.  WHY am I having to WORK MORE, just to PLAY..!?
