Pros Good singleplayer campaign. Decent graphics. Fun but limited online heists.Cons Hackers rampant in GTA Online. Rockstar inflating in game pricing to combat hackers and creating a grindfest for legit players. Singleplayer modding arbitrarily deemed illegal by Take2 this games publisher. Shark Cards. Unrewarding and redundant online mission design and gameplay. Forced public lobbies to play new content. Rockstar punishing legit players who happen to receive modded currency out of their control in aforementioned public lobbies.Conclusion Not really worth the price for the single player campaign and certainly not worth it for the Online mode unless you love grinding away doing the same missions over and over again to maybe afford a new vehicle with absurdly inflated prices blatantly designed to pressure players to buy Shark cards. Newer players will have quite a few hills to climb in order to enjoy any of the newer content in GTA Online which has thus far been a major deterrent to any of my friends that Ive actually convinced to get this game and try it.
