I would have recommended GTA to anyone. But not anymore. Shark cards are understandable. Free DLC, less interference, yes the system was a bit greedy, but it kept everything balanced. But TakeTwo Interactive have bumped it up. As time went on, in game online prices soared. GTA youtubers took advantage of kids to milk them for as much as they could. Now, this. The sole reason I bought GTA V for PC was to play mods. My purchase is now worthless. Rockstar is innocent. Dont blame them. Blame TakeTwo. Sign this, even a single signature counts.
