I used to love this game, had a lot of really good moments in it.  Now admittedly, I DID hack the game a couple times before, but after the 2nd temp ban 3rd one is perm ban, I decided to stop so as to not end up throwing away the 60 I spent on it.  So I tried playing legit from that point forward, and still managed to enjoy it plenty, but eventually got tired of how painfully grindy it was to earn GTA and RP legitamately.  However, this time, instead of resorting back to hacks I chose to just take a break until I was more willing to put up with it.  Fast forward a couple of months, I start up the game and try to connect to GTAO, only to see that damned You have been permanantly banned. screen pop up despite me finally deciding to try and play legit.  So, against my better judgement, I bought the game again.  The same damn cycle repeated.  I resorted to hacking again, and after the second ban removed the hacks to play legit, and this time I wasnt planning on taking a break.  So I played through some jobs, earned some GTA and RP, and again got perma banned even though I stopped hacking.  Shortly after this I noticed that the reviews for this game had dropped significantly.  Apparently even the people who played legit from the start and didnt hack even once unlike me, who didnt stop until it was my last chance were getting banned left right and center.  I made a bad decision from the start, and I regret that, but the fact that even legit players are getting banned and having money outright stolen from their accounts?  I WAS planning on repurchasing the game one last time when it went on sale, but from what Ive seen and heard normally Id say that its probably just haters, but the sheer number of these kinds of reviews kinda disproves that theory, well... itll have to be a damn good sale.  Seriously, Rockstar needs to get their crap toghether.
