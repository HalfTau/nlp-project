TakeTwo Interactive says no to mods. They are some greedy  B A S T A R D S  for that.I guess that 3 Bilion  is not enough for them.I understand that mods that are able to cheat money and insta kill players are bad, but, dont treat the people like this that have bought the game. Some have bought the game up to 3 times.I bought it on PC to mod. PS3 to play the game and XBOX ONE to play the game with better grafics.You bought the game and if you want to mod the singelplayer mode, then you should be able to do that !You dont own the game any more.If you own GTA V, and you love modding the game, say goodbye to modding all games that TakeTwo have published.If you dont own GTA V, dont buy it. You give them money for the game and you cant do anyting than play singelplayer and then go to online that in my experience have only been grinding to be able to buy cars, houses, clothing, weapons, car upgrades and so on.And the online mode is a micro transaction piece of  S H I T.I dont play GTA Online because of that.Only Offline with mods.The price of the game is still expensive since it came out on Steam 14 apr, 2015.
