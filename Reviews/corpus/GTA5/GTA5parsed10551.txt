Its a great game that can be incredibly fun, but unfortunately I cannot say Id recommend it.GTA OnlineAfter all these years it still has issues with loading into online jobs or sessions and hanging loading screens.Public sessions are full of bloodlusty, angry teenagers and the occasional modder that never gets caught.The cost for most vehicles and infrastructure is much too high, turning it into a real a nonstop grindfest for .Wouldnt be surprised at all if these prices were picked with the intent of promoting Shark Cards.Really needs friends to play with to get the most fun out of it.GTA V SingleplayerAbsolutely great game, not much to be said there.
