i thought they overdid it when they killed multiplayer mods but i understood saying its ok as long as i can mod single player. But now they are even trying to kill that. wanting to kill one thing thats making their game sell so much is a ludicrous decision and should be frowned upon. i will change my review if they stop attacking mod creators.EDIT they reverted back to what it was before. so there for i recommend this game again.
