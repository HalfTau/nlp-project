Honestly, this was a good game, but not allowing modding is down right stupid. I played the story, bought all the cars, all the houses, and now theres nothing left except to play through mods to make it fun again. Without mods this game is a one trick pony and not worth the money unless you are willing to pay 60 to play a 2040 hour game.
