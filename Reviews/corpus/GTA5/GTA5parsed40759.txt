Even without the modding thing, this game is dead. If you havent played the single player, go back to 2012. If you want a quality multiplayer online experience, you wont find it here. If you dont have mommys credit card hooked up to your account or you dont have hacked money there is very little fu to be had in this game anymore, seeing as though rockstar has decided, hey, lets center the game around updates which include tons of new gimmicky that cost ridiculous amounts of money and make it so that the only way to further enjoy the game is to buy these increasingly expensive toys. The game is it isnt half the fun it was on release and its on a fast decline.
