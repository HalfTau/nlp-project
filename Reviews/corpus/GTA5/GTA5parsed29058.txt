TakeTwo, the parent company of this game, sent a cease and desist to the modding tool thats the backbone for almost all mods. The mod only works in single player, and they said they did it to prevent multiplayer hacking.Oh, the CEO also said they werent making enough money off of the players.So we all know they did it to push players into DLCplastered multiplayer to shove microtransactions down their throats.They also did this midE3 hoping it would get drowned out. Nope. Piece ofcompany. Dont buy any TakeTwo games.
