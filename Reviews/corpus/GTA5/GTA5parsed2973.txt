Unless you have a helicopter and 1 mil penthouse in real life, its going to be a full time job for the work of getting them ingame. You need to grind repetitive missions in order to buy an apartment so that you can grind some more to get a bunker so that you can grind some more endlessly. Everything costs way too much. Its just a scheme to get you to buy those shark cards. Dont recommend it.
