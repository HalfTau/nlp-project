500 hours, would not reccomend. Rockstar is a good company but theyre throwing all their chips into online play which is fine but their stance on modding is hindering single player which is how this franchise began. Given the current stance in online and the ever moving push for players to buy their card sharks while power creep is a major concern I would skip this.
