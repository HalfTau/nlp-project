GTA V is fun, but online there is some people do a lot of hacking, gliching, and a lot of cheating. I try to avoid a lot of hackers, because they can take money from you and you can go bankrupt pretty fast. The anticheat thing needs more improvement, because so far it really not stoping the hackers and doesnt make the game fun. So far the game is fun I would rate this 9.4/10.
