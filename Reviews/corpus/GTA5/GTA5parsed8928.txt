Firstly if you gonna play this game for its story mode ignore this review its a great SINGLE player game with a nice story!Now if you interested to start playing online you will have lots of problems modders/cheaters rule the game that means they can dominate kill use scripts and bugs. That sometimes makes you lose items that you PAID.  I lost all my ammo and some  weapons idk if its R fault or the game destroyed by the hackers and i dont really care am really sad that i sold my csgo skins to invest things in this. I highly dont recommend you to play this game for its online mod dont waste ur time there are so many other great games to play with.    ALSO ROCKSTAR should be ashamed because she owns the 3rd best selling gamein the world and instead trying to fix modders and other critical bugs that ruins the game preparing DLCs
