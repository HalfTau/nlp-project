GTA V has been a hilariously awful experience. Between poor optimization, boring online, and weak singleplayer writing I have never had a worse experience for 60 dollars. Why did I play 80 hours? Because even though Rockstar are so insanely stupid about mods, I downloaded several of JulioNIBs mods and they completely saved the game for me, between Flash and Iron Man I had a blast rampaging through the military base and police forces and playing the story as various superheroes and villains. I enjoyed the combat aspects of the game but without mods I would have refunded this game in a heartbeat. Good potential, but I wouldnt have paid 10 bucks for the game I got without mods.
