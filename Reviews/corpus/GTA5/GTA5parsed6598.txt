I could write a really long review about how amazing GTA V is, but I think everyone knows how amazing it is! The single player is one of the best story campaigns ive ever played, long and full of hollywood style explosions. The online is so much fun with friends, I know people complain about the money of GTA online being hard to obtain, its really not though. So I would rate it 9/10 100 would recommend at full price!
