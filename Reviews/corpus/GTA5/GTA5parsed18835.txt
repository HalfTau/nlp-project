This game has a very fun singleplayer mode. The multiplayer is also pretty fun when it decides to work. But lately its pretty bad. I end up quitting because I get so frustrated and I am nearly bald at that point from pulling out all my hair and I like my hair. But if you like a good single player game this is a good one for ya.
