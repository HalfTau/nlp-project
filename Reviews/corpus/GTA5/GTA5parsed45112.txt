was great at first but one of the main reasons i play GTAV is for the single player, DLC support is trash for singleplayer, so everyone looks towards mods to jazz up their singleplayer experiance. may it be accessing online only cars in single player or adding new cars completly. LSPDFR was what gta had become to me and Take Two took it away from us. Its never good when a game company attacks its mod community keeping it alive.please sign below to save open IV.
