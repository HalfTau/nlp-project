I bought the game on my other account have like 150h i bought a controller to play and i also bought a copy for my 2 friends just so they could play with me, I played with them for like 20h after that i got banned for a month it got me superoff coz there was literally no reason why i got banned after 2 months i played the game again with my friends and on the next day i got pernamently banned. I wrote a long email to rockstar they told me that bans are a pernament thing and cant be revoked. After a year i bough this game AGAIN just to play the game with my friends last time i played it was like a month ago in December 2017, rn i have about 130h in game. The game was on sale and i also added a shark card coz Starting all over is a waste of time. I had 8mil for the start did alot of missions coz i wanted to buy some stupid flying car.This is the total cash i earned so far. Today i Logged in and recieved a Nice welcoming message from rockstar  Rockstar had deducted your cash by 535k. Well played rockstar. All i did in that game was heists and some other dumb stuff. I got very annoyed coz i spend my own hard earned money on a stupid scam company. Wouldnt reccomend buying this game, its alot of fun when youre playing with friends but its a waste of money. If you like being scammed then sure buy the game. Rockstar support, More like Rockscam Support.
