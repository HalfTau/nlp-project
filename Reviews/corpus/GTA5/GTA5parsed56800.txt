You buy the game for 40, then they make online such a grind to get money and try to make it pay to play with micro transactions. Micro transactions might be acceptable if they where at a reasonable price, but 60 for 8 million  which gets you no where in game, if you wanted to but everything in game your looking at spending over 600  THATS RIDICULOUS!! !So if you buy this game, you lose 40, and if you play online to become rich and powerful you lose thousands of hours doing repeat missions.Since Gunrunning DLC they have become more greedy banning mods in offline mode in offline you should have the right do whatever the hell you want!.
