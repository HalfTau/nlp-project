Block the mods in singleplayer and give this game no replayability, good job Rockstar. Next time make your  game not able to be modded online! Stop being selfish and how about you donate the billions of dollars your make a year to charity yourselfs its because of them you get that much playerbase on your 4 year old game....... You used to be good developers but money changed you.
