I bought this game for 40. yeah, a bit pricey, but I knew Id enjoy it. I have spent about 4hrs in GTA online, it doesnt float my boat. I have spent alot of time in single player, yes, using mods, and I love them.but T2 said NO. This game is nothing to me without mods. Thats the experience I want it for.
