Goddamn this game. Its gameplay, graphics, optimalization are AWESOME but the community and Rockstars themselves... Lets put it like this. When the online came out in 2014 on PS3 it was great a lot of fun and no need to spend DAYS grinding to even have some fun. People could hang out, someone hacked the lobby so everyone had money and everyone was happy. Prices were reasonable you could actually get money for them and the objective of the game was having fun. Then port on next gens 11/2014 the game started to go to I mean they completely leftout old gen players after some time and started to release more and more DLCs. Which is awesome and they were and still are free but prices in those DLCs were AND STILL ARE absolutely insane. In order for you to have fun you need to play the game a lot and play it in the way of repeating the same thing all over again mostly office work. Unless you have mod menu which if you do, you are a  and ruining the game or have a lot of real money, you need to spend hundreds of hours in the boring part of the game. And now the objective of online is not having fun but for most people getting money especially when new DLC comes out. As said previously there is a 90 that in your session is a modder. He/she doesnt have to be doing some insane stuff but for instance just simple invincibility so he can destroy your cargo all day. The community ahh how to put it, well MOM WHERE IS YOUR CREDIT CARD?!. Also people in this game are mostly they will try to tackle you in all meanings. I have played this game on PS3, PS4 and PC and I have to say that on PS3 I had the most fun of these all. Even tho I practically pointed out only the bad stuff, there is a lot of fun playing it so I cant not recommend it. I will, you will find the good things yourself. So buy it.
