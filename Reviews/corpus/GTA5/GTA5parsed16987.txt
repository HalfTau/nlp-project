Horrible mod support and no attention given to expanding on the single player mode. Ever so often there rolls out a huge update for the online mode, which Ive only played a couple times and have no intention of ever touching again. Online updates are mandatory and cannot be switched off, so they keep cluttering up my harddrive. Only purchase if you intend to play online with hackers, or offline with no hopes of extra content ever being added.Probably the last Grand Theft Auto game I ever buy.
