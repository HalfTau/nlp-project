this review is based around gta online and how it was ruined after 3 years ofdlc the newest one adds planes that can drop bombs i had no way to defend myself noteven homing rockets worked becuase the planes had flaresand forget about having fun playing this game unless you buy shark cards even though this game is 60 ing dollars they still have microtransactoins in this god forsaken game i would rather play big rig racers than play gta online again this is my final time ever playing gta online becuase of these  wannabe fast and the furious dlc
