GTA Online loading screen simulator and hackerfest due to p2p based networking. Takes forever for job lobbies to fill up because of horrible matchmaking. Im sure I spent 30 of my logged hours in loading screens and waiting for matchmaking. Overinflated price because of corporate greed to push shark card sales. Godawful customer support, response time measured in months.Singleplayer its good, but no SP DLC in sight. Potential for new content in terms of mods or otherwise basically nonexistent now after Take Two expressed their hostility toward the entire modding community.But really, dont get it unless you really like the singleplayer or can put up with the toxic online communities, grind for virtual cash and ridiculous loading and waiting times.Also, your hardwork in GTAO could be undone in an instant from temp bans, which removes everything you own without a chance for appeal. Shouldnt be an issue if you dont cheat, but if youre the unlucky sod who get falsely banned for reasons you dont even know, well sucks to be you then, since all bans are final. Have fun with that.
