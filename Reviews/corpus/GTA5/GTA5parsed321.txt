One thing  GRINDFESTIm a Warframe player, perhaps thatll ring a bell. Ding ding, yes, its more grindy than Warframe.Aside for the grind, Its good. I played with some friends. Soloonline? No, as I mentioned above, too grindy. And....toxic.In my current state, I can make 1 million in about 24 hours of boring repetitive mission.Meanwhile, I need 5 to 10 million to get thing that I want.Okay maybe thats an high end thing. Then lets talk about early game.Armored Kuruma and CEO which is essential early is around 900k  1 millionWhile your ideal max income with various mission and trick is around 50k per half hour.Fyi, those crazy sht race /TDM/ other mission that you saw on youtube only gives like 1020k.TLDRGrind is okay for me, while this game have grindfest worst than WF. Its okay if you play with friends. Its not okay if you play solo online.VerdictRecommended, but be wary of things you heard about GTAV because most of the are right.
