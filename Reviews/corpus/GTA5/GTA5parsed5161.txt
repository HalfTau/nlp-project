God damned game is a piece of I have a couple hundred hours on this game on PS4. I recently bought GTA V during the winter sale thinking that I could transfer my account to my PC. Turns out Rockstar removed that feature in early March 2017. I was thining that I would finally be able to play this game with all my friends who love playing this game. Well guess I cant. I of course am going to get this game refunded. But anyway,  you Rockstar.
