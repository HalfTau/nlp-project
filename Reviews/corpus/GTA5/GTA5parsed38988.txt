372 Hours spent playing this game and I can tell you this Dont waste your time.Current PR issues aside, heres what it comes down to GTA V single player is great. GTAO spits in the face of every pereson who was unfortunate enough to give rockstar their money.My biggest gripes areNo dlc makes it over to single player.Purchases in SP cost pennies but in GTAO the same purchase can cost millionsOnline currency, while not impossible to make, is very scarce they do this to encourage microtansactionsHiest matchmaking is a joke. You either wait 2 hours or join a quick match and wind up with idiots who die twice and then quit leaving you stuck for another 30 minutes.This game would be a great free game for someone but it isnt worth what anyonew is gonna pay for it in its present state
