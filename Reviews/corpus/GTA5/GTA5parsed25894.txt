Ive been a fan of this series my ENTIRE life. Infact not just GTA but all of rockstars works of art. Red dead being the finest of the bunch in my opinion. Anyways, the mod ban and horrid condition of online and its content have caused me to hate GTA 5. After playing over 500 plus hours including my time with console i can say nothing good of this game past its release. Ever since its been a steady decline until its finally dropped off now. This used to be one of the greatest video games of all time. Now its a laughing stock for hackers and full of content neglect. Fix this rockstar. Tell take two its time to hit the road with their  before you leave with your amazing work yourselves.
