This game is amazing and after 300 hours in this game I would usually recommend it. Although for some reason my entire account including my game somehow dissapeared and I do not event have a social club account anymore. Rockstar support was no help at all saying that I didnt have the game purchased. I am forced to create a new steam account and rebuy the game if I ever want to be able to play it again.
