I tried so hard to play this game again but, in truth its ing boring.The singleplayer is fun the first time round but when you try and play it again its just a bunch of oh ive already done this. Its not fun. The main concern is the multiplayer. The multiplayer is literally the most underwhelming boring piece ofI have ever played in my life. Even GTA RP isnt actually fun at all. With GTA Online there is no objective. You can pretty much have the best stuff if you do all the heists 3 times over. And for when youre not doing missions the online is just a ing huge deathmatch that is just horrendeously repetative. Especially after the Gun Runners update. The races are just boring, the actual driving mechanic is horrifying to say the least. Deathmatch is basically you get money for doing the same thing you would do normally Online. The heists are actually remotely fun as long as youre playing with mates and not taking it all to serious.Shark Cards are ing outrageous too? 59.99 for 8,000,000 when you can make that much in like 2 days? Its a horrendous scam people actually fall for.In conclusion GTA V is one of them games you would tell your mates is fun, then when you all hop on and are all in a game you get bored within half an hour and then switch back to Minecraft and probably request a refund. It was praised for having such an overwhelming world with so much to do. Occasionally you would get back an old ladies purse or rob an armored truck? Its boring, not fun and there are for a game that is now over 3 or 4 years old should not priced at 39.99 19.99 On Sale
