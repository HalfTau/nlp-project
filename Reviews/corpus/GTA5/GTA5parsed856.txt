I absolutely loved this Game! However there is alot, and I mean a massive amount of Modding and Hacking going on in the online portion of the game. I did end up meeting some pretty amazing friends which out weighed most of the bad. My only advice for new players would be to get this game on console if you wish to avoid the cheaters. Remeber have fun and dont stress out you can get better at the game over time!
