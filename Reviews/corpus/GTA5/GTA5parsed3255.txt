Having initially played this game on the PS3, I was blown away by the improvement the PC version offered as the game was far improved framerate wise. I considered this game to be one of the best of the 7th generation of consoles for both multiplayer and single player. The game has since become far too grindy for the multiplayer component, but if you have friends to play with, the game can still be a blast. Regardless the single player component alone is worth the asking price and will go down as one of the best in open world gaming history.
