Singleplayer, i have nothing bad to say about it, the story the gameplay everything is in place.but........GTA Online is just based on Rockstar to make money by Sharkcards, because everything is expensive and you need to waste your life to have cool things.I know, there are cheaters that can give you money, but there are some that are game breaking.If you want single player, and to just have fun with mods offline, then its good, online is also okay, but as I said there is mistakes.
