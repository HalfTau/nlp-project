the story modes in gta have always been the main selling point for the franchise, thi game definently delivers in that respect great charcaters, an amazing story and very good gameplay could not recommend the story mode any more its just outstanding where as the online aspects of the game are mixed gta has always been about gangs, cars, drugs, and money but now its alll shifted into a military game for no good reason and its a real let down. although its highly unlikely, the best thing for this game is to focuse more on the amazing story which deserves more content
