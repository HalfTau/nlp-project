GTA online has so much issues. Tried joining a game and if you cant connect then now you will have to take around 10 minutes to joing the story mode, go back to online and hope you dont get dced.Joining any session takes longer than anything and im on a lan cable with a ssd drive. this is incredibly annoyingYou get kicked out for being idle for 1 minute. I just close the game and check reddit and im already kicked.GTA online is not user friendly and if I didnt have a friend begging me to stay, I wouldve already refunded this trash
