Uninstalled the game from my hard drive the moment I heard about the OpenIV fiasco. Mods were what kept me coming back to this game. Replayability in single player is pretty poor without them.  Only touched the online mode TakeTwo is so desperate to protect a few times. Awful profitfirst grindfest. Overvalued cars and undervalued missions designed to get people to buy shark cards. And by protect I mean selling shark cards, as they refuse to revamp the anticheat and instead ban totally unrelated singleplayer tools.Wont be buying another R or TakeTwo game.
