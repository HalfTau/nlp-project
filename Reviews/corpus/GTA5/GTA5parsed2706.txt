This review is for GTA V Online. The base game is pretty damn good. But GTAO is where people tend to have the most fun.That is if you are totally fine with grinding literal days of your life away to make your first million only to find out that after you bought an office you need a ton more money to actually make money. Its really sad and frusterating to see a game make it so unplayable that you buy GTA with real money. 46 hours in game. Probably about 12 hour in the story. 34 hours online. After 34 hours I just made my first mill. Thats me playing in 46 hour sessions. Mind you I am following all the guides online that all say VIP missions is the way to go this early. Almost 1 1/2 days and I can finally start making money. WAit sorry. need more money to buy a warehouse that holds 11 cargo. But that cargo makes you no money.My friend and I are sick of grinding hours on end just to buy something that is another frusterating grind.
