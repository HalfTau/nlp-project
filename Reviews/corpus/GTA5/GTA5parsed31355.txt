great concept, great game.but horrible. please raise your hand if youve been in the middle of killing someone and LJT calls. Maybe ending up in a server with a person using a hack client? not to be mistaken with modders who make the game more pleasant by adding features. My personal favorite is how you have to steal a car to call your very own car/boat/plane. Otherwise youll be standing on a street corner with a phone that keeps ringing, or until you punk someones car then your mechanic picks up instantly. Dside note its funny how now they are cracking down on hack clients/mods now that its hurting their wallets, but not when it hurts their players. By cracking down on modders essentialy your killing your game, do you think skyrim would be a game people go back to if they didnt have mods/addons. By cracking down on hack clients well... thx but your late to the party by a few years.
