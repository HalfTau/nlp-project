Everyone knows the game and what it is about, so I wont write a review raving over the single player or the immersive world which are still holding up fine after all this years.The thing is that Rockstar a long time ago in game release years dropped the additional single player DLCs in favor of the online which blew up big time.GTA V finally released on the PC and from that day till the current time of this review it is riddled with modders which mess with you either by destroying your gameplay/fun/business or filling everyone in the lobby with money that you never asked for or wanted.But overtime Rockstar/TakeTwo found out that people want an easy way out of the established grindy way of getting some money and released the shark cards which totally coincidently are not affected by the account adjustments for when a modder fill you with money and that money will not be taken away if Rockstar feels like it the other day.In my experience I worked my way to level 60something while leaving every lobby as soon as I saw anything out of the ordinary someone used scripts and have lost countless fun times with other players due to the fear of banning.One day we were 4 people in a players yaght after having completed 4 setups and a guy started putting in our normal accounts not bank 50.000GTA per second.This was the first time that a modder dropped money on me and I was scared  of getting banned so I took a screenshot, altf4 out of GTA, sent a ticket to rockstar with full details modder account name, time, amount recieved.Next day, a canned message arrived from R reassuring me that I wont get banned and that their regular sweeps will adjust my balance.One and a half months later while trying to do my maths so I wouldnt touch the modded money, I caved in.I bought a CEO office, slightly nicer that  what my legit money would have allowed me to get.About three weeks later the bunker update came, R did the adjustments, taking away all the money every last  while giving me 20.000GTA to start my bunker carrier, while bombarding me with all the new content on the map, with notifications, unavoidable telephone calls and ads on the loading screen for shark cards.To be fair I expected this, well I expected it in the first days or weeks and not 2 months later right before the big update.I said, OK, now that I dont have dirty money it is a new start. I worked by the definition of the word for one week every night to get the oppresor because I like bikes and flying in this game. No guns, no bunkers, just the bike for rides in free mode.Then I thought that I have to earn 2mil  as a safenet for weapons and such expenses.I built a steady 2mil  but I lost my interest in the online as I felt that it was getting rediculous by the amount of grindy work you have to do in order to get a new toy and have some limited fun.So from then I have only gone online 2 times and about 1015 times directly to single player just to interact with the beautiful world of Los Santos in peace.Today I wanted to play some single player while listening to my podcast and as soon as I dropped into single player there was a banner over the GPS saying that Rockstar game services have corrected your account by 1973871 which was all the money I had in the bank the 30something thousand in hand are intact.At this stage I really cant care less about GTA online with R shady intents, BS and fundamentally corrupt practises.I bought GTA for the fun I had with every previous title and blind faith to R from their solid track record but GTA V recent direction made me avoid R for now on with their money grabbing techniques.Sure the single player is pretty fine, but R wants you online and actively buying shark cards in order to enjoy this game.The above is for the people that hate this trend of microtransaction on everything, just stay away from this title for your own good. You can spent all this hours on something you genuinely enjoy and love like a game/ your family/ a hobby/ your job, or whatever else. GTA V online unfortunatelly turned overtime into a cancerous monstrosity.I would not recommend it at all, even to the last persons that havent fallen in this Rockstar/TakeTwo rabbit hole.I just wish I hadnt spent all this time on the online believing that everything is possible and achievable just by trying to improve.
