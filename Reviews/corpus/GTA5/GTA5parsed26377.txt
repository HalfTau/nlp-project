BUYER BEWARE ESPECIALLY IF YOURE TEMPTED BECAUSE OF THE SALE!Last night I was caught up in the ban tsunami that hit online. I had money injected directly into my bank account by a modder two months ago and instead of adjusting my account, I was banned and had my characters wiped. The support system is useless and the only thing they stand 100 firm on is BANS ARE FINALE, NO DISPUTING.If youre going to buy this game for single player, its great. If youre going to play online, steer clear. The online environment is still flush with script kiddies that will make the game hell for you. I cannot state this enough... they say in their own KB article about unwanted modded money that they will not ban you, just adjust your account. From what Ive seen, this seems to be about 50/50. Some get adjusted, some get banned.According to my stats, before the ban I got last night, I was 42.4 hrs last two weeks / 4,108.9 hrs on record. And that is where it will stay as I am not going to come back in 30 days to start all the way over. My relationship with R and T2 is officially over.Spend your cash elsewhere and with a company that actually takes cheating issues seriously and has some kind of decent support system.
