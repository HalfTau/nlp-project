Having played over 400 hours on this game, i strongly recommend it. The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is smooth and the storyline is excellent. The Online mode for this game gets regularly updated with new content for its players to experience. This game has tons to offer and is definitely worth the price, Grand Theft Auto V is truly one of the best games I have ever played.
