The Online part of the game is cancer, its 24/7 grind and nothing is rewarding...The loading screens are insane and it usually takes a absurd amount of time just getting inside a game, and when you do it has already started.Community is toxic as .To actually get good stuff in this game you need to work just like in real life...24/7Gr8 game would buy another GTA game...
