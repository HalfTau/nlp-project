Gta 5 is great game, I really enjoy playing it. But, Gta online is soo annoying game! so many hackers and everyone just want to kill you even if you do nothing to them. If you are in a lobby of more then 20 people you can t do any mission, you will simply get destroyed by higher level players or hackers. Only play when you have 23 friends, cause if you will invite any random people for a mission then there are so less chances you going to complete it properly.
