Im hearing now rumblings that Rockstar is in talks with the OpenIV developers to bring it back. I cannot confirm this myself. I will not be changing my review to recommend becauseA Taketwo ordered the ceaseanddesist in the first place, and they dont get a pat on the back for an issue being resolved that they created to begin. On top of that, Grand Theft Auto V has had many problems with hackers on its online servers that it does not seem to want to fix and the apparent banning of completely innocent players that causes me to continue to not recommend this game.B If the ceaseanddesist is not being rescinded, and OpenIV is not coming back, then I cannot change this review to recommended.In either case, due to the actions of those that run this game, Grand Theft Auto V earns my not recommended review. If it comes out that OpenIV is coming back, then I want this review to be a reminder of what Taketwo tried to do.
