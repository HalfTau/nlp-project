I have played gtav across all platforms and Ive enjoyed them all.Main game is fun the first time, the problem with the second playthrough is that you realize the enitre game is a  long tutorial. gta online could be amazing! If anyone played the boring missions or actually did heists together. The current state of the game feels like so much of a grind that making any progress just means more replaying of the same missions.psThe only way to make a good amount of money in online is with shark cards and you have to use the stock market without spending any money in the main game to become rich at the end.Please let this game die so rockstar will focus on making rdr2 playable.
