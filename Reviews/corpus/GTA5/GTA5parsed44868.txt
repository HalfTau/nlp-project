Ive been a huge fan and supporter of Rockstar over the years and have bought multiple copies of many games over many systems over the years. I was even concidering buying a console specificaly for RDR2. That is now in serious doubt, I cant in good conscience give any more money to or recomend products by a company that is actively working against the mod community, a community that has improved the GTA experience for many many people for free.
