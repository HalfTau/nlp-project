Reasons to not purchase GTA5 currentlyThe money you earn online is subject to deletion regardless if done correctlyyou may be banned for no reason two of my innocent friends cant play nowActual modders are still at large, so all their efforts are in for nothingthere wouldnt be nearly as many modders if there was quicker ways to earn money and things to do, but rockstar feels that being a tyrant is more lucrative than anything.THEY ARE DELELTING SUPPORT TICKETS BY THE THOUSANDSthe loading times are insanity, it takes me nearly 10 minutes to get into game and i ahve a i7 4790k and a gtx 980...they are ignoring what their fanbase is telling them on purpose, justifying it with whatever they want.in the end its up to you if you get the game, but i would hold off on buying this game till Rockstar figures out how to make their players happy again. Their current PR efforts and disciplinary actions for modders are about as good as their ability to get this game to run on PC, its working, but itseveryone off.To RockstarStop adding new content, refine your old, make it so we can make more money, have more fun with our friends. the only people who can break lvl 100 are those that no life the game and have more than 200hours playing it, you obviously need to make the game easier. You morons also need to make the players feel safer... from you....
