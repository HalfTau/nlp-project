Im not even sure where to begin with.The singleplayer part of this game is great, i absolutely love it, and i like the world created by R.However, when it comes to the Online part, im afraid thats where things change, and drastically.I hate to say this, but the online is nothing more than a horribly made and messed up grindfest, and taking into consideration the automated banning system that R has created, youll certainly end up banned for nothing.Also, the fact that everything is insanely expensive, a measure made by rockstar in an effort to make people buy their shark cards, which, are unfair, really. Legitimate players the ones who dont have any modded money and play normally often find themselves in disadvantage to players with modded cash, or in other cases, god mode hacks and so on.It pains me to write this, since, at first, i greatly enjoyed the online, despite its glitchy and buggy launch, however, as of this date, the online has changed, and for the worst, i am afraid.If you want to buy this game solely for its singleplayer, then go ahead, theres plenty to do in it.But, if you want to buy this game for its online component, i strongly recommend you not doing it.
