I have been a fan of the GTA series from the beginning when it was released in birds eye view on the playstation 1!!GTA 5 its self has been a go to game when i want to relax and have some fun in a group or pretend im in the game playing solo to escape the world!The online is a fun place to be when the russian, lobby exploders are not there!! and ive had many fun hours between the consoles and PC with my friends!I like the ability to add graphic changes in offline and extensions to the story from some very creative people!However my biggest BEEF is with Rockstars idea of an online econemy!! NOT only is it a huge grind to be able to afford anything, but when someone gets a modder to drop them a few  to save some time not everyone can spend their life in a game!!! they get punished and banned from the game!Rockstar has made some amazing games but as much fun as GTA 5 is i am disgusted at how they treat their long time followers and how they force people to grind the game like a 95 job just to be able to have fun!!
