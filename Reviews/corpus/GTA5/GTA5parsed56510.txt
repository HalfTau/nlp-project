Online is a cesspool riddled with cheaters running rampant and griefiers, and the prices are massively inflated so good luck being able to afford anything legitimately, especially newly released content. Unless you grind a on that is, or spend real money. Both of which isnt worth it, or something I can imagine anyone would wanna do considering the state the game are in.It had the potential be very good, but they completely screwed it up by being way too greedy and ignoring all the issues with cheaters, griefers, etc. Basically they dont give a crap, and now Take Two pretty much killed modding by declaring OpenIV illegal.
