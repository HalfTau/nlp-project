This game has a great single player. If you are going to buy it do it for the single player.The online mode is one of the best online games I have ever played. It has an RPGlike leveling system built around how much money you have or can make ingame. If you play the game fairly, there is always incentive to get more money and to buy more stuff. Making money is also fairly easy.However.... do not expect to play the online game for longer than an hour, as the cancerous tumor, known as online modders, will destroy any fun you would have had. If you even think for one second you can kick them or report them, your are sorely mistaken. Rockstar has no intention of protecting its players from online modders.If you really want to play it online. I suggest you play it on another platform.Or purchase this game and download your mods and have fun toiling in your insignificant existance if the only thing that gives you the slightest bit of sexual pleasure is griefing other players with your god mode mod. You will die alone.P.S. Dont worry about the microtransactions. Even if the shark cards are probably the best way to impliment mictrotransactions into a game without breaking the balancing. Just get a modder to drop you money. Ofcourse that would ruin the whole purpose of the game, but  it, who cares, right ?
