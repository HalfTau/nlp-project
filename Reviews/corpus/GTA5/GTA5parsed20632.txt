had fun playing with friends but getting into a lobby with anyone is near impossible, game crashes randomly, all cool cars take forever to get due to being so expensive and getting very low money for doing missions so you have to spend hours upon hours grinding just to buy one thing unless the usual chinese hackers join your game and spawn millions on top of youlooks like fun on the surface but is honestly not enjoyable
