I really wanted to enjoy GTA Online but like others say, its a mess. Youve got the cheating modders, loading screens for days, expensive items over 5k for a paper bag mask, really?, lobbies where people arent patient and leave, griefers, stupid game mechanics, cant steal an expensive vehicle to own it, etc. GG.Single player is fun for a while at least.
