Rating 8/10After reading reviews about micro transactions for multiplayer, I decided to stick with only doing the single story. So this review is only for single player.The story is great. Lots of humor, drama, and conflict with multiple endings.The three main characters are all unique with their own quirks and personalities. The game allows you to jump between them pretty much whenever. My favorite was jumping to Trevor and finding him in such strange and funny situations.Quest/story is very linear. There are the larger heist quests that give you choices for how you want to proceed. Then there are other quest that progress the main story along. Finally there are the very few repetitive quest which are so completely optional, I dont think they were even necessary.There is a skill system that improves certain stats related to activities you do. If you drive more, your driving skill improves. If you shoot more, your aim improves,  The more you run, the more stamina you get. I didnt think this system was necessary and was probably something more intended for multiplayer.The graphics are amazing. There are so many different areas of the city that had their own look and feel and helped set the tone for where each of the main characters came from.This game is a great improvement from past GTA games. It feels more like an action movie than you just doing the same type of quest over and over with slightly different premise.If I had to come up with a negative about the game, it would have to be the difficulty of escaping from police. Youre supposed to hide in tunnels, under bridges, or in parking garagesbut it always felt like these were never around or these locations did not help much in losing the cops.I would recommend this game to anyone that likes action type games and themes similar to the oceans 11 style crime.
