The only reason to purchase GTA on PC these days, usually one year after its already been out on consoles, or even buy it a second time after youve had it on console for a year, is to mod it and mess about.Now Take Two has decided it does not want its game to be modded and give some silly reasons about messing up online games which are protected anyway. We dont believe you.So as much as I loved the GTA series, Im not going to bother in the future. Ill just wait and buy it second hand.
