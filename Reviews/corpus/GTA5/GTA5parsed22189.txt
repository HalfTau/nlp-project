In the beginning of the release for GTA V, it was awesome and had a good run for storyline. However, the Multiplayer Online is not really good because of many cheaters and trolling that have over Rank Level 100 than you for the first time being youve encounter for joining random server and may have a chance to kill you just to lose your role style life and GTA money waste.Ive also noticed that you can use mods to have fun and do silly stuff before, but apparently TakeTwo has control power to ban your Rockstar Account if any attempt is being used for OpenIV Mod Tool in Singleplayer. What a way to ruin the game.Although, I have never use mods before, but from what I heard, dont ever trust the Video Game Company who are changing the major rules and have the rights to do whatever they want without listening the community feedback.I would only recommend if youre much interested for playing Singleplayer to follow the storyline without using mods to avoid the ban, but I dont recommend to play for Multiplayer Online as it gets boring for few hours, nearly impossible to earn GTA money unless you insist to buy Shark Cash Cards to earn it faster and being annihilate by cheaters or higher Rank Level.
