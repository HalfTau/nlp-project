Fun game but Rockstar support is a cancer, support tickets take weeks to get a response if they ever do.Also they incorrectly banned me for a month and deleted my character, after over 600 hours of gameplay and 180 someodd hardgrinded  levels.There is still a hacker in literally every server but at least they deleted me.
