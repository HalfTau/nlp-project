GTAV Online feels like a fulltime job, it is not really enjoyable unless you can afford the massively overpriced shark cards or cheat. The game demands that you grind for 100s of hours that most of us do not have. You cant progress because cheaters will remotely explode you or mess with you in some way.The single player is great, the graphics are great, the game could be great, but the online mode is absolutely abysmal.Why not just charge money for DLC? I would happily buy DLC if it were absent of the cheating and grinding that make the game a chore. I end up having to just play private sessions with my friends.Worse the EA Star Wars Battlefront 2, and that is saying something.
