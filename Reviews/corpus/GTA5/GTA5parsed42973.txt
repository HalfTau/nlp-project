This is a review of the game itelf, not the modding that comes with the community support. If it was it would be negative. The game is just incredible. Rockstar put in so much effort in such a detailed game and has still been updating it constantly. I do think that the newer updates are too expensive and you have to put in millions to make good money, but the things that you can buy now are crazy. Ive seen game companies handle their games much worse than Rockstar has with Grand Theft Auto V, and we should appreciate it. We need to look at the big picture of what this game is, not just little things that they ignore which is ridiculous at times. Overall this game is amazing and Ive loved playing it since 2013 then on pc in 2015. Good Job Rockstar.
