what do I do to get a refund on this game. Ive spent more time trying to get through the prologue mission just because that lag is so bad. It took 8 hours for it to download and install everything including the updates. I barely played one hour and couldnt even complete the first mission after the prologe. It is only running on a few frames per second and I do not think that is worth having this game. I want a refund on it.
