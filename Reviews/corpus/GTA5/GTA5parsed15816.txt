ok, the game is great but the history mode is short asf, dont get me wrong but in the Grand theft auto san andreas, Grand theft auto IV, was better and the history was long and rich then GTA V.I recommend?no if you like those great and rich history but if you want throw 59.99 into the trash go ahead.Online mode nice and is the only thing that saves the game.
