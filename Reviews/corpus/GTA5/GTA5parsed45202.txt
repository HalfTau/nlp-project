While I loved the single player story and experience, Rockstar has based its entire strategy since release on its online and microtransactions.  That focus killed potential awesome Singleplayer DLC, and has recently killed a single player modding tool, OpenIV, something that has made the single player fun in the absence of official DLC.  Until Rockstars strategy changes, I cant recommend Grand Theft Auto V.
