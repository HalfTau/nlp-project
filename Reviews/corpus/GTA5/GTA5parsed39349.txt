I dont agree with whats happenig right now with everyone giving negative reviews just because they took away mods. its not fair to make new people think that this game is terrible when it isnt just because everyones having a hissy fit. We were never promised mods, we were never sold mods, so i dont think its fair to base revies on the presence or absence of mods.
