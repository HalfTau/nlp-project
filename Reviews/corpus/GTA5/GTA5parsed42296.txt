Rockstar have gone waaaay too far  first, the addition of Shark Cards, and the ridiculous grind involved in getting nearly anything online. Rockstar realised that microtransactions earn them a lot of money, so Shark Cards are practically required to get anything decent online. Unfortunately, this will now probably be the case in all future Rockstar games, including RDR2. And recently, Take Two blocked OpenIV, a modding tool for GTA V  a SINGLEPLAYER modding tool for GTA V. Absolutely shameful.
