i used to love this game, had it on ps3, ps4 and now pc, but i cant support the fact that rockstar is milking the hell out of its playerbase by making you grind for days or buy an 100 shark card to get maybe 3 cars if youre lucky. GTA online could have been so much better if it wasnt a grind fest and you werent forced to stay in public lobbys with complete s whos only goal is to blow up everything you just spent hours acquiring,  you rockstar and take two for killing a beloved francise, and for turning your playbase into a cash cow.
