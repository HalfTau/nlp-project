It has great multiplayer and they keep updating their game with brand new and innovating content, its perfectly optimized so you can play the game with almost all of your friends, even if their GPU isnt all that great.There are so many things to discover and so many different gamemodes you can play. You can go all fancy or just live like a dirty redneck on the countryside.The singleplayer missions are just great with the 3 very different characters you can play, you got a dirty old redneck, a black ghetto guy making it big in the land of equal opportunities and a stereotype white familyman with a great house and family problems. Theyre all different and they all have their own story to tellThe one thing I very like about GTA V is the diversity and the great amount in customization of for example your car or your outfits, thats probably my favorite thing to do. Ive spent countless hours fitting some new clothes together to go for the most classy or the most ghetto thing I could combine, together with a great hairstyle and some great tattoos.Ive played this game almost 200hrs now, and Ive enjoyed every single minute of it.I would totally recommend GTA V to any of my friends since its so diverse yet you can make it as complex as you want. And almost everyone can play it with almost every GPU.
