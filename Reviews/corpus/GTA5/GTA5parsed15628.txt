When you make it next to impossible to earn money ingame, dont be suprised when players use exploits and bugs in order to access your free content.Dont be suprised as well when your playerbase reacts negatively towards your anticonsumer behavior.Will i come back to this game? Maybe, I put time and money down on this, but this is most likely the last time Ill ever purchase a product from this company again.Rockstar, if you continue down this road, people will resort to pirating your games, not because they cant afford them, but to send a message. If you cant guess what that message is, then you are truly lost to us.
