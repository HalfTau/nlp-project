So ive played this game on almost all consoles and pc and LOVED the story mode!Great writing great charicters, ive played it through a few times over the years and still like it. but i feel like that no great feat from rockstar they are a huge company and have made great games beforeNow lets talk about online...I held back from buying this game because of all the reviews warning me not to play online alone so when a sale came alone a friend and i bought it and instantly started playing online, it started out interesting, its hard to find jobs to do, its borderline impossible to play in a game with your friends unless you host, but i would hardly call it a host position, you have little to no control over the loby.I could go on and on and on but you know the real reason im writing this?Because i sloged away at online for 20 solid hours only to have a hacker come in and sell everything i owned for himself and ROYALY  the game turning it into a unfixable, glichy mess not to mention all that hardwork was for nothing.Oh and also there is no legit way to contact rockstar to get this problem sorted so FK YOOOOOOOOU ROCKSTARRRRRRRRR!enjoy this ultra salty review
