Played since launch on the PS3 and its good.Moved on to the PC for the next gen online stuff and updates.Playing online has never felt like a grind so hard its like trying to evolve your level 1 Pokemon to level 100 after beating the league. Everything is way overpriced for its use.ExamplesThe Facility  Useless if you really want to play The Doomsday Heist.Lazer            This thing has been around since launch and its priced around 7Million for its function. The Hydra is waybetter than this.note that this is about onlineThe Story Mode is the best one. Great story and interesting missions.9.5/10 no Cluckin Bell
