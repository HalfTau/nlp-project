Singleplayer is awesome no doubt in that. But alas! Bought this game only for multiplayer and it completely dissapointed me tbh. The most annoying part is online loading, it takes 810 mins to load online mode in my i3 processor  and also when I join my friend, it starts ping spike everytime. FIX IT ASAP
