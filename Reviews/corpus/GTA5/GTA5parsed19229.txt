Amazing single player, never skipped a cutscene and played along, realy loved the endings.Horrible online, if you dont have atleast 2 other friends with you then your ed.Weapons and vehicles give non skill required advantages against other players, getting the rocket bike I cant be bothered to even look it up is basicly saying Hey! I have less of a life then you do but cant be bothered to actually earn money the normal way and just steal my moms credit card and but a shark card! before he blows up your car with the T homing rockets on the bike, then you try to blow up his bike but cant because he goes mach speed. Weapons...jeez, what ashow, why would you use anything besides sticky bombs, carbine rifle With suppresor even tho its a straight downgrade heavy sniper, minigun and heavy shotgun, all are pink even though he dosnt like pink. That same person probobly dosnt have cloths with only a lepord thong and a tatto. Either that or full balistic armor. He probobly asks for money drops from ha Script Kiddies, all the while raging at people saying Hackers are stupid because they give him money drops.The missions and heists are cool tho.8.5/10                                                   Single player...2.2/10 multiplayer.
