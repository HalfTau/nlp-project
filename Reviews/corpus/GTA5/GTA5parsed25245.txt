As time passes being 3 some years into the games release it seems it is becoming more and more of a play to win style game with the shark card system that Rockstar has implemented. From low pay heavy grinding missions to enemy and neutral MPCs making it living hell to do CEO work, it could take a player sometime before being able to purchase something interesting in the game and enjoy the new things with each DLC. Yes, I understand that Rockstar is a company and they have to make a profit but I am sorry what they have done and what they have refused to do for the Online communitythe players that have fun without being holes is simply unacceptable in my opinion.  On the subject of players it seems to me catagorized into three different types. There are the regular players who mind there own and have fun with there friends, the toxic griefers who enjoy messing around with the hard working players for fun and, the worst of all, the online hackers who turn each session they enter into a fest of stupidity and anger.In regards to Rockstars recent banning of singleplayer mods, well there is not much that I can say simply because I have never tried modded GTA 5. However from what I know it seems really stupid for the company to literally stab half of there community and OpenIV in the back. Overall I believe that the game has gone down the drain and unless Rockstar gets it together and wake up to the anger of there community they will be going down the drain.
