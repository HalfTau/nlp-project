The last GTA that I played before this one was GTA 2 released in 1999, I didnt know what to expect but I wasnt disappointed. Ive only played single player, so thats what this guide is focused on.The game starts off following the storyline of three career criminals from very different backgrounds that somehow manage to make an effective is not extremely violatile team. I can honestly say I enjoyed the storyline of all the characters and found myself actually liking certain NPCs that I found ingame. The games an incredible sandbox and alot of detail has been given to the map to make every area feel unique and realistic.The side missions are great distractions from the storymode and they dont break immersion in the game. The game has a variety of good music to listento. The dialogue is excellent and pokes fun at all sorts of hypocrsys and throws in witty jokes for those with the ear to listen. The map is absolutely huge, and has a variety of diverse areas. I enjoyed the gameplay both the gunplay and the fast cars. Each character has unique abilities that dictated different playstyles of the player. So if youre feeling the urge to speed around the city in a brand new custom job car, you use Franklin. If youre in the mood to go on rampages through the city, you pick Trevor and if youre in the mood to be more sniper/stealthy secret agent type you pick Michael.Con Every game has flaws. Flying. I felt like this game deliberately made flight controls difficult. The AI sometimes cheats to find your character, instead of using line of sight or sound.And thats about it.I had a blast with this game, I wish it was longer but plan on replaying it again soon for a more completionist playthrough. I wa personally a fan of the character Trevor. Very good game, I highly recommend it.
