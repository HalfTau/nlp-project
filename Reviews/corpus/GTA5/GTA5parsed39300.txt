After what TakeTwo did to mods in this game, it seemed like the end, but lots of mods seem to have recovered, however I would say that online is not the best. It could use a little spicing up in terms of things to do Heists, not ing CEO missions and more ways for Rich people/Modders to waste thier money. The single player, is amazing. One of the best open world stories ever.
