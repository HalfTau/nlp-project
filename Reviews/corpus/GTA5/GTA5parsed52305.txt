T2The only reason i play GTA 5 story mode is because of the mods. I admit i do play online but infrequently because of your OVERPRICED shark cards and the vast expence of EVERYTHING in the game. By taking away GTA 5 STORY MODE mods, you are essentially taking away the only reason that people play GTA 5 STORY MODE, and all for what? MONEY? T2, if you think this is acceptable, then take a good long look in the mirrior you greedy bstards. Oh, and everyone who thinks ROCKSTAR GAMES is to blame here, there not, its just T2 shiing on them for there own selfish wants, not needs.Thank you for reading and T2 if you are reading this, you dont have to take into account what I am saying, just take into account what the HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THINK OF YOUR GAME NOW. YOU HAVE MADE OVER 3,000,000,00 FOR FCKS SAKE!! And so to T2, i say Thanks?
