GTA V is literally the definition of the perfect game. Unfourtunately, I cant really say the same for the community.Fantastic music, interesting story, graphics that still hold up today, and an astonishingly great open world.Now, onto the community.The part of the community that complain are either kids who complain about Shark Cards or people who areabout hackers.People need to stop complaining about Shark Cards, because so long as you dedicate yourself to the cause, you will achieve it. Its really not that big of an issue. Hackers are kind of an issue though, as they have the ability to spawn things ingame that could get a legitimate player banned. In which case, happened to me, although it only lasted a few minutes Instead of complaining about players hacking, just report them, hope they get banned, and move to the next server. Simple as that.All in all, fantastic game, bad community.Game 10/10Community 0/10
