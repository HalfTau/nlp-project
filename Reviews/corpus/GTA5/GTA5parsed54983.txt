This new update sucks so much, its got sweet cars and all, but when all Rockstar wants is for people to buy the stupid Shark Cards, it completely ruins the fun of the game.  If you dont want to buy shark cards well good luck to you, you get to spend so many hours buying everything you want then realizing a new update is coming out with even more expensive things!  It was nice to have modded money because I could actually enjoy the game for once, the struggle to get money sucked so much.
