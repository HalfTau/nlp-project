its gtav i dont really need to tell you anything about it, lmao who hasnt played this game yet? Anyways I get stuck on a lot of loading screens and when I join a online server oh baby INSTANT KABOOM and i go flying across the ing streets there are modders lmao idrc. Most people have grow up playing with modders in gta so its kinda normal but pls get them out? if the game never ing freezes thatll be good too thx, also what the actual  is this game now some kid flew past me in a flying motor cycle or something? also jet packs? This game got more fun after I left and came back. Glad I did. But literally have my hours are thanks to loading screens. Good Game in 2018 tho
