Great game with beautiful graphics. Runs like a charm on most PC rigs. and has a great story. I have put in over 1000 hours into this game just on Steam. Ive played the game since launch on PS3 off and on but, this game may aswell be renamed to Grand Theft Auto Online. Only because that is all Rockstar seem to care about now. When they do a GTA VI, I hope they put as much effort into the story and story DLCs as they do into online. The online is great, you can do some crazy stuff with your friends, including pulling of heists or just messing around in public sessions. The main downside to online is the modders. You hop into a lobby, After the 14 hour loading sim and in most cases come across someone exploading the whole lobby in godmode with a mod menu. If it wasnt for the modders, I would say the online aspect of the game is amazing, that is one of few downsides to it.
