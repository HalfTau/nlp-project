Love this game wasnt happy about the take two v mods but because of that modders vanished till now, Ran into a modder who caged everyone up and spawn UFO hoving over your head and in the cages spawning random NPC dropping the frames faster then usain bolt however the best way to deal with them is to leave, Jesus Im ing on this game. I did play GTA 5 on the xbox one but the auto aim was the reason why I brought this game for the PC because the aiming is much more smoother. The gunrunning DLC did add the worst feature research, hated that you cannot choose your research and the fast track did make a Pay to win feeling. Not sure to recommend this game or not because of some features, bugs and modders. Also I want to say how military the game has got    I Remember the days when the adder was the greatest car and the Tank was the closest military thing in the game but today we have flying bikes, APCS and much more. Gta is now more battlefield then Gta and also the dipfeeding.
