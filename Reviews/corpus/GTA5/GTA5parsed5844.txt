I been playing this game since it came out but here are some problems i have with the game.1. modders are just everywhere and most just non stop kill the server2. Rockstars support is just trash you could get ban for no reason and they wont care i seen it happen a lot over the last 2 years3. Rockstar 100 lied about the single player DLC4.  Everything is very very over priced so you will be forced to either get a modder to drop you money or spend your hard earned cash just to play some good content like cmon rockstar yall are greddy af5. No transfer I spent years working on my main character but when i got GTA for PC the transfer was gone and all that time and money was wasted maybe they will bring it back who knowsWell that is it for now there is more but I sadly dont have the time to list them if you are getting GTA just for the single player DLC then go for it but for Online I wouldnt recommend till they fix some problems
