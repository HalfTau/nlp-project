I started modding GTA ever since Vice City. From SAMP to Simple Native Trainer in both GTA IV and V, those made me come back to GTAs after Ive beat the main storyline and was bored. Now TakeTwo/Rockstar decides to shut down OpenIV? off.GTA Online is a pure cashgrabber and nothing more.Dont buy the game, leave negative reviews, check out NerdCubeds videos on the matter and sign the petition.
