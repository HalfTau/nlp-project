Bethesda opened a new path for all the games industry , the first attempt to take down the free MODS was a failure , but now theyre on the road again and with the same policies, and this time its not only bethesda but TAkeTwo, another giant who wants to make more easy money, its problably the beginning of the payforeverything on this market. If they dont refuse ont this decision dont be strange if they announce a new feature to have MODS but PAYING . Im not going to buy more of their games.
