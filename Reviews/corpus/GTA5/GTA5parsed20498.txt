Im very upset that they stopped the GTA 5 liberty city mod. That and the online part of gta 5 is horrible and they have done NOTHING for the single player mode. A team decided to make something for gta 5 single player and it gets stopped. They didnt even try to negotiate with the openiv team, like hey guys you can make this as a dlc or hey guys lets just make sure that you require players to own gta IV to use this. Nope, just up yours and buy some megalodon cards so you can buy a single fricken yacht! only 100 dollars to get 8 million, oh and you need 10 million to get the Galaxy Super Yacht! Come on a single yacht is worth tens of thousands of players to pay us 100 dollars to own one, but only until we end online support for this game! At that point you get jack, and can enjoy all the hackers ruining the online servers, just like with gta IV they saved us the trouble of ending the online community. This game is NOT worth 60 bucks, its a 2015 game that only gets overpriced online updates. You can buy this game for the Xbox 360 on ebay for 14 bucks, but if you decided for some god awful reason to buy it now on steam, not only will you pay the full original price from TWO years ago, but you can also get overpriced online credits that will expire when they make a new gta. If they lower the price OR add more single player content I will remove my negative review, but dont hold your breath.
