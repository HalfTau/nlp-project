I dont think Ive ever gotten this angry at any game. The menu and options is completely non functional. There are more controls than arma3 with ace and if any of those controls is unbound it will reset everything to default. Which is a huge problem since I play ESDF. If you change a single graphic option the game will need to restart. And theres two graphic options menues and changing one resets other to default. Also selecting story mode sometimes boots up online which you quit for story mode but it goes straight back to online.Yeah rockstar, needs to fire some people because this sheer incompetence is only rivalled by those who design ubisoft open worlds.Honestly It is a fantastic open world, perhaps the best open world ever made in gaming. It is amazing how much technology rockstar managed to cram into a game. Sure its one city and some countryside but that one city feels like a real city.But  the reasons I dont reccomend it is that there isnt much to do on downtime you can rob a few stores or randomly spawning armored truck. Thats pretty much it.Seeing as entire theme of the game is heists I am sad to see that you cant plan your own seeing that there are many big empty houses and clubs and warehouses. A massive missed opportunity.And while the 3 character thing works one of them is made for 12 year olds so youre going to hate time spent with him.Overall downvoting because after 20 hours spent on the game im bored of it.
