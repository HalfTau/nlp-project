this is a decent game and it has its moments that are super fun.... saddly the fun is limited by the greed of the publisher and i cannot recomend a game that has such an obnoxious puplisher! i mod my single player hell i would rather not play multi player and since rockstar has no plans to work on adding to the story mode then all we have to lookforword to is a cashgrab mmo this wouldnt be a problem if gta online was its own game apart from gta v but it is not and that is making this game much worse then it could be... sometimes people just want to play a modded game and take Two is taking away alot of modds used by the comunity that if it werenot for us would not even exist so it is time to say  you take 2 im taking 3 and dropping this game alltogether it isnt worth any money if not for the abillity to mod and has been around for far too long for 60 not worth 5 IMO
