Effectively made modding illegal by sending a CD to the creaters of the OpenIV tool claiming that the tool can enable malicious mods online.Which is false as OpenIV blocks access to the online mode.Theyre not blocking the tool to prevent Malicious mods.Theyre trying their hardest to prevent people from playing the single player because the less people playing the multiplayer, the less people they can scam with their t sharkcards as they release new content and make it cost far to much in game cash for someone to get in a reasonable ammount of time.R and Take 2 can go kiss my sweaty, hairyWe dont bow down to your cancer lads. You should bow down to us you
