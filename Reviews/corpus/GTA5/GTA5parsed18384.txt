Grand Theft Auto 5 had the potential to be one of the best games. The story in single player was unique and took you through different spins and tales. Then you wanted to play more, with other people. Wait what? I need money to really enjoy the game? Like in game currency, right? Oh you have to grind the hell out of any and everything just to make a few bucks, but why do that Says Rockstar when you can just use REAL money for ingame currency. Oh and its not in some small amounts either. Were talking 35, 50, 100 dollars for millions of in game dollars  ingame money that after you purchase or two things that are actually desireable, youre out of money already. Oh, and the chance of running into hackers in a lobby is about 75, and Im giving it a VERY generous 75. Its honestly higher. They turned what couldve been amazing...into a cashgrab POS
