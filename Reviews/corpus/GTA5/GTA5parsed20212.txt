The Story mode is good, not great but its fun but GTA Online is getting really bad. Before the addition Shark Cards it was a really good game too but since then they only added really expensive Cars and so on. It seems like the only thing they care about is how they can get the most money out of the new update. And how do they do this? Making things more expensive because no ones going to notice it anyways, let things like Biker businesses give you less money and make you wait for several hours to complete your research. But wait, theres a way to go around that Paying a sht ton of money so you can skip the research. Also money making methods are unballanced as f. Races give you almost no money at all unless youre first place and drove for at least 10 minutes. Same thing with other Missions. I hope theyll get away from this howcanwemakethemostmoneyoutofitway of thinking and instead focus on the Gameplay and Balance.
