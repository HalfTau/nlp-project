StoryHavent done it but I hear its really good.OnlineDo you want to play a game where you spend hours on resupplying your MC businesses, and doing a sale just to get those hours of work blown up by somebody else and lose everything. How about spending hours paying for CEO crates for the warehouse, just to do a sale and BOOM all gone in seconds. Most if not all of the public sessions are full people who fly around in Hydras, tanks, Insurgents, Moblile Ops just to blow up others products. Public sessions are literally a warzone and no fun at all, especially when all of the businesses are locked to public sessions.Some of us just want to have fun together doing whatever we want online and not to deal with public people and especially modders. Businesses should be allowed in Private friend sessions and I will not change this review until its set to private sessions.
