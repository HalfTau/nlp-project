THIS REVIEW IS BASED SOLELY ON SINGLEPLAYER I recommend this game, because it is truly a masterpiece and a game that will be remembered 10, 20, 30 years from now. The graphics are superb, even in 2017. The story is wellcrafted. The gameplay is immersive and fun. The open world feels lively and bustling around you, not to mention how varied and diverse different parts of the map are.   Now that has been stated the reason why this game has an overall mixed rating, is because a lot of GTA players were triggered that the ones responsible for the game pushed some antimod rule. Even though Rockstar did eventually relax its stance, many of the petulent children who unfairly rated this game down did not rescind their rating for the game. They have committed an injustice to this game, and they are no better than Rockstars antimod tantrums.
