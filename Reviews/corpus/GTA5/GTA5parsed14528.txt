Great single player experience.I cant recommend becuase the game came out years ago with promised single player expansions that were never released and probably never will be. Also, the online is a terrible cash grab. You have to grind to unlock weapons, vehicles, anything really. You are not aloud to just mess around with friends like previous games. Its like a bad MMORPG except with more grinding. Or you can skip the grinding and just buy Shark Cards with real money. Also the online community is as bad as you would expect it to be. On top of everything else, modders/hackers are everywhere and prevent you from having fun. Im almost thinking the modders/hackers are just employees preventing you from progressing so you have to buy Shark Cards.
