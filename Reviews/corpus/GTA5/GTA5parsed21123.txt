Its time or money with this game you cant have both. Either spend hundreds of hours pointlessly grinding to unlock new ways to grind for cash, or sink hundreds of dollars in real money into doing the same thing. The story mode is fine, but if you want this game for its online gameplay, look elsewhere. Dont make my mistake of getting trapped in this endless cycle of grinding and microtransactions and buy a game that will actually leave you satisfied, rather than this abysmal black hole of wasted time and progressively more absurd socalled updates.
