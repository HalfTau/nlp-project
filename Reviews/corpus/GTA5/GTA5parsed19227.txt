The online is a garbage grindfest in which the only way to get money is eitherA repeat the same missions over and over and over again untill you spend all of your money getting a business and then do the crate pickups over and over again.orB hack money into the gameIts obvious take two/ rockstar just want you to pay for shark cardsin game currency which is insanely overpriced .This game is only worth it for the single player, however due to take twos position on modding the damn singleplayer it has lead me to not want to ever purchase another take two published game again. They have actively been against the modding community and taking down the Red Dead Redemption mod was the final straw for me.Honestly just pirate this game, you wont miss the multiplayer.
