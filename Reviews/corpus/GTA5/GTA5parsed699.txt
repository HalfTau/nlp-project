Quick summary Singleplayer is amazing Multiplayer public is awful since it is pay to win It was good once, but this time is over since a long time Multiplayer private with friends is still cool although some features are not aviableIf you wonder about the time I played this game recorded on steam, I played 704 hours online Level 213 and 82 hours in singleplayer mode on XBOX ONE and bought it on steam now to be able to play with my friends on PCUpdated 08.02.2018
