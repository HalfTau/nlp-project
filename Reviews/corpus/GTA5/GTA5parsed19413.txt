Go aheadIf youre looking to play the stories or add some mods like the characters skins, vehicles etc.If youre play with some friends that you knew well. Do jobs, etc. Its fun, but dont ever cheats, it ruined the happiness of the game.ButDont if you want to play the multiplayer alone. Its really really ed up. Bunch of cheaters, random acts of players, very noisy room etc. Go with the Playstation or Xbox version. Id rather play the GTASA Multiplayer
