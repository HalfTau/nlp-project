alright.... now ive never played gta long enough to get anything good.... in fact it took me weeks just to get a good super car off of missions and jobs.... i really like the game.... the shark cards are a streach... but i mean you have to make money... the real thing is though is that.... if you kill the modding... you have to understand wht that does to the community who have spent plenty of their time making these mods..... your game is great.... the concept is still great... you made a mistake and bit the bullet.... listen to the community and your game will be the peoples game not a capatalists deam
