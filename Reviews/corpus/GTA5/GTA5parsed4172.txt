Nowadays, Im mostly involved with playing online rather than the story mode, if only because so much of the content that was released online was never released for story mode. That said, unless you have hundreds in disposable income to spend online or you have at least six hours a day to spend just grinding for the next vehicle/property, I really cant recommend GTA online.Its really unfortunate, because I do think that if there were only a few improvements on the game  shorter loading screens, missions that didnt end if even one person leaves or disconnects and cutting down on the excessive costcreep of new additions to the game  this would without a doubt be the best online multiplayer out there, bar none.GTA has the unique attribute of being whatever type of game you want it to be  a flight simulator, a racer, a builder, an fps  you name it. The developers did all of these things well. In the singleplayer mode, you have a damn good story the only downside is the lack of new content that ended up going to online only.The online community is somewhat deprived  invariably because of how difficult it is for someone with less than half the day to play this game to make progress at a steady clip. In general, I very rarely see subjects pertaining to whether theres a modder in the lobby who can give cash not part of the conversation in the chat. Theres just enough of a thrill in killing and griefing in freemode for a lot of players that ends up making freemode a crappy place to be in most cases.If you find this game on sale, get it for the singleplayer campaign. Its a beauty. But as for the online multiplayer, I would be wary unless you have friends that play this game with you.
