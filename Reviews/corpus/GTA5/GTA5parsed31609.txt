Let me preface this with Not all modders are bad. Some of them actually used Open IV for what it was intended for making awesome player created content. But as they say, a few or a lot in this case bad apples spoiled the bunch.If youve been on GTA Online in recent months, the unscrupulous modders have gotten out of hand. Every session had modders who would drop explosives on everyone in the session, killing them, or toggle Godmode, or teleport everyone to one spot on the map and blow them up constantly, or disable your weapons, or delete 500K of your money every second, or crash your game. It was getting ridiculous. You couldnt find a server without some modder ruining the fun for legit players.SMH at all the modding people throwing a temper tantrum like a 5 year old would and leaving these reviews. You did this to yourselves. You have forced Take 2 and Rockstars hand. Please dont give me that, Nuh uhh, I din du nuffin bullcrap. Sharkcard sales are Rockstars cash cow. I dont blame them for what they did. The modders were effing with their business. Where do you think all the FREE DLC comes from?GTA5/O is a great game. Top 5 game of all time IMO. Dont listen to these whiners. I just hope Rockstar and Take 2 can clean up and ban the cheaters from this game. If the past week is any indication of cleaning up the servers, then they have already done a great job.Flame away whiners.
