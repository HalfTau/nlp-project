I love GTA V and GTA Online but Taketwo Interactive banning modding is essentially censoring the creative communitythat makes up the majority of GTA V. Modding is the reason I bought this game a second time on PC so this is a real disappointment.Update Now that Take Two allows single player modding, its all good.
