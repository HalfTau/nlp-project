Alright where do I begin....Oh wait I dont have to begin anywhere other than the fact that this game has a massive ing issue with modders.See .. this is what gets me. Everything script handled must go through rockstars servers so why in the  hell can we use scripts without administration priviledges? Its painfully obvious that they care only about shitcards, I mean shark cards.Ill be honest, I modded all of my wealth because online is a grind. Not a good grind but the type of grind that feels like your face is being pressed against a belt sander. Anyways, I never hurt the players and when engaged in battle I would play normally. But because I do that doesnt mean others will. I heard they started handing out bans and have not modded in over a year. The real issue is blackhat modders, or asshat modders as I like to call them. They will attachto you, blow you up , aim hack , god mode ... the list goes on.Online is trash, Im not afraid to admit it. I have over 500 legit hours played online and the only thing I can say is Boring grind fest. When the grind is over you can subject yourself to killing randoms over and over because you may be better than them. OR you encounter an asshat modder and die a lot. You can switch lobbies, but that doesnt fix jackfor the player base. I still play online but only in a sandbox manner, as I have everything unlocked and I enjoy the character creation and DLC vehicles, that stuff is great.The main game is forgettable, as with all grand theft autos. These games were never meant to be taken seriously. From the time I was a child it was the thrill of playing it at the behest of our parents, and once we could all we did was gun down hookers and hit jumps in vehicles. Generic sandbox gameplay.Now I know this review seems like I am slamming the game, and thats because I am... however that isnt to say its not fun. Its simply thisGrand Theft Auto.
