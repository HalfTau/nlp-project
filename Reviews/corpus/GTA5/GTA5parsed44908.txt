This game is well designed, caters nicely to the abilities of PC out of the box, and is fun to play.Its also published by moneygrabbing, anticommunity, protectionist and aloof people.If I hadnt already bought this game, I wouldnt buy it. Making good games is important, but it doesnt give anyone the right to ruin the hundreds of hours of hard work put in voluntarily by modders and those who want to enjoy the game in every way their gaming computer is capable of. The internet is under threat, our free speech is under threat, and now it seems that even we arent free to enjoy games weve paid for in the way we want.
