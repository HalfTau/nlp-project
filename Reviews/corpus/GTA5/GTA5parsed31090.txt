The only interesting thing about the game is the online portion where you have to spend hudreds of hours and hundreds of  real life money in order to enjoy a small fraction of the content. The updates are mostly repetitive. You need to buy a special building, then do supply runs over and over, then sell stock. I dont recommend this game any more
