I Will write this from a Sober standpoint. My main issue is with SOCIAL CLUB! Numerous bugs e,g What the HECK is this nonsense below...GTA V Exited unexpectedlyGTA V Launcher has stopped workingHaving to do numerous work arounds for a Game u have bought legitimately really?? Even cracking a Pirated game was easier than what I went through with this game... not to mention it still refuses to play at times.When hustle of Pirating a game is easier than playing a Legitimate copy with ones hard earned cash then there is something seriously wrong. At this rate I Cannot Buy even a GTA 6 or be hyped about it or any Game with ROckstar social club.Though not ur fault VALVE/STEAM You guys need to seriously check this and provide a way foward to avoid such problems in any game in the future This is unlike of any Steam Game.I AM STILL Mgetting same problems ever since. I wonder why Rockstar cant deal with these bugs once and for all.I say Again if pirating a game is easier and more convenient than a legitimate product I dnt see why I should buy this game or any rockstar social club ever again.
