DO NOT BUY Red Dead Redemption 2.I love this game, but  the people who made it.The online experience for this game could literally be one of the best of all time, but because of the aggressively stupid decisions of certain people, its turned into a patience exercise.Issues that could have been fixed years ago, persist.  Issues that should have never been issues in the first place.Im not even talking about the incredibly long, grindy nature of adding things to your account.I could tolerate triple the prices on many of the items in this game, if I didnt spend so much wasted time loading in and out of various instances that amount to ing nothing.  You can literally spend several hours accomplishing nothing, through no fault of your own, because of the stupid design of the online components.Why the FUC.K, do I have to load into another persons game, before it tells me the game is full, and then bounces me back through another loading screen, just to get back to the spot I was at before?Why the FUC.K, do I have to load into another persons game, before it asks me about aiming solutions of the persons game, and why the  do I have to acknowledge, EVERY TIME, that, yes, despite the fact that they use auto aim, Im desperate to actually accomplish something, so I will take literally any open instance thats available?  Why do I have to confirm this EVERY FUC.KING TIME, and by the time I confirm it, the session is full?Why do I have to go through some t arbitrary invitation process, instead of just having some universal heist queue?Why the FUC.K am I constantly matched with players from across the world, who dont speak the same language, who have  pings, and cheat?  Is it that FUC.KING hard, to create a regional preference?Most of these problems do not have difficult solutions, but Rockstar has turned into a garbage company.The primary developer who made Rockstar worthwhile was fired. this company.  I hope it rots, and the people who actually made this company great get the funding they need.FUC.K THIS GAME, AND FUC.K ROCKSTAR.I have spent dozens of hours bouncing back and forth between loading in and out of failed instances, and the only reason I got that far, is because I have two monitors, and can watch TV while this game constantly bounces me in and out of lobbies.DO NOT BUY RDR2.
