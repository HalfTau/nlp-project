Singleplayer is 10/10, it really doesnt get much better than that. But online multiplayer... be prepared to grind for 300 hours just to have a fair fight against others, and even when you finally do a modder will just blow you up out of thin air or simply throw you out of your fighter jet as you take off. Really, the online is a sewer. People dont play the game, they just find what pisses you off most and do that over and over and troll hard as , and if you type back to them in chat you can almost physically feel them smile and be pleased with the growth of the cancerous tumor that is the GTA V online community. I guess if you have a modder friend or have mods yourself it can be pretty fun, in the right lobby. I have had some fun moments at the skate park with a couple friends on BMX bikes, car meets and races are pretty cool, and General shenanigans are common. Overall Certainly dont buy for full price, 60 after this many years is a little rediculous, and dont expect much from online. Singleplayer is golden.
