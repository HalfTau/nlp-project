Mission took 20 mins to get people to join, then halfway through someone leaves.....failed, leave mission, drive back home.....start mission again wait 20 min for more people.....dont forget 45 mins of load screens in there. NO! its not my pc... anytime a mission is done or going into the load screen is for everyone, i built 3000 dollar pc, its the game, the devs make all this content but dont fix game.....and then hackers....yup... dont forget about all of them..... dont buy for online!
