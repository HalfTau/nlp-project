As of recent, I wouldve loved to tell you to play a Rockstar made game. Now, now its not even worth giving them any more money. Ive purchased 5 copies of this game from my two Day 1 copies on Xbox 360, then short after I had bought my copy for Xbox One for my Day One edition. Then after the months of delay of the PC version. The day had come, and instantly bought and started to enjoy GTA V like weve never expierenced it before. Recently them taking away single player mods  modding all together just ruins what an open world game like GTA V has to offer. Honestly they could combat modding online in a different  easier way instead of just killing everyones hard work.
