This game is a very fun game. Great sandbox with lots of content and great modding possibility. I personally reccomend completing the story mode first, because it teaches you how to play without shoving tutorials into your face. If you play online you will most likely get given money by some random hacker and banned from the game. I think this game is worth its full price even though I got it in the sale.
