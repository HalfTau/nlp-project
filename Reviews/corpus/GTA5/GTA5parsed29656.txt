2K decided to swallow their decision and allow Open IV to continue development. The downside that remains from this however is that the highly anticipated mod Liberty City in GTA V has been cancelled as it goes against R Updated terms and conditions of mods. However I would still recomend this game. There is a lot of fun to be had here with the addictive single player story that pulls you into the lively world of Los Santos and the fun game modes and free roam in GTA Online. If you have a group of friends, the online portion is excellent and full of funny and cool moments to experience.
