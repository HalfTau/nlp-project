Damn am I split on this game. On the one hand the map is exceptional. The characters and story are pretty good. The world offers so much to explore and dic around with. The Online multiplayer adds hours of extra content to be had with friends and all around Ive very much enjoyed playing this game.On the other hand... The single player base game has gotten 0 attention. The multiplayer has turned into a pay to win fest with cheap, uninspired content being added every few weeks. The community sucks. And there isnt actually anything of substance to be gained from your hours. Just money, cars, guns, and repeated heists and minigames.They could have done more with the multiplayer and I am in firm disagreement with the Shark Card strategy they have adopted.I also can not condone spending 60 on an almost five year old game which is continually becoming a less viable use of time and which actively encourages you to spend extra money.But when it comes down to it I cant not recommend this game. If Online bothers you that much then the single player will still be a great game. I just cant recommend buying it for full price. Honeslty, if you dont own it yet its not going to kill you to wait for a sale.
