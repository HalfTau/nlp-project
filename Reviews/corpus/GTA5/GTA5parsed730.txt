The story wasnt the best of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, but the online was outstanding from spam fck hydra using twelve year olds, to the legitimate hard working players who earned everything they have.  For story just seek a game in the series like San Andreas or Liberty City, but thats my personal opinion.  The online is fun customizing your character then killing everybody in sight.
