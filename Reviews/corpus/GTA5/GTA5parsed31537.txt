If you were thinking about buying this game, forget about it. There were some very fun mods in this game, and T2 ust ruined it all. ScriptHookV is not going to be updated, and that was the only way that mods were able to be used. Until mods are not illegal, I do not recommend this game. Also, you do illegal stuff in this game all the time such as stealing a tank from the military. You gonna ban that too? If you already have the game, I kind of still recommend playing it, but it will not be nearly as much fun as it was with ScriptHookV.
