The singleplay of this game is pretty fun and i enjoyed the story. The multiplayer is a different story. Its frusturating as a noob because all the level 100 players kill you over and over. After that everything is a grind. Then you can loose all your money to a bunch of t. I spent a bunch of money on the gunrunning bunker. Stole a bunch of supplies. Had 200 grand worth of stock. Went to sell it and I was given a phantom wedge with a trailer to transport it. 2km from the drop off the phantom wedge explodes, obviously a scripted part of the mission. You then have to find a truck to transport it with. Wasted most of the time looking for a truck. When I found one I didnt make it to the drop off in time, about 5 seconds off and that causes you to loose all of the stock for some reason. So I had spent hours grinding for nothing. Waste of a bunch of time for minimal enjoyment and then anger. would not recomend online to anyone unless you enjoy pay to win, or want to try your hand at hacking the game.
