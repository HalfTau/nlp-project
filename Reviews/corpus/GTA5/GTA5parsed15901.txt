THE ONLINE PART OF THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE. I HAVE HAD TO CONTACT ROCKSTAR SUPPORT 4 TIMES IN THE PAST 2 MONTHS. MODDER AFTER MODDER AFTER MODDER. FRAMERATE DROPS TO 20 WHEN MODDERS SPAWN OBJECTS AND IT TAKES A TOLL ON YOUR GPU/CPU.IF ROCKSTAR WERENT SO GREEDY AND DIDNT MAKE IT UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT TO MAKE MONEY IN THE GAME, YOU WOULDNT HAVE PEOPLE BOWING DOWN TO THE MODDERS FOR INGAME MONEY.MODDERS ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THEIR NAME, MASKING THEIR USERNAME AS SOMEONE ELSE IN THE ROOM SO REPORTING IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS. YOU, ROCKSTAR. FOR 3 YEARS OF T.  YOU AGAIN.
