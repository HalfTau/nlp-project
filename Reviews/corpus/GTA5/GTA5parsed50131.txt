Grand Theft Auto V Single Player with mods was my favorite video game ever.  Vanilla GTA V is okay but thanks to the modding community it fleshed out into the game it was always supposed to be.  Rockstar laid a great foundation for videogamers and creative minds alike to produce a game with limitless entertainment.This recent CD on the developers of OpenIV by Take Two is upsetting beyond words.  Another symptom of the corporate greed that just HATES to let us be happy, because their millions just arent eingnough.  GTA Online isfor many reasons on top of the cheaters that wont be touched by this pathetic attempt at fixing a multiplayer game thats broken to the core.  So they have toon the best aspect of the game which is SP with mods?  I cant understand this.Shame on you Take Two...from me and the modding community who poured so many hours of hard work into making your game better, and doing your job for you for FREE out of the love of the art of videogames and not your meaningless profits.  This move represents everything thats actually wrong with this world.  Not even Trevor is that much of a monster.
