This game is absolutely amazing. The reason why I think it is because its gameplay and visuals orchestrate together to bring a game that is truly fun and in depth. The storymode on the other hand lacks the density that I enjoyed in past GTA games specialy in San Andreas. The online mode is still running well through out the years and is still very fun to play as well.My ratings areGraphics  10/10 Still beautiful in 2017Gameplay  9/10 Very optimised, Quite funOnline  8/10 Gives a new gameplay to experience, however it is hard to earn money
