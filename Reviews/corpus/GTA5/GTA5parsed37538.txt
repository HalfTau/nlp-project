Dont buy this game. Its wonderful but the business practices of Take Two are appalling and as far as theyre concerned 40 per copy for one of the top five bestselling games of all time isnt enough money. On top of their banning of mods theyve more than doubled the price of ingame currency from the already outlandish 40 for 8,000,000 which is NOT a lot in the online game to almost 100 for the same amount. Its currently showing 84.98 for that amount of ingame money but also says this is a 15 discount, making the standard price 100. Take Two needs to learn that gouging costomers after THEYVE ALREADY PAID YOU is not an acceptable business practice in the games industry or anywhere else. Do not buy GTA5.
