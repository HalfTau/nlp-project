TakeTwo is a bunch of money grubbing jews. Banning OpenIV was a bad move on theyre part. It didnt happen in GTA IV because there was no microtransactions. GTA V of course has shark cards and that means oh no theyre unwilling to buy this stupid ingame money even though the game costs 60 euro.And yes, OpenIV is for singeplayer modding. But that makes it even more rediculous. Thats like taking legal action against singleplayer cheats.
