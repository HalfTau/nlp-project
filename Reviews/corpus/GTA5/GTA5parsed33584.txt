Full controller support my Steam controller configs all start ingame recording because Rock has not enabled mouse and controller input at the same time.Asides from that, TakeTwo has ruined the game by banning mods years after the games release/theyve been made available. Glad to see my onlineconnected games losing feautures like this!
