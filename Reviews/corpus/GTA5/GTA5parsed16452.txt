This game is absolutely absurd, I tried logging on GTA Online without realizing I had mods on LSPDFR, Rage hook, etc. Within 24 hours I got an email from rockstar stating I got temp banned and stat reset. You think im going to grind for that virtual currency again? No thank you. If you thought I was gonna spend that hardearned money on the new overpriced DLC Vehicles, you can forget about that. Hoping RDR doesnt turn out like GTA Online.
