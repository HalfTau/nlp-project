First of all, i can recommend GTA V! Little bit detailedPros huge, open city whit many playable things great graphics great sound effects, perfect voices and music some very enjoyable main and side mission good handling played whit controllerCons In my opinion the main story is too long and can not able to keep up my interesting until the endhowever i completed the main story. I mean there are some repetitive and filling mission. the optimalization is better than it was at GTA 4 but far away from perfect you can not change the default cars some cases the yellow, indicator ring is too small and it is little bit difficult to discover it
