Well, I suppose its time. Time to review...Where do I start? The game is overall... Just great.The campaign is pretty long, with a bunch of interesting and unique people, theres plenty of stuff to do even after the main storyline and a lot of toys to play with. Im currently on my 2nd playthrough of the campaign and it still feels fresh and new. But anyway, enough with the campaign. Its time for theattraction in my opinion. Its time for...Ahhh GTA Online. A breath of fresh air for me after I finished the campaign. When I clicked the Play GTA Online button for the first time, I was promted by a character creation screen. After creating a character, I was in the game! After I completed the tutorial, I was in my first freeroam lobby. At first I was unsure of what to do. After playing the campaign, I was expecting a big red DO THIS THING sign pointing me in the right direction. However, I did not see any. The first major flaw with GTA Online in my opinion, is that it doesnt really give you any tips. It just chucks you in to the lobby, says Have fun kid! and then leaves you to yourself. My advice to you is this play races, PvP missions or any other jobs, get a high end apartment and do heists. Once you have a bit of money, buy a CEO office or a bunker and starting getting better money! Anyway, Ive been rambling. Better wrap this up.Yes. Just yes. Absolutely.9.5 / 10 Would buy a flying jet bike and do backflips again.
