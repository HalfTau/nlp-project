I hardly played this game outside of single player and Take Two shuts down a modding tool that literally only works in single player just to boast that they did something about hacking in GTA Online. It did quite literally nothing, No GTA hacks Ive seen utilized OpenIV at all, and it shows. Hackers have been just as rampant as they always are. Honestly, I imagine they did this in some crappy attempt to force players to play Online more, and have all the microtransaction BS shoved down their throats.Congrats, Take Two Interactive, you played with fire and ended up burning most of your consumer base.
