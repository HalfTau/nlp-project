Too Unreliable to recomend.Its pretty fun when it works, but having the best game in the world is useless if you cant play it.Every time it takes several attempts to load, a problem also experienced by 4 of my friends.Playing with 16GB Ram, game and windows running from a high end SSD, intel core i7, GTX980. Really shouldnt have a problem.
