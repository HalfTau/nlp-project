So imma make this simple. Everything is incredibly overpriced, takes hours to make any type of money, repeating the same misson or the same heist over and over is incredibly boring and makes almost no money compared to prices, the terms put in are so strict that recording software can get you a perma ban, single player modding is now banned, ceo missions and other club missions instigate toxicity due to rewarding players for ing with you, lack of support toward false bans and the agression when trying to appeal. Now you know this game in a nutshell.
