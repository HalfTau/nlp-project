With OpenIV available again, Im changing my review to positive. Mods are really needed to make this a better game, not just graphics, but also things that used to be a part of previous GTAs, like police, ambulance, trucking and train driving missions. Would not recommend buying it unless on sale though, as online is full of cheaters and obnoxious kids and most of the good stuff requires a fair amount of grinding.
