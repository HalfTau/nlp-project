TakeTwo killed this game, and all future titles of theirs.  To claim that mods are illegal is like saying that putting a nonstock air filter on your car is illegal.   them and their lawyers.  I hope that business pressure within the company makes their CEOs kill themselves... even though in reality, I know they sleep very well at night.  Pathetic human beings at the top of an even more pathetic company.Rockstar really didnt have much to do with this one, despite their past discressions.
