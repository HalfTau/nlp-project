Great storyline for sure. Online tho makes it not worth its actual price 60 . The game is already expensive to start with and were not even started yet. Grinding your first million is legit hard. Best way to start things off is the flying school 250 k  but then youre in for a whole lot of trouble. It takes you WEEKS to earn good money afterwards to start businesses and accelerate your money making process. Grinding is just way too slow gotta make dem peasants pay for the shark cards. Yes the games fun and quite unique but damn bruh you gotta play that game a lot to have your yacht in the end. Oh and one more thing the hackers are found on a regular basis basically half of the session youll join which shows you Rockstars capabilities on the subject x. tldr  Overall good but not worth it.
