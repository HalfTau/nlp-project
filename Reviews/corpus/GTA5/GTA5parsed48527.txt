As a modder I am very disappointed in this game and Rockstar in general. I dont recommand buying this game. The multiplayer is buggy, loading screens can take 10 minutes and you just end up being kicked. On top of all that, there is a lot of server lag. As for the singleplayer, it was good and not as buggy, which is why most people chose to play singleplayer. Recently Rockstar has decided to kill modding for singleplayer because it allowed people to cheat in multiplayer. Meanwhile they dont even bother fixing the lag and all the bugs in multiplayer.
