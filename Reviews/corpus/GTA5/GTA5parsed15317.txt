This used to be the perfect game to play with friends. All of our characters had a bunch of money. It was the only game that all of my friends agreed to play. When Rockstar released the gunrunners update they reduced almost all of our accounts cash to 0. My friends still sort of played but it became clear it was impossible to play the game without spending a thousand dollars in real cash on it. This game used to be perfect but now because of it Im never buying another rockstar game.
