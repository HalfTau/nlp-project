Been playing GTA on console for about 2 years, switched to pc as soon as I got one, and oh my god, its amazing, and if you have a good pc you should install a graphics mod like redux, I got it and it looks like real life, and with a pc you can get higher fps. I for example have an Radeon rx580 8gb, 16gb ram, ryzen 7 1700 oc 3.7Ghz, and I have redux mod, and it honestly looks like real life, and I still play at a very solid 60fps. If you dont have a good pc I dont recommend, but if you do, get this game. The game itself is very fun to play, the storyline will make you laugh out loud, and it is very well written. Online is a whole nother story, it is updated like crazy, awesome vehicles, but it is very much a grind now, and its very boring unless you pay extra cash for ingame money, or if you mod online, but this will result in a ban if rockstar finds out. So its very hard to have fun online when you are nonstop making little money, and not enjoying whats in the freeroam. I personally mod offline, which is perfectly gone, and its really fun. All in all its fun, but wait until black Friday or Christmas or any other sale, so you can get this game cheaper, I know for sure black Friday and Christmas it is 50 off, which is a really good deal. Back to the redux mod, you should get it if your pc can handle it, it causes a 515fps drop from the original fps, but not only does it make the graphics look insanely real, it is a complete overhaul of the game, better explosions, better ragdoll, better water, waaaaay better reflections  My favorite, and the weight of the car when turning, stopping, and going is very realistic. Also the plantlife sways in the wind better, and the sky and environment looks real instead of like the vanilla which looks like a filter. I give it a 7/10 regular vanilla version, 10/10 with redux and other fun mods you can add to the game. This is just my 2 cents.
