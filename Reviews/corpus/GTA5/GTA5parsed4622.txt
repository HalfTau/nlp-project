I recommend this game as its a overall very joyful experience. The single player is great and you could spends at least a couple hours on it with everything you can do. Also there is a multiplayer that is still being updated with mnew content to this day despite its release date being from 2015. To add on to its age, the game looks beautiful. just amazing for it being from 2015. So in conclusion if you can buy this game do it, you wont be dissapointed due to its overall greatness.
