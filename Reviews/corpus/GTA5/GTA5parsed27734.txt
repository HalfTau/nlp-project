This game is just OK now. It was great until rockstar started their complete war on modding. GTA V Online is the only reason to play this game, and they slowly started making that more like an MMO in the aspect of grinding. There is so much grinding to do anything in this game now that I dont understand how anyone could ever have the time to play it 100 legit. Its almost as if they responded to people hacking by giving them more insentive to hack it.
