The plot sucked. I couldnt relate to any of the characters because they were written to appeal to 12year olds. The game is prettyish. Since the game is pretty big and theres a lot going on I guess they had to be sensible about the graphics to give a smooth experience. Speaking of the open world, getting around with jets and helicopters would have been fun but the controls are a mess. I cant remap the controls to how I like so I just gave up flying and went back to Battlefield 4. Now they banned mods, so this game pretty much has nothing going for it. I cant recommend this game in good concience.
