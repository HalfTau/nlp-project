Im recommending it ONLY for the story mode and singleplayer mods I first got this game on Xbox 360 for christmas back in the day. The story mode was great played through the whole thing, and enjoyed Trevors oneliners as I viciously run over peds.Then I tried GTA Online dear CHRIST was it bad hackers in every lobby, highrankingthat KoS every chance they get, corrupted as HELL economic system, and to top it all off, getting banned for NO REASON. and that was on the 360 version Im not even touching thr PC version of GTA O, because from what I hear, it is pure dogOver all, the reason Im recommending GTA V is purely for the singleplayer. avoid GTA O at all costs.
