got banned becuase i joined a random lobby with some guy who was money dropping... i got banned for it. Rockstar does not know how to monitor this game at all. not to mention they started suing random people for even single player modding and then they charge close to 100 for 8mill in game. if you wanted to buy the new vehicles and wepaons from the arms dlc you would need approx over 75mill so in other words rockstar expects you to pay over 600 REAL MONEY. This company is so corrupt and i am never purchasing another game from them ever. not to mention im gonna promote hate to this company on every social media site there is. ROT IN HELL ROCKSTAR YOU ING CONSP.S im using my buddys old account and money dropping every public match i can join just to boycotthis disgusting company...
