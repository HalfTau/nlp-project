untill Rockstar and Take Two get their head out of their behinds and start giving the pc community the respect we deserve by releasing games on both console and pc on the same month at leastand giving us red dead , and they dont have to support mods but at least not actively shut them down, I recommend every gamer who enjoys playing on pc and wants to keep the platform going strong stay away from T2 and Rockstar as if they where a pile of smelly droppings.this is unfair treatment and Im a not buying a single T2 or rockstar game utill this stops.p.s yes I really wanted to use more adult phrasing but I didnt... youre wellcome.
