What was once a fun game, now ruined for many people thanks to Take 2 interactive. I myself never really cared for heavily modifying the single player aspect of the game, but I can understand how it hurt many others all because it was hurting Take 2s bs Shark card Revenue. It was never about protecting the online portion of the game from harassment. its always about profit. Dont put this bs blame on Open IV, because you cant put together a functioning Anticheat system. Sorry R, but you better ditch this department of yours otherwise youre looking at a grim future like Ubisoft is in. Let this be a nail in the coffin. Definitely wont be supporting RDR2 until this has been resolved by means of something else. Sorry R.
