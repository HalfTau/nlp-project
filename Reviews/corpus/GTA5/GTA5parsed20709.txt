The Multiplayer is micro transactioned to hell. so unless you likecash out of your wallet its not fun. The single player is lacking a lot of content that is in the game specifically to force people into the miultiplayer. And theyre killing the modding community to prevent people from resisting this.They then proceded to lie to the community claiming the single player mods were affecting the online side.
