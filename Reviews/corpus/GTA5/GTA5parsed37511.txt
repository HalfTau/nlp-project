I spent over 2000 building a computer for the exclusive reason of playing GTA V with single player mods. I was able to ignore the fact that the core game elements such as shadow  texture issues or poor optimization  frame rate inconsistencies were not being addressed or repaired with updates, because I was able to enjoy the game in other ways by using Open IV. Playing GTA V any way that I pleased was one of the only joys that I had to look forward to at the end of my hectic days, and I believe that a lot of people can relate to that. Take Two has angered an enormous community of people who have invested a lot of time, and money, and hard work into this game. I dont know if they will ever be able to live it down unless they make it right very soon. The damage has been done, but they still have the power to fix it. I urge them to do right by all of us who have put a tremendous amount of effort into playing and loving this game. This is very important to a lot of people.
