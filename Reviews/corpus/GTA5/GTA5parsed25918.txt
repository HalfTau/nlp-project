Blatant online cashgrab at all costs, spiralling online costs to fuel microtransactions and a complete abandonment of single player to push this further... And now a war against the community that supports this game through the random and baseless decision to destroy its single player modding scene to eliminate the hackers that the overpriced and poorly maintained online aspect of the game has created.GG TakeTwo, you definitely dont want your competitors to hog all the negative press that comes from milking and abusing the community that supports them.
