Single Player  loved it. Buy it for this.Online  Hate it.The online aspect of this game while promising falls very short of anything fun. It is very difficult to make money unless you have a good crew and friends to play with. Cheaters are everywhere. You can do hiests as someone almost always drops out in the middle of a mission forcing you to quit. Veterns spend there time just killing other players for fun. The new updates while they may be fun, really just opens up an aviation superiority problem. People who can afford the new heavily weaponized aircraft just go around bombing the crap out of the poor saps on the ground trying to make money to buy the new stuff. You cant move anything on the ground without someone just blowing you to peices from the sky anymore. Unless you have a thousand dollars laying around to by the outragiously priced shark cards, you will never be able to rank up and make money in multiplayer to have any real fun.
