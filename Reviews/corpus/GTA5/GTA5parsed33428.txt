All they care about is money. They took away modding from the game to attempt to make more of it, disregarding almost all of its PC fanbase. Please do not give them more money by buying this game as it is dead without modding. GTA V Online is boring as every DLC that they release has rediculously expensive content and almost forces you to buy their Shark Cards. There we see again, more money wanted by the devs. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME PLEASE
