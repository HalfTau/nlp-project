Fun game ruined by loading times and lack of support for private servers.The single player is probably fun.Multiplayer is designed in a way that it tries to get you to buy their shark cards ingame money and the loading times / connection times are horrible. Often youll also get disconnected from lobbies.Multiplayer is probably best played by just doing the heists once with a group of friends and forgetting the game after.
