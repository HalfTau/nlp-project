Good game right? Wanna play for hours and hours with you friends and complete heists? Possibly even attempt the criminal mastermind challange and due to the fact that they took away character transfers for no reason buy a shark card edition of the game.WELL IF YOU WANT ALL THIS DONT CHANGE THE ING SETTINGS!!!!! !If you change the settings then be ready to get shafted. I changewd some settings and the game restarted as it normally would then when it did restart the game crashed i have verified integrity of game files and have gone into the settings folder i have even unistalled and reinstalled the game with my slowinternet just for the game to not work again.The game has always been fun and for the time i played the game it was fun aside from the fact i had to buy a shark card DLC. You can have loads of fun with your mates but if the game crashes you pretty much say goodbye to it. One of my friends had a silmilar problem but a differnt  error, he had a memory error and he couldnt start up the game himself.Rockstar customer support is terrible and now i have to beg steam for a refund even though i technically cannot get one this means i have wasted my money for a few laughs and a hole load of stress.
