Id held off on leaving a negative review due to the excellent moddable singleplayer, but now were stuck with vanilla sp for the forseeable Its time to vent about the dreadful online experience.From as early as a fortnight after release to present day with a few very brief moments of respite after major updates the online portion of this game has been absoloutely rife with cheaters to the point of unplayability. GTA online uses an easily exploitable peer to peer network model similar to the call of duty series where the players client is trusted for pretty much all data such as position, amount of health, weapon damage, vehicle speed... you get the idea. This gives those with the ability to inject nefarious code unprecedented control over other players such as the ability to freeze you in place, or spawn objects in your field of view that will cause your game to crash.It also has an mmolite style progression system and a focus on grinding, with the idea that those willing to put in the most work will rise to the top and become crime bosses acting as anchorpoints for a lot of the freeroam sandbox gameplay buying/selling shipments of various illegal products, pve encounters and inter organizational gang wars while those newer to the game can tag along as muscle and earn enough to eventually set themselves up as a big boss, whether that be a sharply dressed CEO, a grimy biker gang president, a cut and shut stolen car dealer, an arms dealer or any combination of the above.Unfortunately, the games currency is easily hacked and a combination of basic human nature everyone wants to be the boss after all, and why specialize when you can have everything? and take2s ludicrous ingame pricing of items and miserly pricing of shark cards a way to purchase digital currency for real world cash have created a fertile black market for third parties selling tools to hack the game. Youtube has provided the marketing and the end result is its almost impossible to play the game as the developers originally intended on this platform.The games recent updates are designed around groups of players competing to buy and sell various types of cargo around the game world and theres a certain thrill in fending off a rival organization to make a sucessful sale. Whats far more likely though is youll be pulled from your vehicle and exploded remotely or teleported to an unkillable player and shot dead, losing your progress. At its worst, usually immediately following the update of a well known mod menu every 32 player session has a minimum of five cheaters running mod menus and the vast majority of them have a major chip on their shoulder and features at their disposal to easily prevent you enjoying the game. This also has a negative impact on  connectivity creating lag and frequent disconnects. Cheaterss ability to spawn in objects also effects performance as these will persist between sessions and can only be removed from the game world by restarting your client.The laughable part is that all of this could have been easily preventable by investing a little more in the games network infrastructure before launch or at least made more difficult for the hackers by licensing a third party anticheat, but to save costs and increase revenue the publishers have allowed cheaters to run rampant and taken draconian measures against those seeking to provide an alternative.If you are considering buying the game at this late stage in its life for the online portion alone please reconsider as its simply an excercise in frustration.Id be amazed if they could turn it around at this point.
