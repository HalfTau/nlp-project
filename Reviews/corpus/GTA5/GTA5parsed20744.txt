WARNING The online game attracts horrible people and is filled with cheaters and toxic players. Most of this can be avoided... if play in private sessions.Also, Rockstar should be considered worse than EA at this point as well with the auto customer support and awful microtransactions that have made them BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, setting a precident that paid games are a service that needs to be furnished with extra money.HOWEVER, there is a case to be made for this game as you can see in my short review belowGood singleplayer that has mod support. The writing is solid and the missions are fun. You can expect anywhere from 30200 hours of interesting gameplay there depending on how much you like sidequesting and finding collectables. I personally havent touched mods and cannot guess how many hours that can add.Online is a pretty good time waste with friends. But, people tend to focus on the overbearing cost of the online items price points and tend to forget that there are many missions and races that are very fun to do and dont need hours of grinding. If you want to grind for cars that you use in free roam you can do that... or you can play many missions that are all very fun to do. I do suggest a mix of both and only playing the online with friends. If you think that cheaters are bad in games such as PAYDAY 2 and CSGO, the cheaters in this game can do so much more to you than god mode and aim hack. You can expect anywhere from 501000 hours here.
