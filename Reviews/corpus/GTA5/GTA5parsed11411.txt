If you are looking for a great singleplayer experience, you can ignore this review. Youre getting what you pay for there.If on the other hand youre looking to play GTA Online I cannot recommend the game anymore. Its fun in theory but the way Rockstar handles stuff is just awful. Not only are they completely helpless with the cheater situation in the game but their attempts to stop them actually hit legit players as well. Ive earned quite a good amount of in game cash during one of their double money weeks shortly before the last major DLC hit and Rockstar in an attempt to remove cheated/modded money removed 7 million thats the equivalent of about 80 real life bucks from my account. Ingame money I had earned through their event. Ive contacted the support multiple times only to receive responses that either claimed the money was cheated or threatened to ban me.After about 5 support tickets I gave up. Rockstar Games is scamming their own customers, and thats why I cant recommend being a customer of Rockstar Games anymore. If you already have the game and still play GTA Online Id recommend doing the following Go online and search for a cheater willing to give you modded money, proceed to get as much modded money as possible and spend as much of it as you can. Never even think about playing the game legitimately to earn money and for gods sake dont buy shark cards.Cheers.
