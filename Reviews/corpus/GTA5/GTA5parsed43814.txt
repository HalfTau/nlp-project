Dont support aggressive money hungry developers.Take2 is using its legal team to destroy the modding scene for this game. Dont buy this game for two reasons. One, if you like multiplayer games with fun, funtional netcode and all that, you wont get that here. Theres a massive paywall seconds into the game due to an inflated economy that only favors people who pay microtransactions, and two, if you like mods, well say goodbye to that too. Take2 just recently hit the largest modding resource for GTAV with a cease and desist, so what was once a fantastic modding scene is now dying off with little hope of being saved. The only way we as a market are going to resist this deplorable business practice of developers shoving extra payed content down our throats is if we stand up and stop handing them our money. So please, crush Take2 by not giving in to their cashgrabbing practices.
