Im approaching about 2k hours in this, and I highly recommend this game. Theres something for everyone, whether youre just a casual gamer who wants to mess around, do some whacky stuff, or if you want to join up with a crew and explore the game content together. I hooked up with a really awesome group early on and weve been enjoying the game for going on two years as a crew. This is something you can play for a little bit, or as long as you like, because DLC and updates are always dropping with new content.Now, keep in mind, this is a Grand Theft Auto title....which means there are going to be plenty of randoms who just want to blowup. If you can deal with that, its really a fine title and a staple as far as GTA games go.
