Over the past 2 days I have raked up 14 hours in this game... I never play games for that long in such a short time. So far the story is nice and Franklin seems to be my fave so far. The multiplayer however much people hate it, yes you will be killed, yes you will be bmd, yes its a grind. But how is that different to any other online game? I dont care about the heists or anything like that the racing is really fun though with friends, jsut dont try hard, and just have fun, ram eachother off the road, laugh at there missfortunes and shoot eachothers tires out and just have fun! I read some negitive reveiws from people who have lots of hours but after that long in games. I am suprised you are still playing it, maybe the end game is boring but so far, so good. Im gona go and do some more races with my mates now! See ya!
