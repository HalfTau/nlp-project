Ive always recommend this game to my friend. There is no limitations for players, and you can get all the skills you need in only story mode. You can simply enjoy the story line and get trained. For the online mode, with high degree of freedom, there is a big differences between competitive games and GTA5. You can build your own world, make money in any way you want, or simply just go sightseeing when youre down. For me, its a more relaxing game than a contesting game, sometimes you would be killed, though. But in this game you shouldnt think too much. Just do what you wanna do, commit crimes.
