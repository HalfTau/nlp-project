Take Two doesnt give aabout the games community right now. If a publisher acts like this, I refuse to support the game.Taking away modding, because it totally reduces the number of hackers right? Wrong.Take Two just took the easy route and doesnt care about the community the game has created.I love the game, the graphics, and the game. It is one of my alltime favorite games, but if Take Two doesnt get their act together, I cant recommend anyone get this game.Was hyped for the next GTA game, but Im going to be boycotting until Take Two reverses their decision on Open IV.
