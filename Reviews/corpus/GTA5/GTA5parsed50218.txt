I bought this game for PS3, PS4 and had a blast. The it was announced on PC and the ONLY reason I bought for the THIRD TIME was to play this game with mods. Been able to play as The Flash, driving a ferrari, shooting whales at people with a minigun was super fun... But you had to mess it up by taking down OpenIV.Not cool Take Two.
