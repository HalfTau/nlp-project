This game is still stunning, the attention to dtails is really impressive. The single player mode is a really nice satire of the world of today.GTA Online is pure fun, but can be sometimes annoying when you meet people cheating / modding ingame.The free content added regularly keeps the online alive.Get a decent PC before considering playing it, its worth it.
