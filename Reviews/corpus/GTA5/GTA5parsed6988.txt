Ive played GTA games my entire life, and sadly I cant recommend this game to a single person.  I waited years for this to come out, and Rockstar hason the title with their greedy and uncaring ways.  Never have I played a game with so many cheaters and such an uncaring developer, and Ive played PUBG.  Rockstar ban waves cheaters, but they only do this because it brings in more revenue.  I am truly sad to say this game is a waste of time unless youre going to cheat, or play souly offline.  I have well over 1000 hours in this game between xbox and PC. Both are ruined, save your money.
