I dont play Online at all. Singleplayer was fantastic, but felt greatly stripped down in order to sell Online content. I get that companies follow the money, but leaving singleplayer in the state they did was a mistake on their part.Also, they seem to be a little ban happy in Online. Instead of adjusting the market, Rockstar just bans players who want to experience all the content without shelling out reallife money. They dont ban players who straight up cheat, just the ones who cheat for ingame cash. Thats the reason Im never going to buy Shark Cards or even play Online.Singleplayer gets a 10/10. Online gets a 0/10 for Rockstars handling of it.
