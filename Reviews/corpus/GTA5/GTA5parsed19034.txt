Single PlayerThe Single Player is beyond one of the most enjoyable campaigns I have ever played. The story is good and the characters are diverse. Its also a lot of fun to use Native Trainer/Open IV/ etc. to mod and break the game sometimes. Ive had loads of fun playing the fun and story driven missions. The first person view isnt the best camera angle you want to use but its very considerate for Rockstar to add a feature like that into the game. The playtime is astronomically long and the only bad thing I can say about he single player is that the controls on Keyboard/Mouse are really hard to use while in combat or just freeroaming. So I definitely recommend you use a controller.MultiplayerSwitching my Characters from PS4 to PC was painless. I was lucky to be able to transfer my account without any errors. But Online is just as bad as it was on console. Most of the missions I played were very unsatisfying and gave low rewards. Everything is just so damn expensive! Im very disappointed in Rockstar for implementing this terrible economy and having you to buy Shark cards to get the things you want. The shark cards are a rip off, 20 in real life money for 1 million dollars in game money is a terrible deal. The apartments dont give that much purpose either Except for storing cars which you can buy a stand alone garage for much less. The heists are very frustrating. If youre doing it with trusted friends then it wont be so bad Besides the super long mission. But if youre playing solo it might be a rough time for you. If one player screws up a part of the plan the whole mission restarts. I just wish Rockstar would make the missions a lot more pleasant and fulfilling. The Online portion of the game is not that great and very stressful. I wish Rockstar would listen to the community and take into consideration of the Communities Reviews and Complaints.
