When I purchace a game, I expect to OWN that copy of the game. That means single player mods shouldnt be a problem. Well thanks to Take Two Interactive, I can no longer enjoy the game I payed for to my satisfaction. I already owned the game on Xbox 360. I bought this copy mostly so I could mod it.Dont buy this game until Take Two changes their polacy on Open IV.sign this petition
