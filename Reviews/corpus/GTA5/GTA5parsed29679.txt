Ignoring the whole Take 2 Fiasco, this game is still not the best. The singleplayer mode has a story that lasts about 2 hours max, very basic side missions that feel like the most thrown together afterthought in the history of gaming, and the online experience is so  that the only people playing it anymore are trolls.To put it simply Rockstar and Take 2 dont care about you. They care about your money, and if youre stupid enough to fall for their tricks ... you have no right to complain when gaming is nothing but paytowin t.
