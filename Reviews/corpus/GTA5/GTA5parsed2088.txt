A fantastic openworld game. A massive environment with hours of content and activities to complete. Not to mention the great driving and shooting controls. Only complaints go into the length of the story and how it can go on for a bit too long. Also the map can be a bit overwhelming at times due to its size at times. Overall though, one of the finest openworld games out there.
