Dont ever think to buy this game just because you want to play GTA Online.1. Hard to earn money. Especially if you play solo without any friend. Or, youre okay to spend your time for hours just to get money, doing repetitive missions. I only tried few heists, and vehicle warehouse. The time you spend is not really worth it. Mostly I am just doing VIP Missions. But I might be wrong about this.2. A lot of expensive toys. 1 million is nothing in this game. Back to number 13. Modders/hackers on your session. You can set your own private public lobbies on your own. But, be careful. You dont know what will gonna happen later.4. When there is no Modders/hackers on your session, High level players usually kill you or ruining your missions.But if you buy this game for single player only, It is definitely worth it. This game is fun, even the story is amazing. And if you getting bored playing vanilla game, there is a lot of mods out there.10/10 for Single Player6/10 for GTA OnlineThumbs Up only for Single Player.
