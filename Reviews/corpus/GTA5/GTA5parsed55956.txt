The devs do nothing to stop the rampant hacker problem in GTA Online. The best they do is catch a small percentage and wipe their account/money, without tackling the root of the problem.You see new accounts with millions and millions, and it is just not worth the insane amount of hours of grinding to make enough money to buy anything newly released.
