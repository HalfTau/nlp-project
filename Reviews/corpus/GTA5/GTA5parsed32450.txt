Look, Im not on the wagon that we should totally boycott rockstar. I completely dissagree with their choices to deny modding especially single player mods. If people that want to mod cant? Return the game.. dont buy it, Vote with your wallet. If you dont want to mod then fine buy it! Unless you want to support those that have a problem with this anti mod practices.Rockstar... cmon guys wtf.
