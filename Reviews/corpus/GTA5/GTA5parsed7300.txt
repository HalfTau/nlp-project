Game is super glitch and full of hackers. This is just another EA style money grab! They make everything stupid expensive. They make the missions or objectives repeatative and prone to failures outside of your control. There is also a good chance you do everything right and it just fails cause of a glitch and your out days worth of work, Serious FK you Rockstar! Dont waste your time or money here, go play anything else.
