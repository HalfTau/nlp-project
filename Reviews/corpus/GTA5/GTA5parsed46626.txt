I really do love this game, have since i bought it, but with OpenIV being cut out of the picture the whole reason i have kept playing for so long has also been removed. How TakeTwo could be so lame as to allow this when OpenIV does not work online at all, is byond me. So there are hackers, and they attack your online game, go after them! All you have done here is attack the thousands of Single Player gamers and taken their fun away.I stand with the OpenIV Team!! !With OpenIV back, i will happily change my review to positive, as i love the game, play endless hours in singleplayer mode, if you want a fun game to loose youself in for hours and are pro modding, then this is a great singleplayer title to add to your list.
