Alright so before i get started on this game, just a tiny bit of disclaimer, I am currrently in Jail as of now because of the game. So lets start! This game is a 10/10 in my books and yall should definitely spend all your money into this game. I have been playing this game non stop for the past two days and it has taught me alot of things for example, how to carry a gun and rob a store, or even how to plan a heist on a bank. Well even though im in jail due to trying to plan a heist on a local bank in my area, i have definitely found many great tips and learining points in this game therefore you should definitely buy it.
