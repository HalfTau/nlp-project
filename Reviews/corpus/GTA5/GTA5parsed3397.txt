I will talk about GTAO only because single player is no real issue here endless loadings microtransactions are not necessary but the prices they want for things that you need to buy if you want to play heists, missions etc. are stupidly hillarious. R  EA if you are a causal player it takes really long time to earn something in this game and the way of earning money is just repeating the same heists and missions over and over again in the case if you could play those heists on your own and not only as a random team member Races, stunt series, deathmatches or world events are entertaining Heists if its played by a group of four people, speaking with each other its really funIf you want to buy it then do it at the steam sales. Its fun for a few hours until you realise how stupidly some things are made by Rockstar and how it kills the whole game.
