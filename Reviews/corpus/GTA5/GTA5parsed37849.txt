Given that the Grand Theft auto series is my namesake, my recommendation of the game should be a surprise. Let me explainI was on strike 2 of 3 for modding online, which is fair enough, the game had little content at the time and I had done everything there was to do, so I was a little bored of GTA V at the time, but after that 2nd ban, I come completely clean, given that the game had a lot more new things to do and I enjoyed the game asis once more.Suddenly I discovered that shader mods were a thing, and I decided to try one out, being careful to not even begin loading Online while having this shader mod installed. I decided that it was hindering my performance too much, so I got rid of the mod and decided to completely reinstall GTA V, and proceed to play Online. I was met with a screen that informed me that I was permanently banned from playing Online. Because of a SHADER MOD. ON SINGLE PLAYER.And now reading more recent reviews, it seems Rockstar and Take Two have banned modding in the game as a whole. Including single player. I simply cannot recommend a game that doesnt even allow modding single player.Im no longer going to support Rockstar or Take Two. This is an astronimical let down for me.Go ahead and tell me I deserve my ban considering I modded in Online before, but that still doesnt excuse Rockstar and Take Twos decision to put an end to all modding.
