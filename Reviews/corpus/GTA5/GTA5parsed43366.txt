TakeTwo and probably Rockstar should not get away with this insult.Erasing the modding community, and trying to milk every cent the players have.The economy is so beyond busted because of people cheating money into the online. At this point though, I honestly cant blame them considering they CANT get the cool cars and features in the SP because TakeTwo wants you to go buy them Online. So unless you want to grind for weeks on end nonstop, people are just gonna cheat money in because the amount of real cash they want you to shell out is beyond ALL reason.All Im gonna say is, if you wanna play with mods get an older cracked version that would support SP mods still.And dont even entertain GTA Online by trying to grind their lowpay quests for their hugely expensive virtual cars, and ESPECIALLY do not support these practices with your own hardearned money.Its just not worth the grind either.I stand by OpenIV by putting out this review, fck you TakeTwo.
