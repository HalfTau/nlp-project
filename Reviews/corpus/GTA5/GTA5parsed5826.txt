The game is not bad, but its not good either....The story is not bad, but from the start it feels slow, I had difficulties going thru with the story at the beggining because of that, but luckily the game got interesting pretty quick.This game has three playable characters its the first in the series to have three playable characters, each with their unique style and personality, and gives a sense of theres no main character, but there is a main character, Michael.The story is clear from the beggining, its all about him, his family, present life and ghosts, his retirement, and Franklin and Trevor are there to fill in the gaps, even tho they have stories on their own, and its not a bad thing, it makes the game more dinamic and gives you a rest from each character, I liked that.Im not playing the online mode, Im not sure if Ill ever play it, so I cant say anything about it.
