Well tbh I could not be bothered to write a whole review on gta v.Well firstly I have 2 copies of gta v on my pc one modded for offline play and a fresh install for playing gta v multiplayer to its full. To remove openiv which has been around the time of most gta games for modding the gta series for extended fun was a big mistake. Gta v is only popular to this day because of mods and to  over the loyal fans of the franchise like this is horrible. However short and sweet BAD IDEA TAKE TWO!
