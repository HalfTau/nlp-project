me as a person that has no intentions to play online am disgusted withn take twos attack on the modding community. modding was the only reason i switched from console gaming to pc. all it does is personalize the users experience not affect the online portion of the game.rockstar might as well quit making ports for pc because after this its pretty much a wrap! fk  ROCKSTAR  TAKE TWO!
