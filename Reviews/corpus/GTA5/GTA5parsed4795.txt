I have played literally every Grand Theft Auto Game since I was a wee lad. I enjoy them. I have watched the evolution into multiplayer. If you want a game where you can literally do anything you want from beating up people to racing to stealing cash cars guns and drugs, then this is the game for you. If not, its probably still one of the best games out there. I play this game with my family, I enjoy most sessions, except for when some dirtbag is modding and kiling us all20 of the time. This game pushes my pc harder, looks better, and has more content than any game released, ever. you can go watch a movie, tv, throw snowballs, hack computers and fly helicopters or even jets. I have a jetpack, lowriders and a garage full of motorcycles. You can take selfies. Try it, you will not regret it, except for the worlds most annoying introafter you have had to play it eleven times. Graphics 10/10, gameplay 10/10, modders 0/10, fun 11/10.
