Cant connect up to friends. Connecting up to friends was no problem when i bought this but after the refund tmes were up, i start joining lobbies that are empty and only me in the server. This is useful to do CEO missions without any modders constantly exploding you but i dont need any more cash from CEO stuff. I do heists instead.
