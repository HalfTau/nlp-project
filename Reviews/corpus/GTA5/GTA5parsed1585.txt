The singleplayer brings an interesting criminal story, filled with scripted action and twists. Well, I guess, its a must for every gamer who respects him or herself. I enjoyed that, its perfectly done, it delivers you a lot of freedom and shows you some new ways of amusement and entertainment inside virtual world. Great job, R, this was 9/10, that 1 point is taken away for... I dunno, this game lacks something, butYes, its true, there are cheaters here they are called modders. Yes, they ruin all the game process. Yes, this is annoying. Yes, the puiblic community is cancerish. Yes, there are jerks and metagamers. Yes, today you gotta grind to get the best of DLCs.However, I cant stop enjoying GTAO. Its awesome. First of all,  you can always join a GTAgang and play with adequate people on gangservers. Its okay there to compete, its okay there to cooperate. So just get to it!Secondly, missons and grinding with a friend or two is awesome. I play GTAO with my gf... Well, she is not much of a shooter, but she was happy to buy luxury appartments, clothes for both of us and she also is a good driver, so she helped me out many times with resupplies for my bunker. We are running 2 orgs now. She rules Los Santos, I  Sandy Shores. Helping each other and fighting some... bad NPCs is nice. Best criminal coop RPG with open world, cars and guns customizations and much more.With friends it always seems not that bad. This one feels awesome!
