This is the only review I have Left in my life and unfortunately is not on a happy note.The only reason I spent My hardearned cash was to use offline mods.This has come great shock to me that a company that has stated previously stated that they support the modding community would ask a company to stop using the tool to allow mods to vehicle packs etc.I have never used it online and feel this is punishing everyone for a few that break the rules. Also open IV have implemented a feature that stops you going online with using their mod.I will never by a game form take 2 again.As I will not support a company that seams in my opinion to be picking on end users and only motivated by money. The only Reason they got my money for GTA IV and GTA V was for the modding offline.Many ThanksJason Tattersall
