The 4  year experience review!! !GTA5 as a single player marks a legacy of the Super GtaFranchise of sandrease liberty and Gta 4The multiplayer is really good but only for those whoWant to buy the game money or really have some goodFriends to play with online. Saying that let me first tellYou why that is so, rockstar has given an incredibleCustomer support plus a ton lot of features on the onlinePart which no other game that has such a great single playerCampaign does. They have to pay those developers whoBring new things in the Gta  online every month that is whyShark cards were introduced. GTA5 has incredible graphicsEven a lower spec pc can run it as it is highly optimizedThe story is awesome the characters are good murderersWhich one expects in a  Gta game. No laws exist in singlePlayer. But in the multiplayer they do because ones freedomEnds where others freedom starts all players are equallyImportant that is why they discourage players from killing each other.Think you are flying a plane and out of nowhere some one kills uThat is why they discourage harassment. The game is a wholePackage that is why they dont make Gta 6.
