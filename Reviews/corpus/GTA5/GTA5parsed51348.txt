Ill be honest, I like money. Especially in GTA. When a hacker joined my game and started giving me millions I was ecstatic. I had 80 million and everything in the game. Then, without even installing a mod, I was banned from the game forever. My friends received the same treatment from the hacker and they still play on today. Sort it out rockstar.
