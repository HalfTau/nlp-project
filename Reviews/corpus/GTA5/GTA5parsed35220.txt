GTA V is a logical and evolutionary step from GTA IV in terms of improvement and also belongs to the top three GTA games in my opinion.Basic concept has remained same this means we have a great story, interesting characters and new types of experience.The gameplay is excellent with several new addons that make it even better compared to older games from the series, its never repetitive and boring, it will keep you occupied for a long time.The graphics are much improved and have a greater range of colors than GTA IV, a larger variation of locations on the map has been added with a lot of detail and we have new types of architecture as well.Conclusion GTA V is a game that everyone should get and have in their Steam library.
