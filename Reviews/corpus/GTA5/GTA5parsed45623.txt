This game is fun, no doubt about it. Love playing it. Dont get me wrong, theres alot of stuff to do. But at times it feels like R made a very good map as a platform for more content and then abandoned that idea to instead release increasingly expensive things, without adding any new ways that would make more money than endlessly grinding the pac standard heist. Now if those shark cards actually gave a proportional amount of money compared to their cost, that wouldnt be such a problem, but you have to pay atleast 15 to get enough money for a decent car.
