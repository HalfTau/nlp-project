About GTAV Online. I admit, I enjoyed a lot of hours in it. Enjoyed it even on my overheating laptop with 1220 fps. But I cant recommend it for us Lone Wolfs. Updates that are getting too ridiculous forces you to team play and the community in my experience was beyond toxic. Unless you have your gaming buddies then yeah you will have an epic play time. In my personal opinion the game should change its name by now, its nothing like grand theft auto the Online part.GTA V 10/10GTA Online 4/10Hard to decide now for recommendation Y/N...Recommended just for ...THE BIG ONE!
