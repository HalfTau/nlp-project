TakeTwo takes down OpenIV A SINGLE PLAYER LEGAL MODDING TOOLRockstar says OpenIV allowed online malisous mods to runRockstar also says it was not them that took down OpenIV, but it was TakeTwo....basically passing the blame offEarlier in the games life, Rockstar loved all the single player mods and even praised OpenIV for the community help.TakeTwo nor Rockstar contacted the developer of OpenIV to help prevent MALISOUS ONLINE MODS, all they did was take it down and cause the SINGLE PLAYER MODDING COMMUNITY to die.Now for my take on this, I only bought the pc version after already paying 60 for the xbox 360 and then also 60 for the xbox one versions, for the modding of the single player....so there can be more of a story or more fun....and guess what...all of the mods stayed in single player. I never once played the multiplayer with a mod on. I seen many HACKERS on the GTA Online but not a single MODDER...learn the difference Rockstar and TakeTwo. So for now on, no more TakeTwo games are going to be bought or played from me, every TakeTwo games I own will now get a negative review and hopefully everyone else will join me.Thanks for reading this review.SirDayton
