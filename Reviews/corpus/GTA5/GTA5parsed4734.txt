I played GTAV extensively on the playstation prior to switching over to PC and i can say with great confidence that it runs and plays smoother on PC, i generally enjoy the reckless aspect of the gameplay, and the ability to play different things in order to fit your mood. I strongly recommend this game to anyone whos looking for a good way to kill a little time, and enjoy some fun.
