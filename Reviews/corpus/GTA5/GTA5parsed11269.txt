Not a bad single player game, honestly strictly buy it for that because the multiplayer is boring manure. I was expecting the island to be much more NPC active with multiplayer but it is the same empy shell structures, limited interactions and just rinse and repeat missions. For new players, either prepare to spend big or play multiplayer as a target, eventually if you just let them shoot you, they get bored with it and leave you alone.Buy for the single player only, the multiplayer is pay to win faeces seriously shark cards, you asshats are just poking fun at the whales with that. By the way, the call them whales not because of the size of their wallet but because the size of the ego demands they spend to win, they can not take losing, paying to win ie cheating is fine with them.Buy at a discount only. So mostly thumbs down with a thumbs up on special only.Be warned when you start a new game, you must actively save it at least once, else the game will eat all your efforts. If you buy shark cards you are a gullible idiot.Basically wait and buy when it hits 1/4 orginal price, definately not full price and half price is a rip of because of the very bad pay to win multiplayer or pay to not play ie the game is so bad, they can charge you to not grind, as in not play the game.
