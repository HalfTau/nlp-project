My negative review is not just about TakeTwos cease and desist for the OpenIV tool but also about the lack of fun it is to play GTA Online. The campaign is absolutely marvelous and a ton of fun to play and if it was only for that Id give it a thumb up, but R made it quite clear in the last 45 years that their focus was on the Online portion of the game.That portion is extremely lackluster in my opinion since its extremely time consuming to make any kind of money and theres very few ways of making money solo that is actually fun... I wouldnt mind it in a RP role play setting, since it would be expected to struggle to rise up, but the vanilla Online is far from a RP platform. The difficulty to acquire vehicles, houses and company properties without having to spend hours for a pretty unsatisfactory reward makes this component of the game a bit boring.Back in 2013 I was pretty hopeful for GTA Online since I thought they would add multiple map extensions so it would really feel like a bigger world full of opportunities, 5 years later Im pretty disappointed that it turned into a money grab and to make it worst, the content in GTA Online is not available in the story mode  you cant mod it anymore, hard to give that a positive review /.
