The singleplayer is awsomeThe online is pretty good but has plenty of negatives. For example it has many things to do, you make many plans on how to use your money or invest them on something BUT the heists or any activities you do, do not give you enough money, so you have to grind alot and it gets boring.In the Online, again, alot of people are too toxic and kill players in free roaming. I prefer to go for a ride with them or something, but i cant find anyone else who wants to as well.Now the real problem is the servers. They are quite badly maintained and sometimes you crash. You might as well see modders in some lobbies.Anyways, i recommend buying this game mostly for the singleplayer and IF you have any other friend playing the same game, you should try going on private lobbies online and having fun with them and of course doing heists with them or any other activities
