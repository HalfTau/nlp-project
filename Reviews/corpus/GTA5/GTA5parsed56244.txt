This review is in the light of the recent threat to modding for SINGLEPLAYER. They havent announced anything to deal with hackers in the already  GTA Online.  you Take Two Interactive.EDIT As of June 23rd, Rockstar released a statement which reads, Take Two will generally not take legal action against the OpenIV team. This is what happens when a community comes together to change a  decision. I can now recommend this game and play it with a good conscience
