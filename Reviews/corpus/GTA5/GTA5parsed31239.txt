Look 3 years and GTA V suddenly wants to remove mods as a clear push to sell cards on the multiplayer. Too everyone saying Rockstar is guiltless and that Taketwo is to blame is fooling themselfs. Rockstar just threw up their hand and said they didnt do anything, That they had no control which is just as bad. They made so much money off people paying for their game and pelnty of people bought it on pc for the moding. They continue to prove they dont care at all about single player and want people to move to online which is plaged with so many problems, Hacker, insain grinding for little profit, The whole issue with someone running you over and you cant do squat back because they ride an expincive car that YOU have to pay for even if they stared it if you kill it in revenge. The list is so far more extincive then that and IMO they should have fixed all of these issues before they tried to shove online and shark cards on us as hard as possible.
