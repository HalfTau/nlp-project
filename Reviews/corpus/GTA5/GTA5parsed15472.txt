What kind of idiots do they hire to handle the customer support?One momentMy Combat Pistol is missing so I contact the support and they be like We have reviewd your claim and were unable to verify the reported loss. If you have any additional infomation that may help to verify your purchases, please reply to this email.So I ask back what happened and even though I get a human response they still cannot help me.Next momentMy ammo pops out of existence durring a heist and when I returned to freemode, spoiler alert all ammo is 100 gone. So I just contacted customer support before posting this review and now I just have to wait for events to unfold.If they do not help me at this point in time I will give up on this game.Next time I get a Rockstar product I will have to get it Preowned or fromso that they cannot get my money ever again. I hope this review makes sure no other gamer will have to suffer what I went through.Now if you excuse me Im going to go outside to play with some rocks while I press F to get my money back.
