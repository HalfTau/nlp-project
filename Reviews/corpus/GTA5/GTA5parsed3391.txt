GTA V is a great game but it is better on console if you dont mind lower fps with some rigs i only say that becaue there are less to no hackers on consle but in PC there is almost 1 hacker in every lobby i have 1000 hours on console i got it the day it came out on the xbox 360 and then i moved to xbox 1 and now to PC i recommend GTA V on all platforms but i would wait for a sale on the game
