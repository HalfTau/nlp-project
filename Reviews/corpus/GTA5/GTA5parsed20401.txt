GTA V was one of the best games Ive ever played, and probably still is. The game itself is great, but Rockstar is not. I bought the game, a few months after it came out, played singleplayer, then went back and played with mods, then got into online. I got around 400 hours into the game, and got banned. Out of nowhere, for three weeks. Multiple support tickets and conversations with support yielded no results. A month or two later, I decide to return to the game. I boot up Steam, click play, wait for updates, and boom. The launcher crashes. I make a support ticket, and rockstar responds with basically the front page of their support website. Check drivers, verify game files, reinstall game, if that doesnt work, your ed. I called, I emailed, and no results. I am forced to manually check and repair the files in the directory, until I find the one which was causing trouble, get that file from a friend, and replace my broken one. I hoped this would be the end of my trouble, but no, rockstar social club now wants my  ACTIVATION CODE. Of course, it apears as already used and their support can do nothing about it. I have given up on GTA V. If it works, its a great game, if it doesnt, you might as well flush 60 bucks down the toilet and save yourself some time.
