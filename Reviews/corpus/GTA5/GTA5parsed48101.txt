How are you going to take modding away from the community? Really? To make MORE profit from GTA online? Like you  arent rich enough already? !This game has, and always will be ONLY good with mods. Without mods this game is mediocre at best. Good job shooting yourselves in the foot and putting this game into an early grave. I hope your online sales crash and the whole series goes under. Was looking forward to the next GTA like all GTAs but now you can all go  yourselves. I will never put another dime into any Rockstar games product. You lost me as a customer as well as THOUSANDS of others im sure.
