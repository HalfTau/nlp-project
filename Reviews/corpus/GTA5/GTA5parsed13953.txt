We will not forget the famous game of all ages  GTA San Andreas. Unfortunately, I wasnt able to play that game when it was released, but the GTA V gave me an opportunity to experience the greatness of the GTA series in whole new way  with new stunning graphics, magnificent storyline, ingame full freedom of actions, enormous size of playable area, and certainly a great number of different features and entertainments that are available for gamers!
