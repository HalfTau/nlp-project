Unfortunately, I cannot support a game that stomps the PC community in an attempt to make more money by forcing us onto multiplayer. I bought this game, I should be able to do as I please with it within rules. There is an entire community around modding and you no longer support that group, youve abandoned an entire group of customers. Good Work.
