GTA Online is one of the grindiest, greediest, most horribly cared for multiplayer. Singleplayer is still the same as it was at launch. And there wont be anything at all for singleplayer, Rockstar has made that very clear. They issued cease and desist for a singleplayer modding tool. Unacceptable, I cannot recommend this game.
