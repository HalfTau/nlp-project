overall amazing game. so good i rebought it for PC after i originally had it for the PS3. amazing grahpics even better with mods but youll need a gtx 1070 or better for that. once every few months, they release a free DLC to keep players playing and buyers buying the shark cards. unfortunately these DLC updates are expensive in ingame currency so youll have to spend hours grinding missions to get that next sick supercar for free. i cant complain though, this game is already worth the cost right out the box with the amazing storyline and the Trevor character that nobody could forget. would buy again.specs 6700k, 970, 16gb ramthese specs will allow you to run 1080p  60fps with near max settings low grass/fxaa settings though.
