Take Two and Rockstar have treated the community behind this game like trash, from banning mods outright even single player mods to making players grind so hard for new content that they essentially have to buy shark cards with real money.I was so looking forward to future titles, but I can no longer support this publisher until I see a change of heart from them. They need to realize how important it is to treat their player base fairly.
