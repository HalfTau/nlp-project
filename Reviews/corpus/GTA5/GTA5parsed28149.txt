They banned me because of a bunch of kids who couldnt accept being killed in the game gang up and reported me for cheating I never cheated I liked that game, but its managed by complete morons so dont recommend.Edit  It seems the false reports incident was just a troubling coincidence and the true reasons I was banned for, was something else what exactly, no idea, I only know I never cheatedI was unbanned few hours after that, but stolen from my legit money, So even if Im unbanned I still cant recommend it.Edit 2 Changing Back to recommended for what its worth Because its still the best map ever made, and ton of fun. I still think their online model is rotten to the core but thats another debate.
