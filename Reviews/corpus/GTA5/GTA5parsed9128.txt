This Game is a giant waste. You want to buy anything? Run the same heist 100 times and still not have enough due to ammo, armor, repairs, and GTAV stealing it. want to just walk around and enjoy this fairly incredable world?Cant someone decided to hunt and kill you for no reason with a gun that shoots planes. The DLC is bunk at best, with more things the base game should have had on the way. I really only got the game to play with my friends, and I never really played the main game due to the plot and characters being unlikeable. If you like the game fine I am glad you enjoy it, for me the hackers, campers,hats, ten year olds, and game itself screwing me over got to be too much
