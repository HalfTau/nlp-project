I put a lot of time in this game and in the past I would have recommended it however there is too much grinding and everything is so damn expensive and you either grind for hours, buy microtransaction shortcuts, hack, or just stop playing. I picked the latter option.Singleplayer is excellent though. If you want to play only for the singleplayer, wait for the game to go on sale.
