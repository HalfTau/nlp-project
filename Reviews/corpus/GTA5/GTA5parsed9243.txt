I really love this game, it makes it alot fun join other players online and doing missions with them andalot of activities you can do online but there is one problem online you will have to avoid Moddersand Hackers online and its possible they can drop fake or modded money on to you and I have encountered some of players doing that, however I rather go play online with myself or friends sessions that way I could avoid them doing it so pretty much the gameplay is good and its got good stuff online so far and I do love the updates their putting in such as Heist Missions, New Vehicles, Weapons, Outfits and many more.So I like to say this would be my best GTA game of all time.
