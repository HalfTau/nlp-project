Playing mostly online mode. That being said, every single time you play online there is a hacker. Bullet proof, rocketproof, making ur character fly across the sky to a point you have to restart your game. I dont know if they stopped cracking down on hacking but to experience it 5 times a day when playing is just annoying.
