Single player is okay, though pretty lack luster compared to earlier titles.The multiplayer is a horrible horrendous grind.  There is not a single way to make money at an acceptable rate.  Content releases have been limited to PvP which this game does not do well.  Heists are fun but get old after the 200 time, and yet R wont add more.
