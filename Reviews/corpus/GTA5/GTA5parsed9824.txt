Changed from a game with poyential, to a rockstar money hungery bottemless pit pretty fast. Incom from missions 1/2 from what it started with.. vehicles and stuff in game x2 to force u to buy in game money with real money.. how it is now.. u will pay at least 40 euro, for a single upgraded car.. and more then doubble for a hellicopter.. started with 1.9mil for a heli, new one is 3.9 playing like u want, gives u bad sport status.. and makes u a target for other players to kill.. blowing someone up with his car, because he wants to kill u.. makes u pay for his car. And bad sports are forced into bad sport servers.. so no more playing with friends
