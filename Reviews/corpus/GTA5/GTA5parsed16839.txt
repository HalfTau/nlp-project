Quite possibly the best game ever made, and ill list why hereTo begin, the design of the ingame world is impeccable and could be one of the best fictional representations of western society in all of video gaming and most entertainment. Everything from crooked fictional politicians advertising their campaigns on the streets of Los Santos via the in game billboards, the attitude of young people vis a vis the real world, and the ridiculous amount of media consumption just makes Los Santos one of the most realistic albeit fictional  virtual cities ever created.And that isnt even mentioning the gameplay, which makes this game the pinnacle of sandbox thirdperson shooters. The smooth, fluid controls on either a mouse/keyboard setup or a controller just works with no issues. Its the benchmark for all games of this type. The amount of content is also ridiculous, as there is no downloadable content with the exception of shark cards for the online component of the game. There are no load screens after the first one, and you can just jump straight into the beautiful streets of Los Santos. As well as the masterpiece of a single player story, theres a fantastic online component where you can participate in organized activities and create your own gangster for the online streets.To sum up this game, just buy it.Its one of the greatest games ever made, and i cant wait to play more of it.10/10
