TakeTwo Interactive not only sent private investigators to a modders home, but sent a Cease  Desist on the backbone script extender mod that was used to be able to mod both GTA IV and V, because people used it to play singleplayer where there has been no new content since the game released instead of multiplayer. They actively want to push you onto the , boring MP so that they can force more microtransactions and heists down your throat and pull your wallet out of your esophagus.For the longest time, Take Two has been anti consumer. From actively preventing mods, to overpricing games and extra so for Australia!, to withholding key features that make a game whole and complete to then sell you back at 40 a pop looking at you Civilization.... Even if they withdraw this Cease and desist, I will NEVER buy another 2K game so long as I live.And to Take Two Maybe you should take a second look at yourselves.Edit on July 8th It came to my attention that they lifted the Cease  Desist on OpenIV, due to community outcry. Which is good. But there was something my mother always used to say A tiger cant change its stripes. I still do not trust Take Two one bit.
