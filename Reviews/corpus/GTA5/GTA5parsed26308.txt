Grand Theft Auto V Review.GameplayYep! this FRANCHISE of Bloody killing, violent, brutal, and thief but they still can make player has with it, with a new world new thing what ever you can do it, So i love third person shoot much like first person that why i cant tell you what is bad or what is good, With a new gameplay they have add 3 characters and come with ability so that was a thing we never see before but this is so good to see a new gameplay from rockstar and i thing another games in the future will add this in there games too and second is first person in next generation is good but they make it look like simulator so that was still not a good view mode to play in online just play on campaign this will make you feel better more than online but if you like you still can play to feel like first person games.StoryNow a new county of GTA is come with a bigger map i ever know yeah but i still thing i love san andreas, And it came with a new 3 badass character Franklin Michael and Trevor to give you new adventure like never be in pass gta series before and rockstar present with a 3 new story characters in campaign with a 3 story of there main own chracter or mission team with so many side mission and secrets you can enjoy! GTA V Story is telling about Thief, Bank Robber, Family and Friends so GTA V story is very good to play it, but it too short than GTA IV but i ok with that.Game PerformanceIs good for first time release without any problem in game engine so that too short right? LOL. DSpec PerformanceSo this is better than iv so much my i5 4460 and gtx 950 can play this game on mediem/high/FXAA 1080p hit to 6090 frame rate so that is good for low end pc Performance, But you need to use high cpu core to boots you frame rate up for 1020 frame on every open world/RPG games so that meet you need to setting graphic for recommend and that will help you to play this game without frame drop, GOOD JOB Rockstar!. FALL IN LOVE Award!
