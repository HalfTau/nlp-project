After confirming 420 hours, I can say my experiance with this game was great, pregun run update. That was a time when I had money from doing heists, selling cars, crates, and all of that to be taken away post gun run update because I was making hot cheddar and the cheaters werent. This games Multiplayer is a 10/10, would recommend if you dont like getting your guns stolen every lobby, as well as your hard earned money.P.S. The tennis mini game is really fun and pretty much the only thing I play now lol.
