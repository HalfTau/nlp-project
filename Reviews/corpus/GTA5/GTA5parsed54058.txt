Single player game decent but the multiplayer is the worst. Paying a crapton of money for a stupid car, building etc. and having some person run away with your money for some line of code? Games used to be good before this rush to make every new game a cash grab and this is a prime example. I take it that my 60 was not enough to fill their bank.
