the game is pretty fun, but it is a grind. but then yet again, it is what makes games really fun to play, everything about the game is fine, i love it so much. the only thing i can suggest to change will be the pricing of things in the game, they are way too expensive for they do, and it seems like rockstar is trying to make people buy shark cards.all in all, the game is pretty good and suggest you buy it.
