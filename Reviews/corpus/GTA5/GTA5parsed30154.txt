So TakeTwo decided to make GTA V modding illegal, and how they could do such a thing after 10 years of OpenIV and with no problems, and if they say its cause of cheaters, well sidenote They will find a way always.The game itself is great but, mods not being supported anymore, Im going to stop playing thats opinion and what I am doing but, if youre a person looking at purchasing GTA V for the modding experience , look somewhere else.
