POOR PUBLISHERS, Im sure GTA Vs collective sales are not enough to feed your families, Ill stop modding and put my poor, student wallet in your microtransaction money grubbing hands plot twist, I havent modded GTA. The online just sucks.If youre rich and have sway over companys decisions, know this keep up this type of garbage and people will stop giving you money entirely and youll be on the lower end of the 1. If you dont want to be poor by rich standards, stop being a prick to your consumerbase.Eff you, Take Two.That is all.
