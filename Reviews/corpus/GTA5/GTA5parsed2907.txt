GRAPHICS SETTINGS WILL NOT CHANGE UNTIL YOU FINISH THE FIRST MISSION, OR REINSTALL YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY GET IN GAME TO CHANGE THEM. I WAS STUCK FOR 3 HOURS MESSING WITH GRAPHICS ONLY TO HAVE THEM REVERT AFTER EVERY RESTART. JUST GET IN GAME THEN START AND YOULL BE FINE.Had this game on 360, was a blast.waited for 50 sale and picked it up.I have a moderately high end setup now and the graphics just blow away 360.  you can see cars forever, no OH CRUD A CAR every 3 seconds from reduced draw distances. what what else can imakes controllers look funny. i still use my xbone controller to drive and race....but the rest is kb...get it onis a ripoff for microtransactions because everything is in the millions in game and youll spend way more than full price to get the stuff thatll take you a year to farm.
