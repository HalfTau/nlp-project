You used to be better than this Rockstar... out useless dlc that noone can buy unless they resort to microtransactions?Weapons/vehicles that dont even remotely fit in the GTA saga?And now banning all modding, even for singleplayer?I hope you go bankrupt, the Rockstar i know has died a long time ago...
