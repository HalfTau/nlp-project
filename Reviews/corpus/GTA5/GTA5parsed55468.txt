I can deal with no singleplayer updates. I can deal with GTA Online. But putting out a cease and desist on a mod that only affects singleplayer and is the backbone to some of the best mods and saying modding is illegal? I cannot stand for that. Before anyone states that it was right for them to get rid of OpenIV I just wanna stop you right there and inform you of something. OpenIV started out as a tool for Grand Theft Auto IV Henve the IV in OpenIV to allow modders the ability to create more complex mods such as Iron Mans suit, the DeLorean, etc. in the Singleplayer portion of GTA IV. In comes GTA V with Online and nothing was done to keep Online safe from hackers. The tool that they thought caused the hacking? Turns out it doesnt even touch Online and actually prevents you from going online. I wont stop playing Borderlands 2 or other games, but I will never purchase another game with TakeTwo Interactive as the publisher ever again. They do not deserve our money. They deserve to let Rockstar and 2K go to do their own thing.
