Remember GTA IVs DLC? It was fantastic. It was a standalone game in itself. Rockstar have chosen to forget about that, and to add online content in the hope of making money through microtransactions, and as such have banned modding.Theyve chosen restriction and multiplayer over creating solid, good content and that is simply not good enough. Games used to come first, and now its money. Were seeing this become increasingly popular and boycotting a franchise as popular at GTA is a good way of protesting this change.
