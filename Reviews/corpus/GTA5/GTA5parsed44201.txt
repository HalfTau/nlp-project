Great going take two, you removed one of the greatest and most fun things to do after completing the games singleplayer mode. Gaming on PC has been built on modding for years. Great games have come from mods and you just gave the single player/offline players a big middle finger. i understand hacking was rampent online but for  sake, this was away to go around it.To be honest, Multiplayer is a boring grindfest, Everything is too expensive and your trying way to hard to push those  shark cards eh? Hackers still run rampent after your so called Take down. GG you will not be missed.EDIT still dosent change the fact they did this in the first place so yeah. You will not be missed GTA
