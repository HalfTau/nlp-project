One of the best game purchases I made in recent historyGame is absolutely addictive with tons of things to do in it, from awesome Single Player story to very fun GTA Online there are so many activities and missions that you cant even play them all anytime soonThere are so many pros for this game that I will probably forget some Actual driving feels very smooth, there are tons of cars and customizations for them, fairly impressive online character creator, Heists SP but mainly online that are very fun to do, Los Santos  Desert are very fun to explore, insane amounts of clothing options and outfits and much moreCons would be that sometimes its fairly slow to find people to play above mentioned activities with depending of activity popularity and rewards, heavily outdated peer 2 peer connection that is prone to tons of issues empty lobbies, kicking from server back to SP, etc, loading screen can be fairly slow especially if no SSDGenerally Id fully recommend this game to people and my friends
