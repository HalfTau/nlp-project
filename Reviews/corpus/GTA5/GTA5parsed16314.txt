Ive played every iteration of this franchise since GTA 2. I love, LOVE these games. But Rockstar, youve been steadily killing my love for this game just a little more with every update. Stop with this bussiness bullst. Make something different. You are some of the most creative guys in the AAA industry, I know you can do it.Or, you know, make a singleplayer DLC, the SP crowd has been completely forgotten because of your greed.
