Its almost 2018 and im just writing a review right now because im playing campaign again.Its incredible how a game that is, in practice 34 years old look so damn good.Playing this time on 8700K 16gb 3600mhz 1080 SLI.Single player experience is very smooth, im hitting almost all times 144hz on 1440p. Sli support is good, multithread suport is good.Story wise, you cant go wrong, rockstar always do have great writers and manages to create an awesome setting.The bad part, well, its not San Andreas gta 3. It does not have las venturas or san fierro, and it was the only thing i really miss. This and the fact i cant eat burger shots. Or play cassino. Or bet on horse races and after that kill everyone in a rage.The online game is good, but it basically only work if you have a trusty group of friends because you need people willing to do the heists, they are the real fun of online. The worse part of online is that all missions, races, whatever is done thru a peer to peer connection, so its very demanding on connection and can be a very crap experience when lags or latency happens.
