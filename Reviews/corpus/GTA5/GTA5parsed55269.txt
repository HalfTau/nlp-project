Take Two thinks that shutting down mods will prevent cheating. The tools that are now ilegal to use and make us criminals, by extent didnt support Online, didnt make a cent and they didnt support pirate copies. But if someone wants to cheat, will find a way. I cant stress this enough. Ban the cheaters, not the mods.As a modder  you Take Two. As a player  you twice.
