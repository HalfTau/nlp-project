After successfully removing every effecient method of making money in this game, the developers happily release the same update 5 times in a row that all promise big profits! despite having a multimillion dollar buyin and making maybe 100,000 an hour. In addition, they also release all kinds really really cool content like new spy cars, and rocket cars, and cool new aircraft and supercars, all for several million dollars each. But hey, at least the singleplayers fun and can be made even more fun with moOh.
