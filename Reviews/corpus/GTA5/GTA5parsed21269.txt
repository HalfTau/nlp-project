Its a good game but even better if you have friends to play this with.Edit  okay, im gonna change my review. The amount of modders every session is just crazy. Online is just unplayable, you cant do jobs because of these lowlife s blowing you up all the time and sending cops literally spawning cops behind you and kills you.
