Why Rockstar, Why? You guys had made all the freaking money in the world on this game, and now you gotta pull this? Look, you honestly cant expect to be charging this much freaking money in an online enviornment when you cant get  even a slight grip on the amount of mallicious cheaters IE the wallhackers, teleporters, people that lock out out of your weapons etc and then only ban people for dropping cash. All that shows is that you literally give zero fcks about anything other than money. And now on top of it all, you want to outright tell people they cant even mod singleplayer? WTF?? No, just stop, seriously. It would cost people hunderends of dollars to get everything in this game via your BS Shark cards, all for some cars and outfits?? This games succsess has gone to your heads, and you just bit the hands that fed you. Suck a fat one, love taco.
