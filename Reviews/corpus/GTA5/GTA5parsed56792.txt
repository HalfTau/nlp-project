Keeping the above text as we cant forget about that.Ive thoroughly enjoyed the game, both single player and Online. Online does get very grindy and you will be tempted to purchase shark cards thats just the business model, one I do disagree with. Other than that, hours of fun to be had here.Luckily, Take Two decided to reverse their stance on mods and allow them. This means that there are hours upon hours upon hours of fun to be had in single player.
