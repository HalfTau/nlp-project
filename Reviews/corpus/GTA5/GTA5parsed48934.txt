Congrats, TakeTwo and R to messing up this game. If there wasnt for the never ending money grind and useless copy paste updates there would be less modders in the Online mode. GIVE PLAYERS WHAT THEY WANT... we want more heists and fun missions with good production quality not fast puttogether annoying stuff.Online section is a grinding mess that force you to buy overpriced shark cards to be able to afford things you want to try. And thank TakeTwo to dropping even the last little bit of modding support. Let us have dedicated online servers with a proper admin teams and stuff like it was in SAMP. Let us have modding community to make the game more enjoyable at least for PC players. Dont buy GTA V at this stage.
