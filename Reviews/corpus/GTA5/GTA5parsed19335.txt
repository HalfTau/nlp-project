If you had asked me when the game first came out if I would recommend it????  Yes.  And still, their single player is good...however what they did to the players and the economy in the Multiplayer mode is just evil.  The prices on EVERYTHING are ridiculous and you have to grind your life away just to afford anything, or spend a crap ton of REAL CASH on their Shark Cards so you can get the in game items.  Or if you are lucky...find a modder shooting money from a rooftop in an open lobby.  But just trying to play the missions with friends to gain the money you want/need...nope.  It is rediculous the low payout for the rewards and inflated pricing.  RIP GTAV you were the FIRST GTA I purchased and will be the last.  Because your next installment will eventually end up the same way.
