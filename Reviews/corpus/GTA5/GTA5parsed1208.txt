Everything advertised in photos and videos on here costs money. You will spend hundreds and hundreds of real dollars to afford anything seen in the updates. Take two ruined gta5 with shark cards. As far as this game has come with rockstar releasing no new titles for years it is a grueling experience if you try to have fun for the base cost of the game.
