I ONLY play this game for singleplayer. Online takes too long, can never find a good partner in crime and its grief city unless you are a racer.THEN you decide to screw over the best thing to ever happen to your game OPENIV. ARE YOU STUPID? Or do you want to lose money.I will be skipping RDR2 since it probably wont even be out for PC anyways and all future Take Two games. Why dont you do yourself a favor and learn something from EA. YEA I SAID IT. They learned from their mistakes and look where they are now, almost 1 again. You... you just hung yourself.SP  Modding is what we want yet you keep turning out garbage that makes the entire game look bad. Thats not OUR GTA.
