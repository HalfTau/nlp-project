Gta V was a great game before devs lost it. Story mode is still great and playable, but Online is ruined. Devs made money making grindy that it would encourage people to spend money to buy ingame cash. People who have spent money to buy ingame cash or get it by cheats get ridiculous weapons or vehicles to kill normal players.Good job Rockstar.
