I cant recommend this game to anyone. The single player experience was good... in September of 2013 when it came out. But you must be wondering how does someone who has 200 hours of single player time say the single player sucks? MODS!!!!! Mods were the ONLY thing that kept me playing after the first play through. With out them the game has virtually no replayability. Now these dumb s want to send a cease and desist letter to Open IV which is literally the backbone of the modding community for GTA IV and GTA V. They are essentially gutting the only reason to buy the game, how ing stupid can they be?Dont even get me started on the steaming pile ofthat is multiplayer.
