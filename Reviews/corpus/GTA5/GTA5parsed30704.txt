Clearly at this point R doesnt care at all about their fans intersts, creativity, and contributions. I will still play the game from time to time, but I wont buy sharkcards, or buy future R games... unless modding is allowed again. GTA V is a great game but I cannot support the modding policy that was recently rolled out. Its too bad, because R used to be my favorite Developers. I cant trust, respect, or care for a company that treats its devoted fans like trash. If you havent played GTA V yet, and you want to, I suggest trying to pirate it, or go to a friends house to play it... basically dont give R a cent.
