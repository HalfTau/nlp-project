I gave you my 60 so I could mod this game, and I havent even had this game for a year. My 60 just went down the drain.There is now way in HELL that I am going to give you my money for any of your future games, such as Red Dead Redemption 2, which I was planning on buying.  you Rockstar, I wasted my well earned money on this trainwreck of an ordeal. I will no longer play this game, especially if I have to PAY for mods.
