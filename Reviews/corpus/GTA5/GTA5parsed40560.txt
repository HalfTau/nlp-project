The singleplayer is fun, albeit for a limited amount of time. The multiplayer is a truly interesting world  But however, Rockstar has IMO ruined it. No dedicated servers and no effective system against cheaters  so what they did is that they just completely rinse the game for everything and everyone having been affected by any sort of cheat. Also, experiencing many faults in the game still  after having owned it for years it is still rather unstable.
