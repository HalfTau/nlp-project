I am so happy i bought this game, man graphics are awesome and there is nothing much more satisfying than playing GTA V on PC, you can aim much faster, drive and interactCommunity is good, you dont really need to talk to anyone or depend on teamI mean if you want to win a heist and one team member s up thats on him too, i mean he loses his money and time too and there is just 10 chance that you team up with a newbie or afk personRecommended game
