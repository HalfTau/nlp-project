I do not reccomend this game.I just wanted to download it and have a game. But rockstar has other ideas.First I had to set up a ing account, then I had to go through an activation process that kept failing, after four attempts where it says Im offline. I am not offline. I finally start the damn game. Ok its finally time to game right?NoI get stuck again on even more log in and activation screens that take a very long time to load each time.I finally get past these to change the settings so Im not stuck in potato resolution. After tweaking everything I have a popup saying I need to restart. I restart, and run through each of these things again, only to check the settings and it didnt save any of them.I close the game and run through this whole scenario two more times before I quit, running through the activation process each time. I paid for a game, I dont want to have to check I paid for it each time, I could of pirated this and bypassed the whole thing but no I wanted to support the developers so I get punished.Ill try one more time then ask for my money back.Seriously  this
