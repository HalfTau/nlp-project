As all of you may know, it is GTA, so it has a great and in depth campaign with plot twists, and there is so many things to customize. ALSO, they added GTA ONLINE so you can finally play with your pals and kill each other to your hearts content. However, this is PC we are talking about, so dont be surprised if you end up in a modded lobby getting hundreds of thousands of dollars. But, to solve this problem just hop in a closed friends session, and play some jobs for that GTA cash. WARNING DO NOT BUY SHARK CARDS, IT IS A SCAM.
