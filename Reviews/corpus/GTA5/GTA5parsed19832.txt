the game is fun when you are just playing around with friends, but when you want to make some money or start to play the game serieus it get frustrating real fast. getting money isnt fun but repetitive as hell. the controlling how you walk is a nightmare. doing ceo/mc/gunrunner is only doable in a server where no people are with the flying bike and dont get me started on the sniper with explosive rounds. gta online is fun for people who mod or spend 200 on shark cards. because this game is pay to win. PS youre paying 60 for a game that is pay to win.
