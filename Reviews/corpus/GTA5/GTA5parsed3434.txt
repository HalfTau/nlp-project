I got banned from online because some hacker spawned a ton of money on me.And everybody else, but I dont know about them.Its so infuriating to see how Rockstar keeps implementing new things into multiplayer and intentionally keeps the content out of single player to bait you into spending money on shark cards.Rockstar is way worse than EA.
