lol i regret playing online. it was not fun at all.  with the recent updates its worse,  everything is overpriced, the community in general is pretty bad. Wish they had more options in single player like riot mode or fun cheats like the previous titiles. but im pretty sure rockstar will never think about that since they are only focusing online.
