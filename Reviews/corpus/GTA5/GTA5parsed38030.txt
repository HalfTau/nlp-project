As of today Im changing my review to a recommend, just because the single player portion of this game truly is an amazing experience and worth the cost of the game. In the unlikely event that you have never played the single player, then get it on sale and enjoy one of the best stories in video gaming history.My previous comments in my initial review about multiplayer still remain mostly true. Its still full of hackers and not a fun experience. Its still ridiculous that they havent implemented any anticheat on their servers. But at least TakeTwo reversed their decision on OpenIV in response to player protest, and that was my reason for not recommending.I still cant fully recommend multiplayer. Its a very transparent cash grab at all turns, and when that is the case, you want to see that the money you spend is giving you a benefit, but since you meet hackers at every turn who will have things that cost you real life money or hundreds of hours of grinding, it makes you wonder why you would bother.In summary, buy it for the single player and enjoy that. Dont buy it for the multiplayer because its honestly terrible, which is a real shame considering the potential it has.
