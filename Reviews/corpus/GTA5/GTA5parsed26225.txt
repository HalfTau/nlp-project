This a phenominal game, and you should buy it for the single player experience alone.  Ive completed the story over seven times across the Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC, and I loved it every time. Following and playing as three characters is a gamechanger.I would not reccomend buying the game for the online experience, unless you also plan to buy a mod menu. It is extremely hard to actually have fun in online unless you first spend hours and hours grinding for money, and even then there isnt that much to do besides run repetive, sometimes boring, sometimes stupid missions.  All the adversary modes stop being populated after they stop being double /RP. Online seriously needs a quality of life update, but they just keep piling stuff on that doesnt really add much. The new Doomsday hiest is truly great, and I like most all of the vehicles theyve added, however, it doesnt fix the fact that youve gotta spent so much time grinding and not enjoying it to be able to enjoy it at all.I do not reccommend buying this game for the online experience, and in remembrance of when Take Two shut down modding, however if you plan to play the story then do get it.Note I would not, and did not pay full price for this game. It goes on sale for 30 all the time, and occasionally less, get it on sale.
