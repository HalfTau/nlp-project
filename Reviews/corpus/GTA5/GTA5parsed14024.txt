Hi,I have had gta 5 for some time, and just wanted to write a review on my findings in this time. I played the story which i found very appealing however as soon as i went online i realised that Rockstar went the completely wrong route with the game. The whole idea is to bring updates and content specifically to the online side of things instead of improving the single player campain. I WILL NOT fork out more money for something i have already paid for and considering i already paid around about 60 for the game i can say now its not worth it. I would not recommend the game to anyone as all they want you to do is get hooked online then fork out all your hard earned cash on shark cards i can honestly say until such time as rockstar stops trying to trick people with crap i will never again buy a Rockstar purchase! Alot more focus needs put into the Main story campain and not focused purely on Online time to get a grip Rockstar and realised you have mucked up. Make changes or your fans will not remain by your side!
