Recently, Rockstar has just been screwing over everyone with their DLCs for online. The game has just been screaming out Give us all of your money!. Whenever they add new cars, planes, etc in the game, they become incredible expensive, when they arent even that good most of the time. If youre reading this review, then chances are you havent bought the game yet. Well, I am going to tell you that unless you are willing to fork over as much money as you have, Rockstar will not welcome you. They dont welcome any new players.If it seems like I have not put in a lot of hours in the game it is because I play on multiple platforms
