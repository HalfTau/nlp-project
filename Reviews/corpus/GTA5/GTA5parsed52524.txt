Long loading screens, a large number of hackers,  gameplay mechanics,  or infact non existant  servers and most importantly, suing mod developers are some of the things about this game which are a big NO, and are why I am not recommending to buy this game. Seriously, Even though this is one of my most favorite games of all time, and I have had my funnest moments online in this game, this game has still made me go through alot of problems and by suing mod developers and declaring single player mods illegal, Take Two has really crossed the line.
