Well what can i say about this game that hasnt been aid before. As a huge fan of the GTA franchise and after the somewhat disapointment i had with GTA 4 i was excited for this game. Thankfully i was not dissapointed, i happily played this on my PS3 for many an hour however it lacked something that i could not put my finger on...Then GTA 5 was released on PC..! !The PC port runs magifecently, developers should take note. The PC port did not release till quite some time after the console release. The graphics are amazing, runs smoothly and i am yet to find any bugs although i will concede that there are bound to have someGTA  on PC is a pleasure to play, in fact it runs so well that there are often days where i spend hours just casually walking around the city exploring. The graphics are amazing, originally played it on my R9 290 and the game played flawlessly, single player is fantastic, with a great multi threaded storylineGTA Online might be a bit daunting at first, but once you get your first house and do a few missions with othe people youll get the hang in no timeDefinetly the best GTA game of the series
