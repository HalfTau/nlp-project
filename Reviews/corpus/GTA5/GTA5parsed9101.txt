Wont say anything about the Online cause I almost dont play it, but the Single Player is still one of my favorites games to this day. Nice story, interesting characters, a lot of things to do. Its not flawless though the police this time is a pain in theinstead of beying fun. And I really miss things we had in previous GTA games like eating in food places and stands, playing pool and bowling. Well you cant have it all I guess
