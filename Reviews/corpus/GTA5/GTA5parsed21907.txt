At first i liked playing it.It was fun to play with friends go with them and do heists missions etc but in 2016 everything changed there were so many modders yes MODDERS NOT HACKERS.Modders just change their games files by putting a mod menu into their files that coders have made.hackers are way different then that so yea as i said modders began roaming the lobbyies of GtaV online and i was one of the few thousand of victims that got BANNED for playing the game while being in a lobby with a modder that gave me a lot of money that i didnt want and did weird stuff like putting an UFO on my head.And thats the reason i hate Rockstar they dont care about their damn community they just want the money and i think im not the only one that thinks so.
