Single player is very good, but you cant do as much stuff than online.Online is a pain and the game is broke by modders who can remotely kill you by thowing a boat at you while you are in a plane 18 min into a 20 min mission to get 20k  for buying a 6M  plane.... wich will need a 3M  hangar to store it into.Grinding for money is long and repetitive and things are ridiculously priced... if you want to appreciate the online experience, expect to buy many, many shark cards.... Personnaly, when I buy a game, I canT imagine paying another 100 to have some flying pixels.And if you are planning to grind the money to get something interesting, youll be playing something else by the time youll get the thing.
