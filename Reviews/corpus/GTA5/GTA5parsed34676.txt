Well, when compared to Overkill, Rockstar took a quite terrible way to deal with modding community.So these are what we got after they decided to take mods out from singleplayer.1.Hackers, Hackers everywhere even they are banned as fast as possible.2.No MODs in singleplayer? Are you kidding me?3.Sooooo god damned diifficult to earn your fortune in heists.Now GTAV became another game with open world but restricted gaming style.Rockstar, good fcing job.
