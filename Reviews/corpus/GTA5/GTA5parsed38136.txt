Dont buy this game. The community is as good as dead, and the only reason I bought it is so I could mod. Then Take Two decides to shoot themselves in the foot, and act like modding is molesting a child a sin. The modding community is what drove me to GTA IV, and whats now driving me away. Nice job Take Two, you can tend the rabbits now.
