Not gonna bother on the single player experience as its the same for everyone, as for the online part Ill try to share as much as I can. The online part of GTA is loads of fun, just you doing your thing until some  in a hydra blows you up. But I cant say much as thats part of the online experience. After hours of grinding youre gonna get bored real fast, everything in the online version costs so much money! Even after doing 1 heist you still wont have enough cash to buy literally anything! Its a total grindfest and it gets stale real quick. If youre planning to buy GTA for the online content be prepared to grind for hours just to get one car or a house, we cant really blame rockstar on this as every DLC they give us is free and theyre still providing us with new content for a 3 year old game. So I guess if your not into grinding youll have to buy the sharkcards or hire a modder and probably get banned. Thats basically Gta5 online. Ill give a 7/10.
