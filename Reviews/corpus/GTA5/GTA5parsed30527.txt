TakeTwo Interactive sent a cease and desist notice to Open IV, because they said some people could use it to mod in money on GTA Online. As if being one of the top selling games on Steam wasnt enough, they did it solely because they want us to buy even more of their Shark Cards. In turn, now the ability to have singleplayer mods has been brutally murdered in cold blood due to their insatiable greed. How can we stand for this type of injustice? ModLivesMatter
