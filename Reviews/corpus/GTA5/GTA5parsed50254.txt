Thanks TakeTwo Interactive.The only reason I buy GTA anymore is to play online with friends or fool around with mods. All my friends got bored of Online on console already before we all owned it on PC.Never even got a chance to try the mods and now theyre illegal.Thanks for turning this into a waste of almost 40
