I got banned after owning this game for one and a half years. Idk why Rockstar do this, is it because theres another discount on steam? Just letting you know, in GTA Online therere millions of hackers messing around in the session and ruining other players gaming experience. But all Rockstar did, is banning peoples account randomly. So I DONT RECOMMAND THIS GAME AT ALL!!!!!!!!! The game is a great game but ROCKSTAR FKING SUCK! So in my opinion, this game dont worth the price. Not at all.
