Really good single player campaign, but GTA Online is an exercise in frustration. It takes a very long time to load into a session and you are never automatically placed in a session with friends when starting the game.GTA Online is rife with hacking which usually means you die a lot to people that spawn the best weaponry or you get kicked from the game because youre being gifted cash or somehow killing everybody in the session instantly.If you can get a team of friends together, the Heist missions in GTA Online are instanced, so theres no way to be griefed there and you have an objective.Update Changing review to negative because the load times for GTA Online coupled with the cheating and Rockstars attitude to both ignoring it is unacceptable.
