The game is really good, but as you may have guessed this negative review is to further prove to Take Two that the path they seem to want to take is a path of conflict between them and the rest of the PC gaming community.If they want to keep this line of conduct, rest assured that I wont buy any games from Take Two in the future. Ill play them some way or another but Ill make sure that they dont make a cent out of it.The saddest part of this pathetic situation is that I love Rockstar Games. Ive been a fan of them from a long time and Ive always shared most of their views and stances. I know that theyre probably on the side of modders since theyve almost tolerated such things in the past.Its sad and unjust that they have to see one of their best games torn by negative reviews because of their retared publishers actions. So, I want to make it clear and I think I can speak for the rest of the recent reviewers we are still fans of Rockstar, its reputation is still among the highest in the gaming industry.The only ones who will be treated like pariahs will be the idiots of Take Two, unless they publicly ask for forgiveness and allow again OpenIV to operate.
