I actually preordered this with a box and everything when it first came out on PC. I had so much of a blast then, even doing online with friends. Then I stopped. I picked it up when it was on sale again since some of those same friends talked about the upcoming Doomsday Heist. Over the course of two hours, I remembered again why I fell in such love with this franchise as I downed four beers, got in a wrecked car I already stole, wheeled around like a man possessed shooting any car in sight, getting chased by cops, sobering up and wading through marshlands with a sniper rifle and the determination to shoot the first living thing I came across, fired into a bridge, killed three soldiers, escaped 3 stars by running under the bridge, shot a woman in the head at point blank range with the sniper, stole her jeep, jumped into another car after crashing into and killing the driver, and then returned to my apartment. I remember being audibly in ecstacy. It had been a while since I was that happy. If that doesnt prove this games status as a masterpiece of openworld design, the people seeking that proof will never be satisfied.
