Had potential, Rockstar ruined it. Like putting ketchup on icecream. Single player is okay. However GTA Online is a huge ing grind. Everything is overpriced as  changing the colour of your gun or your car horn is a good 30k right there. Missions are boring and repititive and barely pay. You need at least a good 100 million to have decent stuff and have fun in freemode. This is not a game, just a time waster.
