Rockstars monetized the game to I bought this day 1 on an old account, and besides what felt like false advertising in the time it took to roll out heists and other promised content, they also recently stopped supporting account transfers the month or so before I bought it. Furthermore, Im pretty sure they just realized with this game that they could suck money out of a niche market constantly buying SHART Cards every time they roll out a sports car remodel with a 3,000,000 ingame price tag. And when that proved not to be enough, they went after the modding community. Whom were honestly just circumventing all this stupidity by creating their own content. Do not recommend.
