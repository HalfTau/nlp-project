I thought the game was mediocre when it first released. Now, that Take Two made OpenIV cease and desist, I have come to hate it.NOTEMy lack of hours from the game is from when I refunded it because my PC was a potato back then. I had experience with the game on consoles, but havent played it since PC, since my disc got laser burnt.
