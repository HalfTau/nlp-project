The reversal of their stance on modding means I can once again recommend GTA V  Fantastic single player campaign and fun online component with friends... I can not recommend playing in an online session with randos, as the majority of random sessions I have had have been with your average foul mouthed, cheating 12 year old... much like every other online game Have enjoyed the GTA games since the early 90s, but their recent anti modding stance means I can no longer recommend them. Never thought Rockstar would make Bethesda look good
