I will just say a few things here as to why you should not buy this game. A. Single player has been thrown out in the dirt and left to die, and with this new modding policy that put the final nail in the coffin. The reason they have done this however is to force everyone into their cancerous online mode where you can find // spray and pray ban waves // endless microtransactions // repetitive gameplay and new content // rampent modding // insane loading times // and many more issues // Overall please just dont give this game your money. Rockstar asks you to pay 60 for a game by advertising a fun single player mode and then chokes you to death with their extortion cards to line their fat ing pig holes with money.
