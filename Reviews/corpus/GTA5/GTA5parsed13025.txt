I have been banned from playing both singleplayer and multiplayer. I have sent a support ticket to rockstar to find out why, but clearly they dont have enough time to deal with me. I requested a refund for this game despite my playtime because it literally sits in my library collecting dust. This game is fund but i dont recommend it simply because Rockstars customer support is so horrible. Save yourself the headache and buy something else.
