Avoid like the plauge right now, people!Modders are running rampant in online, with nothing being done about it. Ive had multiple friends banned for hacking when they were in a public match and a modder decided to randomly gift them millions of dollars without asking. I cant even play online out of fear of being screwed over by some dbag with nothing better to do than ruin peoples fun. Best part is Rockstars only to happy to ignore our pleas for something to be done about it.On top of that, they are going after SINGLE player modders!! Threatening them with lawsuit!! Are. You. Fing. Kidding. Me. Basically doing nothing to combat online modding thats ruining peoples fun, but you have no problem messing with people making mods to assist people with machinima.... congrats rockstar, you managed to hit EAs level of sht company. Hats off to ya.This game is a lot of fun, to bad online modders, and terrible buisness practises have made me unable to recommend this game, which is a shame. Not that Rockstar cares. Cnts.
