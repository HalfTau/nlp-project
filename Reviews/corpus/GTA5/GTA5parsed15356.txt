Very good game. Interesting single player campaign, great multiplayer expirience. The start of GTA Online is hard, but once you break the 1 million mark, you are all good to go. There are modders, though, so do beware. The DLC is fun to play and us vert addictive. Graphics still hold up very nicely to todays standards. Would definetly recomend to anyone who is looking to buy this game.
