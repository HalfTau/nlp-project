This game is one of the best but... technicaly only in campaign because with the latest update the doomsday heist is way more saints row than gta. Its still a good game both singleplayer and multiplayer but I more recommend play singleplayer than online. good game a GOTY game good graphics good campaign too much weird updates too many hackers too expansive updatessee for yourself
