Despite all the negative reviews due to the OpenIV cease and desist the game is great. Phenomenal single player with probably the best voice acting Ive heard. Online is great fun if you have friends to play it with, theres 5 heists you can do online as well as a ton of races, mini games, and many things to collect such as weapons, clothing, cars.
