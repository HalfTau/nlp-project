I enjoyed this game while I played it. Both on PC and back on the consoles. Sadly since Ive stopped playing, GTA5 has been ruined by shady practices and  moves. Putting this on sale with a Free Shark card to keep people from returning it. Banning anyone who mods their single player for harmless fun. Online FULL of hackers. Just the concept of Shark Cards And now destroying modding for their own game, screwing over people who love it. Its a good game being soured over time for the sake of money grubbing.
