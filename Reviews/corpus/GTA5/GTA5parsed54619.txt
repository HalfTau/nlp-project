Take2 took us down! Lets revert that.Huge fan of Rockstar games here, I bought GTA V on PS4 for the online mode and one more time on PC for modding. I never spent one dollar in online mod but spent a lot for the modded game without speaking about donations to modders.But now, and until this bad move will still be, no more Rockstar games, no Red Dead Redemption 2, no GTA 6. I promise it.Just let the people be creative.
