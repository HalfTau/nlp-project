This game is definitely not for everyone as the adult content is probably offensive to some but it was a welcomed game in my library. I dont need all of my games to be politically correct and emotionally sensitive, sometimes I want to play something more gritty and this game scratches that itch. This is handsdown my favorite Grand Theft Auto and I recommend it to anyone familiar with the series. Dont pass this game up on a good sale!
