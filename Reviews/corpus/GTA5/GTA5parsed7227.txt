Stop ing about the being bad at the game or modders. As long as youre not modding then dont worry about getting banned, besides most of the time modders just give you free GTA cash. And its not that hard to make money, just join races and heist andand win tf... Even if you dont win races are giving x2 REP and Cash, what more can you ask for. Sure I just got the game, but Its a game Ive been trying to get a hold of for years now, and I love it. Maybe Im late to the party, but its still fun af, maybe even more fun now with the modders doing funny Anyways, I love it and you should to, theres no reason not to...
