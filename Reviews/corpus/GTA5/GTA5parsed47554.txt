EDIT Since Take Two has wisely decided to leave OpenVI alone, I have once again given the game the thumbs up it so rightly deserves!While I love the game, the recent move by the publisher to issue a CD to the makers of OpenIV, the modding backbone of the community, is spearheding a trend towards not allowing gamers to play the way they want to, and only allowing games to be played exactly as the creators want. It is, to use the mildest words possible, extremely consumer hostile. Especially when you consider the fact the the makers of OpenIV went out of their way to make sure it was mpossible to use their mod with the online portion of the game! As such I cannot recommend it to anyone unless you are only want to play online...I sincerely hope the publishers see the error of their ways, and instead opens up the sngle player game for modding, perhaps even with Workshop support as a ways to make ammends. If theyre smart, they see the value of a vibrant modding scene, and instead of blocking attempts to expand the game, hire the makers of OpenIV to make modding the game easier and better. That way you could expand the life cycle of the game well beyond the expected unmodded lifetime...
