Im going to start off by saying that this game is fun, immersive, and addictive.  It can be a ton of fun.  The reason Im currently not reccomending this game is because of the recent events that took place in both online and single player.  As many people may know, many Rockstar and Take Two games have suffered from their recent choices, which was to basically hunt down and crucify ALL modders.  Im not talking about those little s on GTAV online who teleport you under the map.  Im talking about every single one.  Even the people who just mod in single player.  Also, tons of other people who arent even modders are being punished.  For example, someone who recieves 1000 dollars from a modder has 100000 dollars subtracted from their in game balance.  The thing that gets under my skin the most is the single player mod ban.  Its not even impacting anyone.  Its basically saying that someone cant build a house on their own land.  Many people exclusively played GTAV for the mods.  Mods were a crucial part of GTAV, because you could change it into a different game.  You could go from Portal 2 to Tsunami simulator.  The mods and the people who made them were truly amazing because it ment GTA was not just one game.  It could be configured and modified to be qny game where only the sky was the limit.  Rockstar not only restricts it now, but will punish you if you do mod anywhere, which in my opinion, is outrageous.
