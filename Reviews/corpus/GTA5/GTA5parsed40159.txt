Dont buy it if your into modding. The online community is cancerous and garbage. Online portion of the game is filled with overpriced everything to make you want to spend your hard earned money on in game cash because we all know completeing missions and doing heists pays absolute ing terrible. And yes I know I only have 100 hours on pc but thats mostly spent on single player modding, i have about 4000 hours online with console. Only advice I can give is to not pay full price and get the game on other websites Geeeee22222aaaaa kkkiinnnggguuiinnn , most of you will know those sites.
