Taketwo interactive, the creators and benefactors of Grand Theft Auto V have abused their Terms of Service agreements to send cease and desist orders to modders, threatening legal action for modding the game for our enjoyment.Most game developers see modding for what it is  a free way to increase enjoyment of the product and to increase sales and prolong the shelf life of the game.Taketwo seems to think that modding is dangerous to the income from their  DLCs. Why buy a  overpriced DLC when you can get a mod for free that does it better? thats just my guess, though.If you agree with my statement, please sign this petition and leave a negative review on all their products.Thank you.Sign this petition please
