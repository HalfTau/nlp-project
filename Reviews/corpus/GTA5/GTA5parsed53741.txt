First and foremost, I love this game. I been playing GTA series since Vice City. I bought GTA V THREE TIMES. PS3 when it first came out, PS4 remaster and now PC.The thumb down is reguarding the recent decesion to ban OpenIV.This is a big  you to singleplayer.We, the singleplayer base MADE this franchise of what it is today.Ever since GTA 3 the focus has been on singleplayerBut they made a ton of money on GTA onlineand the company turned their backs on uswow that didnt take long did it? proof that Rockstar is a greedy company just like everyone elseFirst they STOPPED updating singleplayer with new vechiclesso you cant test drive them before spending REAL money to buy them onlineThen they increased the price on online item after heist came up to simulate inflationbut we all know the real reason for that do we?Its to sell Shark Cards.I thought. fine Ill just play offline and get new stuff using mods thats arent available in singleplayerNow theyre banning OpenIV, if you dunno what that is its an essential software for a lot of modsbascially I cant even mod my game offline anymore, which doesnt affect anyoneThis is the last nail in the coffin for meRockstar/TakeTwo can go  themselves.
