If you want to get anything in the game, you can either grind for hundreds of hours or pay them in microtransactions. One of the planes costs over 100 of real money if you want to buy it using microtransactions. If you dont buy the stuff, then other players can kill you repeatedly since you dont have the proper equipment to fight back, causing you to lose money.
