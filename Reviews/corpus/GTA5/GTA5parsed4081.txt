Review for GTA Online.Here is what I think after playing this game 100 hours.I recommend buying this game since all DLC are free and offers great value.I do not recommend to buy online cash Shark Card or Criminal Starter Pack. This would be like skipping half of the game. Take your time to make your own money, this is the purpose of the game.Pro  Close to 500 vehicules to select from, each one iwith it own personnality. Bravo. Missions and DLC offers excellent stories and cut scenes, excellent production quality. Tons of diverse missions, from race, to deathmatch and everything in between.Cons  Loading time for GTA Online is too long. Too many modder. The game is infected with cheater.
