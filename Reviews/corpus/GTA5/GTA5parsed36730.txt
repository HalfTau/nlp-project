Single player is okay.Multiplayer is a grind.Im mostly reviewing due to the recent mod illegalization. The main reason take two did this is because of the cheaters in online. Well I have played this game on and off since release and I can tell you that the cheaters have been there from the start. So for 2 years you did nothing. Meaning to me that this is their last resort for curbing the cheaters. In doing so theyve cut off the biggest source of dlc  fan created mods. Im not much of a mod user for this particular game but dont like the precedent thats set by having take two illegalize modding. So for this reason I will not recommend.
