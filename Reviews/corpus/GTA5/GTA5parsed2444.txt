Fun game. Not too many hackers, but if you do find one, you can just go into another lobby within 30s. Not easy to make money, but I enjoy the challenge. I played the story mode on Xbox and it was fun. Anyways, if youre looking for a game that isnt instant rags to riches, than you should do well with this. Well worth the 60.
