I used to love this game, and all of the games in the series. I even put up with waiting for single player DLC for years, because the mods made the game replayable. Now, theyve went and shot themselves in the foot. This truly shows the true colors of Take Two and Rockstar, their greed and their lack of respect for the fans of the series, the ones that made them who they are today. What a complete and utter joke. I wish I could get a refund for the numerous Rockstar products on my games list. This game isnt worth 5.00, let alone 69 Canadian Dollars. Garbage online gameplay, and now zero reason to play single player. Thanks for showing us fans what you really think of us, though we already knew with your microtransactions and constant online only DLC.
