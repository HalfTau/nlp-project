Single player is okay, even though there is nothing to do once completed at the beginning you have no cash and no way to get it, while at the end you have more than you could spend, it needs a better balance, just like in San Andreas, where you could at least earn money as a paramedic or taxi driver.Multiplayer is a one big technical issue. Loading times reaching 10 minutes or more, random errors, modders, empty sessions. Furthermore, there is really no point in playing this mode without friends NOTHING can be done solo. Never before have I been so disappointed with a purchase However, steam wont accept my refund because I had 334 of playtime instead of 200 or less....
