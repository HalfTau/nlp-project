The story is immensely great, extremely rich.Online is , but just hear me out.Online is only , because you guys dont want to experience it.Online is so much more fun then the story with friends.Ive gone through 150 hours of purely playing online with friends, goofing around, doing heists, etc.The one thing that makes online a liability is the fact that people are extremely rude. They acquire the most OP cars through illegitimate means, like modding. These use these vehicles to do nothing but ruin the game for others. If I can recommend it, only play online with friends, in a friends only session, so you dont have to deal with tryhards who arent willing to enjoy other aspects of the game itself.
