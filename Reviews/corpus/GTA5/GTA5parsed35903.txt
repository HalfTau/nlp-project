The sad thing is its not that the game is bad, its the actual game infrastructure and servers that are apparently so easy to hack and mod. Take Two and Rockstar have already taken down the most widely used cheat/exploit providers, which have nothing to do with openIV. OpenIV specifically gets you to create a mod folder that will only be used in single player. As far as I remember, trying to mod the game files within openIV without a mod folder for single player means the game wont even launch or it will crash on start up in online.I was also speaking to a modder on the gta online chat the other day, asking him not to give me money etc, and I asked how modders could mod online so easily, and he told me it was script injection, which Im pretty sure has nothing to do with openIV. If you want to add scripts you need an asi loader and so on and those files go into the game directory manually, not through openIV. Ive only ever modded single player, and not for a while, but thats how it used to be.Yes, modders are annoying as hell, but how much money do you really need to make? I bought gta5 on ps3 and pc, specifically so I could mod single player, as i had done with gtaIV and san andreas for years. Plus the pc community for gta5 is surely smaller than the console community, who have no option but to buy sharkcards and so on, so your revenue isnt going to exactly fall off a cliff. I think last year gta online through microtransactions alone had made over 1bn since its lauch, without taking into account purchases of the game. As a short term solution, this might make sense to take two interactive, but the ammount of negative community feedback will surely hurt them long term, especially since they dont exactly have many big new games from big ips out at the moment. Sad times.
