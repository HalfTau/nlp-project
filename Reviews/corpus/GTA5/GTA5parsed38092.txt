Ok, so I said Id recommend this game if TakeTwo gave us modding back. But now that Ive played online since modding has been banned, It really pisses me off to see how expensive 8 million ingame  costs. Its 100. Yep, 2 Zeros. Thats ridiculous. If you work hard enough, you can make that money in maybe 3 or 4 hours if you have all of the TopRange cars and 3 or 4 friends for Vehicle Cargo. But if you are buying this for the story mode, on the other hand...go for it.
