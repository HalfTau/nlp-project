The PC Version of GTA is all about Modding. Cutting that away is a realy bad move.I preordered the XBox360 Version and the PC Version of this Game, so i payed 130,  but apparently ive been undermonitized and a CEO that dosent even play games thinks that microtransactions is the way to go instead of a complete good Game.The online mode of this Game was a mess from the start, glitchers and hackers everywhere. Now Take 2 bans the modding scene and the one mod that strictly affects ONLY the singleplayer mode because they think it could harm their precious MoneyMakingMachine which is the multyplayer. The Money it makes comes strictly from kids that are to lazy to play the actual game, so they just buy ingamemoney with real money. So Take 2 does not only adress the issues the game has on their side very slowly or not at allwich makes hacking and glitching possible in the first place, they actively attract cancerous players for the sake of milking even the last few cents out of this game.It is sad for the crative team at Rockstar that sits behind this masterpiece, and no doubt about it the singleplayer IS a masterpiece of gaming. But the greedy, moneyhungry people in suits at Take 2 that just cant get enough ruined thos otherwise brilliant game.Under this circumstances i will never buy any Take 2 game ever and i strongly recomend the same to anyone that loves gaming and good games.
