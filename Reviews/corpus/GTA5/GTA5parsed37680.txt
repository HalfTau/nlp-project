OpenIV was a modding platform that damaged the multiplayer experience by giving small children access to immensely powerful griefing tool that could essentially take away everything you ever had worked to achieve in multiplayer. Im glad Take Two has taken a stand against the oppressive modders that had ruined the online gameplay and im so glad that cheating is both impossible and illegal.
