This is a great game, fun to play in Singleplayer or with friends in private games tuning cars. Online is a bit dull as of allot of the hackers. But, if you are a modder, than dont buy it yet!Rockstar already took the Multiplayer Mods away as we get banned of we play online with mods. Fair enough, we created singleplayer mods and a different version of multiplayer. We were happy again, and didnt really complain.And now Rockstar also took our Singleplayer mods away, well, that is the end of GTA for me. And propably allot of others too.
