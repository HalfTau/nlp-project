This game is the best. And Im super happy that Rockstar removed modding from all the salty butthurt modders who ruined the game for anyone who actually wanted to play the real game. So if you actually want to enjoy GTA online now, now is the time. No more stupid  bogging down the servers by spawning too much pointless garbage. No more dying by randomly blowing up in your apartment and not being able to leave. Im so happy you  modders got that taken away. Thats what you get hahahahahahahah
