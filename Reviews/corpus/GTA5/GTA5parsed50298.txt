DONT BUY!!Loved the game, but cant support it anymoreSo you feel like sueing gamers who loved the original, but its old. So they are mod/upgrading your 5 year old game.Instead of looking at what modders are doing, and using them as a the brain storming community cloud. Seeing how and why somthing is popular. Using your RockStar skills, see what they are doing, and do it better.Youd rather see how many shark cards your hacked to unplayablity public servers can sell.Your idea is bad and you should feel bad
