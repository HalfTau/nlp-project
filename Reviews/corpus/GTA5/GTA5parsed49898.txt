The worst game after the illegalization off the mods. Before the illegalization off the mods you could install GTA V Redux, cool world mods, character mods and some, like job/mission jobs. TakeTwo destroyed the mod community. GTA modders hate what they did. Personaly I wouldn t buy it. Without mods it s not funny. We just wanted to mod the story mode because after the story of GTA ends the game will end now. With mods you could make more missions. Don t buy it. Online is trash anyways because in the 2 out of 10 lobbies/sessions you will find an online modder, cause online modders use their own drivers/injectors and not OpenIV, who will put toilets with explosives ON YOUR FCKING HEAD. FIX THE ANTICHEAT AND ALLOW STORY MODS.
