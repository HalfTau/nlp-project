Mods keep games fresh and alive. More often than not, they reward us with endless hours of entertainment, and reward the studios ultimately with sales. They grow communities and make the game something bigger, than people wouldve ever imagined. They spread word of good reputation, which is technically free advertisement, too.Yea, lets stop that, TakeTwo. Let us remember TakeTwo interactive as the publisher who allegedly made 700,000,000 off of GTA V Online last year? The craphole where you spend half your time in loading screens to do some fun activities, and only stop playing because some cheater teleported you up in the air, to kill you with artillery fire or whatever. Lets rather have a precedence case against mods, whats the worst that could happen?
