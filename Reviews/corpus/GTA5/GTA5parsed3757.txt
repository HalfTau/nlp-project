So its up to you what you are looking at this game for. If you are interested in story, this game really nails it in the ground. If youre thinking about working your way to the top in GTA Online, I would think about it. While it is definitely possible to do so it requires hours and hours of grinding. Therefore making this mode very p2w because most people give in to buying money which makes you progress, but then you find yourself needing more money, therefore spending more irl money. Overall, if you are looking for a real awesome story mode I recommend giving this game a try. If you are looking to only do online stuff, I would rethink.
