Such a beautiful game, ruined in so many ways. Give th egraphics designer and the peoople thinking of ideas for the cars a raise. The people handling the servers and the combat, and gameplay and bugs, fire them please. i actally cant deal with leavers and 10 minute load screens any more. this game will really take its toll on you. 50 of the time you are at a loadscreen. SSD will not help. Sucks cause i love this game so beautiful and so much fun when you arnt runningto the bulolcrap that happens a good 90 of the time. Im furious that i spent so many hours at loadscreens. After 6 leavers in a row, wasting hours of my time, and now 2 crashes, one cause aleaver, and one cause I couldnt get into a job I accepted. UNINSTALLING, before I go crazy. Dont waste your money.
