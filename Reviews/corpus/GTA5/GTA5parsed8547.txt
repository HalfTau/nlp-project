You get thrown in with random people, who have no sense of what is going on, dont speak english, cant follow simple directions. After spending hours on completing missions, heist, you finally earn some money. You do the same thing over and over again when, at last, youve got couple millions in your bank account, spend it all on something absolutely pointless, but at this point you are beyond caring why or how. And you just wasted your time reading this, congrats.
