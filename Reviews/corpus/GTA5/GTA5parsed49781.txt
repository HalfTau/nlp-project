Why GTA is goodIts the satire of american culture and its a high level of media, it has something for everyone of every layer. Somebody who wants to analyze this work of art in its context can, on a base level and hyper intellectual level. GTA keeps itself approachable for anyone. The story in GTA V is really good, most my hours are from the singleplayer. The characters feel like REAL people and develop as people the more you engage into the plot. I really really enjoyed the characters in this one and Im the type to usually skip cutscenes for video games but not this one.  Its always a pleasure to listen to Lamar get his thug on. Not much else I have to say besides its something to experience. Gameplay wise its what youd expect from any GTA game at this point, more cars, guns, money, clothes, hoes and good singleplayer missions.Why GTA is badThe GUI is garbage, it was console designed and felt likeon PC, way to many menus and other nonsense. The multiplayer is also garbage. The online heists are nothing at all like the ones in the singleplayer, just missions with a set up beforehand but lacking in quality, the excitement and intenseness is not there, theyre dull. Its a samey repetitive long grind to buy million dollar cars and apartments they keep putting in their slow drip feed of mediocre content to keep the poor chaps asking for moms credit card to buy some more shark cards. This game is filled with terrible policies and and cancer of a community. The cover for this game should be a picture of an ATM machine.I can only see this game being fun if you try really hard to be creative and have a few people for invite only sessions, but thats not a selling point and neither are friends.
