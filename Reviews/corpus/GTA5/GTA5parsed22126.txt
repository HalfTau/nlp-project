Take Two have ruined their own reputation by attempting to shutdown OpenIV.Modding is not illegal.. So why would Take Two even dare do what theyre doing? Seriously, stopping mods? Modding is apart of gaming and what keeps games like this playable for years on end!RIP OpenIV. Very sad days were living in..An apology from Take Two just isnt even near enough.. They need to reverse and do something about this, stop being greedy and stop being a bunch of turds trying to ruin something thats beautiful and trying to shut it down.
