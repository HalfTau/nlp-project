This game was fun in the beginning but now it seems rockstar is only in it for the money by banning anybody who got cash by a cheater who had absolutley nothing to do with the money. Yet they allow youtubers like Slogoman, Kwebbelkop, and Jelly who obviously have modded accounts. In conclusions this game as of right now is a waste of money.
