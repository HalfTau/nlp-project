Without mods in single player story mode this game sucks!! I,ve beat the story mode atleast four times over then I discovered OpenIV and mods for gta5 and started playing it again. Then all of a sudden Take two decided they no longer support modding. Without mods for single player this game has no replayability. Not worth it at full asking price, just wait for a sale later on down the road when it fall below 5.99USD.As for the multiplayer all take two and rockstar want to do is microtransactions and sale shark cards which I get it they are a company and they need to make money. Where it becomes unfair is that OpenIV was for single player only and since the game came out they didnt have a problem with it until just now. It wouldnt suprise me if they release a creation kit and start charging shark card fees for mods that would explain the sudden cease on modding.
