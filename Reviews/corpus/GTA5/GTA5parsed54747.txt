Just doing my part. Ill change it to a positive if they continue to let OpenIV do its thing. If were to be able to stop TakeTwo from treating us like mere mines for them to strip of cash, then it starts here and leads to a boycott, if it gets to that. For that reason, Im also not buying any more games published by T2 unless they kill that cease and desist. By now means do you have to boycott yourself, as T2 does have some really good games some of my favorites, in fact. But if the mods, or even just the principle matters enough to you, then I urge you to do the same.
