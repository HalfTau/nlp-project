This game is broken, not worth your 40. Back in the days of the Xbox 360 and the PS3 I would say hell yeah, buy this game. But now its pay2win. Think of For Honor, but in a criminal based game in the Rage engine. You get GTA V. This game has many features, like diving, but I would just buy Saints Row 3 on sale now and add a sea mod. This is PC gaming, we can add anything. This game died when it came out for next gen consoles to be honest, the DLC has broken the game and made it pay2win. So sad that this game has come this way. They also removed modding totally, so... you get the base game. Just the console version with higher framerates and better graphics. Done. Nothing is different from them now.
