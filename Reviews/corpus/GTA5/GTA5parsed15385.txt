I cant even put how i feel about this game into words, Its utterat this point, the company that owns it is nothing but a pile ofis sentient not like that means much. If your going to buy this game, i prey for you becase in about... i dont know say anywhere from 1 week to 1 month you are going to eitherA become a hacker for money and lose moneyB play the game legit and lose moneyC get banned for lagging or haveing dual gpusD getting banned for seeing a hackerE get banned for well standing thereF get banned for signing into the online.This game used to be worth something but years later, Still 60 for something that will cause nothing but heart ache.Take it from me, and ill admit i went for the hacks too, AFTER my first offence of playing legit, i gotthey RESET my account even the money my brother bought me with a shark card. What is funny i never got caught with hacks, people wanted to even ask how it was done, but no never busted or even caught, pretty sure still have not been. But i gave up playing the game.Dont even buy it for the single player, there is no replayability in it. Once you play its done, all you can do is play online and get ed over, 60 for somethign run by monkeys that have been dead isnt worth it. Maybe if the game was.. idk.. free it might be worth the BS like every other Play to win game out there.i own the game off the R launcher.
