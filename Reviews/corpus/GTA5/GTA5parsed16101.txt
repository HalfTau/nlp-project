Aah I remember the good old days on GTA V when I bought it on the PS3. Good times. Anyway the Storymode of the game is really well done nothing to say here. But GTA Online.. oh boy it sucks so hard lately because the grind is just too much. You need like 5 days of playing to get like 1 of the new vehicles which in my opinion is not really fun and some people who are wealthier can just buy some Sharkcards and get the new vehicles immediately. You CAN have some fun with friends but if you play for a longer time or you always play alone it gets boring really fast...by the way public lobbies are also crap because everyone just randomkills you even if you try to be friendly and there are so many modders in the game who will randomkill you aswell. Oh and if you have a bad internet connection like me and you play online you can expect to lag all the time.I just hope they implement some kind of system that you can get like a money booster for jobsfor example you finish 3 daily jobs in a row and you get like a moneybooster of x3 for the next 3 missions or something like that idk then maybe i will play this game again to grind, but right now I dont think this game deserves my time.Edit Of course the moneybooster would only work on missions and not on heists cause that would be too op
