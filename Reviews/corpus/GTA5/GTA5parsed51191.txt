The only reason to purchase this game on PC is for its modding capabilities. They have now removed the ability to mod sinbleplayer which Rockstar have even said was perfectly acceptable. No. This is wrong. The only reason the game survives on PC is because of mods. Rockstar gave a statement that was clearly not 100 the truth.I find the actions of the developer and its owner unnacceptable and this game is no longer worth purchasing.
