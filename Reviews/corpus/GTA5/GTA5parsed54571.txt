They took away our mods. I did not use them personally, but they where always a joy to hear about, and Im sure plenty of players enjoyed them. Id advise everyone to not buy shark cash, or other micro transactions, but I would have said that before. Instead Id suggest refraining from buying or preordering any future Take Two games until they reform their policy on modding tools for their games.
