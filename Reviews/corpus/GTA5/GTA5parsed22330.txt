GTA 5 isnt what it used to be and I cant really recommend this game to anyone other than someone looking for a fun singleplayer story. Modding has destroyed both the online and offline portions of the game, since you cant use mods anymore for offline play and hackers are destroying any hope of fun in GTA Online.GTA Online is by far the worst part of this game. When it first launched on PC, thats all anyone was playing. Heists were amazing, the races were fun, and causing havok on the streets was hilarious. Since then, all Rockstar has done is release the same rehashed DLC over and over again in an attempt to force players to buy Rockstars ingame currency for real money. The only way to make money outside of these microtransactions is to grind for weeks to be able to afford whatever car, house or yacht that youre wanting to purchase.If Rockstar put in some actual work and gave players an easy way to earn money ingame while providing interesting DLC content to play, Id start playing again. But until then Im gonna keep it off my hard drive to make room for better games.
