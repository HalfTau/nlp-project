Ive purchased this game 3 times, all at 60 xbox360, xboxONE, PC. I still enjoy playing it, but you know what would continue to provide enjoyment for even for years to come? Mods. Mods that add more to the game like Skyrim and Fallout, like Kerbal Space Program and Microsoft Flight Simulator.By making it illegal to mod GTA5, TakeTwo is telling me to stop playing their game, because I beaten it already, and explored the granted free features online.Great Game but the devs really played me 180 in.. Since I dont legally have the ability to modify the games files.
