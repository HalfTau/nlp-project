The Grand Theft Auto series is like the Dan Brown of video games. Honestly, theyre way less clever than they think they are, and they have a schtick that they have been going with forever and figure that it hasnt gotten old.People dont read Dan Brown for realworld facts or relatable characters that people like. Similarly, people dont actually enjoy the GTA games for their hardhitting parody of American culture as conceived by a room full of Nigels.Dont buy it for the pathetic attempt at social commentary that comes off like someone told a 6 year old what satire was. Buy it for the GAME  which is amazing.The environments, the characters again, avoiding the heavyhanded attempts at political or social humor, the actual PLOT are all fantastic. The soundtrack is great, the amount of content is genuinely overwhelming. The driving mechanics at least with mouse and keyboard are honestly some of the best Ive played. Just driving in this game is a delight. Coming out of the hills at night to see the lights of north Vinewood spread out in front of you, blowing by traffic while Sleepwalking is on the radio is more compressed awesome in one moment of playing than some games can deliver through their entire game.Long story short the game itself is incredible.
