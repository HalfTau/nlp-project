The single player is fun, good gameplay and decent story.  The issues start with GTA Online the horrible launch and rockstar fixing the economy and also the delay of the heists.  The open world is fun to play with friends but the issue is getting the money to do so.  At the start of the game you could play the basic missions and make decent money as nothing was priced to high but the nerfed money making in the game.  The issue is money making in GTA Online is a chore not a fun part of the game.  This would be fine but the severs didnt always work right so when going into missions people would get stuck on loading screens and going out everyone might get dropped onto diffrent servers.  The issue is you had to get into the game and then when it was over you had to exit unless you wanted to play a map eventaka a race and etc.  Heists fix some of the money issue after years.  The major issue with GTA Online is switching getting between the mainworld and the games/missions.  This makes me feel as if the missions where a add on the game not a core piece which they are this is my issue with this game.Then they attacked the single player mods.  Stuff that  only effects singleplayer not hacking in online.
