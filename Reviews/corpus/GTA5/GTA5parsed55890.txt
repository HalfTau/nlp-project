Would I recomend this game, well the answer is very simple. The reason I play on PC as the main plattform for gaming at all, is cosumization. It is what made Need for Speed Most Wanted good, it is what made GTA V not just a good game, but a great game. So to conglude GTA with mods YES GTA like how it is turning No mods NO!
