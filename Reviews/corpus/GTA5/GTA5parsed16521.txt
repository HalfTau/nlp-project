Single player is fun, but online has turned into a complete money grab by Rockstar.Rampant modders in public sessions, inability to do newer money making activities outside of public sessions.Money earned from double payout weeks with gunrunning and CEO import/export taken by Rockstar without explanation, while modders mostly keep their money, further making public sessions a nightmare.Increasing prices for new vehicles increase the need to grind hours of public lobbies in order to even try the new stuff.increasing need to buy new properties for each update instead of using existing ones makes the whole experience seem disjointed.Zero support, seriously none. There are early access games developed by single individuals with better support than this.Overall  play single player if you want, but Online is a mess and imo a waste of time/money.
