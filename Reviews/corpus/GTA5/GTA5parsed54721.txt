Been a fan of GTA literally from the start, have the original CD for the first one to this day.This is what happens when a company cares more about money than they do their fans.Way to take one my favourite franchises and drive it into the ground.Your game as it is online is trash, modders are the only ones that made it any fun for anyone at all.
