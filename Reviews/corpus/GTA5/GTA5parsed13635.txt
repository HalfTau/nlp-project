I think the best way to describe GTA V is story mode purists, 12 year old nihilists in GTA Online and people who complain about Shark Cards because they cant afford to buy them and dont want to put the time into the game, but other than that, its a solid game with a somewhat solid ? community, too. Its fairly welloptimized for almost any PC, although you might have to mess with the settings a wee bit. It may seem like a bit of a grind to begin with, but once you get into the routine, it becomes a very enjoyable experience. Whether you want to become a CEO and dominate other businesses or you want to walk around in boxers, air thrusting civilians, you can find it in this game.
