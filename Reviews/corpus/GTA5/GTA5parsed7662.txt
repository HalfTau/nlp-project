Wow, where to begin? Single Player great, get it!But since V was released in 2013 an with 6 not even being on the horizin I got the urge to play some GTA Online. Oh boy what a pile of steaming excrement. In total Im about 50 hours in and besides being incredibly slow to load anything getting anything done outside a private session seems to be almost impossible. I now have stopped playing because I returned to the game only to find a frecking christmas tree stuck on my head, 30m high wtf.To fix this I had to end the game and rejoin a real fix would be to actually make it impossible for anyone to put anything on me including mone. To give me some icing on my shait cake I joined a new game and returned to my bunker after some 15 minutes of joining only to find that I cannot register as a VIP because of my recent behavior. What?The game has been out for four! years now. Some guy can put a giant tree on my head and I get punished for it? How can they take real money for ingame currency when a random encounter can ruin your game?TLDR Do not sink money in this unmaintained pile of garbage.tks for reading
