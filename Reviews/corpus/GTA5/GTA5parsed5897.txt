This game is good and I played enough hours to feel like I did a good purchase.Pros  graphics gameplay things to do customization Cars and properties Fun because buggy some of weekly minigames are really cool and reminds me of snes/nes games. Heist are really nice the first time you play it CinematicsCons  No ranking system ranked PVP for teamfights could have been a  Maybe because of hackers but the GTA is way to hard to get compared to the price of things Everything feels too expensive, for example  hats can cost 30k and a simple contact missin gives around 5 and 40k. Game is way to easy to hack/mod, 50 chances to see a level 8000 in your session which is impossible in one single life. Unable to select the session you wish via a Lobby, there is no lobby so you are dropped randomly Extremely long and buggy loadings The game should consider merging old mission live in the session like any new missions related to DLC so we dont have to constantly get through the loading process.I know I have a lot of little critics about this game because in my hearth I feel like this game was closed to be the best ever made so this  is why Im really picky. I played GTA, GTA2, GTA3, GTA Vice City, GTA San Andreas, GTA4, and this one.Thank you Rockstar for finally fix the Memory loading issues, so you dont see the same car model spawning when you are looking for a specific car.PEACE!
