Due to Rockstars resent changes I have been forced to uninstall GTA V and I will not be returning. If Rockstar would embrace the modding community and make game modes like LSPDFR into the game as a update the game would be more enjoyable and lower the cost of weapons, vehicles, property and raised the payout for heists people wouldnt be forced to use money mods.
