Modding was the only reason I bought this game. Now that theyve shown their hand by killing it, I know Im done with the series. Dont buy unless you really, really like grinding against hackers in Online just to upgrade basic cars. Or spending hundreds of real dollars just to afford a decent car.TLDR Only for the rich and lifeless now.
