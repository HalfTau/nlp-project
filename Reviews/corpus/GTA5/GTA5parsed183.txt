game came out like 5 years ago and its BROKEN AS its still full of bugs, and its pretty much half broken..... its infested with annoying hackers and half the time you are playing you spend it loading the damn game for real, every loading takes around 5 minutes, minimum, and sadly you have to load the game A LOT, IF you are lucky enough it will find a sesion to play on, but again, you will get online in a sesion full of hackers, with everything broken, and if you try to change sesion you will end up in the same one AGAIN, that is how broken this game is, add the boring missions on and on and on tooliterally from those 43 hours i have been playing, 40 have been of me playing the special races.... funny, uh? because well, the idea of the game wasnt that.... and they promote the game with that now, how sad.......... i guess next rockstar game its gonna be one of cars
