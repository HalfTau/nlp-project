Ive had to pay for this game three times, The stupid rockstar CD key platform lock prevented me from even launching the steam game and dont even get me started on my Xbox copy.My only working copy being the rockstar launcher now doesnt even work because of their network port usage. Love the game, Hate Rockstar support.
