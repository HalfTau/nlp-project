Well done Take Two Interactive, seems you have finally accomplished something.Your now worse than EA when it comes to publishing games.Has it not occurred to you, the reason people mod the game, and spend thousands of hours in it is because the enjoy it?Maybe they reason they dont play the online version you provide is because your services are bad and full of cheaters? Maybe next time get off the community back who helps you pay your employees, and actually fix the stuff like hackers that NEED IT.
