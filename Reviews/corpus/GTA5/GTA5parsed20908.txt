Its a great game. There are a lot of options and game modes to play online. The only problem is the toxic people, but thats life. You can blame Rockstar, Take Two o whoever you want, but people is like that. Theres no online game without toxic people and this game is a good place for them. Some people will try to ruin your game just for fun.Biggest problem modders. You will find a hacker in every two games. I find it unbelievable how usual it is to find a hacker. I really cant understand how Rockstar doesnt have anything prepared to detect them as soon as theyre triggered, because theyre everywhere, literally. Its a huge problem, youll have to find a new server very often. Also youll see a lot of kids asking for modders in the chat. They are the ones who then come here crying because theyve been banned. They probably received money from a hacker.If you can get around hackers and toxic people, you will find a great game. You can do missions, play minigames, races, and make a lot different things. Its hard to get all the stuff you want, though, as things are expensive and youll need to spend a lot of time to get all the money you need to buy them.Apart from the online, you have the singleplayer, wich is very good too, although youll end up playing online or not playing at all.
