Loved GTAV for the single player mostly to be honest and I was looking forward to replaying it with mods. The whole Open IV issue is from my point of view disgusting, since Take Two seems to think taking away my freedom to mod a game Ive paid for is their right.I mean, some of the games I enjoyed most were games like Fallout 3, Fallout NV, XCom 2 w/ the Long War mod maybe take a lesson from Firaxis, you know... and the thought that publishers keep pushing towards dumbing down games AND trying to fight against mods is just unacceptable to me.Most likely, I wont ever reinstall GTAV and will wait out the next one. If stuff like this happens again, I dont want even 1 of my money to go to Take Two.
