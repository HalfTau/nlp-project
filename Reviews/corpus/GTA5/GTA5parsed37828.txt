review of gtaV as a standalone single player game in the gta series lotta fun. pretty great story, or stories rather, theres 3 guys it follows the lives ofgame includes gta online. neat. if you are rich in time or the traditional financial sense.recently a decision was made that many people are quite upset about. i was origionally planning on avoiding the hate train since this review will probably outlast my anger, but then i logged in. now keep in mind i have never cheated, hacked, modded, or exploited this game in any way. none of my friends have done so either. i have never asked anyone to cheat, or give me any illicit currency. but i went to login today and was given a message that i had been awarded xxxxxx... they AWARDED me a NEGATIVE value so now i have about 1 of what i had and about 5 of what i need to even START playing the new content. this, combined with their destruction of single player modding community, means i have to recommend you not spend your money here. if you want to play gta online, find another game, i promise it will be a better choice for whatever reason you want to play. if you only want the single player, well, all im gonna say is dont spend money on it
