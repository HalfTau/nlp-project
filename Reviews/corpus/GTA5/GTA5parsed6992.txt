Honestly sick of money  developers, pay real money for ingame money to pay for a heist which could easily fail as its in free roam with a bunch of toxic players. which will then force you to pay again and have the samehappen. you wanna play the new heist? best buy shark cards or spend hundreds of hours grinding otherwise its not gonna happen.
