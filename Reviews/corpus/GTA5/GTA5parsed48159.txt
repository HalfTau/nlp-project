This game was a blast, key word WAS. Mods were great unfortunately they removed this and now its not worth it anymore. If you are getting this for multiplayer and mods dont bother you at all, well still not in luck. The multiplayer scene is jsut as bad. The loading times are terrible and the grind isnt worth it. Missions get stale very fast and after a certian level, the missions get really easy.Dont get it, not worth it GTA went down hill, really dont buy it, spend your money elsewhere.
