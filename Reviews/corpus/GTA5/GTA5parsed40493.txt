Mods are an important part of the community. They provide replay value for the game.Making them illegal does not solve the real problem of online hacking and is a bad anticonsumer move on the part of the publisher.EDIT due to the outcry of the community, Rockstar have stepped back on the policy for mods and they are back, with some rules impeded.EDIT2 Keep in mind the microtransaction in multiplayer, but the game is worth the singleplayer experience alone.
