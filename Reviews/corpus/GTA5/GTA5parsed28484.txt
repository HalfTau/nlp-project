everybody that are being kids and giving negative because they took out mods are just stupid and unfair .. yes fair enough people want mods and people like mods but the game itsself is good .. a game is never buiult to have mods in mind and i find it kind of pathetic that people disslike the game because of that .. i have still just as much fun on this game as i did before they took mods out and that purely because i didnt use any mods... yes it was  of them to send the letter to OpenIV .. but do people actually think that bad revievs are going to stop rockstar from making money .. it makes me laugh seeing idiots post bad reviews from this all because they think mods should be in the game .. TOXIC and Unfair people who just cant play games so they have to use mods to make it better
