Money grab by publisher leaves bad taste in my mouth. Modding is the future of games. When you have games being released with 60 DLC packs, it just makes sense to get mods instead of shelling out money for unfinished games.Solution, Dont ship games with hundreds of tiny DLCs for 30 bucks, ship finished full games.
