This game is alot of fun and there is tons to do.  I have played it since the 360 then on the PS4 and now on the PC.  I know A LOT of people are having a fit right now over a mod getting banned but to be fair it was allowing people to exploit the online play.  Dont pay attention to these people and enjoy this great game
