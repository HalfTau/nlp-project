Any company that seeks to ruin your single player experience because they wish to make more money selling you shark cards, is a company I will no longer buy products from. Open IV did NOT affect multiplayer in any way, and was not the cause of hackers in your game. A massive factor in the longevity of GTA 4 and GTASA was the mods developed by the community. Youre biting the hand that feeds you. Also, where is the single player DLC? Or are you guys to busy working on yacht updates to make us buy shark cards?
