Think of this game as GTASA  DLC  Shark Cards.This game is absolutely trash on last gen, hence why i rebought it for PC, but honestly dont bother playing this.The multiplayer is either a massive grind, dozens of hours just to buy 1 new car, OR you spend IRL money on shark cards, which is why they still release DLC for this game.Just because of the shark cards dont buy it.
