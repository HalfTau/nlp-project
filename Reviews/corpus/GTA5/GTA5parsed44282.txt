This games developer and publisher are awful and money hungry to the point of being toxic to their own community. They are not above filing legal Cease and Desist letters to you and threatening to sue you if you dont play ball by their rules.These are multibillion dollar companies, and they act like schoolyard bullies. you Take Two and Rockstar.
