waiting to get ban or stripped all money out of my character after a cheater thrown 100k at me while my character was watching TV at my own apartment. Game sessions are littered with these cheater.Dont even call them modder, they never do anything good like modders.UPDATE today, I logged into GTA Online and discovered that all of my cars have gone without any traces, how the  could that happen?
