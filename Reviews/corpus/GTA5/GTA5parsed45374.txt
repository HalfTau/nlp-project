Ive held back from signing onto this band wagon, but Openly banning innocent players because of other cheating players and then refusing to even have an open support to talk to? players who have paid possibly for multiple versions of this game banned just because you cant stand people not buying your microtransactions?Take two have gone and Fd this one up royally, the funny thing is theyre not even the major company who created this game. they just run the MP and they ed the game up for rockstar.You can ban and attack innocent players at random and get away with it by blaming the cheating community.You cant Fing attack a whole community and get away with it.
