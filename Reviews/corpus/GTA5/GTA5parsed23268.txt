rockstar created a game that was amazing for the first year on pc but then they removed singleplayer mods to prevent online modding so they can get more money and milk the game and with it the communitys creativity died and not only that they got a bad support team that doesnt do anything about false bans or doesnt help out with any broken thing in this  game and it got the worst online servers ever i hoped i would give it a better review after i played it for 1000 hours and will still play it for more but it is getting worse and worse by the time
