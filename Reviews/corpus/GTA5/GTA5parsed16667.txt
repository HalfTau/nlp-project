Rockstar will acitvely moderate the online money and adjust that with almighty vengance to make sure Im broke when I didnt do anything and had actively avoided cash drops to the honest to god best of my ability. seriously between this one and the last time they adjusted money out of my account i had gotten maybe 40k becuase as soon as i noticed money drops i left that server fearing this exact thing. Then they go and take a clean 2 mil. Now today, in my effort to try and make back my rightfully earned money I had one modder disable my stunt plane durning a smuggler supply mission, swap servers to do a gunrun sell and had an invincable prick show up, DANCE IN FRONT OF ME LAUGHING OFF HEAD SHOTS LIKE THE BLOOD COMING OUT OF HIS HEAD WAS CHERRY KOOLAID and blow up my 250k shipment after flipping my phantomwedge with his body.In short rockstar are only out to get you to buy the game and play the admitantly good story mode, but once you go online they only care about how they can get more people to buy shark cards. They will snuff out modding cash into the game but do nothing to stop thewith tinythat terrorize entire servers with explosives, invincability, and disabiling all your fun for their own. Rockstar will only ever care about how to take away money that they think was illegitimate, they will never care about the actual quality of the online experince and thosewith tinywill keep getting away with whatever they want as long as they dont drop money.
