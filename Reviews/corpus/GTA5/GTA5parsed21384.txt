Before being judged for my opinion i have to clarify that the game in general and each of its part are close to perfect in any way. Singleplayer campaign is a shining gem amongst many other AAAgames. And even multiplayer could be described as enjoyable, when played with friends and in the most stressfree enviroment.Problems began to arise with the Dirty Money updates. R was more and more inclined to the Koticks community policy. I.e. Shut up and give us money!. Vast majority of new content is hidden behind a paywall that is so big, it can rival The Great Wall. Which leads to a paradox  you need money to get stuff that allows you to make money. And this is when sharkcards kick in. Why grind/play at all, when you can just pay R a bit more money? So yes, instead of balancing the content and actually listening to their playerbase  R just went the easy way, along with Ubisoft, Square Enix and Activision.slow sarcastic clapWell done, Big R. Welcome to the club of publishers that dont give a single flying turd about their community.I want to warn other players  no matter how good or hyped a game can be  nothing can save it from corporate s in charge. Except for audience turning away from them.
