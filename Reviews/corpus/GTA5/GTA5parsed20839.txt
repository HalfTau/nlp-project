Singleplayer is one of the best Ive ever playedOnline is a grind and the community is horribleOver the Xbox 360, PS4, and PC I probably have 500 hoursMost of that time was spent grinding online and doing the same 5 hiests over and over but its gotten to a point where you have to grind 20 hours just for a single super car or you could just blow 100 on shark cards...Its ridiculous.Basically what Im saying is just dont get this game for the online anymorePlease bring Red Dead Redemption 2 to PC
