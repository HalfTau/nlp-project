I have played and beaten this game multiple times on both xbox 360 and ps4. I also have hundreds and hundres of hours on the multiplayer across all 3 platforms. I guess you can say that I love the game. However I got it for PC a while ago to have some fun with the mods. Rockstar has always been and always will be one of my favourite dev teams. It almost seems like Take Two is just absolutely butchering Rockstars legacy in turn for a quick buck. After all the false bans on accounts, shark card t, and now removing single player mods, I have to say this is the LAST game produced by Take Two that I buy. To put it bluntly,  you Take Two. you real hard.
