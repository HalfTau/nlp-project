Outlawing mods in the singleplayer experience?  Get over yourself Take Two.  In solidarity with the OPENIV team, I cannot recommend a game that purposefully shuts out its modding/art community.  Taking care of cheaters online is not a valid excuse.  Make modding the singleplayer available through the workshop or some other easier route and this wouldnt be an issue.  These developers have all the money in the world and manpower to accomplish this.  Make a positive change and well remove our reviews.  No, this will have no effect on their wallets, theyve made their money.  But sign thepetition anyway, hopefully somewhere this will trigger some frantic highlevel meetings.  One can only hope.
