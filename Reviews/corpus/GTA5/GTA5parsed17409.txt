This has to be one of the most expansive, indepth and detailed worlds Rockstar has ever made, and its an amazing game. The ability to play several protagonists only adds to the depthofstory, and the choices make it replayable.Pros Lots of guns, customizable Lots of cars, customizable   Custom vanity license plates for your cars in multiplayer Multiplayer gives you more of these and houses than 1P DLCs add more interesting vehicles and weapons to multiplayer Multiplayer has freemode, closed servers, friendsonly servers, etc.Cons Multiplayer freemode is too chaotic... Nobody lets you do anything because they have superweapons or jets, or lots of friends, or spawn near you... But you can only complete some missions in freemode. Have fun never having fun being a CEO, biker entrepreneur etc. if you have few pals. Rockstar is sorta greedy Missions only earn so much, and sometimes even cheap vehicles take hours to get ...But you can pay realworld money to get these faster if youre a spoiled rich kid or guy without bills. You can earn the money ingame... After weeks of playing.TLDR, Good game, overwhelmingly positive, few negatives.
