I feel like this game deserves an ACTUAL REVIEW for the first time since this whole antimodding negative review tsunami.Since so many people feel that a review counts as complaining about something that does not take away from the game youve been playing I will try to step up and tell you what this game actually has going for it instead of people telling you that oh you cant mod it DO NOT BUYI have owned this game for PC since release, infact I preordered it and to this day I do not regret this decision.The entire time of owning this game it has been quite a bit of fun,  the singleplayer was a fun experience while it lasted but as I finished the story for the singleplayer, I found that the multiplayer for this game was quite possibly more fun than anything that singleplayer could give you. and since the developers have been hard at work developing new ways for multiplayer to be more fun and interactive, multiplayer has gotten even more awesome since the games release. going around and just having fun with your friends is... well... really fun! playing this game with friends is really where the fun kicks in with this game, may you be running a slightly illegal motercycle club with them, or being apart in a large business working for the CEO. with the insane amounts of ways you can make money in GTA online now, its hard to find something thats not fun to do, I mean you can do a mission that involves a car that has a ramp that can flip other cars just by driving into them, thats pretty cool!all in all, this game has been and will probably always be a fun game to play with your friends more than anything, dont trust the intense amount of negative reviews this game has been given recently as it does not deserve it in the slightest.I would highly recommend this to any friend of mine. and to anybody who sees this, really... please look past the negative reviews... they dont add any constructive criticism or feedback to the game itself.
