Multiplayer is t. I regret buying this crap. Modders, hackers, cheaters, you name it, they got it. There is no system to segregate newer players from rich older players wholl just shoot you down with their twisted metal type armed cars. You cant even complete browse the world peacefully for about 10 mins before somebody will kill you. And its not that Im bad at the game, in front of their weapons, you really dont stand a chance.On the pro side, single player is good.
