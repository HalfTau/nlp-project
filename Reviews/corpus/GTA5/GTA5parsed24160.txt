This game has gotten hate because of OpenIV being shut down, and its getting more from me.The SIngle player is OK, I have not finished it so i cannot give a solid opinionMuliplayer is toxic, full of modders, people thta just drive around and kill new players to make their lives hard, and lag, lots, and lots of lagEnjoy!Edit After playing the game for numerous hours, and plenty of money making tutorials, it gets enjoyable, There is one very big issue, it is so easy to go bankrupt, just by havving fun with afew friends for a few hours, one thing that bothers me a lot personally is being able to upgrade acceleration on vehicles but not top speed. Multiplayer is a good experience, WITH FRIENDS, random peopel will just drive by you, kill you and blow your car up.Flying Flying is fantastic! It is a very purifying experience especially in propeller planes, the jets are great fun to zip around in, its hard to get them, unless you have millions. Because if you steal them youre most liekly going to get shot down, even with evasive maneuvors.Driving Driving is a disaster, the cars are beautiful and soemtimes its funny to think of which cars they are based off, first, there is 0 realism, Some cars will top out at 100 MPH at 5k RPM DOWNHILL! Second some cars are just ruined by their stats, they are so beautiful but useless and expensive, third, grip, there is either too much or not enough, and a mssive amount of understeer, this is coming from someone who plays forza a lot and can estimate corners alright.Commbat Unless youre playing a job where everyone has the same equipment, youll either be overpowered or be overpowered by someone else with a 50 calibre and explosive rounds in a jet bike.
