I enjoy this game more than others but Im now fed up.. Whenever I do a job like gunrunning business or vehicle cargo this ing game has to freeze all the ing time and make me lose a lot of money. I tried all the possible solutions I found on the internet, nothing could solve the problem. I have already lost aload of money and its really annoying now. Thanks Rockstar for this. You create an enjoyable game with bugs that make it totally unenjoyable.. Im now trying to avoid jobs just not to lose a great amount of money AGAIN. Not to mention the NPCs that drive like no one would in real life which also causes money loss. Thanks again Rockstar! Great job!
