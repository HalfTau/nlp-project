DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR PC.I wish someone would have told me what a Complete mess GTA5 Online for PC was before I wasted my money on it.No exaggerration, literally every single session has modders/cheaters.I have this game for xbox 360  xbox one and there were NO WHERE NEAR this amount of cheaters on there.Rockstar should be ashamed of themselves for taking peoples money LOTS OF IT thanks to their Greasy shark cards hustle and then not even implementing a proper anticheat system, especially considering that they have earned well over 2BILLIONNNNN from this game alone.I dont mind the ridiculously slow  grind but it is even slower when cheaters are killing you from underneath the map and teleporting you to your death and 80,000 other ways they can hinder your progress.Complete and utter waste of time for anyone other than scumbag cheaters.
