The singleplayer is amazing. Great story, characters, and gameplay. The reason for this negative review however, is because of the multiplayer. Never before have i seen such potential bogged down by imense paytowin. I recently came from a fight where someone went passive long enough to spawn an APC with infinite rapidfire rockets That needs to be fixed by the way, give em a few mins before they can toggle passive again?. Then he thought he was great at the game because he can kill someone who is on a bike and has stickybombs. But when he was on foot against someone who was also on foot, he would die everytime.Edit Recently lost over 420,000 because someone has a helicopter with free aim, hitscan explosive rounds.
