GTA V Pretty fantastic story, got great actors here and a royal mix of action and humour. Its worth playing, but dont really see the need for a replay.GTA Online Theres a significent hacker/cheater presence, Ive been robbed from all my ingame money once due to a hacker emptying my ingame bank account. No idea how this process works but there it is. Also, GTA Online does update regulary with new content, but the problem is that everytime something new comes the old doesnt become better, so in the end you have a lot of small extensions instead of a few large pieces of content. They could just choose to expand on what they have, for instance the CEO business and lately the Doomsday Heist update, why cant it simply be an extension of the Bunker? Or the casino and real estate updates that may happen in the future be an extension of the Executives and Other Criminals? It makes sense to me to go to my office and do administration and the regular odd job to keep business flowing.Well, if you wanna have fun in GTA Online, play with at least one friend, not with random players. Because most fun content are for 2 players. Often the content is too difficult for random players and they keep messing up the mission with futile attempts. But for all the bad points GTA Online has some good points too and is semisoloable for those who just want to play in the GTA V world with Online content but not be disturbed by random players or hackers. With some firewall settings you can prevent other people from being in the same server as you. Useful for vehicle outsourcing without getting your prize vehicle get blown to bits by some triggerhappy player in a Hydra.As a conclusion, Id say its worth buying, should be in any true gamers arsenal in my opinion.
