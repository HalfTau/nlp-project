I like this game a lot, but a large majority of the people that play are some of the most toxic I had ever come across. Hackers rampant, can spawn the whole lobby in 1 area and either kill them or a variety of other traps and deaths, or Drop cash on your head. Rockstar will drain your account for any money you may have recieved wanted or not, and then they sell shark cards... Instead of creating more jobs and heists Rockstar has only made more ways for people to be ugly to eachother. Unreal Vehicles are accessible to the point everyone is in something that is Military grade or a flying motorcycle with lock on missiles. New players have next to no chance, Have fun bouncing around between loading screens to make 20k here and there or get annhilated by the rest. Played Singleplayer for a long time and GTAO for some hundred hours but seems to just keep getting less fun for me overtime and just becoming more of a waste of time than anything. Like I said I like this game, and some of the Cooler down to earth people whom are kind of organized, but the rest of the community just kind of ruins it along with what Rockstar is up to.
