Used to be my favorite game after i used a graphics mod and got banned permanently for ONLY THAT!ive been playing single player with mods sometimes since then, but its nowhere near what online is.Its been years but i still want to buy it again and play online, but when i think about it....  you rockstar, i wont be taking anymore changes of getting banned for nothing  they have become mad at just making money and not caring about what the players think, if i would have unlimited irl money then maybe but no.
