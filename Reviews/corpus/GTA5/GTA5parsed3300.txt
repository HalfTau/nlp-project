Now seriously, what has this game become?From a somewhat realistic game it went to a pure carnage filled game with flying rocket cars and motorcycles.I remember the days when i sat infornt of my Playstation playing GTA2 and that game was better than GTA Multiplayer these days.Dont get me wrong, the singleplayer still captures the essence that GTA used to be, but in contrast to the multiplayer I have no idea what this game has become. I know and respect the way game developers have to update a game like this with new features to keep it alive but why the hell does it need a rocket powered flying motorcycle that can shoot rockets? Or a flying delorean? The game went from GTA Grand Theft Auto to GFA Grand Flying Auto.This, a excrement ton of vehicles having the same max speed I get the balancing reason but cmon.. and tons of tons of hackers who drop you money and even tho you report it you will get punished by Rockstar by just ripping all your money out of your bank multiple updates after you have apperantly cheated by getting moneybags drop from hackers you basicly cant avoid but just not play in public lobbies.But obviously i do not only see the bad side about this game. It really is giant in optionI just wanted to leave my opinion about this game here and I really dont give a damn if anyone reads this. But if anyone actually read this, congratulations and i genuinely hope i didnt bore you to death with it.
