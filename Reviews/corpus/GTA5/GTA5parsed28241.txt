GTA V on its own had a lot of content from the start.GTA Online felt initially a bit grindy alot like they were pushing towards Microtransactions.Then they kept pushing and pushing and pushing.And now we have the state we have now, all the assets you want to get in online cost a kidney or a part time jobs worth of time to ensure that you have enough money to buy a useless cool looking part of the game.They pushed this stuff for ages and ages. This game came out 5 years ago and theyre still milking itNow why i am giving this a negative review. The Lawsuit, The censorship, The Threat whatever you want to call it that was the Open IV debarcle.Take Two one of the giants who made the game Threatened Open IV to stop harmless single player modding of GTA V and this was part of their regime to keep flooding in more ridiculous content that more people will spend more money on more shark cards. Theyre pushing to make even more and more money out of a singular Online feature of a game. GTA V Online makes more money then triple A titles make on a release, Just through microtransactions. This by all of the definitions dont make a game. It makes a pay ridiculous amounts in unfun missions, or hand your wallet over.EDIT  If my point was not stated enough R just realeased their newest GTA Online cash grab... more content updates. as of 2/09/2017.
