Pretty much anyone in Online behaves like he just turned 14, and Rockstar forces you to play on public lobbies instead of closed ones with friends only. Online turned into a hell of a grind, and now Take Two takes a huge dump at costs of modders who didnt even touch Online.I played this game for hundreds of hours and during this process I got more and more disappointed in decisions made by R.So yeah, I feel like following the trend and give a negative review.
