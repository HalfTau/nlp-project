So far singleplayer is great D, though have not progressed far enough to feel confident in GTA Online. Once I start playing that may update review have heard bad things about it, waiting to check for myself.EDIT Finished main story, wasnt anything special but good nonetheless. The open world is a lot of fun to just free roam about in. Tried a little GTA Online, was pretty fun but obviously a little P2W. Overall, great game, but 60 is a little too much at this stage in the games life. Wait for it to go on sale and get it.
