Fantastic. Theres a lot of negative reviews because against the online portion of the game, and some of the controversy is deserved, but the single player is just great! Its hard to get bored with all the available main missions, side missions, activities, etc. GTA V is expansive, well written, funny, full of action, and above all else, fun to play.
