An overly detailed singleplayer is available to players who are particularly interested in exploring the map, parttaking in the minimissions available across the vast map and simply escaping the real world. The storymode is mediocre in comparison to GTA IV and its DLCs as well as most other retro GTA games. It is a disappointing ending for one of the GTA IV DLC protagonists and it is something I think Rockstar did very wrong. Killing him off is not my complaint but rather not giving him more depth as a character in the game made it look quite lazy from the developers sides. Singleplayer overall however, is quite a nice experience that is offered to players and it lives up to the standards in many perpects.The same could not be told for GTA Online, which is ridiculously cancerous.
