I used to love this game quite a lot but now I cant condone their practices recently. They have just recently banned mods and are now taking legal action against their modder community. They also dont give aabout protecting their players rights because it is plain to see if you go to any forum about unfair bans people who arent hacking are being banned for being in matches with modders. After a plea to be unbanned after a long time they unban them but also remove all of their progress and for players like me who legitimately got to nearly lvl 100 with no exploits would be a game ender seeing as i have a lot of expensive items. I want to come back to the game but i am afraid of being banned for just playing. So to me GTA 5 Online is a dead man walking but despite all of this they remain in the top sellers on steam regularly. To you GTA i say goodbyeSincerely,A huge fan of your game
