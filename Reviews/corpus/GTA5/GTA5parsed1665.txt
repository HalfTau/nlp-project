Ive managed to sink about 120 hours into this game without even touching the single player campaign or doing missions in online mode. Dcking around with friends is just insanely fun.I eventually started touching the actual content of the game, turns out its really good as well, but definitely overshadowed by the online multiplayer.If you know how to have fun without simply following objectives, then the game is absolutely worth it just for the online.
