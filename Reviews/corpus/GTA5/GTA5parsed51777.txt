What the actual  where they thinking? Oh huh dur let us completely ruin modding for this game.Back when i did play this game I redone the storyline with mods and Enbs and the game was completely different, far more enjoyable as well. Now im never ever coming back to this game and any further installment of Grand Theft Auto if this is going to be their stance.
