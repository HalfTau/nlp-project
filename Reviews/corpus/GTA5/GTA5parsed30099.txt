Game is a terrible console port. For example in single player if you steel several cars and start to block the road, or form a barrier once you turn the camera away and back again the vehicles just vanish in the space of 1 second.If you are chasing a NPC  that is not part of the main story  say a car that beeped at you or someone that offended you in some way... if you are chasing a car  one that is distinctive  say you shot out a window or something down a country or mountain road with no turn off  so its not possible the car took a turn you did not notice  when the car leaves your view or gets a certain distance ahead it just vanishes removed from the game so its not possible to catch up to it.Its like the game is a miniverse sorry tiny verse that just renders this tiny little moving circle around your character. all the bollox about a simulated city living around you is just not true.Oh and GTA online is not enjoyable, Over the top grind  buggy
