WIth the latest update I felt like I was playing Saints Row 4. The game is still fun, but I agree with members of the community when they say the game is not headed in its brightest direction. It seems like the developers mostly want to obtain more money in such a manner that it does not put the players first, which is something I cannot stand behind.
