anotherupdate most probably, the gunrunning one was absolutely awful. why on freeaim should i fire 8 rockets at an APC just so the scummy fkrs call it in 10 secs later, when a tank only takes 4 and is alot slower. the explosive sniper is also a joke and needs to be instantly removed, it completely fks with competative playing on GTA 5. not just competative playing however, it also ruins the fun for flying aircrafts, 2 shots on an explosive round on a buzzard instant kills it and 34 on a hydra. you spend 3 million on a hydra just so it can be destroyed by someone who unlocked some cancer bulltes. it doesnt matter how much you put the price at, some people/alot most likely have over 20 mill. meaning that alot of people can afford that PC people. put the game back to what it used to be, fun and not filled with ti honestly like this game but the way people play it and how the update has effected it, i dont recomend
