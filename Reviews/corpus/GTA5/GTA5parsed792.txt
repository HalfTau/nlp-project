GTA Online is absolutely awful now. This game used to be fun for me, but now every time I connect to an online session, there is someone flying around in a car with rockets on it just blowing your cars up over and over. People are driving around in these weird Mad Max style vehicles that just ram you off the road and destroy your car. Saw someone flying around on a motorcycle with rocket launchers. I feel like Im playing Saints Row. These new vehicles are so powerful and over the top people use these to just bully constantly. GTA Online has become so stale because of this. This happens to me everygame and its just not enjoyable. I understand you are going to get shot at in GTA Online, but if Im just getting spawn killed over and over again by someone on a fictional flying rocket launching motorbike that travels faster than I can get away from it, Im out.
