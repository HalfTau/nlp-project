I love this game, got way more hours on Xbox. I think people should calm down about expensive cars considering all DLC is free, there is notthing you can accsess in the game that requires money. Would you rather paid DLC to get the cars in the first place or free DLC to earn the cars though playing the game?This is a great game, story mode is as close to perfect that any game can get. Online is probaly the most mulitplayer fun ive had in any game this decade. I just wish theyd tone down all the military gear.Buzzard was enough, Lazzer was a push, Hydra should crush.Still much more fun to be had!
