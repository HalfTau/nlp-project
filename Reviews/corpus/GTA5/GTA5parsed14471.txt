I bought this game only for single player campaign. As it turns out its the worst of its kind that Ive ever seen. The story by far is quite immersive, but the overall mechanics suck big time. Theres absolutely no way to make money in the campaign. Hardly a few of them give you some money. However there are tonnes of things to buy here but no money at all. In fact some of the missions also will usurp money from the player. On top of that I cant play the game smoothly using my keyboard because of a local pcplatform glitch. That has made the game literally unplayable.This game is purely made from multiplayer perspective with a single player campaign provided just for the sake of it. If youre looking to play single player, try to find other games skyrim, or witcher 3?.
