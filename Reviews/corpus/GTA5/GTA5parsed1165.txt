Gta 5 Has been one of my most played games I played it on xbox 360, Xbox One, Ps4 and Pc and I cant say I regret playing it. You know everyone has a game they just played alot over and over again and couldnt stop playing it? That was Gta 5 for me, but to be honest gta 5 isnt that fun anymore, its sadly run by microtransactions, if you dont have money you just gotta grind for hours, As many early gta 5 player we all remember Rooftop rumble, playing that damn mission over and over again. But Its a great game to play if you have friends to do those mission with and not alone. Gta 5 is great alone and with friends.
