This game feels like San Andreas pumped up on Vice City drugs, the hype is real, but sadly so are the amount of modders.as i probably assume that Rockstar works hard to remove all these problems, it seems that they might want to invest more into these issues instead of releasing new contents, all servers long i see people asking for money and getting money drops. Aside from this, the game offers a true experience story wise as well as offline, you get to feel what its like to be part of a movie experience, i can see all the love that went into creating this game and it is by far a masterpiece on the singleplayer experience. Sadly wished it was more but i am human and we always want more. As for the offline experience, it has so much to do and should have focused on more story driven heists which might just be my personal opinionGTA V  Story mode overall score would be 8.5/10GTA V  Offline mode overall score would be 8.0/10I cant degrade the game just for its attackers, as the game is really promising and offers many fun.The community itself might need some improvement and preferable servers people can select since its either 50 existing out of foreign speaking countries who dont or cant cooperate. and the ridiculous long loadings and queuing.Take those away and you get yourself a 10
