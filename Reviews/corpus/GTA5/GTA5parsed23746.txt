I just cant get into this game, I dont know. The story is a big joke, that stops being funny at what I assume is about half way through. I couldnt care less about the characters, theyre all just  people with literally no redeeming qualities, and no appeal. I like being the bad guy, but being a piece ofjust isnt that fun I guess. You have the drive around and shoot people GTA style thing, which is fun for a bit.The world LOOKS full, but is quite uneventful. Its just too real and unimaginitve. Theres no reason to explore video game LA, we have that in real life.I liked some of the old GTAs but I genuinely dont get the hype, and I like 90 of the games I play.
