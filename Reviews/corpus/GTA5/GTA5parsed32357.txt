The singleplayer itself is pretty good but i cant recommend the online portion of this game. Taketwo has basically made any modification of the game impossible since they sent a cease and desist towards OpenIV, so gg no more mods. The shark cards and the updates do not help the game at all, and every update seems to be even more expensive than the last. Taketwo and rockstar have made this game a total paytowin by this point. Only reason I have so many hours is because my friends and I used to play a ton until the updates started getting absolutely insanely pricey. Cant recommend this game to anyone, anymore. Save your cash and stay away.
