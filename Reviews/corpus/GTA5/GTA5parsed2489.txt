EDIT after reaching 100h of playtime I can say.....this game is a m a s t e r p i e c e and deserves 9.75/10This game has everything, story, online, graphics, gameplay, durability EVERYTHINGonline is awesome and what people are mad at are just stereotypes that you can bypass easely by joining another sessionthere are still mods but installing them will result in you not having acces to online untill you remove themYou really should pay attention to the minimum specs before buying and even try to get better than the recommended to play the game of ultra, the way its meant to be playedIts absoluetly GORGEOUSgood story with interessting charactersno disturbing bugs and many detailsconnection isnt really a probleme, I mean when you have lets say between 100200ms of ping the online stays smooth god knows howYou dont need to buy shark cards, I spent 5 hours on the online to get 100k dollars that are worth like 5 bucks on the steam store, its like buying skyrim...and all the weapons armors skills unlocked, some people find it funnyGame needs a L O T of free space on the hard drive and it will maybe be a problem to some players for downloading, but hey ! these gb are worth it !In the online mod you create a character and do whatever you want, there are missions like the story ones but you do them with other players which is pretty cool and you can also play mini games and walk around the city like if you were in solo but there are other people roaming at the same time, from there I found 3 problemes which are not really the games fault but the playersIf you join a mission and there is someone with a low end pc youll have to wait a longer loading because of himIf youre on a mission with some dumb or unskilled people youll probably have to replay it multiple times /Sometimes when youre on the freeroam just walking around the city youll meet  that just kill youwithout reason, but all these problemes really dont affect the gameHere is my pc specs if you want to have and idea of how it worksIntel I5 4460k 3.2ghzNvidia GTX750TI 2gb ddr5RAM 8gb ddr3HDD 1TB 24mb/swith these I get MIN FPS 45AVERAGE FPS 61MAX FPS 85with all graphics on ultra and a res of 1366x768, hope itll help youIn the end I would probably give it a solid 9.75/10 and advice you to buy it on a saleHave fun 3
