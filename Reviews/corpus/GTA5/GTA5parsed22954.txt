This is my third time buying the game first on Xbox 360, then Xbox One now on PC and I still love it to this day. It really is a shame you cannot transfer your old characters from Xbox One to PC even when linked to the same social clob account, so let that be a warning to anyone who wants to play with their old chatacters on PC.
