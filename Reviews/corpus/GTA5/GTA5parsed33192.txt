Why would you guys remove one of the only things that is keeping this game alive. Gta Online updates on their own sure as hell aint doing it. And channels on youtube that play gta5 are pretty much dead, except for the modders. And youtube is free advertising, someone may say wow! that mod looks cool! I want to purchase gta5 and download that mod myself! and boom rockstar you have just made some money. Why would you want to destroy your last real presents on one of the biggest websites? Your community will suffer! I can see your overall score is!
