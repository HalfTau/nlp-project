Grand Theft Auto V a game with endless possibilities, a great story, awesome multiplayer, and just an amazing experience.GTA5 is an open world 3rd/1st Person multiplayer shooter. A game where you can go around and cause absolute mayhem, rob stores and banks, steal fighter jets from a military base, steal a car from an array of people, blow up other players, go on a rampage vs the police, run a business or become an employee of a CEO, join a biker gang, plan heists, race cars, and plenty of other things to do, opportunities are endless.I highly recommend this game, its a blast there is so much to do and so much fun to be had, friends to be made, and money to be stolen. Grand theft auto runs well and the gameplay is top notch, people seem to get mad at the money grind to afford the new items in the game but Ive never really cared much about having to grind for progress especially when there is so much to do and so much fun to be had playing this game alone and with friends or your crew.
