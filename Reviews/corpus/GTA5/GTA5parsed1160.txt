Hello I like Grab That auto 5.2 for many reasons. One reason is the gameplay. You get to buy a soda drive a car into bush so stronk that he can rival jeb bush. Then by mistake crash into a police officer and then get 5 stars and die. Great grampaplay. I also like the grabthiccs. While not as good as a legendary game ROBLOX. However it still is great because it includes great features like dogs and soda trucks to enhance the gamephics. Now I could dive more into statistics. However I think to describe grampsarse 5. Is imagine you are looking out in the distance in your new car you see a man in a chicken suit fighting a man in a anime costume. Then all of a sudden your have a stripper at your lap giving you a lap dance. Then you explode. OK lets talk about the characters. Frankie is a black guy who makes a rap song and everyone calls it trash so he gets 5 stars and dies. MIKEY a family man hits his tennis coach with a racket. However the tennis coach uses a reverse card and he dies. Fianlly Travis a man who becomes a chicken and jumps off the roof. So I love this game I like this game a lot you should play it so I give it a chicken suit/soda. Just a solid RPG.
