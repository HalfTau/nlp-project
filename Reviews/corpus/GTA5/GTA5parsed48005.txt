GTA 5 is a spectacularily fun game to play that is constantly updated by Rockstar. If youre looking to play a fun and exciting game, either by yourself or with friends, this could be a great choice for you. If you enjoy having traffic cones places on your appendages and losing access to your office because some dropkick has modded the game, then this game, specifically online, is perfect for you.Heres my previous take on the OpenIV situation, but that has been rectified now. I feel that what happened with this cannot go unspoken of or forgotten about. This awesome community made it possible for TakeTwo to recognise their mistakes and retract their proceedings.I cannot think of any way a game as good as GTA 5 could be butchered so quickly by people sitting in an office trying to combat cheating but somehow you managed to do so. OpenIV allowed people to experience this game in ways never before thought and opened up a great and enjoyable community of modding. These mods brought the community closer together and made GTA 5 how it is viewed by many today. Until now, at least.Rethink your decisions Take Two.
