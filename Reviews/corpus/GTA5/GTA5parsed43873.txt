Take Two Interactive, Rockstars parent company, has declared modding in SINGLEPLAYER illegal. Modding in SP was the sole reason why I played this game.If you want to buy this game for the stock singleplayer, go ahead. If you want to buy this game because of all of the singleplayer mods, do NOT  and I repeat  do NOT buy this game.
