main storyline is a little meh at best, so you go online with friends and find out its one massive money grind with no fun allowed sign on everything you do, then the hackers join your game and massively screw with you so you make a complain to rockstar, and well they banned me... not the hackers.So thank you rockstar for helping me having no problem with hackers anymore, ill will help you by never giving you any money anymore.sounds like a good deal to me
