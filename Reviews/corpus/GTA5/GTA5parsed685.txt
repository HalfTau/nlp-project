Extremely fun and would have played it more but... I cant even finish the damn heists cause i would need to wait literly an hour each time i have to do a set up and then some noob would join and immediatly leave or keep dieing and i would need to restart. gta should take a page from l4ds book and keep the game going and dont ruin it for everyone when some dumbass leaves. took over 20 hrs just to get past the lamar missions because of people who cant even sit and even play for 10 mins.
