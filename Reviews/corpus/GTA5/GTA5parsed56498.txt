I played a lot of GTA4 for years after it had been out, thanks to the modding commuity. Sadly Take Two seem hellbent on forcing all players into their buggy, hacker ridden multiplayer inorder to suck every las drop of money from the fans.Well you ask, Why cant I just enjoy the single player? Sure you can but that wont last you long!Its fine, Ill just install a bunch of mods, that way ill get hours of fun wont I?WRONG ... sadly Take Two have decided to shut down the modders!YES, Take Two are shutting down the people who improve their game, The reason I bought the game, The reason people sink hundreds of hours into the game!So do I recoment it? Not anymore, youd be better just stick with GTA IV.Shame on you Take Two, Shame on you for ruining it for the fans after they had bought your game!
