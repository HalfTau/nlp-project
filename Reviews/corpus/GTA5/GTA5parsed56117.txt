Good for about 10hrs then you realize everything in multiplayer is overpriced AF in every free DLC/update. They are money grubbing to get you to buy Steal Yo Money Cards so you can buy virtual trash that somebody with c4 will blow up in just a moment while your reading this. They dislike modders more than ever because they want more cash out of this overpriced overhyped cow. Even the fact they are making modding illegal across all GTAs just proves how petty theyve become.Make Number 9 LARGE again.
