Good thingys Good Story Good missions Good Graphics Lots of custom things for characters online and clothes on single player as well Lots of realism Good to play with friends Constant updates Its quite the sandbox game, you can do almost anything. Theres constant new items being added online.Bad things The community is amazingly rude Lag Some missions have horrible spawn systems. If you get a phone call the text you were typing in chat will be deleted. Sometimes the chat system is really slow and will miss some letters if youre typing too fast, this can be quite annoying.Worse of allMy current rate
