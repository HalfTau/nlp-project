When this was released this game was amazing, unfortunately over time the single player has clearly been neglected in favour of the online multiplayer. What is worse is that the online mode has become a microtransaction hell hole where you either grind for several hours a day just to afford a new vehicle or spend a fortune on Shark Cards. Many of the best vehicles arent available in single player and online has become a playground for those with the most money. Its a shame because it had such promise.R make the game equal for single players and Ill change this back to a positive review.
