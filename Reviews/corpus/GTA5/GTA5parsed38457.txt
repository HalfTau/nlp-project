There is a lot to be said about a product whose development is driven primarily by monetary greed rather than customer satisfaction. I feel it is a significant shame that such a overall good product is being plagued by the hands of such people, a product that has so much potential for a very wide range of video game entertainment, a potential that has been effectively utilized over the past few years by creative modifications by the talented community that has built itself around this playground of a game. A potential that however is now being whittled down due to corporate greed.Mods have for a long time built upon the foundation of this title better than the developers of it, and out of fear of losing monetary benefit in favor of something that others do better and for free, that activity have now been more or less shut down for that very reason.When such a clearcut action is made against the satisfaction of the consumer and in favor of the monetization of the title, it becomes difficult to avoid the thought that this game is not being developed for the purpose of making something that will make its players satisfied, but rather to make something that will make its players invest as much money into it as possible. When such a circumstance is made so clear, I cant imagine how anyone could overlook such a revolting goal of those in charge of what you are consuming. If the purpose of this titles development is monetary benefit and only monetary benefit, then that is going to influence every addition made in such a way that something that could be great will lose a lot of its value to accommodate for the demand of being monetization friendly.It is revolting from a personal standpoint, but it is also unacceptable from a business standpoint. When a product gets as large and respected as Grand Theft Auto V, people might assume that they can get away with anything they do it, so an action certainly needs to be made to clearly state the opposite so that such a business practice does not continue or grow even further. People who are ruled by greed will push the limits of what they are able to get away with, and that line has not only been crossed here, but jumped past by several measures.
