This game has been incredible so far barely even played 4 hours of it on PC and I can say its much better playing on pc thats if you have a PC that can run this game it will play fine. Just turn vsync to get loads more FPS aside from that I think its a new experience on PC. Also I recommend you buy it when theres a sale on steam dropping its price to about 30
