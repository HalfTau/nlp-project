Take two has once again shafted the players and modding community that made their games playable after a year. The only reason I bought it for the pc was for very popular SINGLE PLAYER mods, I could care less about the multiplayer online which I remind take two took over a year to deliver what was promised on launch date, remember that thing called heist. yea go screw your selfs
