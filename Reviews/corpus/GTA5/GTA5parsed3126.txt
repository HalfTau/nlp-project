I do not recommend this game because of online, because in the story mode everything is fine. All because of the players who only see the meaning of the game, how to kill everything that moves, when you just go or go. Cheaters generally a separate topic. In 1 of 3 sessions there will be a cheater who either distributes money or blows up everyone. Thats all I wanted to say.
