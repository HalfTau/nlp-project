Rockstar we still love you... Take Two has ruined this for the both of you...If you like mods then this is not the game for you. Why punish those who dont abuse the mods just because you cant handle the few online who do abuse the system? Maybe invest some of the money you bleed out of folks buying the damn shark cards into so operators to handle the reports! Or is this what its truly about? Your money stop flowing in for those shark cards as modders can just give free money to people? Yeah... That couldnt be the reason... Gotta be something else...
