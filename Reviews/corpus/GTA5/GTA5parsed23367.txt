The game itself? Amazing, i would recommend it to anyone. But what I cant stand is the capitalistic aholes who run the service. Rockstar Games is only in it for the money and in doing so have provided us with  service. I have had issues with the game crashing and  now that TakeTwo has their hand up Rs asses  having nonmodded funds removed from my account. Whenever i contact R about either issues, they basically wipe their asses with my complaint ticket and redirect me to the support forum. Me How do I stop this from happening? R Support / See what these people did.I would suggest buying the game, but dont be surprised when you quit because of the terrible service.
