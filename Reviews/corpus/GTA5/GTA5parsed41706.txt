if youre looking to buy this game ignore the review score. the game is still very good and is worth the price tag. the people leaving bad reviews are upset that taketwothe company that owns rockstar sent out a cease and desist order to a modding company. so they are taking it out on rockstar who had no say in the matter. this game is still a lot of fun and unless you were wanting to mod your game shouldnt pay the many attention when deciding on your purchase.
