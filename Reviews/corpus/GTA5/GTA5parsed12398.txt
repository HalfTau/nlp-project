While the gameplay itself is fun, and the singleplayer story is fun, the online mode has become increasingly more and more of a price gouge. They are constantly releasing new content and vehicles normally a good thing. But they make them prohibitively expensive so that due to the low amount of money you can make through playing, the only realistic way to get the newer stuff is to buy it with real money. And I am talking in the hundreds of dollars. Add this to the fact that at any time, your account could get banned with no warning or explanation just because some hacker came into your session and did something to/with your character.So... fun gameplay, ruined by heavy price gouging and a near requirement to spend a lot of real money to get ingame vehicles
