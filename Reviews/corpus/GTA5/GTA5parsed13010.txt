I am insterested just in the online part of the game and this could be great game but there are two things that makes it unplayable for me.First is that this game is basically loading simulator  I have the game on middle class SSD and it is almost 5050 ration between actual gameplay and neverending loadings and connectings to servers. This is outrageous nonsense and I am far from being the only one experiincing that in my social bubble. Its basicaly same from everyone I know.Absolutely broken economy by no ability to stop cheaters. You can try to grind through very large grind, or you can pretty easily get a mod that drops money from the sky, makes you invicible etc. And it is sadly pretty comon thing to encounter, not just some corner bussiness for a few outcasts. And it is like this for at least several months now and no visible action against it.So for me, this could be one of the greates game I know but ignorance from publisher issuing prevalent loading/connection issues and cheaters on majority of servers this is a game that I dont want to even give a chance again.
