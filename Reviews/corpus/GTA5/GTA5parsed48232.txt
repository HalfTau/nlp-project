They have done it. It has finally started and there is no way people are going to let this stand.If you are reading this, chances are you play PC games. As a PC gamer you have used some sort of mod for a game at some point in your life. You have, its not even a question because you have. This is what PC gaming is about. People make games, we pay for them. In some cases we buy them three times in a row for different platforms! Sometimes most times the games that we play on PC are lacking something or could be improved by removing something a wonky mechanic or AI and as modders, it is almost our duty to fix things like that or test the limits of the game we have just paid for. Well all of that ends now. No more modding, no more creativity, no more fun and absolutely no more TRULY sandbox games. At least not from Take Two Interactive. I hope they do as their name states and look into a TAKE number TWO on this decision that they have made.Do your self a favor, if you want to pay for this game. Dont. If you are in dire need of a somewhat good GTA game that still for the time being has some modding support, buy GTA San Andreas. No micro transactions, no modding blocks yet and a beautiful multiplayer mod that is more ironed out than the full release of the multiplayer for GTA V.I know Im not alone when I say this, but if this no mod thing continues, they can kiss a once loyal customer goodbye.Shame on you Take Two.RIP Open IV
