Best games are ruined by the worst business people.Actual talent, programmers, artists, script writers, actors, succeeded in making a great game.All it takes is one greedy psycopath with an MBA to ruin it all. And when they sink their blood sucking brittle teeth into something as iconic as GTA, they can take the entire industry with it.Dont they teach you that at the community college? Dont alienate your customer base?
