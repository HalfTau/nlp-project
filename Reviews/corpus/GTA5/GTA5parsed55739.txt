Oh nice a new DLC!All items included are 30 million dollars, and theres a new DLC every 2 months. But you can buy and 8 million dollar shark card for 100 real dollars for the best value!And dont mod your single player game. Because that would be fun. And dont bother trying to play offline, because Social Club has to be connected to the internet at least once a day otherwise this 60 game wont work,Thats the biggest problem to me. Never mind the terrible customer realtions. YOU CANNOT PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE, EVEN SINGLE PLAYER. You must connect to the internet at least once every day. Otherwise its 70.5GB of your hard drive being wasted. Useless if your like me and you go away without internet for months at a time.That being said, its an awesome game! Its just such a shame its so limited by how youre allowed to play it, even after paying for it.
