Rockstar has recently made everything in the game way out of reach for new players and even players with 200 hours it is rediculous everything in the new update would take months of grinding to obtain i think the game needs to be enjoyable not a grind. I used to enjoy it when it realeased on xbox 360 and ive played on pc for a while now its just not good anymore.
