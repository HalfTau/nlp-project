Hard to say about gta5 here,pros Free DLC with single price tag A lot of content Not so heavy considering to dates hardware speccons Online mode swarmed with modders/hackers Sometimes you become victim of being banned or items removed especially money Random players killing and causing disturbance Story mode didnt get to have the Online mode content Hard to make money unless grinding slowly Some items are overpricedverdicts? I would still recommend this game though considering there are more cons than pros of this game. The recent Doomsday Heist are so cool with the hover car D.If you have the hardware to play this game and coming from ps3, better get this, it is worth it
