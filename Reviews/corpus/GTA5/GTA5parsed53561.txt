Do not purchase this game if you wish to mod it. TakeTwo Interactive has required that OpenIV, a tool vital for modding, be discontinued.TakeTwo Interactive has had a longstanding distate for the modding community. It should be expected that further actions will be taken against them.In addition to these circumstances, it is worth noting that Story Mode updates have long been discontinued by Rockstar Games. GTA Online recieves regular updates but is woefully mismanaged, all the more so on PC. Rockstar Games has continually proven to be completely incompetent at managing the stability and security of its online mode.As a longstanding fan of the Grand Theft Auto series, I am extremely disappointed by all of this. I no longer see any value in purchasing this game on PC.
