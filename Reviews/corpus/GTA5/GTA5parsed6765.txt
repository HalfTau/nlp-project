Ive played all of the GTA games. This is by far my favorite. The storyline is epic, and the ending is awesome. Online is fun eventhough modders spawn vehicles and planes on top of you and you die instantly, but its still so much fun. I give this game 10/10. Online is funner when you have a bunch of friends.
