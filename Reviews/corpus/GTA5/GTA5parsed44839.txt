I loved the game until Take Two stepped in like a communist leader. The game was great upon release in 2013 but as we get further into the games age we run into the cancer of microtransaction and it is just getting far more worse at a very quick pace. There is a reason why all the DLC content has been free from the start. Because sooner or later you cant keep up with the release of these DLC and you will soon start buying Shark Cards that is more expensive than the game.Any further with the forcing of microtransactions on the players of Gta5, I would consider a scam. This company has turned money hungry with a farm where they can milk your wallet like a cow. You can consider me the South and Take Two  Rockstar Games the North if this is a civil war, and believe me, the South will rise again because not many of us want to put up with the t.On behalf of the antimodding policies that your company believes in, I would love to say to your faces, Come and take it, because you are not getting it !This game has earned the negative reviews and the backlash of the modding community because this company is technically scamming its player base. I cannot even write a full review of why I chose the negative button, because I simply do not have the time to waste.
