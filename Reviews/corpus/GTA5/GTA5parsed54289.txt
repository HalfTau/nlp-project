I bought GTA V originally for the single player and not the multiplayer. I tried multiplayer for a couple hours and didnt like it because it felt too pay 2 win with the Shark Cards in order to get anything decent in value.So yes, I intended to buy this for the single player and to mod it and not for online. TakeTwos decision to file a cease and desist to Open IV clearly shows their stance on mods. If this is how TakeTwo is going to treat the modding community, they arent seeing another penny from me until they decide to pull their heads out of their asses.EDIT Seems they either arent listening or dont care becase TakeTwo now took down Menyoo.
