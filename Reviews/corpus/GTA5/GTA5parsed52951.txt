If you were planning on buying this game to be able to mod the singleplayer NOT THE MULTIPLAYER do not buy this game as the company behind it has banned the main mod that supports all other mods making the things and vehicles that are only accessable through multiplayer and could be accessed through singleplayer, E.G the Hydra Only multiplayer accesible so they push their players into online to take as much money as they can by charging them with new updates that cost a fortune so in order to purchase new things you either save a tonne of cash or buy shark cards.No wonder people Mod/Hack multiplayer because its so damn hard to actually purchase anything everybody justs wants money so they can have fun in the game, but thats not allowed as TakeTwo hate fun and dont want their players to have a fun active experience.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME At least until this issue is resolved by either TakeTwo or Rockstar Games
