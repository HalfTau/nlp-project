Been playing since GTAIII. Can confidently say this looks like the last great iteration.Like a person hooked on coke, Rockstar got hooked on Online and microtransactions and its been downhill ever since. I stopped playing altogether 6 months ago and have not missed it since. The modding ban is just another nail in the coffin.I bought this game 3 times. 360 Collectors Edition, PC Boxed and on Steam.If you havent already made the same mistakes, look elsewhere now. Youre not missing out much here.
