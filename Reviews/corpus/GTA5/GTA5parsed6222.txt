This game is just great, that is if you have creativity which not everyone does. If you have a mind that can come up with things to do and dont mind a bit of grinding to get exactly what you want, then this game is amazing. I would definently recommend it since it has so much replay value and pogression that can make the game last basically forever. My only worries about the game is that with the most recent update Doomsday Heist my frames dropped by about 3040 and hasnt been fixed yet happened with my friends too, and the fact that the game is becoming more grindy with what seems like every update. The fact that it takes around 5 million  to buy 2 planes in dlc, and 100 shark cards only give you 8 million which isnt enough for that price anymore. So even if you buy the shark card it wont last long with the increasing coast of the dlcs. But overall this game is great for the price and if on sale, I would definently recommed the game since if you have friends the experience can the best, longest lasting fun in a while.
