single player is good but you dont get the really good vehicles that are in online gameplay which is terrible, As for the online its a money grabbing scheme everything is waaay too expensive and no where near enough rewards for the activities ,they are pushing you to spend real cash.I will not spend a penny on shark cards as its a ripoff for small ammounts that go no where in game. 4 mill for 1 vehicle ect real shame as they have ruined online game with greed.Come on rockstar give us proper rewards for the activities or charge way less for vehicles.
