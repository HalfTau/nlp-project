GTA 5 is only for players which like a realy loooooooong loadings. I mean realy loong loadings, for example right now iam waiting more than 10 min to get online. Every missclick can cost you a lot of minutes in waiting. Quite often you will be disconnected fron online game and redirected to story mode, which means waiting again to get back to online. So this game is only for people which like to wait and again wait.
