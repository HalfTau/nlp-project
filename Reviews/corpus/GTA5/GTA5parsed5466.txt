One of the best games I have ever played exeptional graphics cool story great gameplay lots of funBut...The online .....oh boy the online servers...theese  are made out of potatos because the rockstar servers are always crashing witch is inconvinnient for the players.All of that aside I think enyone should buy the game and try it for themselves.
