The single player is fun to mess around in and the multiplayer is repetitive and pay to win. I would suggest waiting until Take 2 revises their stance on modding. The Multiplayer is the weakest link. Take 2 and Rockstar are unable to properly moderate their game this leading to hacking. This is caused by the pay to win nature of the game. The jobs, heists, gun running, and biker gangs are all inadequate. The only realistic ways to make money is to by shark card or to hack. I do not condone hacking, not do I partake. but the game requires an unrealistic amount of grinding with little meaningful payoff. I would suggest you refrain from buying  the game for the foreseeable future.Nerd cube made a fairly good video on the subjectThe CEO of Take 2s stance is clear. We are convinced that we are probably from an industry view undermonetizing on a peruser basis. There is wood to chop because I think we can do more, and we can do more without interfering with our strategy of being the most creative and our ethical approach, which is delighting consumers. strauss zelnick.
