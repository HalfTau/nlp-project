I preordered this game when it first came out on PS3, played it forever and LOVED the game. Loved it enough to purchase it again on PS4 and then twice on PC. 60  60  60  60 not including the many shark cards Ive purchased. The game is beautiful and amazing. The open world is like no other and before T2 shut down OpenIV I would have stood by this game no matter what. But now I am so disappointed that I dont even want to buy future games such as Red Dead Redemption and GTA 6. Before they shut down OpenIV I would have told you Grand Theft Auto V is my favorite game of all time. But as the Steam reviews show, people are not happy with the shutdown of OpenIV. The modding community is important to this game, without it I would have never bought 2 times on the PC, I would not even be playing the game anymore. I would have never bought GTAIV in 2017 when the game released in 2008. I support the effort to rid GTA Online of mods but OpenIV does not even let you load Online with it installed. I dont want to see this wonderful game become negatively reviewed on Steam but If you dont support the modding community and bring OpenIV back it will happen.
