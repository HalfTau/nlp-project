Im joining the AntiTakeTwo, ProModding circlejerk and posting a negative review.The campaign was fun, multiplayer sucks balls because of microtransactions, yadda yadda. Modding the singleplayer has no effect on the multiplayer, so why remove support for it?TakeTwo Interactive is just a bunch of greedy and greasy humans with no respect to the consumers.
