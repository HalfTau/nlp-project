Not only have Rockstar and Take Two completely screwed over their loyal players by only releasing new DLCs for Online, where they can milk people of even more money through microtransactions Shark Cards, they have now destroyed the modding scene by sending the founders of OpenIV a cease and desist order, forbidding them from giving the game years of additional community support after launch.All I can say is that I would discourage any potential buyers from purchasing the game at this moment. There are plenty of better games out there, with developers who truly embrace their respective playerbases.
