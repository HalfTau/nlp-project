a bit of a late review, but i had some time and wanted to emphasize how much i enjoyed this game. the singleplayer is truly fantastic, one of the best video games that ive likely ever played.the world is beautiful, rockstar paid a lot of attention to small details, and though there are still a lot of things that you cant interact with, they put in an insane amount of work and its just really fun exploring the map, driving or flying around and taking in the sights. one problem is that even on the very lowest graphics settings on a decent system, load times were pretty long and sometimes i experienced problems running the game smoothly.i have no gripes with the storyline, its creative and makes sense. its creative and humurous but not too overthetop with stupid humor. quests/missions were as a whole, pretty darn good. there were some missions that felt uninspiring and pretty repetitive, but for the most part, i had a blast.id give the singleplayer a 9.5/10. i dont think id ever give any game a 10/10 but this is probably the closest anyone is going to get to a 10multiplayer on the other hand is a bit of a different story. i personally didnt invest that much time into multiplayer, as load times were pretty ridiculous, all i ever found was getting gunned down by random people and ive heard nothing but bad stories from others about their experiences with multiplayer. hackers and cheaters roaming freely and rockstar apparently banning innocent players and refusing to look into pardons. i can see how playing the game in a group might be a lot more fun, but alas i have no friends and cant comment on multiplayer too much, so i wont give it a rating.
