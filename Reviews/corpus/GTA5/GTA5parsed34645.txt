If you have no interest in modding, or politics of this games parent company rockstar has nothing to do with this controversy this game is incredible. Amazing base game with a great story and huge diverse map, and online mode which is the most fun ive ever had in gaming, its so incredibly dinamic that every time you log on there will be an interesting story to experience if you put yourself out there to other players. If you get this game on sale its a ing steal, 100s of hours of entertainment for 30  with free DLC thats updated every few months. 10/10 would reccomend.
