Rockstar, your games used to be so great. They were so fun and easy to go with. But, the modding community needs to be accepted to an extent. I understand people wanting to mod money in to get cool items, buying your ing 100 shark cards for 8mil in game is a ing waste. Modding can get you 8mil for basically free. You need to get your prices down, or make it easier to get money legit. Your overpriced shark cards and your ignorance is insane. I have never modded, and I cant really stop insession money drops. But you need to understand how to find out whos moddding and who isnt.. you banned me, and I was on hold for an hour. Your ing dumbass british employee did nothing but say  you.
