Having no single player expansions or DLC, instead choosing to milk people for all theyre worth to buy a couple items online.  But we put up with that, because other people could expand the game through modding.Now thats not allowed, because TakeTwo made modding tools illegal.  I never recommended the Console version of the game to people because of the lack of single player content, but now the PC version has been pulled down to the same level.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  Stop bending over for publishers to do whatever they want.  We as consumers have purchased the game, and we own a legitimate copy of it.  How would you feel if your films were edited once youd paid for them?  If Book publishers came into your home and tore pages out of your books?  Dont put up with it for games.
