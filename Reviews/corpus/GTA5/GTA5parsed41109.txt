Grand Theft Auto Online has been nothing but a cash grab for some time now and Im glad people are finally starting to stand up against it. GTA has always been a game about freedom and doing whatever the hell you want and Take Two haveall over the playerbase for a long time now. The removal of mods does not impact me in the slightest but Im tired of being treated like a talking wallet.
