Grand Theft Auto has been a long standing series, a very good series indeed, this being one of the better ones with the way there is three protagonists rather than one. But, this game still comes second to San Andreas dispite its better graphics, better physics and additional online mode. Online is something else, varying from a storm of fire to a very peaceful, very polite game where players who bump cars might apologize to one another rather than start pumping lead. I feel bad for the people who are reviewing and raining fire on a good game from a good series and being obtuse about the actions of Take Two, whom of which should be raining fire on their customer support if they honestly cared rather than leaving reviews that measure up to nothing more than petty comments and disliking a game they probably wont stop playing anyway.All in all, its a worthwhile game and I apologize on behalf of the good community for these sputs of pointless reviews.
