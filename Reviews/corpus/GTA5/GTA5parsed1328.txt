This game has its ups and downs, I generally like the game but it has become such a grind I have to put a whole week of hard work to get a vehicle I want. With the 500 hours I have put into this game I definitly recommend this game because you can do anything you want. But I also wouldnt recommend this game if you dont plan on investing lots of time into it because as I said earlier if you dont invest a lot of time into the game you wont have a single vehicle that you want.
