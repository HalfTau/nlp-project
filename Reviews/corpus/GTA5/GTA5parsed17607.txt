You take MONTHS, actual ing real life months to collect a million to be able to buy at least something halfdecent, one supercar and still wont even be able to upgrade it fully.If thats not enough, they randomly delete ALL of your money and when you contact support about it, they just claim it was all illegitimately gained, even though it wasnt and they never give you any reason as to why they say it was illegitimately gained.and if THATS not enough either, they let blatant modders roam around ruining peoples fun with no repercussions whatsoever.The only reason to buy this game is the story and even thats really painful and lackluster, just an allaroundgame. this game,  rockstar,  take two.What a ing fall from grace.
