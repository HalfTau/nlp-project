Singleplayer is a 10/10, Stunning visuals, amazing story and stunning visuals. Although theres no official modding support theres a good selection online.GTA Online is best played with some friends or even a social group on Rockstars Social Club. If you want to experience every piece of content it would require a lot of time, money or neither of those if you find a friendly cheater.Although they abandoned single player DLC and have hiked up ingame prices to drive microtransactions. The game is great and I have put in over a thousand hours across multiple platforms.
