take two trying to murder singleplayer mods, probably to force people into the microtransaction riddled multiplayer.because apparantly selling the game 3 times over 3 platforms  for 60 wasnt enough, and over 700 million dollars in microtransactions alone in 2016, is not enough. Apparantly being the 4th highest grossing game of all time isnt enough, they want to be number one.everyone bought it on xbox 360/ ps3, then they bought it again on xbox one/ ps4 for the nextgen performance upgrade, then they bought it again on pctake two makes it blatantly clear with their actions that they have no concern for their community, they just want more money. if you are reading this and want to do a great service to the modding community, dont spend your money on this or any other take two game.
