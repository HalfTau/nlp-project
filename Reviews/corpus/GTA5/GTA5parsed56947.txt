I originially purchased GTA V for the online. The story never really interested me, but the online looked like a lot of fun. It was, but it got very repetitive and boring and I never really felt I was earning enough money for it to be worth my time. I almost quit, until a cheater they are everywhere and gamebreaking gave me an inordinate amount of money. I proceeded to buy everything I wanted. This alleviated my boredom for a while, but eventually I ran into the same problem. Repetitiveness. So I along with the rest of my friends stopped playing online. I didnt touch the game until I came upon a mod called LSPDFR. This mod allows you to play in singleplayer as a police officer. I played this on and off for a while, having mroe fun than ever before in GTA V. However, recently, TakeTwo, those who control rockstar, sent a ceaseanddesist letter to the creaters of OpenIV. This has stopped the distribution and advancement of OpenIV. OpenIV is currently the only way that I know of to mod GTA V, essentiallly making all modding illegal. GTA has had a strong modding community since GTA III and all of the sudden the execs decide no more? This has changed my opinion of GTA V and TakeTwo completley. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It may seem cool and fun. But it will get boring fast without the mods. I will never be purchasing a TakeTwo game again as long as they try to make modding illegal.SummaryGTA V seem cool.I buy.GTA V gets boring.I stop playing.I find cool mod.I play again.TakeTwo bans modding.I stop playing.I stop buying TakeTwo Games.I write this review.
