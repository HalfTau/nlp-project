I havent played that much GTA V in PC but in my experience I showed up my moves and earned money, Doing heist and playing PvP, From Deathmatches to Freemode, Storymode to Job. The game costs quiet alot 60 But The graphics are AWESOME, A little bit problem to my FPS But staying still.The game in my opinion worth the 60 and even making you enjoying the game.The online mode Is the must fun in the game I really like it, I already own a CEO and making friends in the community, Im still looking for some buddies to play with, If you seen this add me and commend on my profile that you saw this review and I will be back to you.
