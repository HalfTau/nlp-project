Amazing game, BUT...MILLIONS, of innocent players Including me have been randomly banned by their anticheat system. No matter how much evidence and even a video of the incident you upload, you will be permanantly banned after spending 100 in the game, without any response or reply from their support.Also, the community is full of griefers, hackers, and kids!Game 10/10Support 100/10Community 2/10Please note, if you play this game. And you have done nothing... You can still randomly lose your account!!!
