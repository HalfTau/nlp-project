Loved the Grand Theft Auto franchise since Chinatown Wars. Every game Rockstar makes gets better and better. Although I have to say GTA V wasnt the best in terms of storyline, it is still one of the top Grand Theft Auto games I have played. Rockstars attention to detail in this game is amazing. The only downside is just the modding problem and also the endless hours of grinding Pacific Standard in order to get myself that fully customised Panto D Rockstart pls fix Shark Cards
