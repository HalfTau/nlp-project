I mean, I would say its a great game, looking at the graphics etc.Then again, looking at the developers, tar Games, a bunch of greedy makes me change my mind entirely.Banning people for having Graphic Enhancers... Really? Oh, dont forget the fact that the game is older than most of the people who play it, yet they still sell it for 60 bucks! Nice!TLDR Yeah Rockstar can go hump themselves.
