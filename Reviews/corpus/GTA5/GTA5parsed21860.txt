I used to really enjoy this game until their publishing company Take Two sent out a Cease  Desist letter which would essentially ruin the modding community as we know it. All I can say is your coorperate greed has now landed you multiple overwhelmingly negative reviews recently on the steam page, and overall you are now a mixed reviewed game. GTA is a game based on freedom and creativity. Rockstar even use to encourage use of OpenIV and now youre trying to take it away due to the cut in your profits from shark cards? Get over yourselves. You brought in 8 bill. last year, why exactly do you need more again? You justoff a huge userbase. Hope it was worth it.
