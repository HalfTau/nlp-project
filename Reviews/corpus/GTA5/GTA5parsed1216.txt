A complete masterpiece in terms of world design and singleplayer experience, but I wouldnt get this for the multiplayer. Its a micro transaction shitastrophe full of hackers with little to no depth. I really, really hope they rethink the multiplayer experience from the ground up as the world/mechanics are incredible.
