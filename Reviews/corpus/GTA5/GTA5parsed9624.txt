Im gonna keep this review short because everyone knows whats good with GTAThe story is pretty fun, but they did skimp a little in comparison to other GTA games.The Online has been improved so much theres so much content, holytheres so many ways to make money now, not to mention the endless replay value when friends get invovledall the business types you can open and different mission styles have made the online into a full fledged game and has put the offline story in its shadow. hackers can be a problem but nothing that cant be fixed by switching sessions.and rockstar is cracking downMY ONLY GRIPE IS THE SHARK CARD CRAP!!!BUUUUUUT it is a decent way of getting around making people pay for dlc and giving people a chance to just work for the money to get the same content...but it does make make the game a PTW title in my opinion,still nothing beats opening a drug smuggling business online with your friends hahaha
