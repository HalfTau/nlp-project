Rockstars greed has ruined a perfectly good game. Sky high GTA money prices and low honest way to make money started hackers going crazy. Add the fact that buying shark cards gets you hardly any money in GTA money at all and hackers running free to ruin the experience and purchase things for free with nothing happening from RStar created an extremely unbalanced in game economy. You would literally need to spend over 100 real dollars to be able to afford half of the items that come out per DLC. Now take that and their recent move to harass OPENIV for SINGLE PLAYER mods in a SP mode that HASNT BEEN UPDATED IN YEARS, they are forcing the only way for PAYING customers to pay HUNDREDS of dollars to get ANY replay ability for this game online.... after they have literally made a killing on this game already. Take a hint from Bethesda Rockstar on single player modding because if you keep on this track your future title will fail in your micro transaction world. AND BALANCE OUT THE GAME ECONOMY!!! PLEASE MAKE IT WHERE HACKERS ARENT IN EVERY SESSION!!! DONT MAKE IT SO HARD TO EARN HONEST GTA MONEY! !Flat out if you dont have this game, DONT pay for it. its a waste of time unless you are a hacker.
