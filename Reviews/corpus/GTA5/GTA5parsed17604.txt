 this game.I spent more than a week farming money to get ready for the next DLC, and out of nowhere I receive a message saying that they removed 6,5 million GTA and nothing else. After that, I went to social club website, and read they were removing cheater money from the game.So, I farm like a ing idiot in order to ready myself to the next stupidDLC that costs aton of money, and they just remove my money? this game and this company. If youre idiot, like to get banned for doing nothing wrong, and like to waste time, definitely buy this game.
