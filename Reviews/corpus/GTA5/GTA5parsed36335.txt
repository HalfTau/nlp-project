TakeTwo is trying to dismantle the modding community that they once said they supported, all in an effort to take your nickels and dimes through GTA Online. Dont fall for their corporate excuses. By removing OpenIV theyve eliminated most mods from being used by new players to the game. Mods that are for SINGLE PLAYER. If you support TakeTwo wanting to crush the creative community that is the biggest reason that this game is the FOURTH best selling games of all time. Sorry that you are making BILLIONS and not TRILLIONS. Jesus. Dont buy this game if you dont already have it, not until OpenIV is allowed again.
