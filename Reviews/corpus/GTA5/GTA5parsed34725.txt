Played this back when it first came out on the console, enjoyed it back then and still did. When i first got it on pc i was excited to get into the modding community and just have even more fun out of the game for single player, since Take two has taken that ability away with OpenIV I just cant play it anymore.. Just an ordinary, boring game as it once was.
