Have you played one GTA game, you have played them all. The city is boring because it looks the same everywhere, there are barely any cars that can be hijacked, all the parkingspots are empty for some boring reason and because the city is so big, there is so much empty except alot of roads and driving in this game is not even fun. Car customization is cool but why cant i switch my primary car? WHATS THE POINT of this then? I experienced glitches and bugs that had me restart the game and i waited years before buying this so why isnt this game fixed yet? I was hoping for something exceptional because of the hype but i guess its all because of the online part which im not interested in.
