Pretty good game with seemingly comprehensive and customisable graphics options. Very CPU heavy, uses 8 threads if you have them. I struggle with an FX 8150  4.3GHz.Also, the bloom is horrendous and you cant disable chromatic aberration, which is ridiculous. GTA IV had better handling and physics and is a better game, in my opinion, however considering how poorly GTA IV runs on PC, if you need your GTA fix this is the best option. Just use a mod to disable chromatic abberration / all post FX and use Flawless Widescreen for a better 1st person FOV.
