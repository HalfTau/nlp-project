So many things are wrong with this game. Half the DLC cars are not in single player, and it is so hard to make a quick buck. Now for TakeTwo, those s go after modders for no reason and ruin the games reputation. And the worst part, Rockstar Support are idiots and cant fix a damn thing.  Rockstar,  TakeTwo,  all of RockstarsEdit Even if OpenIV is back never used it this review will stay negative until Rockstar fixes their mothering game. I havent even been able to play it because my launcher blacks out and wont load my game, when i try to ask Rockstar Support, they say I have the steam version and to try launching through Steam. Rockstar and TakeTwo can suck a giantfor making such a  ing game and not treating their users fairly.  you Rockstar you dumb es
