I have played this for nearly 2k hours since release so its clearly a good game for me, unfortunately they are a bit greedy with the shark cards lately by overpricing everything so only hackers and whales can afford to purchase the game latest stuff, but those can be avoided if you dont mind a bit of grind or just do like me and play the game for its different modes and avoid entirely freemode which lost its charm a while ago personally, specially with all the overpowered griefing tools and rampant hackers everywhere.SP Mode Its ok for a while but its boring and limited once you finish it, i wish it was more like San Andreas with more stuff to do never touched it once i finished the main story.Online Mode I love it and its where i spent most of my time playing this game for its different adversary modes,  be warned there is a lot of hackers, griefing and a massive grind if you are a new player.Get it during a sale and dont bother with shark cards their real price is high and their value ingame is very low.
