I 100 would recommend this game to people who love cars, and guns. Online is very fun with friends, but there is the occasional modder. You can make an online lobby, but it can be private. You can mod all you want in single player mode, and there are tons! The game is very well done, there are little to no bugs. Only had the game for a few days and LOVED it!!
