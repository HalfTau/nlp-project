i bought GTAV not that many months ago. literally the very first session i joined there was a modder giving presumably everybody 2000 every second. i didnt know that it wasnt normal. i didnt know that a modder was giving it to me. i made 86 million in that session. admittedly i spent almost all of it at this point. but that put me all the way at the end game the day i bought it. it seems i cant even play the game at all without some modder ruining the whole experience. last week i tried playing and there was a modder in the session. he trapped me in a tram. he spawned a tram directly on top of me and took away all of my weapons. i tried changing sessions but something the modder did made that give me an error. so i tried restarting my game but then it wouldnt work at all. i literally had to reinstall the game just to get it to work again. today i joined a session and there was a modder killing everybody. i hop on my oppressor and try to kill him but he was unkillable. and he kept blowing me up without being able to see me. then he kicked me from the session and made my game crash. this happens literally every time i log on.
