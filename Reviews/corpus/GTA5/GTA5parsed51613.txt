I cant believe that TakeTwo Interactive, after all this time, have now become complete asshats. Saying modding is illegal is asinine and shutting down OpenIV when they have nothing to do with the online multiplayer is equally stupid. Youre a pathetic excuse for a publisher and I hope that Rockstar Games can become an independent company because they sure as hell dont need you.
