When you port a game to PC you are subjecting it to mods. Without modding communities, PC Gaming as a whole is crippled. GTA V is no exception. Since you idiots didnt care about mod support and didnt work on it yourselves, people stepped up and created something incredible. Now Take Two pulls this t like PC gamers dont care about mods. Lift the CD or focus on adding mod support yourselves.
