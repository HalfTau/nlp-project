GTA V is a must buy. Yes, a lot of people complain about the microtransactions and lack of single player DLC, but the game is still worth it one hundred percent. Currently, Rockstar adds awesome online DLC every couple of months that get better and better and give the game new life constantly! Of course most of this stuff they add isnt obtainable unless you either grind money for hours doing missions or buy their shark cards. I currently havent bought a single shark card and have unlocked everything I really want from this game. It is possible, and honestly fun too. GTA is great and the continuous support and new additions coming from the creators are making it better and better. If youre going to play just make sure you grab some friends to come along with you.
