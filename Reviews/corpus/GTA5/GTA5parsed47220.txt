Just got banned for a month and character reset?!?!this is some ing t. R must be out there ing minds to start banning the FEW ed player they have left over some Russian  hacking thier mothering server that I just happen to be on at the time. Not to mention the fact that i reported the hack asap with screenshots to prove that i had nothing to do with it. Out of all the negitive reviews they have lately, I was still one of very few people still giving positive reviews and recommending the game. And those s at R ban me for it? Well  R,  GTA,  me, and  you for playing it. The next time i log on to one of there servers will be with a new account and character, from a VPN within a VPN and after ive learned how to hack it for real.
