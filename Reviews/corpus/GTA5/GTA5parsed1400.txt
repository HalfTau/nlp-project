Could have been a great role playing online game, but you can know anytime where are the other players, motorcycle clubs are pretty bad because two clubs cant do missions at the same time. Players are mostly shooting anyone on sight and you just CANT hide, and will respawn 2 meters from where you died. I m too tired to speak about the other optimisation issues and the money lust of rockstar. If you want to buy the game wait until it is below 20 dollars.
