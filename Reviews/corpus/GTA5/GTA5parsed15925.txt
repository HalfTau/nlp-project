The Single Player is great and i would pick this game up just for it, theres no reason in me explaining why its good since the damn game has been out since 2013.The online portion is like a 5/10, you first think its super great, then you realize the amount of grinding you will be doing just to become one of the big boys. I wouldnt recommend cheating in money because youll most likely get a ban nowadays, and if you decide to anyways youll quickly realize how boring the game is after you have everything. I definitely dont blame you for cheating money in though, the hundreds apon hundreds of hours youll be putting in is such a joke.By no means is this a bad game but it seems that RockStar is getting a little money hungry on the online portion.So i would give the game a 9/10 but totally disregarding the online portion in that rating, i would give the game a 7/10 with the online included.
