I really enjoyed the single player experience of GTA V and I would definitely recommend the game to anyone who enjoys massive open world masterpieces. However, the multiplayer is a repetitive microtransaction laden hellhole comparable to freetoplay mobile games while still costing 60, and TakeTwo declared war on mods so Im going to go ahead and give a negative, though I might change it if the company bends over backward to make up for it.
