its a good game that builds on a great history of GTA games but the immense greed of Take Two Interactive ran this games potential to the ground by canceling potential great DLCs to the single player portion of the game in favor of poorly implemented content to the online portion of the game witch is riddled with microtransaction that force you to spend large sums of money to be able to try any new content or play countless hours grinding the same poorly implemented content in order to get any reasonable amount of in game credits to buy in game content
