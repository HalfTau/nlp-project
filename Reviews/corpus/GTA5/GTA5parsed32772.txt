1.7 mil taken off my account because of supposed exploiting their 2x vehicle cargo mission. intense smacking headpalm GG Rockstar. Im sorry for fairly waiting for the cool down timer of cars to be sold. Because 1.7 mil could totally buy me everything in that game. sarcasm It takes me forever to save up that much in game because I dont like randos, I dont wanna participate in all the 2x xp and cash pvp stuff that you can supposedly make millions in hours if you participate in. Be like one guy in the forums who got 50k from a hacker and rockstar took 32 mi off his account in the end even when he reported it to protect himself. Doing things solo or with friends still takes time on all the business plus bodyguards and prospects dont make jackfrom the profit if you dont fit missions in between. This happens again Im probably gonna be done with this game.
