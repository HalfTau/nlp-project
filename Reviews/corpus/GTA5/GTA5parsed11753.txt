Very hesitant recommendation of this game. The game is 10x as fun with friends as opposed to playing by yourself. That being said, if you dont have friends this game is a REAL pain. There is so much grinding in GTA Online its insane. Playing with friends helps alleviate this somewhat by making the grinding slight more fun and faster but its still a pain. GTA V single player is really enjoyable, theres no grinding at all and I thought that the main story was really fun. I would definitely wait for this game to go on sale and if you play on playing GTA Online be prepared for a lot of grinding and lots of people trying to ruin your fun if youre trying to grind.
