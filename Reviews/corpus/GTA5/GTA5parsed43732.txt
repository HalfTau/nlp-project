One of the reason why I bought GTA 5 on the PC, is to ING MOD IT! i dont even play in multiplayer! why in the ing hell would you guys do this? for money?..I understand that you are a business and you need to make a profit, but alienating your entire modding community is completely !.Mods keep the game fresh and alive even after their release! this is completely devastating, extremely stupid move by take two. SO STUPID!!! !
