Even despite all the greedyyou see regarding Take Two and OpenIV, this game is no longer playable.Entering now, youll be far too poor, likely get banned for something you didnt do, and your game will freeze every 510 minutes July 14 2017.  Youre too late and its just not worth it.  Im sorry.For the seldom few who have had this game a long time and have loads of cash, the game is fun and still playable if it wasnt crashing every 10 minutes. The base game has great potential and R has put forth an effort to expand the experience.  Unfortinately, the cost of this is cripplyingly expensive.  The equivalent of 1000hrs of grind time might get you to a place where you can finally sit back and enjoy yourself for a bit, but youll still be relatively broke.  It makes no sence.  The game is clearly milking its base for all its worth and stomps on those that disrupt their income.Itd be nice if R could move on, but GTAV is easy money.Honestly, the only way you will not regret your purchase is if R gives up on the modders and cash starts raining from the sky literally.  And so long as they fix the crashing, you could have a blast.  The conversion rates on the Sharkcards are criminal.
