Take two essentially banned single player modding for this game on legal grounds that were completely unfounded by sending a cease and desist to the creators of the SINGLE PLAYER modding platform OpenIV, a letter that they couldnt even take the time to write professionally and it was full of technical and gramatical errors. Do not support take two.Not to mention take twos executive officer thinks you are a freeloader if you do not buy all the stupid microtransactions they put into their games that ruin the experience, as well as claiming that the are undermonitizing on a per user basis by not making you pay for EVERYTHING in the 60 dollar game you bought. As if 60 dollars wasnt enough. They want to squeeze every nickel out of you.Im serious The company doesnt see you as a person but just ato milk money from as long as they can. Im personally running dry and tired of it. The destruction of a community that dares make the game any better as well as possibly drives player from sinking every minute of play time into the fee  to  play online mode adds on to this and demonstrates it perfectly. Do not support this company until they start treating their customer base with a little respect.
