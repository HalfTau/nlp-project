Since they have taken an antimodding stance, I would no longer reccomend this title nor its affiliated companies and publishers. The war on modding only hurts the community and pushes people away from the game and kills replayability. SHARK CARDS SHARK CARDS THATS ALL THAT MATTERS. Is the message I am getting from this.
