Everyone keeps saying that there are heaps of modders and the online sessions are cancer, but i dont beliave that is true. i have played a fair bit of gta online and the game is great, The modders dont troll you and the sessions are not cancer, well in most circumstances. its a really great game to play with friends and i am absolutley loving it. my only wish is that this game would be less resource demanding as for me, when i drive a car rerally fast, i freeze frame quite a bit but im sure that can be fixed with some upgrades to my computer. anyways, great game /
