It amazes me its only now that people are having some rebellion against Take 2, considering how theyve rigged the entire online game to be a tedious grind fest unless you spend money on shark cards. Not only that, but even if you do buy them, theres literally nothing to do once you get the stuff you want. Worst yet, unlike GTA 4 theyve completely trashed modding, as shown by the recent controversy over Take2 shutting down OpenIV. We cant really forget that to keep their monopoly on Online, theyve completely banned modding in general, removing what used to be the greatest part about the original GTA games.
