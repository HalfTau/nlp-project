Rockstar has stolen millions of dollars from players who bought their scummy shark cards and refuse to give refunds.  Instead of hosting dedicated servers to have some sort of legitimate anticheat to stop modding online they just decided to attempt to sue the creators of a mod manager that doesnt even have anything to do with modding online, following up with banning modding in general.  I guess they thought they got enough money from their dumbfoundedly stupid playerbase from buying sharkcards and multiple copies of the game after getting banned for no reasons whatsoever.Definetely a cause of the downfall of videogames.
