Way to wreck a good thing gta. your customer support is horrible. banned my online account because i was entered into a hacked lobby and will not even review it at all. now you have disabled mod support after it has been available to use in singleplayer for years. way to wreck peoples creative content. your shark cards are a joke too expensive to keep buying them as you release new dlc almost everyweek forcing people to want those new and big things but put the price way out of reach for people not willing to shell out thier hard earned money to purchase shark cards over and over again.gta online is just a bunch of random people going around being complete asses. I have supported GTA since the very begging and will not give anymore money to rockstar or take 2 interactive.DONT BUY THIS GAME unless your want to throw your hard earned cash away all the time....
