Very underrated game with excellent combat. I love the hack n slash elements with warrior. The only game i can compare the epic combat goodness to is Vindictus which, in my opinion is very repeditive. The artstyle in this game is very beautiful and with a level 40 character on the europe server i can guarantee you that the maps are very unique to eachother. The terrain combined with the enviroment and monster designs Im truly impressed. You do see some enemies that are recycled BUT they differ ALOT from their other models. As you progress in the game you see variations of the mobs you have met before. Depending on the environment and level they have their unique style. There are only a few monsters that get evolved like this and they are iconic to the game. The rest of the mobs are also very detailed even though you only see them for about 30 minutes  2 hours. That can be said the same about the environment. The lighting  the art and particles really makes you drop your jaw when you travel through the landscapes. There are all kinds of environments but one thing I really wish to see is a little bit more modern factory of some sort. Other than that you see all kinds of enviroments. Mines, forests with unicorns, fields, underground dungeons, cathedrals, grasslands, woodlands, you name it! Some people might think that this game is repeditive and in the start i think so too! But once you get started and get your own mount and get past level 25 the game really shows it true beauty.Id give this game a 8/10 but its FOR FREE AND THERES NO PTW SYSTEM except for cosmetics but that aint PTW SO ILL GIVE IT A 10/10 THIS GAME IS AMAZING AND ITS LITERALLY 500 HOURS OF PURE EYECANDY NOT TO MENTION ITS MULTIPLAYER AND YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME WITH ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS MAKING IT SO MUCH MORE FUN.10 OUT OF FCKING 10
