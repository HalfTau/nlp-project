This game has changed the whole concept of gta, in a very positive way. When i was introduced to the series for the first time i was surprised, we can do almost anything in the game which we did in real life, open world ! Now there is so much to this game that i find it hard to do the extra curricular apart from the story line. And then there is GTA online, i am just speechless Its just everything for a 3rd person shooter and open world adventures fan D
