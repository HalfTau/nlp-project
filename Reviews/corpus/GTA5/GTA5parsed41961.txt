The single player is great, the online multiplayer is trash and here is why.Free DLC that costs ingame money sounds great at first, but when it costs way too much its an obviouse ploy to make you  buy  in game money from rockstar that will set you back 40 and sometmes more then the games actual cost.However what I hate the most is hackers and GTA 5 online has alot of them. Every other lobby has users that put invulnrability or blow you up while not being anywhere near you. Which makes me question if they even check the servers or even the game.              .
