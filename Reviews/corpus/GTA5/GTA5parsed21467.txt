Grand Theft Auto V fails to deliver the same feeling the older GTA titles had.Sure there is a lot to do like skydiving, races, small store robberies, customization, etc. But the game fails deliver an interesting story even though it has 3 main characters one of them is really boring, looking at you Micheal. They also gave it a more arcade feeling compared to GTA 4 imho physics in gta 4 were fun. Police is not interesting or funny to fight against and the gun gameplay feels really shallow and boring. Even the fighting is unsatisfying.Lets not even start about GTA Online, because it might be a cash cow, the gameplay and community are boring and toxic as hell. Rockstar and Take Two only care about online now because of the money and wont adress the real issues like the lobby system WHICH IS INFURIATING. If someone leaves during a heist, you are send back all the way to the open world.Rockstar and Take Two are so focussed on making money with GTA Online that they abandoned the thought of a single player DLC completely.Then you have the issue with not allowed to mod your own game...  the fact that the game is, even after 5 years, still full price!I suggest you skip this game entirely. It is the most boring GTA to date in my opinion.
