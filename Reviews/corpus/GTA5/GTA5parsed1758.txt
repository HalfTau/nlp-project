I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign and the online mode, whilst becoming increasingly unfair to newbies with the ongoing inclusion of highpriced vehicles and weapons, was always a fond source of enjoyment over the years. However, after being hit by a suspension for carduping, I then returned to play for 10 minutes with a newly refreshed character. Barely getting past the tutorial section I then get slapped with a permanent ban. What followed was months of trying to get through to Rockstar Support to try and get to the bottom of exactly why I was banned, and every time I get the same response. Trying to speak to someone about it is impossible, I always get the same standard response that Ive been banned and that the decision cant be contested.I thought the suspension was harsh considering the amount of hackers that get away scotfree on a daily basis, but to be banned permanently for no discernable reason and to have followed that incident with the experience with Rockstar support means I really cant recommend this otherwise excellent game anymore.I hope one day I can play once again but I cant ever see that happening now. Very unfortunate.
