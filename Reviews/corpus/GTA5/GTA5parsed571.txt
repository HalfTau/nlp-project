If youre buying the game for single player youll probably enjoy this, but if youre wanting a good multiplayer experience youll be sadly disappointed. Starting out in this game requires a lot of work to get the money required to buy anything, unfortunatly the skys are full of jet propelled griefers, random bombs, falling hacker ufos, hackers can even teleport you away from your haul just to laugh at you. Rockstars support policy wont return you any funds lost this way, and seemingly ignore the fact that hackers flood every lobby. Long story short, multiplayer is basically unplayable unless youre a hacker. Maybe thats what rockstar wants though, if people cant make money legitimatly in game then theyll buy more with real money? Bad rockstar, bad...
