The singleplayer gets boring realy quickly , the muktiplater is disgustingly filled with kids and people who claim to be pros , in the end the game is garbedge because of the player base , Id give it a 0/5 and modding is difficult , online modding isnt allowed and the fun vanishes in les then ten seconds because these kids realy want to troll you
