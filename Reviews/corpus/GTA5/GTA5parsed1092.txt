well iv been playing gta 5 for a long timeand i have to say  this is a cool game ! HOWEVER and this HOWEVER is VERY importantyou need to be rich in real life to be rich in gta OR you need to mod and take a risk of banfor me modding is not an option so i stay pretty broke in the game all the timerockstar just want to make TONS OF MONEY from the playersthey are selling us shark cards and make tons and tons of moneyif a shark card would bring 100 mil  to my gta acount i would have saidok this game is totaly cool but this is not the case......shark cards give small amount of millions that you spend to fast and befor you notice its GONEso im sorry but this is the UGLY part of this gameso i dont recommend buying itunless you have tons of real cash to spend on those shark cardshave a nice day !
