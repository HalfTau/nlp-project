Its fun and all but coming back to play it after some updates there were serious stuttering issues that were not there previously doesnt occur for everyone but extremly annoying.Hours and hours of digging and ive found a fix that works but requires 3rd party software. Just not cricket really as people have had this issue since launch and its still occuring.Therfore cant recommend, a pain to get working properly if broken.
