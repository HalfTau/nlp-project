Frustrating online mode. Not as many hackers as I thought there were, but the few bad apples are real jerks that kill everyone. I keep getting disconnected from everyone, even though I just got faster internet. Story mode is pretty cool though, online is terrible. Pay to win? What a joke. You cant even transfer characters from console anymore, so console players stay away from the PC version.
