Take Two has recently issued a cease and decist to OpenIV, a modding team dedicated to opening up the games files. The existence of said team and subsequent mods is the primary reason for purchasing GTA V on PC. At this point in time I cannot recommend the game to anyone.Edit Oh, and forget me buying Red Dead 2 or anything else in the future. Youve lost my money unless this decision is overturned.Edit 2 Theyve since mostly overturned their decision considering OpenIV. Im switching my review back to positive but leaving my initial complaint explaining the previous situation so as to caution anyone in regards to R and Take Two. My review is positive because the singleplayer is fantastic. The multiplayer is a microtransaction grindfest, however.
