GTA Online is a mixed bag for certain. On the one hand you have a nice game world that is full and detailed replete with plenty of things to do. Endless content. On the other, the game is also infested with cheaters, who have only gotten more willing to screw around with legit players as the sources of these cheats are nullified. They cant kill off this cancer soon enough, I just hope they still have a game left after its done. You shouldnt have to be forced to play in private sessions because people cant handle actually playing the game without cheating.Your right to cheat/mod/hack ended when you went online.
