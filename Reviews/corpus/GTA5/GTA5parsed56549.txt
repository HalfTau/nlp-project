GTA V is a decent game that was inspired by GTA san andreas.Sadly the developers are destroying the experience in order to make more money.Mods have been banned in single player even, tho they dont efect the multiplayer.Online mode is designed to be so grindy in order to make you buy shark carts.The anticheat does not work and creates a constant fear that one day you may get banned for no reason.If you havent bought this game yet, Than dont buy it!If you want a gta experiance than go and buy GTA san andreas or GTA IV.
