ing fantastic game ruined by its producers. If you want this game for the singleplayer and nothing else I do recommend it but on the behalf of the OpenIV team im not recommending this cause its t. For anyone who doesnt know yet you can no longer use Open IV to mod GTA V. Online CAN be fun to a certain extent but is massively unbalanced and grindy.EDITIm changing my mind and deciding to reccomend this game, cause itd be hypocritical of me to leave that previous review of mine there when this game has provided over a hundred hours of laughs and entertainment with myself and friends. The multiplayer in a nutshell is fun but unbalanced and is imperfect, still fun though. Singleplayer is vv good so ye I would say GTA V is a good game, imperfect but good.
