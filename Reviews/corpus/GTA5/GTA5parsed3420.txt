Story mode is awesome, Second to none... However the GTA Online part has become very bloated. Due to the shift to Heavy micro transactions obtaining items in the game has become a grind to deep for casual players. This point causing the player base to dwendle and make it even harder for players trying to catch up.I bought this game day 1 but now its a long long grind until i have the assets to use newer content unless I spend cash on the Micro transactions Shark CardsThe missions online rewards didnt scale up with the increasing cost of everything ingame.
