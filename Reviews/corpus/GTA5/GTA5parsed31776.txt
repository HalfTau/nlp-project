I had sunk over 500 hours into this game, but this way way in the past back when Online was relatively bearable and the single player could be modded with things to make it more interestingBy now, not only Online has adopted the freemium scheme of aingame economy where you need to unholily grind to acheive anything worthwhile, but TakeTwo has also killed modding for single player which would have been the only reason for me to come back to this game eventuallyThats why Im giving a negative review after such a long time, because its mind boggingly insane that after 10 years of zero issues with modding in their games they suddenly decide to adress the smoke of the fire and shut down a SINGLE PLAYER modding tool while not giving two  about the reasons as to why online hacking still exists
