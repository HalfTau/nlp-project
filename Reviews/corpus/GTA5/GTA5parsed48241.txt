Adding my voice the displeasure over removing OpenIV. Its been instrumental to the success of singleplayer SP mods for GTA IV and GTA V and removing it has wiped out an entire community of SP GTA players. As long as TakeTwo insists on stomping on this communitys creative aspirations, I will not recommend this game to anybody for any reason.The game itself was already fairly meh, especially when 100 of the development focus went into GTA Online and no new singleplayer content was added. But taking away the ability for others to add meaningful single player content to the half of the game Rockstar decided to toss by the wayside? Thats the last straw. I resoundingly do not recommend this game, nor do I recommend supporting the publisher Take Two or any of its subsidiaries, like Rockstar.
