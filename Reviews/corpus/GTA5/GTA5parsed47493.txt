Take Two is the most greedy, money hungry company and they do everything they can to suck us, the players, out of our funds. Now they banned Open IV and thus modding for this game. I am not taking it anymore and I wont buy single Take Two game ever again. I hope that all the other players will do the same, lets vote with our wallets.
