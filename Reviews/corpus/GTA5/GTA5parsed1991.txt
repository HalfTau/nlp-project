I recommend this game, obviously if your computer can run it, dont buy a 60 dollar game if your PC cant handle it.The game is fun, I really enjoyed the story mode and didnt like that it ended lol, but you can always replay missions.My main issue is the online portion, and the thing is probably 65 bought this game just for that.The servers tend to crash a lot for me and my friend. You would randomly get kicked, and its annoying.Also, the Heist. Dont get me wrong, they are fun. But I wish they could be done with at least 2 or more people, not forcefully have 4, because having some people who arent your friends are just annoying and dont cooperate well.My other problem is the flying, for PC. The controls make it literally impossible to have a Dog Fight. Its a big disadvantage and takes away a piece of fun I can enjoy. Yes, I can fly, just not fly and fight. Hard. But other then the Servers and some of those Controls, the game overall is good, and would recommend it.
