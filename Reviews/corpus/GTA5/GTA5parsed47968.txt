I have over 186 hours into this game, and its only on the online alone. The recent update and Fixes for the game are a god send for some of us who legitly play the game... I can understand people wanting to mod the game for Single Player use. How ever OpenIV has opened up a back door into the online portion of the game, which makes online harder, when you never know when a modder is gonna pop on and start doing a cash drop or start blowing up random cars or a number of vairous other B.S. that caused gameplay issues for legit players.To the fools whining that they dont get to cheat online any more, just please shut up.As for the game its self, its pretty good, and Im gonna be honest the Shark Cards could use an update, If Im paying over 100 bucks for a shark card, I should get at least 15 million instead of 8 million. Most cars and gameplay mechanics require more than 8 million bucks just to get them.
