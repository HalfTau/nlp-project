i am not gonna talk about gta v because everybody pretty much know about this game, i am gonna talk about my incident and rockstar online support so, i was in an online session and suddenly a modder started using mods on me then he started putting money on my bank account i took screenshots of all of it and suddenly reported to rockstar within a day i got reply from them and they asked me to prove my ownership by replying with my mail which is associated to my gta account i did what they said and they removed modded money.rockstar support has been improved so much so if youre gonna buy this game go ahead this game has lot of fun try to avoid hackers in game just whenever you face hacker just leave your session and report to rockstar if you somone gives you modded money because youre gonna get banned if you dont  report even when you not using mods that pretty much sucks yea but report hackers if you found any and most importantly you will only get banned if they start giving you money drops just report to rockstar and tell them, overall buy this game and start grinding,
