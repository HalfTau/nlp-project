Singleplayer is fine, online is a cashgrab for rockstar, charging extortionate amounts for cash via shark cards. They inflate prices of ingame items to such amounts that you either need to pay for those cards or live this game, playing multiple hours per day performing various tasks to earn very little money.Its not worth it. You almost sympathize with those who hack money as they just want a fun social game and not need to be some oil baron to afford anything.
