First of all  I like GTA. No. I LOVE GTA. And I love all Rockstars games. A lot of good things, I really LOVE these games. I wont be telling about my love anymore. By the way, Im really thankful to Rockstar that we dont have to pay for DLCs, its really good thing.WARNING! If you are snotty idiot, which cannot take criticism adequately  dont read this review. All the others  youre fecking welcome.The point is  online just sock duck. Huge duck. Just to enter online takes from one to, well, something about 30 minutes ?!. No, seriously. 15 minutes of preload load screen. And 15 of load screen. If the game wont kick you, of course. Try some other time, duckhead. Thats what the game says everytime.OK, I can understand that  its really huge community, a lots of people play online everyday. Servers are overloaded. But... Is it really hard for you to fix this, Rockstar, ha? Of course, youd better make new mission, which will be disbalanced as And youll never fix this too.As well as the connection during missions  I just cant start play heist, I cant even start getting crew for mission! But youll never fix this.As I said  I love this game. As well as I am angry with you, Rockstar. Youre doing nothing for the community. And there is a result  you have no loyal player through me. Do with yourself everything your game doing with players.
