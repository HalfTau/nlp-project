Thank you Rockstar, thank you for ruining a saga, thank you for ignoring all your customers, thank you for defrauding all the people who made you great more than a decade ago. Now I know that i am not going to buy any other Rockstar game, even I know you dont care, because you have already sold to people like me more than 500 in games, and that is exactly what you have shown us, we dont care, only money does. THANK YOU.
