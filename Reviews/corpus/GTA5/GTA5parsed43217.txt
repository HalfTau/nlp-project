As if this basegame did not disgust me enough with the lack of content, now TakeTwo has decided a little while ago to take down OpenIV which is what nearly the entire modding community requires.They wanted to make more money from people buying useless stuff for their online loading screen simulator for a game that literally has nothing to do anyway, and in order to force people to play it online, they had to ruin the singleplayer aspect...Dont support this corruption, pirate the game, its not even worth the money anyway, its but an empty shell of what used to be a great series of games.
