If you want to buy the game for a singleplayer experience, Id say go for it. The story and its characters are great, the world it takes place in is beautiful and there are enough things to do for months of gameplay.The vechicles and guns feel great to use. However the characters feel a bit unresponsive at times, thats no big deal.Nearly all of the cons I have are for multiplayer mode only. Yes, its fun to mess around with friends but the flaws outshine the pros.The game is riddled with modders, the gamecrashes, making you replay heists all over again.It takes months of grinding money just to buy one vechicle, and sometimes, the developers just take your money for no reason. This hasnt happend to me, other players reported this.
