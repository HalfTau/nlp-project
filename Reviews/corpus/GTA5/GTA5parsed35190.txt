I got perma banned from this game awhile ago because why make a sandbox game and force people to either grind for weeks for money or pay stupid amounts of money to get ingame money and not much at that,  though I understand the greed of stupid people however banning mods in single player?  They dont get an income from single player that I know of they seem just to be out to ruin peoples gaming experience now which. . . wtf?  You  with the gamers you  with your income my good sirs dont be ing stupid.
