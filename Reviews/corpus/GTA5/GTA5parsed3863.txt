GTA V is probably the best free roaming game you could possibly play and one of the best games ever. It has a beautiful and large world full of life, a great story, an incredible graphic and a good multiplayer even if it is filled with cheaters. I recommend you this game absolutely if you like singleplayer or previous GTA games. A must have in your library.
