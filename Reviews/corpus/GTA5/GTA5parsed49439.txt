I still love this game it made 1 on my favorite games list now it has sunk dramatically to number 20 for now. TakeTwo you are just wrong Its like you dont even care about the players of the game and where most of your profit comes from, I want to say a majority comes from the people spending 60 on this game just so they can mod it which in return makes the game really fun offline I mean you cant even play online if the game is modded you get prompted to return to single player and now Open IV gets hit by the pile ofwich is injustice. Open IV strongly supported Rockstar in taking down and banning hackers and online modders, but why do you care TakeTwo if it doesnt apply to the greed that you so much love then why should the player base be happy.
