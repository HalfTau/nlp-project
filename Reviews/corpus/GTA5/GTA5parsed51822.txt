Modding has been made illegal. I loved modding the singleplayer. Losing one of the biggest draws to these games was the amazing mods that people could make. No more back to the future Deloreans. No more tsunami mods. No more police mods. Its so sad that all it took was one person, to ruin the modding community of this game for all. What a shame.I personally and interested in watching this game all come crashing down. I hope all the bad reviews continue, so we can make a big point.RIP GTA MODDING.If Rockstar wants to kill their own game, and alienate their fan base that they had so many people attention with, fine by me. They deserve it. Talk about falling apart.
