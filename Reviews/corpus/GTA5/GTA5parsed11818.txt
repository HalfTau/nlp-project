With an awesome singleplayer, whos quality rivals that of a hollywood movie. And an addictive multiplayer that, if a bit too grindy, still has great, expansive updates. Its pretty much a must own by now, but stay away from the Shark Cards! That is a dark path of overspending and dont let Take2 have the satisfaction of leeching more money than nessescary out of you!!!
