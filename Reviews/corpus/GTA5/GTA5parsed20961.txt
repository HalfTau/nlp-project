After all those hours, i found this game is soo boring with all those expensive  update items. As a Preorder play i am really disappointed how this turns out. BTW there are lots of hacker that would screw you around so you basically cant play happily in public sessions, and Rockstar just busy updating thosewithout controling those hackers.
