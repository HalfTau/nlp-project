       . ,     . . ,    . ,     ,     . ,  . GTA.I regret of any cent spent on this piece ofOnline is full of cheaters and imbalanced farfetched crap like that gay rocketbike.The plot strives for some addlebrainded values.Gameplay is full of glitches and AI absolute stupidity.All in all, the game is made for money cows, which SOMEONE just wanted to milk.Not more, not less. Im fully disappointed with all the GTA series.
