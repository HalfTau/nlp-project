This game is alright. I have owned this game on PC and XBOX 360 and One. I have to say this game is much better on console but having the modding aspect is a game changer. The game looks pretty good and runs good but some of the mechanics are trash. Switching weapons is absoulety dreadful and you sometimes lag out during a mission. This can be super frustrating because you will be in midddle of a heist and then you lag out and the entire thing is cancelled. This has only happened to me twice. Overall the car customization and gun modifying is a blast. So much content in this game it is almost hard to get bored unless you have no money which makes the game boring. And that comes to my next point, everything is so expensive now, I can not afford a 3,000,000 bunker just so I can play the new heist! I think this game is fun but you better have some friends or download some cool mods to have fun on this game otherwise I think you will find yourself getting frustrated. Anyways that is just my opinion of owning the game since it has came out for xbox and PC
