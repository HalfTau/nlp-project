Ok, first of all dont listen to everyone, who cares about single player mods we all really got this game for the online,and the online mode is really fun and is amazing and i dont understand why people say rockstar is only in it for the money because all the dlcs are free, and you dont need to buy sharkcards you can get the money legit like doing vip missions and races.Get this game it is really funEDITOk I was wrong about single player mods ok i am sorry but it is no reason to practicly stop rock stars income
