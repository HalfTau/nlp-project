Multiplayer is the most grindyfest youll ever come across. What makes it worse, is that GTA V would be an extremely better game if it werent such a grindyfest. Just imagine being able to progress at a reasonable pace and climb the ladder of power on GTA Online without having to waste your college money on stupid in shark cards.Whoevers idea it was to add microtransactions into GTA Online in order to progress at a sane pace, please, eat a moldyand savor the flavor. Youve ruined a potentially good experience.
