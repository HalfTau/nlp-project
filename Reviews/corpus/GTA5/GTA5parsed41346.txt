Open Im shutdown has gotten rid of many mods such as the ability to play as a cop that has not impacted multiplayer in any way shape or form. Force Hax was also shutdown, which is good for all of us in multiplayer. But now we have no modsThe game however, by itsself, is a great game. Sign the petition to revert OpenIv shutdown
