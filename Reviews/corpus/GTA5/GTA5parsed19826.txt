Im updating my review because I have since played in story mode for quite some time. The story does start off kind of slow but it builds up the more you play. Once thats done it gets really good. Cant choose a favorite between Franklin, Michael, and Trevor. They are all great characters in their own respective ways. If youre looking for online play can be very fun but it can also be frustrating. Items are way overpriced and even starting a business comes with its own ridiculous expenses. It only makes getting money to buy anything even harder. Thats not to say that there isnt the potential for friendships/alliances with other players to form from helping each other grind. Unfortunately that doesnt seem to stop s from constantly killing you just to get their precious K/D up and then either leaving or killing themselves when you want to get even...quite pathetic or from destroying your stuff for no apparent reason. On a good end note online hackers and modders have made themselves scarce.
