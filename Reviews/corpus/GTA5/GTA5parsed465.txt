Much as I love this game. It is, unfortunately a modders heaven right now. Between Rockstar being unable to keep up with the high volume of injection mods and ever changing scripts. And their unwillingness to drop the ridiculous prices of in game content and shark cards. Your garanteed to have AT LEAST..... Cant emphasise that enough. One game breaking modder In any given lobby.Now, that being said there are plenty of things you can do that keep you out of lobbies like that, and you can even search out new lobbies that have little to no people in them. Ive seen it like night and day, some lobbies are chill and have a full roster. And others are not so tame and they only have a few people in them. Just the luck of the draw. Invite only lobbies are also always a thing. Not to mention you can interupt your connection breifly through your resource monitor and have a lobby all to yourself. But, theres no telling how long that last, could be an hour or more, could be 15 min or less.All in all this game is still very worth its 60 pricetag. You can still have a blast doing whatever your heart desires, On the SP campaign and the ever challenging online aspect. So to be fair, despite all the nonsense taking place right now. Id give the game an 8.5/10. There is much that can improve, but in terms of what is already possible. It really isnt that much that needs it. I do recommend this game. I have had it since release, on my 360 way back when and still continue to play it as if it is still something fresh.
