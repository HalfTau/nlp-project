There is currently a petition going against this whole modding fiasco. Be sure to sign it!Had you asked me last year if this was a game worth purchasing, I may have said yes.Ask me again today, and Ill tell you that Rockstar and Take Two can take their shark cards, and shove them up theirI have logged over 200 hours in this game, a very large chunk of it being in LSPDFR in single player. Have I done any harm to anyone online with mods at all? Nope. Not at all. Because the wonders of RAGE Plugin Hook dont even allow you to launch it with all the modified archives. There are plenty of people out there that rework the entire game with mods, and never touch online, and now they are the ones that get punished.To all the little  that modify online and ruin the game for the rest of us, thank you for everything you have done. You have finally ruined the game for everyone that wishes to simply enjoy it. It is partly because of you that Open IV has been shut down.As for Rockstar and Take Two, take your heads out of your asses and realize there is a very large community that means no harm with modding...
