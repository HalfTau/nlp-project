Great single player game with a multiplayer aspect that is severely hampered by the ineptitude of the online team, who would rather pump out lackluster events and shark cards rather than dealing with the toxic population of hackers. It seems every decently populated server has a hacker who would effectively sht on everyone else, with their fun being at the expense of other players. Im fine with modding on an isolated server with your friends, but how consistent this is pisses me off.
