Even though it can be a fun game because I originally purchased it on console, like most GTAs, and the main reason why I wanted to get it on PC was for the mods, and for LSPDFR  but because of what Take Two has decided to do is not right and it goes against what the PC and singleplayer modding is all about.I dont get why they would take this stance when singleplayer mods have nothing to do with their online game.
