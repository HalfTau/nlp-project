When you buy it and play it fine for 3 days then you get ERRGFXD3DINIT and the game is unplayable even after doing all the fixes like underclocking, low settings, reinstalling drivers, and redownloading the game and social clubEDIT I contacted support, they told me nothing new but said they did something to my account to make it work again, I actually have no idea what happened but the game works now
