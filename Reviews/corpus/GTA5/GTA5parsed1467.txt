Alright, firstly, this is a very good game. The problem is Online, in GTA Online all of the cars or other viehcles that would be cool to own are RIDICULOUSLY expensive, intentanly forcing most players to resort to mods, or the games microtransaction, Shark Cards. The other big problem is the customer support is horrendous. There is no live custermer support, you ether have to spend hours looking through unclear articles, or wait potentaly days to get a usually automated response that is often as unclear as the support arrticles. All in all the game is fun, but while good support and a good money system cant make a bad game good, they can make a good game bad, and this is a perfect example.
