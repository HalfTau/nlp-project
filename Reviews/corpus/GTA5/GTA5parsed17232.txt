If you want a good 10 to 20 hours of single player fun, yeah this games got it. Plus quite a few collectables. Although only ever respawning at a hospital of which there are 4 iirc when you were at the other end of the map can get quite annoying.Online. Either have deep pockets or be prepared to grind for days to afford just a few things within the free DLCs they keep adding. The hiests, if you have 3 good frriends to do them with could pay out quite well, especially the bonus challenges. But since they added the CEO rubbish, everything has been designed to drain your ingame accounts so you spend more of that real life cash money.There are hackers, Ive run into a few of them. More often then not theyre just messing around with trainer stuff, like taking and locking your car while youre driving or the fan fav, dropping cash sacks on your head so you get banned for hacking money.I cant honestly say its a good game because 75 of it is online and the online side of this is just garbage. someone said just watch youtube videos of the new stuff. Couldnt agree more.A redeeming thing though, if you dont mind rollplaying, there is quite a big custom server/roll playing community which is good fun apparantly. Does require modding your game, although thats quite easy these days.
