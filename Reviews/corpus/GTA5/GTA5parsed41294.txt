ing GREEDY s I remember when they put game on sale but they bundled  piece ofshark cards with the game and then after discount price was the same..... LOL that was great move. Like who wouldnt like some overpriced ingame money right?also they sued guys which were making RPG mod for multiplayer like one in SAMP which actually help keeping that game alive after so many years. DO you know why they sued them? bcz if they would make that mod and every admin could manage how much money player could earn on the server noone would buy that piece ofsharkcraap so they just closed that project.And now this? they want to ban moding in SP too, just  You!I hope gamers will support community and not buy this game from GREEDY SHARKS so maybe they will learn somethingThank You very much!
