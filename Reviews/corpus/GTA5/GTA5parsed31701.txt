A ceace and decist notice was recently sent out to the biggest moding tool for single player use, it even dissabled online where you to use mods made with it, their excuse was that it enabled hackers online wich is very false.they are all still running rampant online using other hacking tools that are usually locked behind a paywallIt is overall a great game but i can not recomend buying a game of someone who blatently tramples over its entire communityEDIT rockstar has made a new statement regarding gta V moding and has made the condition that the mods/modding tool can not alter gta V Online good on them and ive changed my recomendation
