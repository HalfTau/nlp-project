Short version Storymode should be about the story, not getting stuck in an endless police spawning mechanic loop making for an overly time consuming chase that kills any story progression. Shouldnt need codes to evade cops at 22 completion when it took way less before that point. Note I am NOT talking about chases in missions, I mean wanted levels from bumping cops or hitting someone....Having owned and played every GTA for the Pancaked first game till now, I will say I do love the series.... BUT.... while playing solo story mode, the police get to be a load of horse crap. Very early game less than 6 completion you can opt to litterally just outrun the police, and a realistic number of spawned cop cars are on the map, which is great and lets you use your skills behind the wheel to evade them. Now, get to around 22 and every time you get a 2 star wanted level there will ALWAYS be a cop popping up less than a block infront of you regardless of where you are or where you are going or how often you hit side streets, backroads, or vross country.Frankly I find it completely crap mechanic that I had hoped wouldnt have followed from previous games Which tended to abound in the console versions especially....After an hour of said horse crap, I finally said screw it and found the built in codes to remove my wanted level after a mix of james bond and fast/furious driving skill couldnt overcome the crap mechanic... Which litterally screwed the entire experience for me.Do to this crap alone, I would rate this a 3/10. No game mechanic should force you in to a never ending loop of crap.
