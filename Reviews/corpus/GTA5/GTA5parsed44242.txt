Played the game since PS3 version was released. Bought it on PC. GTA T2 and R decided GTA Online was more important for their shark card sales so the DLCs for single player stopped. People turned to modding. Open IV, modding tools for SINGLE PLAYER ONLY were recently taken down due to a legal threat, reasoning that it is a cheating tool.I will not purchase any more R games products and as such I cannot recommend this game to anyone who supports modding and a proper single player experience.
