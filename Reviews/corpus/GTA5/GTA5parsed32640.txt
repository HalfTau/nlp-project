I recently bought this game for PC to be able to mod the single player after completing the story missons I also own this game on xbox. Now with the cease and desist being held over Open IV this makes it difficult to do the very thing I bought the game for, the online is a microtransaction hell hole with every gunrunner DLC item being over 1 millon almost requiring you to buy shark cards. The singleplayer how ever is great fun until you run out of missions to complete, which is why I wanted to mod the game. This game will be in my bad books untill the modding issue is resolved.
