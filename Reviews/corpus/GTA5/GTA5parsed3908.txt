Great game and a ton of crazy fun! Having played the entire GTA line up to V, I skipped story mode, and jumped right into online. Playing online is a blast, makes me wish I started playing GTA V sooner, but better late then never. Right now its Winter here, and the fact that we have snow covered roads in the game is awesome! Freaking love GTA V online! Cya!
