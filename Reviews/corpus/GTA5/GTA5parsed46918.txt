TakeTwo is doing their best at destroying the GTA franchise, both in multiplayer grinding online for ages unless you fork over cash for the shark cards and singleplayer Banning modding, and scrapping new singleplayer content in favor of multiplayer. I used to love GTA, but the choices TakeTwo is making have resulted in me no longer being able to recommend this game. Sad.
