Hey, 4 years veteran here. Ive bought the game in PS3, PS4, and PC.The singleplayer is fun and totally worth it if youre wondering. But I wouldnt recommend you to play the MP. The MP used to be a fun game, until Rockstar made it extremely hard for players who dont want to buy shark cards. Go look it up on Youtube, search for Gypsy or Broughy1322. Theyll explain it to you.Cheers.
