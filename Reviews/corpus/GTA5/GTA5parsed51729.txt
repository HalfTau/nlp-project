OpenIV was a Singleplayer modding tool that has been around for many years, for the singleplayer of GTA games.Saying its to combat online hacking is utter t, and goes along with the random bans that have been happening to some people.I never truly got to experience this game, and now I never will.Edit Wow, Take two, you really have ed up, this is the first game Ive ever seen on steam with an Overwhelmingly Negative rating.Edit 2 Officially fallen into Mixed Overall. This is honestly quite saddening at this point, TTI really needs to understand what theyve done.
