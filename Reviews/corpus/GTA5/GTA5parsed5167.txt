A poorly developed game made by paid adults that are easly out classed by the minecraft modding community both in content quality and in balance.  They very, very rarly change old content like balance changes, car mods or liverys, what you get at the start is what you get forever in many cases. With new content updates coming every 23months packed with issues like giant planes costing players 45mil able to be killed with 3 shots from a explosive sniper among other problems of the same caliber the list is very long, wanted to keep it shorter. Instead of nerfing things, they attempt to fix the balance problems by adding new content to counter the old. This eather doesnt work at all, makes the problem worse or ruins what ever the addition ment to balance out. So with new content coming in every 23 months this game is a ever growing garbage fire where ever the good stuff that gets add eventually gets overwhelmed by the ever growing burning pile of garbage that is this game.why do i have so many hours? i have friends that like to run mc stuff and fool round in online using a trick to get our own solo sessions. also try to find a competing game of the same genre with online like this.
