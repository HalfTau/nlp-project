Good single player campaign. But for whatever reason, online does not work for me, and never did. Whenever I start online, it takes anywhere from 10 seconds to 56 mins max, then Im suddenly kicked over to campaign. Nothing wrong with my two PCs, and nothing wrong with my connection  I do play several other online games with absolutely no problems whatsoever.Cant recommend whats not woring.
