This is a really well known game for alot of people. I would say if you can handle some of the graphic images it has then you may like this game. Not to say it tries to be realistic and you get a very big map to play on. It aint bad but I would recomend taking on some modding when you finish the game because once you finish the game there is really nothing else to do but mod the game into your own world, or to get all the achievments.
