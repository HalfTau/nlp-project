I am aware about theshow that happened  between OpenIV and Take Two but Take Two realized they ed up and are working to fix it. Im not defending them In any way. What they did was ed up but atleast they acknowledged their mistake unlike some companies.The single player is really good, if you dont know this already then youre living under a rock. You dont need my review to tell you how good he single player is, there is plenty of other reviews which do a better job at explaining it then I ever could. What I really wanted to focus on is the online.The online is extremely fun if you have some friends to play with. I would recommend skipping the online sessions until youre at level 2025 or else youre not going to have a fun time, instead, do some missions/heists until you get enough money to get some things to help you combat other players. Doing a mission or heist with a random is completely fine though, as long as they dont grief.Once you get some good gear then Id recommend trying to be a pain in thefor other companies and try to benefit yours if youre invited to one.But all in all the online part of GTA is pretty good fun. I try to make my reviews for the reason this feature was added in for do you recommend it? Not do you like it? For me, the answer is yes, yes I do recommend it.
