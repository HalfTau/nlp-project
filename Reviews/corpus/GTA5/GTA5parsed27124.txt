It really pisses me off that so many people went out of their way to post as many negative GTAV reviews after Take2s CD of OpenIV. I personally wouldnt have cared much if the reviews werent all like Rockstar has always treated us like this is the last drop or GTAV is ruined now.Literallyoff.Im the last person to defend billion dollar companies most of the time. And let me get this straight, Im against the actions taken by Take2 against OpenIV. But to go ahead and actively try to destroy the reputation of arguably one of the best games of the last decade is not at all warranted. Rockstar Games has a track record of making some of the most high quality games in the industry for the past decade and a half, with GTA IV, Red Dead Redemption, and GTA V receiving a lot of care postlaunch, to the point of giving us some amazing standalone DLC in IV Lost  Damned, IV Ballad of Gay Tony, and RDR Undead Nightmare. For Red Dead and GTA V they even gave us loads and loads of DLC for free. Rockstar also has been very friendly to the modding community, with GTA San Andreas, IV, and V being just as famous for its modding community as for its singleplayer and multiplayer content. I highly doubt Rockstar agreed with Take2s decision to CD modders to begin with, which is now basically proven with Take2s lift of said CD. Rockstar and its undeniably high quality products shouldnt be demonized for decisions their publisher made.The game is still amazing, mods or not. Even though Im definitely a cheap , I definitely think I got way more than my moneys worth out of the 120 I paid for the experience over two platforms, PS3 and PC. Take2 cant ruin my enjoyment of the game with their t. Im definitely gonna be playing a lot more.
