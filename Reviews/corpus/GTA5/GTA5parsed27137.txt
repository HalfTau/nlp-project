OpenIVModdingStop the mod ban!This is one of the main reasons many people bought this game! OpenIV was never the main thing used for online modding.It just helped with adding additional content into single player.Those online mods you tried to get rid of are hacks and they still exist without caring about the ban because they use different stuff.Allow modding and OpenIV again or you will regret it!
