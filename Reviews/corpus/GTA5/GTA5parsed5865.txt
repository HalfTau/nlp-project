Ive played over a 100 hours so i think i can make a review.I started playing GTAV on my ps3 a long time ago, i bought this game again on pc in hopes of remembering the good old times.I dont like what rockstar has done with the online game, singleplayer is fine everything perfect, on online everything is so expensive, if you wanted to buy something without stupid shark cards you would have to grind the heists for weeks, ive never bought a single shark card and i still managed to buy a ceo office, a warehouse and a bunker.Weaponized cars are the worst in this game for low level people, youre ed, thats that, a bike that flies? with rockets? and the most recent addition, a delorean? that flies? with homing missiles? too unfair, low level players can barely afford to buy a homing launcher 75,000, after level 12 people can place bounties on you, if you steal any  car from the street its 80 assured that a civie will place a bounty on you, you can survive the bounty if you play solo, but dont go to public matches because high level players will come after you, people that throw heists, they join and then they leave just to troll, modders... the pc version is plagued with them, they freeze your character, they place props on you, they explode the whole lobby with the click of a button, its stupid what they can do, ceo missions are impossible to do on public full lobbies, rockstar basicly sends the whole lobby after you and your crates/shipments, so if you are doing this missions find friends to play with.For your own sake dont buy this game, buy something else, i also got influenced by the bad reviews, people getting unfair bans stopped a while ago, just dont mod singleplayer, and if you do delete all your mod files before jumping into online.I love the old gta online, but i hate the new gta online. this stupid game cost me 399.50 MXN i wish i could get them back and buy Wolfenstein 2.
