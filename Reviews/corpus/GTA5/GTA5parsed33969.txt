Ever since the doomsday Heist, I havent been able to play whatsoever, constant crashing during the load up wanted level/rockstar logos. Ive already tried everything, verifying cache etc... This game has finally put me off, with over 1000hrs Including 360  XbOne. Before the doomsday heist update I could run this game at high settings 60FPS too.Also Rockstar haveme off with their support, problem after problem stopped me from being able to actually contact them on theirwebsite, my games been broke for months, and I cant even get help for a fix, even though Ive supported this title since day one, Ive easily spent over 100 on copies different platforms and shark cards Yeah I know they suck it was years ago lol, and yet Im stuck with this. Thanks for the help ers, Uninstalled.
