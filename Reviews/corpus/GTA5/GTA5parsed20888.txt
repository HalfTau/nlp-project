If you dont want to read a little skip to the end.I am appalled by the modding scandal. Why cut a feature from a game that only furthers the life of the game? a lot are asking, well its because shark cards. You see, you buy GTA5 and they expect you to go to online, where it is near impossible to make money enjoyably without wanting to put a bullet through your head. a game shouldnt make you want to do this btw Modding is this games bread and butter, it adds flavor to an already good single player game and prolongs the life of it. Since youre enjoying yourself in story mode you arent buying shark cards and then Rockstar isnt making money, but why does money matter to them, they made more than 2,000,000,000 off the game from an article done 3 years ago, the number is probably 46 billion.In short they removed a feature that adds life because they want more money, although theyre game is one of the most successful titles in history. Honestly why does it matter to them.
