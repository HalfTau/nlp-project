This game is the epitome of what is wrong with the gaming industry. Ive never truely liked this game and the reason for that is the online. Oh please tell me again about how I can give you more of my hard earned money. They ruined a part of what made their game worth buying on PC in the first place. Long gone are the days where games were made with love and passion. Take two and R should be ashamed.makethegamingindustrygreatagain
