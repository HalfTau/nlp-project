me personally i like it but a few things are stopping me  giving this a good rating i cant access the social club store to buy missions. i waited a good week still enjoying the game but still it wont work. it says it cant connect to the store. the other thing is that the loading screens take forever annd a half at least here in guam. ill try again after the holidays but as of right now not recommended
