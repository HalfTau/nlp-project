Since Take Twos recent cease and desist to the creators of the biggest singleplayer mod enabling engine and Rockstars blatant claim this engine enables Hacks in the Online mode which the creators of OpenIV specifically tried to prevent  their engine was supposed to only work in the SP this is not a game I will recommend anylonger.Instead of going to the modders, asking them to work with them in the fight against hackers in Online, they chose to basically destroy somewhere between half and three quarters of the modding scene for GTAV. This cannot stand. Until TakeTwo/Rockstar do something about it, something proconsumer, this game will not be recommended by me.
