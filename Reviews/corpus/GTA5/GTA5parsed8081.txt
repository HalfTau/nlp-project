Definitely the BEST new generation GTA game ever. Lots of things to do. Its like you have bought a hundred games in one purchase.Sure it is not perfect, but its really hella fun to play, especially with friends online.Id give it an 8/10 ratingI would give it a 9 if only they had better servers and do something about rampant chinese modders/hackers.
