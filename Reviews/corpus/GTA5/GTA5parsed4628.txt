Gta is the best game ever. Ive played this game for almost 5 years now. I think its boring now but the first 3 years was amazing. Gta ruined the game by giving us too many updates and not to many performence updates. You cant really enjoy this game on console because it laggs when you are in the city. But overall its good.
