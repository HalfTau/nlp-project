Ok, I have a lot to say about this game, so I hope people read it.Grand Theft Auto V is an amazing game, and one of my favorite games ever. But if you want to buy this game, just buy it on a console for these reasonsThe gameplay of story mode is incredible. The story is great, and the characters are all different and interesting, but once you beat story mode then your going to want to play online. But you cant play online when purchased on Steam.I dont really know how this is even possible, but for some reason the graphics are kind of terrible. The textures themselves are fine, but the outlining of objects are terrible, and dont look at all like they do on console, or on the Steam images.Sorry to diss on Steam like this, because Steam is incredible, and I dont know what Id do without it And this is the only scenario that I can think of where the game on Steam Isnt as good as on console or other PC methods. But you really should just buy this on console, or purchase a PC disk.Sorry for the length of this review, but I hope it was helpful!
