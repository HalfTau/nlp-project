I liked this game a lot. Best in the series as far as features and story. But I cannot support the decision by take two and rockstar to threaten legal action against harmless modders. This is obviously an attempt to suppress creativity so that they can sell more microtransactions in the most stagnant best selling game of all time. Screw you rockstar, up yours take two.
