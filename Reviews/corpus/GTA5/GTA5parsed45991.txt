Good game but either Rockstar or 2K are .Broken online play for 1 year, with hackers and loading screens all over the place.They have been hard at work trying to stop any and all modding on the game. The modders work for free, bringing good additional content to the game R wont do DLC because they make more money from milking the broken online
