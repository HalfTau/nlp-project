t after t...Online game is not enjoyable at all unless you buy Sharkcards, its so grindy as , spent aton of hours just to get enough money to buy a single car and be poor again... spend a lot more hours grinding for money to buy an office, or a bunker.That added to the fact that you NEED more people, not just you to do the high reward jobs and pray that the team mates you get paired with randomly arent s that kill eachover mid mission, or being lucky enough to not get killed and your money stolen at the end of the mission before you could save your money in the bank.The only part of the entire game I liked was the survival missions, but eventually you get bored of grinding it.If you go Single player however can be very enjoyable on your own, way better if you have mods Which Obviously Take Two hates and were banned for a while. But I already had to start the campaing over for the 3rd time because the save files somehow disappeared.It might be little things... but they are a lot of little things added up, I just dont give a  anymore.
