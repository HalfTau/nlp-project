terrible game.100 terrible game, there is so much wrong with it, but im not going to write every detail.First thing wrong is the servers/sessions. They have terrible connection, always seem to boot people and send you back into single player mode. Everyone has issues with getting kicked from sessions and lagging out for no apparent reason. and from mine, and friends experience, if 1 person is lagging in the lobby, everybody lags, it doesnt even have to be the host.secondly, there are far too many modders not being banned. everyone seems to get away with modding and playing the game unfairly.thirdly, the heists engineering is terrible. it all starts in the lobby, where people join and leave constantly, then you get into game, and someone either leaves or dies, for 1, you shouldnt have to wait 25 minutes to start up a heist, and when you get in game if someone leave or dies that isnt critical to the heist, the heist should continue example. 2 people need to steal a cop car, one leaves, the other should be able to carry on solo. and at the bottom line, if people leave heist they should be either banned or placed on a very punishing timer until they can do heists or missions again.all in all this game is a joke, rockstar have no priority maintaining the game or fixing the issues. the game would be great if people didnt leave and if the heists didnt quit over deaths or players leaving. and lastly fix the sessions and servers so i dont get thrown into single player all the time.tamaug gives 3/10.
