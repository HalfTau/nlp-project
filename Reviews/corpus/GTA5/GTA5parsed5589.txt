its pretty bad i used to play it on xbox i played about 200 hours on xbox and still got no where i had a biker gang and ceo office only because i bought shark cards keep in mind shark cards are so goddamn expensive its really not worth it tbh its kinda like EA what they are doing because it takes hundreds of hours to do it legitimately and its more of just grinding than fun i would say as last words of this review that its and good game and game mechanics but online just ruins it in some forms like buying shark cards so sort it out ffs.
