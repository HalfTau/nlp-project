The most contentfilled game I have ever played. But since they make most of their money off the ongoing Online component, Im going to judge them on that.EASILY the most hackerriddled online game I have ever seen. People feel so safe hacking in this game that they openly talk about their hacks on ingame public chat for everyone to see. No shame, no bans. Id say about 20 of the user base are openly hacking at any given time. Totally unforgivable, Take Two. This is a multibillion dollar game and it has absolutely failed to provide any meaningful anticheat infrastructure.
