I USED TO LOVE THIS GAME!!! Bought it twice! For console and PC. Put in 200 hours in the Online mode. BUT THEN ONE DAY I LOGGED IN FOR NEW CONTENT AND I HAD 0 IN MY GTA ACCOUNT BECAUSE THEY FOUND MODDED MONEY IN MY ACCOUNT. THATS MESSED UP. I GRINDED AND GRINDED AND AM BEING PUNISHED FOR SOMETTHING I COULDNT CONTROL???? Nope. Not playing this anymore untill I see they come to their senses IF THEY EVER DO. RANTOVER
