Not recommended for nonexistent multiplayer moderation, freemiumstyle multiplayer mode on a fullpriced game, and their recent legal action against a 10year old modding tool, coupled with a bald faced in their official statement on the matter.This is a shame, because this game has brilliant singleplayer and some of the best production values Ive ever seen in a game. If it werent for the crass monetization of multiplayer, the truancy of admins to put a stop to the online cheaters and the blaming of OpenIV for said cheaters, this game at least single player would be one of the best money can buy and would come highly recommended. Take2 and Rockstar need to have repercussions for their behavior. Since they already have my money twice for this game, the only thing I can do is hurt their rating in retaliation. SAD!Take2 should know better, especially since their other devs, like Firaxis, are very mod friendly.
