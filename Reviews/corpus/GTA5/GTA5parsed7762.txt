Okay this is more of a  at rockstar for Banning me perminantly, not that they will notice it...I only cheated online once, and that was for money, didnt go out of my way to make anyone elses game difficult.After a year that I did it, they banned me for 30 days, thought that was fair enough.Then they let me online again, although I had to start again, but at this point I was happy too, after you reach level 100 your pretty much set for what you can do in the game.But then they decided to perminantly ban me even though all I did was play for 5 mins and get killed by a few players.The game is good, but the fact they perminantly banned me without reason this time is t. I still forked out the full price for this game when it came over to pc, yet there more than happy to take 750 hours of my time away because they think I might do it again,  you rockstar, you used to be one of the bros.I only recommend this game if you dont hack at all, they still ban you for something you did over a year ago.
