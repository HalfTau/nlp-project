GTA V is really fun.The publishers are serious s, but that doesnt stop the single player from being really good on its own, or the multiplayer from being fun, especially with friends.Most of the long time players either worked their asses off or had modders drop millions of dollars on them to buy everything on PC. You wont ever have the purchasing power youd expect from playing legit, even once you own all the money making enterprises, but ing around in a 30,000 junker with friends is still fun and plenty of vets will let you use theirThe 100 shark card will buy you 8 million in in game cash, and that amount of money will only get you 24 top end vehicles or maybe 2 cars and an office/penthouse. This is a tiny amlunt of content really The missions generally pay out 25k so you will be forced to grind for a long while if you want to buy anything nice. Better options open up eventually, but things like heists and import/export operations have a decent risk of failure resulting in a lot of lost time and money.I received a lot of modded money previously, so I spend most of my time in game helping friends run missions, playing golf, and flying my new rocket bike around.There are a lot of reasons not to buy this game, but lack of fun isnt really one of them, at least until you decide to grind out a few million dollars online for a luxury car or one of those fancy rocket bikes.Its a weird situation, but the bottom line is that there are a  ton of major, red flag, turn this car around, level problems, but youll likely have gotten 60 worth of fun from the game long before they become particularly relevant.Keep in mind though, by paying for this product, you are enabling some really greedy business practices from the publishers, who are squeezing the online mode for every penny, and more recently, taking steps to kill single player modding outright.
