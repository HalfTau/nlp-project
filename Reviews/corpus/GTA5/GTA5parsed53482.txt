Dear Rockstar/Take2,The modding community is one of the single greatest advantages to using a pc for gaming. You get access to countless user mods that can enhance gameplay to the point that it feels like an enetirely new game. People work countless hours to provide players with free access to their personal creations created within your gameing worlds.98 of these mods cant even be loaded into multiplayer due to restrictions in the modding tools. This negates any fear you guys could have with hackers abusing the modding system. You should encourage your player base to develope inspirational ideas and game mechanics. Maybe you could even build some of the game updates with custom player content as the main inspiration.TLDRYour new stance against modding is unnacceptable and due to that new stance I can no longer reccommend that any of my friends purchase or play this game.And if any of your updates actively prevent me from utilizing the mods with the game that I purchased from you then i may resort to undesired methods of obtaining copies of your game files.bittorrentJuly 4th EditRecently there was news of rockstar  speaking to TakeTwo about its stance against modding. TakeTwo has contacted OpenIV the main modding tool in an attempt to work out a sollution that doesnt involve destroying the entire modding community. Downloads for OpenIV have been reactivated. i changed my review positive
