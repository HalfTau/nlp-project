Uninstalled this Game after 619h ingame time for the following reasons OpenIV Prohibition Insanely high prices for MP content, especially for someone who only plays MP casually Passive opposition against the creative/modding community No Singleplayer Updates/Support pretty much since day one The greedy fcks from TakeTwo should rename their company to TakeAll or Smaugs Cave
