The amount of effort that went into QA balance, bug fixes, netcode, server management, etc is close to nil. DCs, exploits, poor server connections, netcode bugs that result in crashes, getting stuck in black or white screens during load and having to force restart the game, hackers, glitch exploiters, expensive weapons and vehicles that exist only to grief other players to frustrate people into buying Shark Cards, terrible transaction logic when you purchase A for your car, and then purchase B, you have to rebuy A to equip it and no discount/refund is given for the transactions, I can honestly go on and on and on about how poorly GTAO was designed and implemented. When the game was designed to prioritize microtransactions over everything else, you will not have fun with it. I am writing this as I quit trying to play GTAO after 10 Program has stopped responding crashes, Lost connection to servers, kicking to GTA 5 error messages, and game loading to white/black and nothing else while trying to play with my girlfriend. For the 3 or 4 hours I played, I think 1 hour of that was actual game time. If I were to ignore all these issues, would I recommend the game? Yes. But they happen in every single gaming session today being especially worse, that there are absolutely no excuses for the devs.tldr if you can deal with terrible quality for a finished product, go ahead and buy it. By no means is it an unfun game, just very frustrating when the devs can give lessabout common QA issues, and would rather make features that promote Shark Card sales.
