With over 500 hours on PC with this title, not including hundreds more since the day it launched on console, I would argue this is not a hastily reached conclusion. I have put up with many DLCs which didnt really add much, and  net code, and grindy gameplay, and cash wipes when warrented over many years of playing Grand Theft Auto Online. With Smugglers Run, another cash wipe was placed into affect on all hacked money, which again, doesnt bother me. Easy come, easy go, eh? The problem I have with this game and developer now, is that they wiped millions of in game gta that I earned over many, many hours ofgameplay. I submitted a ticket,to which R repliedThank you for contacting Rockstar Support.Your shared bank account in GTA Online was adjusted to remove illegitimately gained ingame money. For more information please seeAs you may notice, this does not address my concern with anything more than the standard response a bot could have generated out of my message to R.Nevertheless, I created a second ticket, assured that my persistence would be acknowledged, and this wrong righted. Alas, I was replied to withHello supersimpsonman,We checked your account and confirmed that it was appropriately adjusted to remove modded funds and that no unspent Shark Card purchases were adjusted. Please note that further violations of our EULA or Code of Conduct may result in temporary or permanent bans from GTA Online. You can find more information atBest regards,Raymond R.Rockstar SupportThis was not right. Someone did actually read my message. AND they mulled over the choice words I had to say,I recently submitted a ticket about this same problem. ROCKSTAR HAS TAKEN LEGITIMATE MONEY FROM ME. Just because I didnt purchase it ia shark card, doesnt mean you should wipe all myI worked hard over months to earn. This is ridiculous. Dont simply close this ticket telling me about cash wipes. I know about cash wipes. My account was recently corrected by 3,370,156. This was hard earned, legitimate money, and I want it back!ALSO YOURSITE WONT LET ME SUBMIT MYTICKETS UNDER THE PLATFORM PC, EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE I HAVE ATTACHED THE REQUIRED FILES. THE SAME EXACT FILES I HAVE USED FOR EVERY ONE OF THE MANY CASES I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CREATE BECAUSE OF GTA ONLINECan you blame me for using language that may garner actual human response? I sure dont.No matter, Ill resply in a formal tone so as to not anger these sensitive tech support workers I thought. So once more, I submitted a ticket and once moreSo no, I do not recommend purchasing this game, nor will I personally purchase any more of Rs games.
