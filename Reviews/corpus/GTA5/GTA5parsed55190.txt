Loved modding this game, its what has always attracted me to the GTA games on PC.  The official online has always been a terrible money grab, so after completeing the story I turned to mods to keep the game interesting. The only thing I enjoy in this game is adding new mods/combining them there are so many fun things to do. Why  with the mod community when they are what adds longevity and interesting new mechanics to the game? Shutting down the people who are so enthusiastic about your game that they create new parts for YOUR game for ZERO pay is ing stupid. You should bethe mod creators with toolkits and maybe even a place to host the mods. It would fill the community with gratitude for helping them play the game they want to play it, and extend the lifespan of the game for years to come.
