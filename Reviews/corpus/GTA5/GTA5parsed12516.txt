I loved the game when it came out, now its just more of a grindfest than a Korean MMO... The multiplayer is nothing but pay to win at this point, you cannot have a lot of fun without spending millions upon millions of in game dollars. The multiplayers just a microtransaction vessel and that alone is really saddening. I can only recommend it for the singleplayer, for singleplayer mods and for playing online with friends, but apart from that I wouldnt buy it for the full price.
