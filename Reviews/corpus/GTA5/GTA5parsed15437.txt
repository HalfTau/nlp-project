stuck loading half the time you come out of a mission or join a new session,  hackers EVERYWHERE, like really, every single online session has some modder killing everyone insight with impunity,  and when you get stuck with a griefing hacker it spawns you 20feet away from where you died so they can just farm you and theres nothing you can do at allyou cant even bringup the menu to join a new seesion when youre dead so you litterally have to forceclose the game if you want it to endwhen your phone ringswhich is every 30 seconds thanks to the spamming npcs it actaully interupts you mid combat so it gets you killedEverything cost millions and it takes days of grinding to make that much money ingame, a poorly veiled mechanic to try and force you to buy ingame money with RL money.  and from the other reviews here it seems like rockstar is a fan of taking all your money for seemingly no reason even if you paid RL money for it.UNREAL what a giant pile of garbage the online version of this game is.  there so many things that are blantenly bad design that any self respecting company would have patched out and fixed within months of release yet this game has been out for years and its still in the game.  Its clear they have ZERO intention to keep their online game in a playable state.
