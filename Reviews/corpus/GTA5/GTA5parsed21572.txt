After 160 hours i can say this.The story is really fun but after you complete it the hype just isnt there after it. But thankfuly theres online.Online is really fun with friends but with the prices of everything it keeps me from gaining the full experience. About online i  can only say thisBe careful because to play online you really need to invest a lot of time to have something nice. Of course the grind isnt the only thing it offers. The online world offers endless minigames and fun so the online isnt completely ruined by rockstar. The prices have its reason too because then rockstar is able to make huge dlcs which are free too!All in all i strongly recommend this game. Its fun, you can  around all you want it wont get boring quickly with what it has to offer.
