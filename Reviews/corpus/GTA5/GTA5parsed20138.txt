GTA V is a great game with a fantastic single player. It took me around 90 hours of playtime to beat the single player and I enjoyed the entire thing. Multiplayer can be fun with friends, but get boring and old fast. All multiplayer is is constand RDM with other players and grinding missions for money and levels.TLDR buy it for the single player.
