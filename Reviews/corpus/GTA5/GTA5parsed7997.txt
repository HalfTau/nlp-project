i have a couple hours logged into this game, so I think I can review it.I bought the pc version two years after its release and everything was fine and dandy.then the import/export update came and it totally ed up some code in the game because I was getting terrible lag spikes and fps drops out of nowhere, my pc was way beyond the recommended requirements so I filed a ticket and nothing happened.I uninstalled the game and after a year or so I installed it back again to my surprise that it was running like butter again and have a some new expansions in the online department, which was good.I will always love the single player campaign of this game, its one of my favorites.but the online is a massive cluster, theres a whole lot of hackers, spawn campers, newbies that will  up your grind for two grand.You will only have fun if youre playing with friends so the grind isnt terrible.but overall, good game
