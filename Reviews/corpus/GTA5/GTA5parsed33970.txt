I love GTA and Rockstars but TakeTwo has taken it too far. And the atrocious statement by Strauss Zelnick made me boil. Please do not purchase ingame credits and microtransactions without ceiling! We have to stop this practice! To think that Ive bought this game on 2 different platforms  Im thinking to even not buying RDR2 seriously...And sign this petition
