I would love to have played this game but I couldnt, despite my computer meeting the system requirements. I also had issues with the social club system, preventing me from starting the game altogether. They refused to give me a refund or even a trade because I had the application open for over 7 hours without even playing it. Dont waste your time buying it unless you are sure your computer can handle it. Tickets are just a waste of time.
