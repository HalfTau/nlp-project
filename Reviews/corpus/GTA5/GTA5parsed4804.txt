Now to start things off i got this game on sale for 35 and the story mode is amazing, the problem is the online mode. There are a lot of modders and people basically ruin your day, example i was doing a contract work for myself and this one  was chasing me and killing me not even getting the cargo and when you tell them why you did that they respond with its gta what do you expect, another thing is everything is way to expensive for new comers and you have to grind a lot to just get aapartment, and there are a lot of people begging for money dont be that person, and the amounts you get for the shark cards are just a joke 8mill for 100 when a since car can be worht around 3mill. but the new criminal enterprise that they released is worth it, you get a lot of this for 50 that it will take another player hours or even days to get.
