I get banning mods from all the trolls spamming explosions in multiplayer, but Ill never get to be a pigeon or have a turbine in the middle of the highway anymore in SINGLEPLAYER. Thanks guys. Guess Ill grind the 5 heists Ive done several times already, still unable to afford ONE of the new vehicles, and would rather not pay 100 IRL for 8.5 million The equivalent of maybe getting 4 of the new vehicles?.
