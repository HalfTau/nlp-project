Unlike the other s going on a review page and not actually talking about the game and gameplay itsself and ing about how their precious mods were removed I am here to say this game is amazing, singleplayer a little better than online, but online in my expirience and Im sure with others hasnt reallyanyone off, I havent got banned and enjoy playing with other people who dont bother me. Quite the game indeed
