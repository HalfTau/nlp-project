Let me explain. TakeTwo Interactive the parent company of Rockstar has issued a cease and desist to the people behind Open IV, a mod and very much a platform which is needed to run more than 50 of all SP mods. They claim that Open IV which affects ONLY SINGLEPLAYER enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players in MP. This gives the idea that hacks and mods in MP are a recent thing. But they are not, hackers have been rampaging and continue to rampage in GTA Online through out its life. So instead of dealing with already existing hacks and thus improve the MP experience, they kill off the largest SINGLEPLAYER mod and mod platform.So it is clear that they do not care for the actual MP experience which is itself very grindy and pushy to microtransactions, but instead want to limit players options and focus them to GTA Online. They also state by issuing the cease and desist that modding SINGLEPLAYER is now illegal or if you want to do so, you may risk having to fight an incredibly expensive court battle.So no, I do not recommend buying this title at full price, even possibly at a discount, they seem to be very much anticonsumer and want to strongarm the players as they see fit.
