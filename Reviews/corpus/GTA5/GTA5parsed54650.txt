It is with a heavy heart that I have to give a negative review to this game, as I did have fun with it for a while. But if trying to ban mods by force is Take Twos idea of managing and enforcing their scummy business practices, then so be it. Stay far away, as this game is now a husk of what it once was  microtransactions, poorly managed online, and now this.
