...Ah,  it. Thats really all you need to know. I mean, come on. Its GTA V, you already know what it is. Dont need me to tell you.The single player is one of the best action movies Ive seen in a long time, and it isnt even an action movie. It perfectly blends silliness and seriousness much like Saints Row 2 did, thanks to its fantastic characters, writing, setpieces and world. Good god, GTA Vs San Andreas one of the greatest open worlds Ive ever seen. I cant begin to imagine how much work went into it. And its still a fantastic game with so, so much fun stuff to do in freeroam alone.But the multiplayer does not play kindly to those who dont pay. Everything is a grinding hell, unless youre willing to pay up to the Stars bank account. Theres horror stories of innocent people getting barred out by Rockstar and hackers roaming free and causing trouble for normal people, who then get locked out by Rockstar. Hell, theres the time they even locked out the singleplayer modders who they used to embrace. GTA Online isnt GTA Online it isnt about a bunch of freeroaming criminals jacking cars and causing mayhem, its about who can shoot the most rockets at each other or use instakill pay2win lasers.Actually, scratch that. GTA Online is not a game. GTA Online is a tool to make money.
