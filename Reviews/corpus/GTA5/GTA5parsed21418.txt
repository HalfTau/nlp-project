The game is fun, but has its short comings.1 The cars only go up to 120140 MPH, so your money spent on them is near worthless, also making the super cars feel sluggish and boring.2 Everything costs a lot of money, and so youll either a grind, b hack/glitch, or c buy the currency at the rediculous price of around 33K to 80K per dollar.3 The story is the same since it came out. No SP DLC has been launched to speak of and if you mod, you risk a ban.4 There is no point in modding any car in the story except the characters normal car b/c you will likely lose the car and if youre lucky you can pay 250 to get it back.5 Racing is fun, the hackers arent.6 Having started late in the games life means youll likely be missing out on the low level job parties to grind on your way to grinding heists for that new Lambo.7 Nothing is officially licensed, and while it doesnt change the gameplay, it would be cool to drive that new Ford GT or a 69 Camaro. Especially if you could buy those cars for their real retail price so I wouldnt have to spend 1.75M on the Ford GT I previously mentioned
