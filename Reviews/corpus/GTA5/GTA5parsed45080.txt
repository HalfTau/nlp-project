GTA V is not a terrible game. The singleplayer is fun and the characters are great. Where the game does fall flat is its online aspect.The online is horribly watered down and you can do pretty much nothing that makes GTA fun without grinding or stuffing more money into Rockstar and TakeTwos pockets. If I purchase a game for 40 I do not then expect to have to pay additional money just to enjoy the multiplayer aspect read the only thing you can really do after finishing the singleplayer completely the way it should be enjoyed. Sure, you could do some heists with friends but there are only 5 of the damn things.But wait! I hear you say. Surely you could just download some of those famous GTAV singleplayer mods Ive been hearing about to add more fun to the poststory singleplayer? Well, you could until TakeTwo decided that they didnt like mods and then took out OpenIV, one of the things that made most modding possible.This isnt Rockstars fault I hope. Its TakeTwos. TakeTwo are a special kind of scum and they do not deserve to pocket any of the money you pay to buy this game, so dont let them.
