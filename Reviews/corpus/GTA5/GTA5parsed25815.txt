I recently got banned for no apparent reason other than my affiliation with modders online. Im not a modder. Please believe me. Im giving this game a negative review. My ban also came stripped me of everything I had procured and bought. Now I have to start anew. Perhaps it was because everything I had bought was bought with hacked money, but that doesnt warrant a ban for being associated with modders. Fck everyone working at R. Fck them.Thanks for reading my plight it may not mean much, but whatever.
