Rockstar is just a bunch of ing idiots. For those who would like to buy this and transfer a character from there console you cannot, it was discontinued on March 6th. So basically your gta character you grinded on for years on console means nothing if you buy it on PC. If you have never played GTA 5 yet then I guess it wouldnt be a bad idea to buy it but I still give it a would not recommend.
