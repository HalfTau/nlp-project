things that i hated when the game just came out  Year long loading time cheaters / hackers over priced Online things because of SharkCard Pay2Win systemThey didnt change a thing now.just the fact that they want to destory our modding tools is too much for me.I will still try to play this game but i wont buy any new game from R or T2
