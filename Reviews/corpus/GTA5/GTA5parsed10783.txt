It is a good game. At least in my opinion. But there is a major problem in GTA Online expenses. All the new stuff that rolls out in the updates are very expensive. You need to pay a lot of IRL money or grind out missions for a long time in order to buy this stuff. Whenever I play it, I tend to stick to story mode for that reason, and also that my own computer has horrible internet connection.
