I cannot recommend this game anymore. I have never seen a dev/publisher so anti modding and consumer. Although the single player is decent, the online mode is terrible. The online is designed to try and milk every dollar they can from you, while forcing shark card microtransactions down your throat. To top it off, mods have been declared ILLEGAL not only online, but in SINGLEPLAYER. So just so you are sure, IN SINGLEPLAYER IT IS ILLEGAL TO MOD YOUR GAME. Rockstar and Take Two have turned into disgusting greedy companies. VERY ANTI CONSUMER. MAKEMODDINGGREATAGAIN
