SingleplayerGreat story.Lots of activitiesModding files.Great port.100 freedom unless they wanna screw up modding again.MultiplayerAbsolute cancer.Full of hackers.Too much grinding unless you wanna pay hundreds of dollars to get ingame cash.Ridiculous DLC content. ex Flying cars with rockets.Final words,Singleplayer is 100 worth it. Multiplayer is cancerous with Russian hackers constantly blowing you up.Game has pay to win unless you wanna grind missions for 1000 hours. I do enjoy the frequent updates but someof the new updates are kinda dumb.
