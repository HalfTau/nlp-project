Recent actions cannot undo the damage done. Time will tell if the reaction to community outrage is sincere. I doubt it this company has probably shown its true colors and this is just damage control.Actions taken in haste to apease public opinion cannot be trusted.Well see in future months/years and future releases what the real outcome will be.
