Gta V... so lets give this game a review.First things first the singleplayer is facking great story line is nice and in the Sp they put some time.Its just amazing they did well on every part of it the heist are facking genuis.if you want a good Sp game buy this for sure i give this part a thumb up !!But... Gta V has a multiplayer mode to.First im that guy that likes to grind hisof and i like it that way but damn if you start from zero experience and no knowledge from this game you will have to grind longgg for you get something.the prices are ridiculous wtf were they thinking 5mil for this 3 for that rockstar pls its hard to get a good mil for starters.Butt this revieuw got some tips try to find somebody that has an office and play a lot whit him till you get a mil nothing else just go straight for that office and you will see that money will come fast.MC busniss is great if you are that guy that want to get not the office first i personnaly bought the MC first and i got some decent money out of it bought coke methaphine and docs my personal tip go straight for coke the others are nice but not so fast money gainers.OFFICE is lovely you get fackup fast money from it warehouse and vechicles money is not going to be an issue anymoreBunker its nice if you want to resupply it every goddamn time if you are lucky you will have some good project after eachother and they are goddamn nice and the MOC is nice if your duo playingHANGAR missions are nice but the delivery missions are t some times but worth it if you only get 1 kind of stockFACILITY trade prices are the only thing that i can say and for duo heisting is it nice other wise...Gta is a facking women that you need to maintain every facking min of the day
