Man I really have a mixed review for this one. When it works fine, the online I dont play the offline is extremely fun with friends. On the other hand, loading screens take absolutely ing forever if they do load at all. The loading times can vary from about 2 minutes, which can be seen when youre switching between adversary events, and a ing eternity 15 minutes, which can be found while loading into the game. I play this game off a Samsung Evo 500gb SSD, a 1060 and an i5 6500, so this shouldnt really take that long. Another problem is modders/hackers. In the online version, there used to be at least 35 modders in every game, bombing the absoluteout of everyone. Now, we only occasionaly come across one, but when we do, it is so blatant that I would have bet my genitals on it. I really love this game and see so much potential weighed down by loading times and modders in the online.Overall, 6/10
