I had 4.5 mil before the new update and was saving it to hopefully get coolfrom the new update, logged onto online and saw that they had taken 5.1 mil for no reason. I now have 0 as well as no desire to play the game anymore. Its a good game that they ruined with making everything ludicrously expensive, requiring either hundreds of real dollars or hundreds of hours of grinding to fully experience the online play. The online play had been ruined by an incredible amount of modders and Rockstars solution to this was just taking everyones money. While there has been much less modders, the online has still been destroyed by endless updates with nothing but things to drain your money on so that you can try to pull out a little bit more gameplay out of a dying game. The past few updates have been nothing except spending millions buying a building and then doing the same mission over and over again, going somewhere far away, getting something, and going back. the only online update that actually let you make money in a reasonable amount of time is the car stealer update and those missions are some of the most boring in the game. To anyone considering getting this game for the online I would strongly advise you against it, used to be a good game that they have slowly been making more terrible and i can only forsee it getting even worse in the future. The online for this game is not at all worth the 60 price tag plus the money you will have to spend buying overpriced shark cards.edit i wrote this when i was very salty but the game is actually decent
