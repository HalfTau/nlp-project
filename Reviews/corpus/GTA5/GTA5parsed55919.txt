I bought this game 3 ing times. Thats 180 Dollars for a ing game.I buy it for the PC simply because of modding. I only played Single player, never touched online play.And now they suddenly remove moding from the game, after a long series of unethical events in patches desigend none other than to break mods.The only reason they are breaking mods, confirmed by the CEO of the parent company himself, is because they want people to spend more money on micro tranasctions.Utterly disgusted by this business practice. And I will be attempting to refund this game on the grounds of a bait and switch.
