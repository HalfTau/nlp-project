Ah... GTA V...Lets start by saying that its a great game, awesome story and fun open world gameplay, yeah?Online is full of modders but if you can get in a Private Match with your friends its great.Now whats really important in this review... Heh...MODDING!Take Two Interactive has come out and essentially stopped all modding. Apparently its to stop online modding, and I can get that but it also stops single player modding, which is stupid.All in all, get it for what it is, now what it can be.
