I dont suport devs or publishers who are anti consumer and who do nothing but bully people. Take 2 knows they have no legal right to stop the devs of Open VI but they know that the people from Open VI dont have te resourses to fight a prolonged legal battle so they threaten legal action even though they have no legal grounds to bully people. They are bullying Open VI because they know they have no legal leg to stand on and thats disgracefull and i refuse to support a company who dose such things. Untill they apoligize and reverse their actions i will never buy or promote another one of their titles
