I had a great time playing this game over the course of over two years, alone, with friends, or with random people on the internet. But for the last year, the fun has slowly been sucked out of the multiplayer, through updates giving players gamebreakingly powerful weapons and vehicles, that cost tens of millions of ingame dollars.It used to be pheasable to grind missions to make enough money to get most stuff from the updates without it getting too monotonous. The game has since been turned into a tool for psychologically manipulating you into buying SharkCards.The Multiplayer is dead. But I got hundreds of hours out of it during its lifespan. It was a unique experience, and judging by 2ks new business model as a result of this game, it will probably remain a unique experience for a long time.The Singleplayer is still fun though, as it was on day one. Its a hell of a memorable experience, which is worth the price by itself if you get the game on sale.If youre planning to play the Multiplayer for more than a few hours though, dont bother.
