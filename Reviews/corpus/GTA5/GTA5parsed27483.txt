The community needs to stop whining about mod support. Modding for SP is fine except its too easy to change over into MP in GTA V. Dont listen to the haters this is still an amazing game without the mods. I have been playing the same GTA online character since release and still have a blast in both SP and MP. People just need to chill and play a game the way it was meant to be.
