Honestly the game can be fun every now and again but with the amount of griefers, modders/hackers, and downright jerks who play this game I would say dont buy it. In addition, there are a lot of problems with the game including getting your money removed for reasons that make no sence, more recently the issue of the free albany hermes, and many more things that will likely never be fixed. Also, almost all the cool stuff is really expensive and you either have to grind jobs and stuff for hours, days, and sometimes weeks to get enough to buy them and the payouts for the things your doing arent really worth it half the time because of how long it took to get it. Alternatively you could waste your real money buying shark cards unless you have a bonus because if you want to get most of the stuff you will need a couple million dollars and thats a lot of real money that you would be spending on shark cards. All in all if you really want this game then buy it but if your thinking about whether to buy this game or not I would say save your money for something else.
