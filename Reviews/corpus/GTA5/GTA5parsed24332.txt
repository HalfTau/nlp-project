This review isnt about the mods thing.So i finally bought this game. I insta regret it. Its loading too much and it takes too long. And the community is I mean in my first hour of online gameplay i was killed 2 times by a high level dude. The game has some phisics problem and the desynch between players is too high. And if you want to do a multi mission even like a heist for example with a stranger, you will be lucky if you get to finish all the stages cause you have to be ,,found and reinvinted in another session.Just think when you want to buy it, ok? Its a sandbox than doesnt let you do almost anything, with a bad community and time wasted in loading. And i didnt get to tell you about the money grind and ingame payments. Yes. You bought a 3060 euros game and the last thing you would like to do is pay 10 for shark cards.
