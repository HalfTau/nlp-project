On behalf of the OpenIV team,  you.On behalf of my online ingame wallet after every new DLC,  you.You wont support the modders and after every new DLC, every tiny little thing we have to pay 5 times the Luxury APT, to force people to play long hours or just buy the shark cards? Yeah, thanks!Update They still add new stuff for TONS of ingame money. A new car, worse than a super car, cost us twice the price. If I log into a public server, I hope theres a nice hacker ther to give me money, since the game ASK for it! /
