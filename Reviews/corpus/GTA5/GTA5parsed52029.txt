UPDATE TakeTwo retracted the Cease and Desist order towards OpenIV in light of the backlash. OpenIV is no longer discontinued and a new build was published.A new statement can now be read here...TakeTwo reserves the right to object to any thirdparty project, or to revise, revoke and/or withdraw this statement at any time in their own discretion.Said granting of singleplayer, noncommercial mods of third parties can be revoked to the discretion of TakeTwo interactive. If they see fit, they will take projects down if its not to their liking.I will still keep the review at negative because of how this business practice came to be to begin with, and how im generally displeased with the state of the game. I put several hundred hours into both the singleplayer and Online, and Im generally underwhelmed with the game in relation to titles such as 4 or San Andreas in regards to narrative, design choices, business tactics and lack of good content and substance in the game. I may write a cohesive review about the game at some point. The narrative is a copypaste of the 1995 movie Heat directed by Michael Mann, the gunplay is garbage, general sense of immersion is weak, Online is a cesspool full of hackers and a grindy, uninteresting style of play. A notable, albeit old video talking over some of the choices and details that were completely trashedGTA V was riding mainly on the popularity and initial hype it has received, it was touted to be the most revolutionary and groundbreaking title to be published in years, and now the initial charm wore off. It rode on marketing and hype, but objectively looking back, its a title thats underwhelming in a lot of ways.OriginalRockstar and TakeTwo Interactive have shown that they have no regard for the communities that maintain the viability of their games by filing a Cease and Desist order to modding tool authors of OpenIV, a popular tool for modifying assets of the game.Do not support business practice that does not allow you to play your game the way you want, and do not support companies that concern themselves about profit more than making a good game for their fans to enjoy.
