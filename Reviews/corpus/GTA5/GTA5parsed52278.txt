After the latest debacle between TakeTwo and OpenIV in which they have essentially shut down 7080 of all mods, which are lets not forget designed for SINGLE PLAYER, and the statement from Rockstar that says this was going after a hack in Multiplayer which they could have just contacted the developers of OpenIV about, I will not be recommending this title at all.Actually, I will not be recommend any TakeTwo title, nor playing it on my channel or posting any positive review of it anywhere. Sort your act out.
