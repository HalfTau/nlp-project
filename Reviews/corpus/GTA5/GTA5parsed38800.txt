Nice job tar, yoursingleplayer game was only playable with mods, so you ed yourselves. No one gives TWO S about your pure unrefined pile of  you call multiplayer.I never thought it would come to this, but considering you greedy s want to take away the one thing that made this game playable, i finally get to free up 70Gb from my HDD and uninstall the mess youve created.. You. Rockstar.
