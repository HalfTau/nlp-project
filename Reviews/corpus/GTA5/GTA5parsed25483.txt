I got banned once as a lvl 150 user, I didnt know why and Rockstar didnt even want to tell me why.After then ban they reset all my progress in GTA Online. I wasnt able to get my stuff back, so I modded and got banned again. Im not complaining about the second ban, but the first one was the real issue since i was completely innocent. I will most likely just buy a new account with high lvl and lots of cash later... All i learned was to not mod, but also mod... So basically, if you dont mod, youre gonna get a ban, but if you do mod, youre gonna get a ban... 10/10 no logic what so ever.
