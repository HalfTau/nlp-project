I enjoyed my time in GTA V, but I cannot recommend this game with Take Twos anticonsumer practices. Do yourself a favour and spend your money on a game which doesnt give the middle finger to the modding community. As for Take Two, as far as Im concerned, you lot can go fck a pinecone for all I care. I hope a flock of birds crap all over your cars for the rest of time.Edit Previous paragraph is now null and void since Take Two finally decided to get their backsides in gear and OpenIv is now back up and running. Take Twos stance on the modding scene is still troublesome, but their idiocy is no longer a huge factor to take into consideration when buyingh this game. I had fun in GTA Vs singleplayer, and am enjoying GTA V Online.
