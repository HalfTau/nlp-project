Awesome story. I first played this on launch, due to me preordering, and yes, i have the blue map. Ive bought this game for every system other then the Xbox 360. I bought it on ps3, finished, Xbox One, finished, PS4, finished, and now i indend to finish it on PC. Awesome story, can never get enough of it. Also, 100 worth the bundle with the shark card Atleast right now it being 32 dollars 100 reccomend
