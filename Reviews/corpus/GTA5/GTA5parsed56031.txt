Ive gota lot of time sunk into this game. I actually bought it again, I originally owned it on the 360, and then upgraded to PC. Ive sunk a LOT of time into it. The game has a great single player campaign, but Rockstar obviously doesnt care about singleplayer, because they havent updated it like, ever. They care about Online, so thats what this review will be about.Theres a lot of fun to be had online, especially if youve got a few friends to gang up with. But there are SO MANY mechanisms in place to make you waste time on it, it starts to get absurd. Every update adds a slew of new vehicles and ways to dominate the game, locked behind an enormous paywall. The only way you can reliably purchase these new upgrades is by paying real world money for them, hacking money into the game, or grinding for an absurd amount of time. For a company that seems desperate to push the purchase of ingame currency, Rockstar has done VERY little to curb hacking ingame. People who hack money gain a tremendous ingame advantage, and because they can kill any and all players at will, can completely screw up a VIP mission, something you had to pay to start, in an instant, in a way you can do nothing about.So, to review an online experience with lots to do that demands you buy into it, while simeltaneously failing to prevent cheaters from ruining the experience. You will lose a LOT of time, and if youre gullible enough to pay for SharkCards, youll lose money as well, getting invested in this.
