Corporate greed at its finest! Please, I encourage people not to let this set a precedent and give the greenlight to other, terrible publishers, to carry on these terrible trends in the industry.I for one will now be boycotting R products and other Take Two affililated games. I wont tell anyone else what they should be doing, but do take a look at other bad examples of these trends DLC, locked content, P2W,... and how they came to be, and make your own decisions.
