The level of contempt that Take 2 has in screwing over paying customers is abysmal. Theres no good reason to spend a single penny on this game at this point in time when after a dlc/expansion sp excluded the game literally now has less features, less playability, and the singleplayer is completely nerfed and barred from any and all mods, all under the guise of protecting players. In reality its all a push towards a multiplayer only demo that you pay full price for where you again pay in game for any chance to actually use any of the features, of which there are now significantly less after mod banning. They took an amazing game and turned it into complete garbage. These changes affect their other games as well, Anything Take 2 or Rockstar is going to be developing in the future it seems retroactively as well will be extremely anti community and anti paying customer.
