I dont play this game. I want to, but I rarely play games without also watching movies, shows, news, or thngs related to my other hobbies that dont involve gaming. Your game will not allow me this. I give you a bad rating for this alone. Never mind that I play online games while streaming all the time. I really dont have an interest in playing this game online anyway. I do really want to keep playing this game. But  you for hijacking my internet line when I am playing through story mode. I wouldnt buy this game again if it was ing free.I will never buy another rockstar game. Go  yourselves.
