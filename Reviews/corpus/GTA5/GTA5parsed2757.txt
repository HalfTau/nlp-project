I love this game.  The city landscape and pretty much everything the player sees perfectly rendered.The gameplay is really great, not much to complain about other then the infrequent glitches that become annoying.Vehicles and weaponry are fun to use and I really enjoyed the ability to switch between 3 different characters within the game. Each is totally unique and nothing like the rest especially in consideration of their individual stats and ability.If you enjoyed previous GTA titles like Liberty City stories or Vice City, then youll love this GTA of the future.  While I can not comment on the Online portion, I used it sparily and when I did Id get sniped as soon as I spawned in game.  I prefer the Story Mode espceially now with 3rd party mods.
