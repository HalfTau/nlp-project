Take two  Rockstar doesnt give sit about their customers the just destroy the fun for singplayer which is useless and they slowly destroying online which is kinda chaos anyway.They dont care about the fun their customers have cause GTA IV which is BAD game and not worth it anymore used OpenIV like GTA V and it gave what Rockstar didnt alot of FUN.I will think it alot and wait and see what Take Two  Rockstar is gonna do in the next GTA game until I buy it IF I buy it and I hope the most of the world do the same too.If they shut down Multiplayer alternatives I am gonna write every single reason for you to not buy GTA V.
