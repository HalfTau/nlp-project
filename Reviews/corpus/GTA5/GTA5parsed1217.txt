For the single player gamethe open world and the graphics were topnotch, probably the most impressive looking open world game Ive played. Driving felt good, npcs around Los Santos were really well done, radio music was great as always, and I also liked the fact you can play 3 different people and switch at any time. Lots of great humour and just an incredible looking game.What let it down for me was outside of missions there isnt really that much to do. I tried playing it more immersively, taking my time, checking out Los Santos and all that and staying away from missions. For the first couple of hours it felt great, but once youve driven about, played a game of golf, had a game of tennis, done a triathalon, parachuted out of a plane, punched a few people, had a high speed chase with the cops, it gets a bit boring and so you just end up following the missions. I would have preferred something to keep me gripped outside of the missions, something that gave me a reason to go out and explore every inch of the incredible open world, but I just got bored after a while.Missions for the most part were varied and exciting to do, especially the heists. I did find some missions to be a bit arcadelike, on rails, press this button, press that button etc, but overall they were decent. I might play it again, it has replayability cos you can choose different options to do missions and heists and it is a great looking open world. Maybe i missed something, i dunno.Great game, but could have been better for the single player. An incredibly rich and detailed open world... that I didnt give a monkeys about exploring. Id give a solid 8.5/10.
