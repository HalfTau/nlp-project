Its a moneygrab what can i say i bought the game at full retail price with a big shark card to start and catch up to my friends, a few weeks later i get perma banned for hacking. Overall rockstar has 80 and i have nothing with them saying go f yourself. 2/10 it was fun before i got banned and its acompany who has no regard for its community. I dont normaly give a bad review but this is well deserved...
