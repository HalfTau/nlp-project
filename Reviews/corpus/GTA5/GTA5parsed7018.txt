i cant seem to get good results on my 1 gb gt 440. but when it runs on it the game runs well. the game itself is the best of its kind it dues have pretty expensive items but its not gamebraking like in most other games. the storymode is realy well done and fun to play but i would like to be able to get my old save from ps4 or ps3 but its alright i dont really mind becuse its fun to play,edit i have been playing on and on in the online game and got a new graphics card.now i tested how the ban works with mods and such and i beleve rockstar made the good decition of baning you for one month for moding and i like how long it takes to get back in the game because tha means moders are going to be less.in most other games moders are a big issue but in this one there not and if you get banned its always correct from rockster or atleast its like that for me.i have also been testing the  graphics and in all resolutions you can play the game its still playable in lowest graphics too and you probably wont need to upgrade your pc because it runs on pretty much anything.my sistem specs now in 2018 is gtx1050 ti 25gb RAM 500gb harddrive  intel core i7 3770k
