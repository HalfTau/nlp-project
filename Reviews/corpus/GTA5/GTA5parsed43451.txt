All they give a damn about is siphoning more and more money out of you via online. Not only do they make it extremely hard to earn money through regular play, they keep adding overly expensive content to try and push you to buy more ingame currency.And now they are disallowing mods, probably to be seen again in the future under a paid mods scheme like so many other greedy companies are trying now. RIP GTA
