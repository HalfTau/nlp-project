This game might be fun if not for the hackers...Its not even funny, the hackers have completely ruined this game for me. I cannot join an online session with more than 2 people without hackers killing me from 1000 miles away, or giving me a wanted level, or spawning cops on top of me, or taking control of my car and making me drive off a cliff...It is insane what is being allowed by the makers of this game. Any of this should be easily detectable, and ban these hackers. But, Rockstar does not seem to care in the slightest. They allow this to go on every single day in their game.I cannot deal with these hackers, and apparently neither can Rockstar... I am requesting a full refund even though I have played a fair amount. It was not fun at all. It felt more like work, even when hackers were not murdering me from afarIf I had known any of this before buying the game, I NEVER would have considered it
