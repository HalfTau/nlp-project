 this gameThey make it based on microtransactions, make everything overpriced because people play the game and can make money like what, they destroy mods because they are too dumb on how to code to stop assets from being used, then they bring back mods because of backlash, then they copy another game wtf, then they update my money and rp and decide to take away 1.4 million when they actually owe me over 600k so  me right.I was going to leave a negative review a long time ago but this was the last straw. off Rockstar and Take Two go suck a
