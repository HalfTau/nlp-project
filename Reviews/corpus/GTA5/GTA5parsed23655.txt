I got banned from this game while it wasnt installed on my computer. Bought it, played for awhile with friends, stopped playing and came back about a year later to find my account banned forever. Contacted support, pretty obvious it wasnt me using the account at the time as the email address was changed, the language reset to russian and logins were from russia, they stated their bans are absolute and cant be undone. Terrible customer support, fun game but  funding a company that treats customers like trash is a bad idea.On a side note, GTA 5 online part is fun to play with friends but theyll screw you any chance they get.
