It was a good game when it was released. Things made sense and the paywall for the game wasnt entirely noticable. Now the game is a mess and you have to either quit your real job to farm for one of the 200 new cars and weapons or buy a SharkCard, which will give you enough money to only buy one or 2/3rd of what you really want. This is frustrating when trying to gather a full on arsenal of new goodies and RockStar has failed to impliment any way of making money that is tedious or requires me to ask my friends for their assistance at my expense. I hope they soon realize this games earning system is flawed and they address this sometime in the future.As For the OpenIV issue, it is my right as a consumer who purchased the software to modify or change anything I wish so long as it is not illegal. I understand Take 2 and RockStars point of view on this game for GTA Online, but it makes no sense to attack the single player modding community that would help their game for years to come. It is sad to see a company like RockStar/Take 2 to be doing this to their loyal customers and I am offended that they have not made a claim regarding the issue of OpenIV. From now on I will no longer be spending my money on any of Rockstars up coming products and I will make sure to spread the word.Also Congratulations on losing a customer!tldr DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
