Thank you for bringing back OpenIV. I have been wanting to purchase the game for a while and right before I actually went to do it, you guys basically made modding Illegal. Not okay on your part so I decided to hold out on buying the gameGot it for 360 and Xbox One years ago... Anyways, I just heard its back and the games on sale so I couldnt resist.
