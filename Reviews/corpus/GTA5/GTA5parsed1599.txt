Honestly made more money in GTA online in a 5 Minute Hacker Session than during a 600h grind, wouldnt need to work if I could resell those bucks for a fifth of what Rockstar asks for.Get 3 Friends, play the heists, do some races, go on rampages  its good fun.Singleplayer lacks GTA SAs creativity, but its back from the gritty serious 4 and went to glorious batsh crazy.Buy it on sale, and for the love of god dont buy sharkcards.
