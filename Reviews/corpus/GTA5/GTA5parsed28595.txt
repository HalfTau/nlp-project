Ive never respected draconian methods never will, dont care who they are and Take2 and Rockstar are up there,Ive played the GTA franchise since its conception in the 90s, and now theyve gona to a all time low trying to ban modding which if anybody knows the world of modding is about sharing their passion and creativity with the ingame community,and the publisher and devs are turning their back on that sadly. 1/10Not interested in buying anything from these guys until they bow down and show the consumers the respect they deserve.
