I actually tried to make a refund today. If disabling OpenIV will reduce amount of cheaters, I want to say a big thank you for that. The amount of cheaters that teleport and kill whole server or gave randomly enormous amount of money is just stupid. I honestly thought Rockstar not interested in gta 5 anymore but I guess It was that mod feature that created all cheaters.
