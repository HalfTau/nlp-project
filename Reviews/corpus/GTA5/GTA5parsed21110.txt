Disappointed by purchase, launcher and steam crashes frequesntly. I had also tried cheking with rockstar separate account with GTA v purchased on it and it was smooth and fast on loading, but this one takes 10 15 mins and still lots of issues with server connection of rockstar.. really disappointed.
