The single player of GTAV is pretty solid. The gameplay, missions, and characters are all fun and completing it all takes a good amount of time.However, I cant recommend a game when the publisher is as anticonsumer as Take Two. Single player has remained untouched for years while multiplayer is continually updated with new content that is only accessible in single player through modding. The threat of blocking these mods show that Take Two is only interested in selling more of its shark cards, as acquiring any of it online involves a ridiculous amount of grinding, or instant access with real world money.
