This is a game whose publishers attack singleplayer mods to drive players to a microtransactionladen multiplayer to get a quick buck. It isnt enough for them to own the fourthbest selling game of all time behind Tetris, Minecraft, and Wii Sports. They need to leech money off the players who have already paid the full 60 so they can have even more of your money.Do not give Take Two and any company owned by them, such as Rockstar and 2K, the time of day.
