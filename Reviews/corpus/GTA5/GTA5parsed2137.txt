So I was playing GTAonline for a while then stopped playing. I started playing after a few months and i get the message could not connect to social club services whenever i try to go online. Been trying to fix this but to no avail. Couldnt even play online before cause i would always get killed and get teamed with  players in heists. I wish i could refund this game.
