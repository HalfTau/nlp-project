This game is just a cashcow for rockstar. They made a great game and THEN they added a few DLC packs and the GTAO prices started creeping up and now everything is WAY too expensive to buy. It takes forever to make 1 million and you blow it on an average sports car.... yachts are like 812 million.... All rockstar wants people to do is buy shark cards. Which are also WAYYYYYYY too expensive I could buy shark cards and get all the cool stuff but I refuse to give rockstar any more money. I already bought GTA V for 360, xbox one and PC! All at 60! Ridiculous. Rockstar is a joke now.... I will really consider not buying the next GTA if they pull this BS again...
