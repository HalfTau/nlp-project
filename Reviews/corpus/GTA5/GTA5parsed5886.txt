Single player  great fun, good storyline if a little short.Online  Microtransactions from hell. Could have been good but instead all they do is make it as hard as possible to earn any cash so you end up buying shark cards for real money.Rockstar ruined this game with their greed.Dont expect any single player expansions while they farm the microtransactions either.
