over 500 hours on the game and i reinstalled it and deleted it again 20mins later as itss pointless trying to make money ion the game using the ceo i know its supposed to be risk reward but the when the risk is every player in a session destroying your cargo for 2000 when youve spent 200000 people are just out toyou off for no reason so i wont be reinstalling or buying gta 6
