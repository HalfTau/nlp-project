Almost 2k hours in game and after about 6 months break after working my butt off to get to 50,000,000, I come back briefly I earn another 2,000,000 then later on spend 14,000,000 and shortly after that I earn back another 2,000,000 only to discover 1 week later I have 15,000,000 removed from my account.Thank you Rockstar for GTA, GTA2, GTA3, GTA Vice City, GTA San andreas, GTA IV and GTA V single player Games, but your attempt at Multiplayer and how you handle it all wa slike a 5 month old trying to run a business.  It was fun while it lasted but your greed and lack of customer support has pushed me away from anything else you bring out in the future Not that your going to bother with PC anymore anyway o/
