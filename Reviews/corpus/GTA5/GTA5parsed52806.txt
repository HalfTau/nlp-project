T2 take a bad and wrong way to protect GTA OnlineGTAO.T2 said,TakeTwos actions were not specifically targeting single player mods.Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of playersand interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody.Ok, I understand that T2 have to protect GTAO.Of course they should do it.But this is not a reason to ban OpenIV.T2 didnt ban MOD MENU like a D3SK1NG, so many cheater use MOD MENU at multiplay.OpenIV is not a cheat tool, its almost used for modding at singl play.Why T2 didnt ban MOD MENU from multiplay ?Why T2 ban OpenIV ?I want to say to T2.T2, are you KONAMI ?Review UpdateJuly 4, OpenIV team says that OpenIV development will be continued.So, I change my review to positive.I want that GTA offline MOD community will be kept.
