I played through this game on singleplayer and had my fun on multiplayer when this game first came out on console. I later decided to buy this game again on PC to enjoy it again with mods. This was the ONLY reason i bought it a second time and now take two have decided they hate fun and launched a cease and desist order against openIV, a modding platform. These guys just flushed their reputation down the toilet. This review will remain negative because of the decision take two have made against its own community.
