Hevent put much time into the game, just played races with friends. Recently uninstalled because a modder got on and spawned a fire inside everyone. After losing about 400,000 from dying every 5 seconds, with passive mode activated, I joined a new lobby. Spawned in with the camp fire still attatched. Created a private online lobby and it was still attatched. Lost bout 1 Mil to it, and I dont do heists so I have no way of getting it back. Not recommended to download this game. Everyone talks in public chat about which mod to use and the fastest way to use mods to get money. Nobody gets banned. I know that this game is about killing and stealing, but hacking is another matter.Wheres my refund?
