Was a bit of a tough one to write. but i have made up my mind. The story mode from what i have played is amazing it reminds me of growing up playing gta on ps2... but this one is a let down... the main grip of this game is shooting people, crazy characters, and of course the cars... but they refuse to impliment a car system, garages are literally useless. the story mode refuses to save the vehicles you customize after around a good 700k i realized that. Youre stuck with the start vehicles of each character you play from.Online experienceRiddled with hackers in every lobbytoxic communityPay 2 win credit card users or no lifes chilling in apcs and vehicles that cost money that will not die after beign shot with 7 rocketsConstantly killing people that just try to have fun and do unique online only thingsOverall reviewGreat story with frustrating customization.Online is annoying and  not funsevere disadvantage based on levelNot recommended.
