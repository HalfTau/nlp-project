TakeTwo, the publisher behind Rockstar, issued a cease and desist notice to the team behind OpenIV, a modding tool that had been previously allowed for almost a decade. The publisher also lied about the reason, claiming it allowed cheating in their online mode. The real reason is that people arent buying enough shark cards. The sad part is that rockstar themselves have prviously come out in support of singleplayer modding, even showcasing some select mods on their blog. I will not be purchasing another game from this publisher until taketwos policy of legal threats against singleplayer modders is ended.
