One of the best GTAs I played till now. The world is huge but not all the parts are explored through out the single player campaign missions. I am writing the review after achieving 100 completion. Trust me there are lot of collectible in game, like a lot. Rockstar does provide a checklist of the collectibles on the website but not all are stated there.The game is smooth and sometimes buggy on collectible counts, so keep an eye on the numbers. I still have one stunt jump left and i dont know which one it dint register. Theres no way to know unless you do all of them again.GTA Online is fun, but i dislike the loading session times. It does take a while.
