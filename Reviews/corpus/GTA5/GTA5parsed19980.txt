It was great for me, until I ing hit the part in which you need to learn to fly. First thing is first, why does your character have to  up everything? Literally. Until enough skill points are made, you character ing shakes the god damn thing as if it wasnt hard enough to control. Then comes the ING helicopter scene. Legit the most annoying things to do and a time waster. Spent about 2 hours wasting my GOD DAMN LIFE. I still HAVENT ING COMPLETED IT YERT ANDT     ITSS REALYME SO SOFUFJCIKNG MUCH RIGHT NOS ANLS I CANT HAND LE THIS SITUPIDbr
