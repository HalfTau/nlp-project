Okay, I understand cheats and hacks on multiplayer being banned, but the banning of singleplayer mods is absolutely unjust. Nothing is being sold at least I havent purchased any of my mods and I believe that after the purchase of a game, the user should do with their game as they please, so long as it isnt illegal. Mods have been used in several, several games even on this very medium  singleplayer and multiplayer alike, so R, why do you think you should be so different?
