Take Twos actions are unacceptable. This isnt just a threat to GTAV, its a threat to other games Take Two owns, like KSP.OpenIV was the basis for SINGLEPLAYER mods, and has been for years.. They cannot claim this is about hacking, clearly this is about milking microtransactions. They want to stop mods, so they can sell more junk.Companies like this shouldnt have the ability to send CDs to fan modding communities, justified by lies about hacking. Modding is FAIR USE. If OpenIV could afford taking it to court, theyd win.
