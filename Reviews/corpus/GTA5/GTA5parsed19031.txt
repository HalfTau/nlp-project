Grand Theft Auto V, one of the games that are really fun online for me. I used to play singleplayer, but after getting this game, I started to play GTA Online. I met some nice people, bought some guns, bought cars, a bunker, everything. The only thing that was bad is that they made mods illegal. Rockstar responded and said that people can mod GTA V again. singleplayer ofc. I didnt use alot of mods, I just used the LSPDFR mod cause it was fun for me. it got boring to me and my friends so I decided to remove the mod and continue playing online.this is why I like the game.GTA Online missionsAwesome carsAdversary modesRacesYou can create your own races, deathmatches and etc.I pretty much dont have anything against the game, except when take two interactives made mods illegal. it was fixed, but the game will never get its positive review ever again.I recommend this game if you want to play GTA Online and GTA V singleplayer.
