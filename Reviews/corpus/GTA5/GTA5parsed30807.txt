Out of honest I wouldve reccomment this,this update, gta online just disapointed me everif your planning to play only the single player, play something else than thisgta online itself is just grindy and awful enemies have damn pinpoint accuracy and can shoot a mile away making free aim less fun each update in this game doesnt nerf or improve anything, it only added extra content thats ridiculous expensive while the single player is cheap the difficulty is a joke it only gives you lives depending the difficulty, no accuracy reducing nothing physics are a downgrade, but the vehicle damage is improving the cop detection is not a zone detection of course everything thats rewarding is little which the game wants you to pay money people are toxicjust get a game that you could enjoy than this
