I really liked this game at first, the online was fun to play with friends. Then the ingame prices for new content started skyrocketing while the ability to make money didnt go up very much. What was already a grind required even more grinding. Doing the same missions over and over again for a pittance while each new DLC cost more and more. Its fun for a bit, but gets old fast.
