The game was great at first, it really was. The story is still amazing. Sadly the once mighty RockStar has fallen so far. Its sad to see a company I once loved turn around and slap me in the face. I had a HELL of a good time playing the online with friends, even back on the Xbox 360. Sadly, now. Everything is so ing expensive that you need to grind money for weaks on end to buy. Or, buy into their micro transactions and buy an overpriced Shark Card. It really feels Pay to Win, and I will not be supporting this game or the Devs for treating us like garbage. They do nothing to fix anything, all the real issues are still present and its never going to get better because they flat out just dont care.
