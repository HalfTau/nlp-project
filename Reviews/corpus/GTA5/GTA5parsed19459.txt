The gameplay is excellent, and its sort of hard to just tag it as a yes or no recommendation.However, the online gameplay is practically a loading screen simulator, and hackers are still abundant in online play. Both have been problems practically since launch as far as Im aware.There are also few bugs. This includes ones that give you an error message after attempting to load into online play for 7minutes literally. While there arent really that many bugs, since the loading screens are so awful, it REALLY hurts to repeat a mission or rejoin online because of a bug. Take that 35minute loading time and DOUBLE it.
