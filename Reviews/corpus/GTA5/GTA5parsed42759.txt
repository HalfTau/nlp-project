I quit playing this game a while back because of a mix between microtransactions, lack of ability to make money due to bad heist groups, and how everything is over priced in the game. Now your telling me I cant even mod single player. I wanted to play RDR2 when it came out, but I honestly cant bring myself to ever buy another Rockstar game. For all those who dont know though Rockstar didnt make the no single player mod decision it came from TakeTwo, that being said I spent 50 dollars on a game and they want me to spend money on microtransactions. It was a good run with you Rockstar, and  you TakeTwo.
