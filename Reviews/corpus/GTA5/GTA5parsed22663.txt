I think I dont really need to say much as to why this is getting a thumbs down. The only thing i will say, is when your going to have your studio semiendorse mod play and all applaud and thank all the video content and uploaders that shared their experience with others that obviously generates additional revenue towards initial sales. Dont be surprised by the big back lash when you rip it away after everyone who purchases the game and expected to be able to do continue this style of play is now angry their sandbox is now a lot smaller. I Dont mod at all and still think this is complete crap
