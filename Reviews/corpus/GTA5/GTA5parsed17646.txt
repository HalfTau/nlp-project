Great singler player, lots of depth, beutiful, attention to detail, Trevor is ing hillarious, and the hiest are fun to create/ execute. However the online is complete cancer and is impossible to buy anything over 3 million without blowing your brains out from reptetive missions from ALL the different characters, love the way the put single player characters in it though. In order to become rich in online you are pretty muched forced to dump your hard earned cash into buying shark cards. The signle player alone is a solid 9/10 wouldve been a 10 if it was longer like GTA 4s. However the online is 4/10. So if your buying this game to only play online there are better options
