NOT RECOMENDED FOR FRIENDS.I am so dissapointed, I just bought this to play with my brother. We can not for the life of us join eachother. I went through reaserch online only to learn so many others have had the same issue for years. I tried the fixes and have had no luck so far. It really sucks getting excited to play this again only to find out I cant play with my brother or my friends. You guys got two games out of my wallet, way to go, feels like theft.Why have a join friends if this does not even work. Maybe this game should be put into beta status? Seems like a Beta game issue riight? I know Rockstar wont give a damn about this review But I feel like Ive been scammed and maybe this review will help prevent others from feeling the way we do too..
