Grand Theft Auto V is one of those games that will and did make a huge impact on the video game industry. One of my favorite games by far, across both singleplayer and multiplayer.GTA Story Mode for me was incredibly fun for me. Players got to see a new perspective towards GTA games, and Rockstar overall, more than one main character. All of them tied into the same story, incredibly different personalities, and different pasts.GTA Online is a different story for me, as I can imagine it for all of the other players. I found GTA Online just as addicting as Story Mode, despite the modders and hackers, and those out to ruin other peoples fun.I played this game on the 360 and continued to the PC, I loved and still love this game. If youre willing to look past the modders, hackers, and allaround s in Online, get this game.
