love all the gameplay and missions ,good stoy line as well. but online mode is full of modders who want nothing more but to ruin the game and mess you up from deliveries and resupply missions. every game session there is a modder. rockstar is starting to be like valve people pay alot of money for shark cards and then just deal with cheaters.. dont be like me and spend a thousand dollars in shark cards hindsite 20/20 bad mistake.
