Take Two has completely ruined this game, your choices for online are to go on a very long and frustrating grind for money to actually be able to enjoy the online mode, or buy one of their Shark Cards aka ingame money that you pay for. Theyve made it clear that they no longer value the traditional GTA, with single player expansion packs and meaningful DLC, but instead are more focused on earning as much money as possible. On top of all of this, Take Two has openly stated thatWe are convinced that we are probably from an industry view undermonetizing on a peruser basisWhich shows that they only plan on expanding the microtransactions that have ruined this game.
