What can I say, there is SO MUCH to do in this game. I highly recommend this game if you like openworld games. The map is gigantic, and just exploring is one of my favorite things to do. My second favorite thing The heists. The heists are like the story mode of GTA Online, and theyre full of actionpacked badass combat, like in the final heist for Humane Labs, where you either sit in a helicopter and blow up everything in sight, or skydive into the lab with night vision and explosives, 2manarmying your way to the middle, then escaping through the sewer system. This game is HIGHLY recommended, however if you dont like grinding then you most likely wont enjoy the online aspect of the game.
