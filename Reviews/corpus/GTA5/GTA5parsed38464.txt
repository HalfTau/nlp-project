I owned this game on Xbox 360 and Xbox one. The ONLY reason I pitched out yet another 70 for the PC was so I could modify it to play LSPDFR. TakeTwo has kindly served OpenIV with a Cease and Desist order to make it so we can not mod our games. So far atleast 20,000 people have signed a petition about this. Thats over 1 million dollars worth of revenue that take two knows of, that wants to mod there games. If they continue this behavior it could cost them millions in future sales, as the modding communities are growing rapidly.
