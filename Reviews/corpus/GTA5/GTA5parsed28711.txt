I enjoyed it at release, modded it to the gills, and had a blast. No more mods mean now I have to bury this game. Seriously, if you mod games, know friends that mod games, or have enjoyed mods, dont buy this game. I cant in good conscience recommend a game that benefits this sort behavior from Take Two.
