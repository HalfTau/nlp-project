Well this game is pretty lacking already, but now that they got rid of mod support, I cannot recommend this game. its still 60 which is too high for a game of this age. They only come out with content for Multiplayer, and i hate their multiplayer. unless you play with a group of people you know about 5 or more then its ok. but if you play with random players its usually a pretty bad experience.
