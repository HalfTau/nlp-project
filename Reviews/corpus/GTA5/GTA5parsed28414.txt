A great single player experiance that will last you several weeks.  When it comes to muiltiplayer I have to spend more time talking about it as Rockstar clearly want it to be the main feature of the game now.  The online is pretty broken if you intend on playing it by yourself or even with just 1 or 2 friends as many missions require 4 people to play and Rockstar are pushing microtransactions down your throat by releasing new content that isnt that groundbreaking and charging millions in game to even get access to the basic items that come with it.  The online community is some of the worst in any online game ever with rockstar giving incintives for people to come and attack you for no reason.Its clear Rockstar arent content with making lots of money unless they are making ALL of the money they possibly can.  Dont get sucked into the online with its toxic community and pyramid scheme to drain you of your time and money.
