Two reasons why I dont recommend this reason one being the cease and desist to OpenIV, and the second being the direction the game is going. The pushes out more ways to spend money with less ways to make it. I want more heists but the game is saying Just buy shark cards and start up a insert expense startup conpany.The motor cycle club was nice but the pay wasnt great for anyone but the owner. Next we had the CEO to which the pay  wasnt great for anyone but the owner. I just want more heists to which is really the last redeemable thing for this game. I love stunt racing but I wanna get into the nitty gritty of not just flashing wealth that I dont have.Rockstar get yourtogether and make something good rather than just asking us for more money for more useless. Do something that actually deserves it.
