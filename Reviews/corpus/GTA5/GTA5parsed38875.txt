Rockstar and Take Two have ruined one of the primary draw points of the PC version of their increasingly cancerous MMO. By killing OpenIV, they have failed to solve their online scripting problems and made the unupdated singleplayer mode completely impervious to any improvement by outside parties looking to have fun playing their game. Mods keep games alive for so much longer. Dont support these companies, spend your money on other games that dont actively seek to attack their modding communities.
