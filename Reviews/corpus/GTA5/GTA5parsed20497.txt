to me the only downside the game has is its long loading screens, but considering it has to load the entire map, and wont need to load again after that, they arent that big a deal.Its a fun game to play by yourself, or with your friends, and you can easely spend hours just fooling around having fun, without accomplishing anything, and even when youre running heists in online with your friends, you can still fool around having fun and complete them.
