Single player is greatGTA Online is too much of a grind, it becomes either boring or frustating unless you pay 1015 more games 60 to get every cool thing, everything requires you to buy some bullsht new office or warehouse or bunker and each of those is 1.000.000 and rising, the cars and planes are cool but way to expensive, if you are gonna play it, my advice is to play it as one of those stupid F2P games where its free to play as long as you dont mind losing always to an apparently homofobic and racist 12 year old who used daddys credit card to buy a flying motorcycle with rockets
