I only bought this game on Steam mainly for mods, Take 2 should recognize how massive this modding community is and it is only going to ruin themselves because of theyre own greed. Screw Take 2!!! And Rockstar if they can find another publisher and accept modding like bethesda. I will not support another Take 2/Rockstar until they drop the cease and desist order against OpenIV. Over 830 hrs played since launch!! !
