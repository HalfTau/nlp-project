Way to go rockstar punish the offline goddess for nothing, openiv cannot be used online to mod and you know this..... congratulations on ruining offline play in favor of making your money online from shark cards. If any of you are looking to buy this game because of the offline mods then dont buy it seen as rockstar seems dead set on getting rid of them.
