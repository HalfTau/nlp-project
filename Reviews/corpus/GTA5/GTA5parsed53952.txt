I really like R Games GTA but not until TakeTwo make their recent policy.You guys on TakeTwo only know how to make money, not to create something.Your statement regarding singleplayer mod ban is ridiculous, you didnt know anything about it until you try the OpenIV for yourself... What? You didnt have a time to do that because youre busy making money with shark card?I know its your IP and you can do anything about it, but your statement is targetting the wrong target, you should target that on Multiplayer cheaters/hackers instead.Mod is for fun when youre finished with the singleplayer story, thats the thing that keep me playing this game for singleplayer.I leave negative respond to not supporting TakeTwo.
