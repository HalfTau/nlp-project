The main reason I bought the game was to be able to play around with mods in singleplayer. But now thats illegal because it was Under monetizing the game. But lets just look at the facts. Grand Theft Auto 5 took 325million to make and as of August 2016 theyve made well over their initial budget. Over 12 times their initial budget in fact. They made over 4billion on this game up until August 2016. Who knows how much theyve made just in the time from then to now. T2 Interactive has ruined this game. If youre looking for a sandbox world where you can do what you want, this is not the game for you. T2 wants you to not play the story. They want you to jump straight online and buy shark cards. This game USED TO be good.
