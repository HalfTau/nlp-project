So I bought this game since only recently I managed to build a pc that can actually run all the good stuff and so far Id been playing on ps4. I remember there was a big deal made about the whole being able to transfer your character thing, but apparently they took that away when they shut down the ps3 online servers. A.k.a there goes hundreds of hours of playtime and about 50 mil I had on my original character. The  do they expect me to do now? Shell out money for a shark card? gtfo rockstar.
