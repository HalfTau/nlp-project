If I had written this review months ago, it would have easily gotten a thumbs up. Now, the game has gone to complete garbage. I still would have given it a thumbs up but Take Two decided act like a child and forcefully end the support offor modding in GTA V. This program has let users such as I use and make mods such as LSPDR and The Flash for the single player versions of Rockstar games for almost a decade. Now it is being taken away for no apparent reason other than the bs excuse of Hacking. Because of that act alone, GTA V deserves a thumb down in protest.However, if that was not the case GTA V suffers from a terrible multiplayer only powered by greedy developers. Dont get me wrong the single player in this game is a 10/10 alone but the crappy GTA Online is a pay to win shtstorm filled with hackers that get away with ruining the game because Rockstar does not try to fix the issue. Instead, they push out these crappy DLC updates to the multiplayer which only make it harder and harder for a legitimate player to do well. This is not even an exaggeration.Grinding for hours for the game is literally impossible because of terrible matchmaking system this game has. Even if you fully load into singleplayer and then try to load into online, it can take ten minutes . Each place in this game has a loading screen and unintuitive menu to pass through before even getting to the meat of the game. Once you do, the hackers bombard with money and you either get banned or have your progess reset.For all of the complaints listed above, GTA V gets nothing more than a thumbs down. Take Two may have been the one that finally pushed the nail into the coffin but you Rockstar were the ones that put it there in the first place. Fix your game.
