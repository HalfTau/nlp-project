Since Take Two made modding illegal, there is no way i can have fun anymore in gta V. Mods made singleplayer way more fun and always made me come back to this game, since in online you cant really have fun without money. Its amove from take two to ban mods , and they screwed openIv over.Dont forget to sign the petition to try and get modding back.
