I bought this game, enjoyed the singleplayer. Went into multiplayer and a hacker maxed me out instantly. I enjoyed it for about a day. Then it was modding, lots and lots of it. NOW THEY WANT TO STOP MODDING?? This is the stupidest deciscion they couldve made. And I hope we let them know with these negative reviews. Fun game, but only to mod!
