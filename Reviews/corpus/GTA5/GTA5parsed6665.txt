What can i say about this game, if you want only singleplayer, then its a masterpiece 10/10 and so on. I can only recommend GTA 5 singleplayer mode.But i write this comment about GTA Online, and its not even close to the singleplayer experience. GTA online is about GRIND, grind and perhaps more gri..micro transactions. It will be okay if these would be the only issues, i dont mind to donate, if the game gives me fun experience, but Online does not work properly, for example old heists now are just brokeni tried 2nd heist with prison break  finished 2 preparation missions, but for 3 days could not start the 3rd, result  heist is unfinishable . So if you cant play what you like you ll have to grind in some random missions  without much fun and for little reward. So to resume it GTA 5 multiplayer has great potential, but for gods sake it has such big technical issues, that it only may cause frustration.i played Online back in 2015, dropped it because it was broken, 2 years have passed and its still broken.
