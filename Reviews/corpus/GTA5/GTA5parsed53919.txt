The last year and a half have seen the release of some of the most lazy and disgusting updates I have ever seen, but I always dismissed and kept playing because it was GTA how could you not love it but after the latest dlc and with what TakeTwo has done to OpenIV one of the last reasons to still buy the game on PC it is clear proof that this game has dissolved into little more than a money hungry  of a game.Stay away from this game.The special charm that online had has been picked away by the vultures at Rockstar and Taketwo and I fear it will never return and will continue on to Red Dead 2
