This game is good, but the online part is just trash. You need to buy shark cards for literally anything. And to buy anything useful, you need to spend more than the game itself to get it. Or grind for days, weeks, or even months. And the fact, that you idiots at ockstar killed OpenIVs project Liberty City in V...I bought gta 4 and 5 again on pc because of this mod! I would like to ask my refund for that ame, but I cant anymore.
