The games from rockstar have always been fun and they always seemed to love their fans, but it definitely feels like this games more motivated by money and the business side of things. I certainly understand that they need to make money but their actions against their loyal fan base seem very disrespectful. While the microtransactions left a bad taste in many players mouths, we ended up getting free DLC the large content updates, so it was more understandable. However the actions that have been taken against the modding community by the corporate side of things has been disgusting, claiming they were trying to help the online community but instead used brutal legal force against a bunch of gamers looking to help others have more fun. I agree that the online hackers suck and need to be stopped, however rockstart, or more accurately TakeTwo Interactive, has gone and attacked many single player only mods and modders. Some modders even reported having investigators come to their homes and threatening them in person with legal action. After these recent events I have lost most of the respect I had for rockstar, I think the game devs are still amazing at what they do but if they loved their community they would stand up for it.
