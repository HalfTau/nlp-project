If youre new to GTAV, dont bother. Dont waste the money.The graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay is interesting, but the players make it pointless. You cannot earn money quickly enough in this game to have a fighting chance against people who have been playing it since the beginning. Occasionally, what are known as modders really just cheaters using a mod menu, will come along and be either total aholes, or will be super generous and give you tons of money. Either way, Rockstar will do nothing about them.However, when its time for another pack release Heists, Im Not A Hipster, Gunrunning, Rockstar will take away all of the money modders gave you  meaning you cant do anything with the new release, but those cheating can. Its an incredibly asinine system, intended to encourage read extort players to spend reallife money on their shark cards or whatever for ingame money. It creates an extremely negative, wildlyunbalanced multiplayer system.If you dont mind being pummeled by players whove been playing much longer than you have, by all means, pay newrelease pricing for this game it came out four years ago, but is still 60 and struggle with the regret of that purchase.
