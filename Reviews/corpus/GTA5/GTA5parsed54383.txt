Take Two wants to make modding single player in this game Illegal... Illegal. HA. We know what you really want, you want us to not be able to have fun in single player, so we have to resort to playing your , overpriced vehicles and housing and business, GTA Online. And to spend our hard earned money on their microtransactions to pay for this items in Online.I will say this as kindly as possible.Take Two, go  yourselves. I will never play this game again. And none of you should either. Vile company. Greedy company. Pathetic company.
