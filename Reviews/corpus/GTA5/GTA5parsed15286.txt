Really good game. Lots to do, has a bit of a learning curve for the online, but not too bad. Campaign works offline, which is a huge plus for me, as it is pretty darn close to what you can do in multiplayer. The options for starting a private/friends only session is a huge plus, only wish they had coop story mode.
