I have played the game for over 500 hours. I have worked myoff for the money I earned and trust me I spent countless hours playing the game waiting and waiting to get the upgrades and new crap. THEN a hacker came in my lobby and started droping bags of money over our heads... Then the worst part happens I get banned now that was alright but when I come back a month later after the banned I LOST EVERYTHING!?! That is total t and I will make sure never to buy another game that you make every again. You could have at least just ban the people for a month and not really worry about deleting everything. I would have done that for the second or third ban. I know you guys love making money but at this rate you will be losing money with your heavy handed rules! You will not get another hour out of me nor a penny more. YOU ROCKSTAR
