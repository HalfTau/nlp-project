So, I got this game on Xbox 360 for the Christmas that it came out, played through the campaign, then played the online Which at the time was amazing, although became stagnant after a year or so with my mates, did all the DNS glitches got everything had a lot of fun, till the Xbox one version came out I went out and bought that, was not disappointed, got me back into GTA played through the campaign again, and played the online for a further year or two, then once again it got boring.Now its been nearly a year since i last played. Was scrolling through steam and found the game on steam, and despite having the boxes for ther game on both xbox one, and 360 a few feet away bought it again. And now im playing the campaign and online again. So I bought the game 3 times, played the campaign 4 times, and on my third online character, the only game to have ever done this to me, and i imagine the only one that will ever do this to me. Honestly, if it wasnt for the lack of singleplayer DLC, and the microtransactions, and how the general in game purchasing is structurred to force you to buy a shark card, this game would be perfect. Annoyingly the online community is just full of who blow up your car for no reason etc. but i guess this is online gaming, and i do it to.......Overall great game. Wish there was a singleplayer DLC.
