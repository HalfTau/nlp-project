Switched from Xbox One to PC, The first game I downloaded and let me say, Its certainly not the same, Theres a diffrent feel to it and thats Not just the grapchics diffrence, The team play is amazing and it seems people work together and not against unlike XboX/PS4, Suprisigly I havent come across one modder yet.I feel a bit of passion back for this game that I lost along time ago on Xbox, I still beleive some of the DLC is overpriced and your underpaid for Jobs but isnt that the real world we live in aswell????Thanks Rockstar,Just Cant wait for the next installment.
