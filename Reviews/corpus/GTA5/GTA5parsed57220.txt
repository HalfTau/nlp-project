Take 2 Killed mods and ruined the only reason I play single player anymore.And there is NO way im playing that microtransaction filled hellhole excuse of a multiplayer experience any time soon.Its a shame because the game was so good in its primeEditEven though it seems Take2 have backed off OpenIV im not going to just forget what they did or take my negative review down yetThe game is still great but it can be ruined by the terrible buisness practises they doEdit Numero DosFinish the singleplayer, mod it for a bit, then uninstall...Unless you hate yourself
