There arent many games Id buy at full price three times without blinking.  Actually, over more than three decades of gaming, theres only been one  and Id be very surprised if another one comes along.  Bought this as soon as it became available on 360, Xbox One, and PC  and played through the single player at least once each time, before spending time in GTOAre you even reading this?   Writing a review for the most popular and criticallyacclaimed game of the new millenium seems like a bit of a waste of effort.
