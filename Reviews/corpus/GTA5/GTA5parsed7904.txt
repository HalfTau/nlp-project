Terrible.You can spend your entire savings on supplies for a business, wait three hours for it to turn into product, and get the award of a transaction failed message for your troubles.  Some forums say its some anticheat measure maybe?  Apparently running a delivery for the very first time ever from your new business is cheating.And thats hardly even an anomaly.  Youll get repeated transaction failed messages if you earn too much from VIP missions in a day.  You just sit there wasting time for zero gain.This game is so poorly conceived, my review goes beyond merely suggesting you refrain from buying this game.  I urge you to avoid Rockstars entire catalog, so as not to enable this sort of behaviour in the future.
