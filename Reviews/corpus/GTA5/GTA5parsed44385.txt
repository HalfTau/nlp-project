TakeTwo has gone too far. They make nearly a billion in revenue for one game and they cant let their loyal customers be free?? I will never support ANY game in affiliation with TakeTwo and i strongly urge any and all to follow. Modding is a right for all of us as gamers. Using it improperly should result in a ban, however many are mature enough to use it as it was intended. And that is for it to bring back the excitement that these games used to produce. DONT LET THEM TAKE OUR FREEDOM!
