In all honesty, I feel like TakeTwos attempt at suppressing modding is unreasonable. They have failed to provide singleplayer dlc themselves, so why stop people from modding the game and enjoying the single player that way?I could write so much about the subject, but I feel like many other reviews here have summarized it all up well enough so that there isnt a need to.
