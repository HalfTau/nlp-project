Let me start off by saying that GTA V has one of the most impressive and well realized open worlds in recent memory.Then why the negative review? TakeTwo for getting OpenIV to shut down. One of the stupidest movies any major publisher has done in recent times. Im sorry I ever gave them my money, no matter how little it was.
