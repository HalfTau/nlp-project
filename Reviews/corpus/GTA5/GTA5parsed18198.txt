The game is great, i think everyone is over the fact you tried to get rid of the most successful part of gta aside from online, but we still would like to see some kind of singleplayer zombies or aliens dlc. or just a map expansion into north yankton. Other then that the gameplay is fun, offline and online, and there is so much to do and explore! I dont think a game could beat the endless possibilities like gtav has, apart from gtaVI
