TakeTwo messed up big, with its flimsy and completely baseless, not to mention wrong excuse that it did it for the sake of Grand Theft Auto Online.They did nothing to improve the situation there, they just made their singleplayer experience much worse with the solid exclusion of mods, for those who want that, of course.Bet TakeTwo is run by the sort of people who think millenials blow 1000 a month on avocado toast.
