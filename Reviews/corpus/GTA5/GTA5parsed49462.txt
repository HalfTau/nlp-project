The only reason gta5 is still relevant is becuase of the modding community. TakeTwo really messed up with their idiotic decision. I hope they come to their senses and reopen OpenIV. I spent 60 dollars on the PC version to enjoy the wonderful and creative mods made by fans. If i want to play the horrible DLCs id just go play on console. Do not get GTA5 on pc until OpenIV is back in action.
