Garbage tier game,the multiplayer aspect that is,you have to spend literally millions in the game to get amything out of it,you either spam lowtier contract missions hoping one day you can have two2 million in your bank account to purchase anything interesting like the heists vehicles or the very expensive highend apartments or fail miserably the heists,who by the way no one knows what the heck they are doing,or you can be a sucker and purchase shark cards using your moms visa gold credit cardand let me put this before you commit the same mistake as i did,well not a mistake to be honest as im now free from the game,do not,i repeat do not use any kind of cheat in the game as you will get a 30 day ban first and if you commit another offense you are set for a 20 year ban perma ban,no do not trust anyone who says that is safe or OK to use it,they are in reallity lying to you,as rockstar makes a good chunk of its money from people who get permabanned and rebuy the game just for the MP aspect,you have been warned.Hope rockstar gets that bankruptcy treatment just like THQ got in the past and vanish once and for all,this company is way too greedy.PSyes,im salty.
