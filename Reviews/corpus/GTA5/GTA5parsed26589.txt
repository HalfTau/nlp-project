Bought this game on sale thinking that I would play online with my friends. Many factors killed the fun quickly. Hackers, slow load times, bugs, bad servers and overall clunkyness of this game made it a bad experience for me. The fact that making money is so grindy also just ruins the whole thing. The singleplayer was enjoyable but still its a big no if youre looking for fun that will last a long time.
