It was bad enough that Take2 shut down multiplayer mods, and now theyve shut down OpenIV. Take2 has essentially banned modding on this game. It doesnt make any sense whatsoever for their effort of removing single player mods.The online experience doesnt help either, the economy is engineered to require microtransactions for buying many items.DO NOT BUY, the online gameplay isnt worth it.
