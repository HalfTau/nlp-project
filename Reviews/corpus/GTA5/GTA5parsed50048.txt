i have hundreds of hours played on the PS3 so dont let the 37 hours played fool you  was a great game until Take Two decided for whatever reason that single player mods are now illegal so theyve completely ruined the game at this point  the online version is almost unplayable with all the hackers and poor peer to peer networking code and now Take Two has killed the single player part as well  gg
