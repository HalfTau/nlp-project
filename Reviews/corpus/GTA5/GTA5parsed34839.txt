I loved this game, only problem is the developers are starting to rely to heavily on the online mode, which really takes away from the singleplayer experience. The recent removal of OpenIV, a singleplayer only modding tool, really hits the creative community hard and we wont get to see new machinimas up from this platform because lets be real, the director mode sucks and really limits what you can do creatively. Not to mention the community that likes to come home and just mess around with the game in our spare time because not all of us have the time to grind online to earn cash and level up, or some just dont like having to play with the rest of the community like me, sometimes its just better to run around doing your own thing without getting bombed by some random helicopter. All in all GTA has taken aturn towards a downhill slope and theyre going to have to change a few things to keep a lot of their fanbase interested
