GTA ONLINE  Users are constantly being lagged out of a session. Seldom irritant behaviour. Rockstar refuses to acknowledge this problem, ignoring their customers completly. They are arrogant and greedy. I just hope they merge with a decent company like Unisoft for example or... just stop making games, that is another solution.
