The online is just too sloppy for current times. Between the controls  which were fine for single player of the generations of gta.  But you cant pull them online  its too slugish and sloppy for shooting and cover. I could get negative about the micro transactions but thats not the biggest issue. The problem is the online experience. Forced into a online lobby with randoms, then you have to go into a random mission or heist. You get kicked, someone quits, someone lags out. Mission failed. Back to a 5 minute loading screen to put you into another random lobby you dont want to be in. Drop in and drop out players should be open like every other game in this generation to make gameplay smoother. A matchmaking list should be in the drop down  or on your phone . These style lobbies can still exsist but it lshould be an option as I typically spend 2030 minutes just getting into a lobby that has someone not quiting or loading from a to b to c. Why when players can hop on another game and be playing in minutes. I dont need to be spawning taking a shower, you can show my character showering in the 5 minute load time.
