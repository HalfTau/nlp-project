The single player was fun and worth the buy, but whats really being sold is the online. A microtransaction cesspool. Ive never enjoyed the online because of the fact that everything is overpriced and a grind to get anywhere. And with the fact that take two screwed up OpenIV, I just cannot reccomend this game. Take two is a greedy company that looks at us like giant, walking wallets. Well played Take Two, youve done screwed up.
