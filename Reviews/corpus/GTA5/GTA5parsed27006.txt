everyone isbecause they banned modding .....the very thing that ruining online gameplay, i can only speak for myself here but im glad its gone ...i would rather have stable dlc from the devs then some hacky mods these people make and cause a brilliant game this gta5 to be unplayable and fustrating, if yourabout having to purchase quality dlc from rockstar then dont and go complain to your friends whom also share your jobless plight ...for me look forwars to cheatless online game play
