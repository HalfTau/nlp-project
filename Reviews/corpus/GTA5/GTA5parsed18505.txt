I got banned permanently1st time My friend spawned in money and gave me the cheat menu so I also spawned in money. Makes sense2nd time Logged into the game after the ban was over to see what i had left and got off, got back on a hour later to see i was banned again. I idolize Rs decision making3rd time Some random person was spawning money for everyone in the server with my friend in it who didnt get banned but I did. Good job R, banning an innocent man instead of the actual guy moddingOnline in general is summed up by this quote from ObiWan Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. You try and play by the rules you just cant because modders are in every lobby and will do anything to get you banned or mess with you.SIngleplayer is great though and thats why im recommending this game. Played it about 5 times.
