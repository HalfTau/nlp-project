Just a warning for those of you tired of creating an insane number of unique accounts thanks to marketing BS... this is another game which requires it, even if you only intend to play offline/single player.Have no interest in multiplayer as others have commented, its badly overseen and frankly a nasty cash grab shark clubs, really? but had heard single player was decent.. and I played all the previous grand theft autos but avoided this as not impressed with rockstar anymore... but was tempted by steam sale and got hit with you must make an online account and you cant use certain names etc. Fine.. but warn next time. Trying to get a refund.
