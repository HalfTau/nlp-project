So far...THIS IS THE BEST GAME I PLAYED. But why ?I can say from the beginning to now, my experience was VERY AWESOMEbut there are some cons that can drive you off the line.When you play online, you NEED to play either with friendor alone most of the time. You NEED to play hell alot to gain money,or just be lucky to catch heist finales. You CAN play with other player,but either they will be trollers, or AGAIN if you are LUCKY pros.Dont watch players that have Level 250, because either they are hackers,or they are the modders themselves.For my 100 hours experience i can say one thing. You need to be peaceful guy toplay this, because i rage alot.PROSAwesome VehiclesVery Cool HeistsEasy Missions for Money GrindOutgrageous Fun, IF you play with friendsCONSToo Hard To Gain MoneyToo Much Modders HackersToo Expensive Armored or Armed VehiclesHard, If you play with StrangersI RECCOMEND IT, because i can just change the session if i find moddersAnd I have friends to play with, and I WILL CONTINUE PLAYING XD
