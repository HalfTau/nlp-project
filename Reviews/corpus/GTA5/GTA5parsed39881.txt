I ing love this game with all my heart, but like an abusive ex theres no way to leave, you just keep coming back.A year and a ing half after this thing was announced I waited for it to come to PC, a year and a ing half. When it comes along Online still doesnt even got heists yet, the servers were unstable as  and content was lacking. Single player was good fun but the story is subpar. Its obvious Rockstar spent most of their time and money on making it look like a good game rather than being a good game.I dont know where everything got so ing expensive, 100 dollar shark cards? Honestly pathetic. Cars with missles on the front and parachutes, bikes with wings, weird riff raff looking characters  If I wanted to play the later ing Saints Rows id hook up my Xbox but I dont, I want to play ing GTA.Now even if I want to mod this ing ugly excuse for a triple A title to look like the game I orginally paid for, Im a scumbag. Ive only pre ordered thisgame worst mistake I ever made, and played on every major update that they put out for it but all that is forgotten once I install a ing dll trainer. you Take Two and  you Rockstar
