I have Enjoyed the previous games for modding and how fun they were, untill they made this game. I have bought this game more than 4 times on different consoles and Pcs and i paid full price for them. You would think that because i bought the game i can do as i please with the game, Nope.Story is ok but no updates to it and no DLCs.The online was really cool when it came out in the start untill they got really greedy and ed everything up. They introduced shark cards and started banning people for anyhing and now you cant even mod the game anymore. everything got really expensive and you have to grind for hours to days to get something/ anything.Thier support is terrible and no matter how many times i contacted them they offered no help at all. I used to play modded custom games with my friends in closed lobbies just to have fun but i was banned 3 times. The final time i was banned for 18 years. A game i paid full price to play it with myt friends, i got banned on it for 18 years because i was modding.YOU!!! Last ing TakeTwo game i buy is this one.And to close this, they Banned all mods now, they shutdown OpenIV because now mods are illigal
