Wouldnt recommend this game after the t that is take twos cease and desist regarding mods. As someone who was just getting into modding and found they had a real interest in creating their own mods this is complete BS. I have this game on 360, PS4 and PC. PC was specifically for mods, not impressed that this mod ban is also only affecting single player mode.Way to force people to multiplayer if youve completed the SP. Thanks Take Two. Youve ruined the game.
