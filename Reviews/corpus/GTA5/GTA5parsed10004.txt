This game has a lot of potential to be fun, really it does....but you cannot play in a solo lobby and there are no player vs enviroment servers...and with so many overpowered weapons its chaos to try and do any of your buisness runs...I like GTA 5 but im giving ita negative review because theyre completely leaving out people like me on this one some of us would rather just do our buisness runs, show off cars, just talk to people without having jets, military helicopters, Tanks, etc coming down on us from the trolls who say its part of the game get used to it.
