GTA V has turned into a cash grab. I love the base game and would recommend it. The base game is definitely worth being in your library. The online portion is a pay as you play run by a very money grubbing corporation. Even if you wanted to play online you will run into countless situations of cheaters making it impossible to otherwise play.
