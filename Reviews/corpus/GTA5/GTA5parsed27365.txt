Okay so here is my honest review for the game Grand Theft Auto VPros Fantastic Story Characters are fantastic Character development is on point, multiple endings Beautiful Graphics OptimizedCons No Mods anymore Online servers can be glitchy If you connect to a server it can lag causing huge distruption while playingOver all I dont think this game is terrible, online is fun but it can be really hard to connect to it sometimes, The graphics in  this game are absolutely Stunning and the controls are great, not to mention that this game is optimized quite well, over all i think the game deserves a chance in everyones library and i rate it 8/10
