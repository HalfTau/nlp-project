My bff couldnt play multiplayer with me without lagging like my pants on a friday night. It gets SO annoying, like OMG Jessica. ROFL. Now Im lagging IRL. UGH.But really, story mode is pretty good, includes heists and quite a good veriety of missions. Many cars and weapons, good voice actors, nice cutscenes, and fluid animations. Its GTA V afterall.The multiplayer, on the other hand, is a bit of a thorn in a great experience. As others have pointed out, Sharkcards are shortcuts for hours of grrinding, many things are overpriced, and finances are an issue. Also, even though my first few sentences were a pure joke, some people experience big lag spikes and stutters. Driving is impossible with fps jumping from 110 20 max and teleports. I havent personally experienced these issues, but 2 people I know have them. Maybe laptops just got theend of the deal here.Without going too much in detail, If you are looking for a solid 100hour funzone, go for it. If you are looking for a fun multiplayer game, eeeeeeeeh, its your life.
