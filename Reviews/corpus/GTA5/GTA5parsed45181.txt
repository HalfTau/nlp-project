Singleplayer is a joke to this company because it doesnt make them gobbles of money. I cant blame them, even though theyve already made more than any other company has on a game, but they just dont care and the empty promises they make are ridiculous. Im always going to play singleplayer because they still fail at taking action against hackers like they should. Therefore, theres no motivation for this game beyond mods, at leat for me.
