First of all,Personally I think this game does not live up to its predesessors...The RDR and GTA IV engines where one of the best engines introduced to any game of that generation...Now on gta v we get stunning graphic materials but  game AI Drivers get out of their way to stop you and they always pretend they dont see you and YES IT IS ANNOYING AF...Cmon its just a game rockstar... game engine especially on vehicles...now obviously we got introduced to planes and stuff but other than that the vehicles are the same exact like the other gta games and then some but that doesnt take away the fact that we got a game in 2013 with a game engine of a game along the lines of GTA SA and GTA Vice City with just upgraded graphics and  AI...Thats what it feels like to me Im sorry but crashing a car feels a ing lame cheapjoke...Also,GTA Online is the reason this game is mainlyIDC whatever the ing other ppl think about it..itsit is a grind and a half and it does not reward you as it should...This is also the main reason the game engine is so crappy because they cant design physics for every car that comes out ever 1 or 2 months they usually come in groups No the dedication and realism of rockstar is slowly fading..This game is a bloody joke having more than 50 online updates and zero to absolute non for the offline more like sit down relax players...This Is a dissapointment and it sucks to say as a rockstar fan from 5 years old I am now 16 this is the first time im mocking any of their games...They implemented online features into their game and have taken away singeplayer aspects like Whole ing storyline long DLCs Ballad of Gay Tony,Lost and damned Liberty cities Stories,Vice city Stories just to name  few This has and will negatively impact their future releases seeing as they will have GTA Online aspects and most importantly now with modding being absolutely removed from Take Two Interactive their games will not sell as well on some consoles In my opinion...There are so many games that allow singeplayer modding that do not effect their counterpart multiplayer experience and in 2017 the Game Developer of the most selling game franchise of all time can not take care of their own Way of making money and only money GTA Online
