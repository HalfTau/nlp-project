Ive just completed this game for the second time, first on console and now on PC.Ive not played a great deal of the online mode.The story mode is fun and the main story is definitely interesting. The game play is great.The only let down is the controls. It definitely plays much better with a controller compared to a keyboard. Where with any decent car W sees you fly forwards like a jet and S sees you screech to a halt. Analogue is king here.The controls are generally your biggest nemesis in this game, compared to the older gen combat and driving is simpler but that makes the gameplay much more smooth.Bugs, oh the bugs!There are many many bugs int this game from simple ones like mission checkpoints not triggering to complex and worse ones like how my Xbox one controller suddely stopped working with this game. And heart breaking ones like that jet fighter you stole and saved vanishing if the game forces you to use one of its planes in a mission.Still recommended!
