The game has good graphics but somehow the character customization is horrendous. Theres a decent amount of stuff to do and a large map to do it on... Even with all sorts of content in the game it still manages to feel.... boring.And then... the hackers, disconnecting, and testosterone pumpedthat play this game give it a  cherry on top.You do have the ability to have a good time in this game, but only very rarely when you manage to avoid hackers and youre playing with friends. The support team is horrible and there is always a possibility of being banned even if youre not modding. If you do get the game, only get it on sale because otherwise its not worth it.Oh and dont waste money on shark cards.
