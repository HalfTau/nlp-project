f uck this piece ofgame. its online mode of all. this piece ofhas made billions of dollors but the es at rockstar dont want to spen a dime on fixing the pc port. it is a f ucking buggy broken mess and is often unplayable. almost every gaming session i spend playing this game i need to exit it and force quit it. also 1/4 of the sesions you join will have a modder in it that s it up for everybody and that is not an egsageration. f uck loading for 34 minutes. f uck leaving your current game session and loading for 40 seconds only to get a message that says the player count is full and then your found a new session that sometimes takes 5 minutes to join. f uck randomly after hiests the screeen frezzes and then you lose all your money. f uck the pc port of this intire s hitty mess of a game. rockstar are a horrible developer that want your money and once they have it they leave you with what they had. you will never get more frusterated and raged at anything in your life then this games online mode. i know im ranting about the online aspect of this game but damn this is bad. despite its flaws is it worth it? yes. just the online mode is despite its flaws and that says something. i will still continue playing this gaming almost daily. dont let this review discourage you from getting it.
