Have almost 550 game hours. After a year break from playing I have returned to the world of Los Santos in this may. I have found many new and interesting stuff there, since I have missed quite a few major updates. I have established my MC business as well as CEO business. I play almost always as solo player but I had a tons of fun again, even in public lobbies. Playing heists with some random guys, roaming the streats with new car, meeting people, sme of which become my friends. I had some great expectations from comming Gunrunning DLC since the MC and CEO business turns out to be pure pointless grind. The Gunrunning DLC killed the game altogether. The Online part of GTA V is now pure pay to win 3rd grade mobile app. Do not buy this until you have lots of friends to play with and are willing to spend enormous time grinding and turning something that supposed to be fun to depresive work. Or you are willing to pay lost of real money for shark cards, or you are willing to risk ban for modding your account with money. The GTA V Online is almost unplayable in public lobbies due to OP Gunrunning stuff. Lots of bored players have all the new weapons and needlessly killing random players in public due to pure boredom. Boredom is the word that describes the GTA V Online the most. Why to grind to have lots of new stuff that you can use only to kill randoms at public lobby ? Instad of bringing the most anticipated DLC and its posibilities to have more dificult heists, more intense and more lengthy heists, this time with more people per team, Rockstar brings us new lame posibility for grinding and trying to force people to buy shark card to just survive in public lobby.
