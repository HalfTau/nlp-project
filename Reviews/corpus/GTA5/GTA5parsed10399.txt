I will start with the single player. If you are someone who wants to buy GTA 5 as you like to play story games then it is a good buy. GTA has a very good story line with good twists throughout the story that will keep you interested in the game and the characters you meet along the way are very good. The NPCs can get annoying but its all part of the fun of driving around Los Santos trying to kill someone when all of a sudden an NPC drives into you.Multiplayer feels like a separate game in some perspectives as you can go through the story line of the heists that progressively get you more and more money as you continue through each one. There are many good game modes to weather you want to do ridiculous races as you do loops over the Alamo sea or jump from rooftop to rooftop or if racing isnt your thing you can go into death matches as you fight in teams or by yourself trying to win each round. The community made jobs are also very good and I would recommend playing Snipers VS Stunters as it is a good mix of both accuracy and skill or give it a go and create your own.Pros and Cons of the game Broken down the passage incase you want a shorter list to look atProsGreat storyGreat characters to play asYou can meet some interesting NPCs and it is also got a very good plot lineA very well made open world mapVery good graphics If your PC has the specs requiredYou can toggle between first and third person gameplay4550 hours of story mode if you plan on ignoring most side missionsGood replay valueYou can get 100 hours out of multiplayer easilyWide range of Cars and wide range of music to listen in said carsSuperb video capture and editing featuresCons Has started to become more and more pay to win due to the price of items in multiplayer Can meet a lot of Toxic players Filled with cheaters now Sometimes you will meet people who just want to ruin your fun Not Rockstars fault tho Reporting someone tends to be useless 99 of the time as nothing is ever done Little exclusive content
