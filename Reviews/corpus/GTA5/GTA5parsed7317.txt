Overall. The game is Fantastic. The story is very complex and interesting with a good amount of things to keep you interested. However the online is slighly flawed. The addition of new veicles and buisnesses is a good way to keep players interested. However, there are quite a few factors that are seriously limiting them. For example, Some players only join you MC clubs to troll you or simply dont understand what to do when their sitting a level 120. It For some reason Is also possible for members of your MC do destroy your products with the new Batman Ripoff that has been added to the game. Apart from this hindering factor the game is amazing.
