you want that new jet ? or uh that new missle truck thing,or how about a nig fat yacht  well either you grind for tens if not hundreds our hours or you drop a hundred dollars, and the damn thing ends up costing from 3 million, 5 million or even 6 million, nothing more than a repetitive and tedious grind, its a shame most open world games are like this now, while not an awful online experience, its too much of a grind and a waste of time ironic for a gamer but whatever single player is the go to mode for this game, preferably with mods to keep things fresh, overall a shame to see rockstar stoop too such levels to make more money, while i get the idea to keep your business afloat, putting in ridiculous microtransactions can and will alienate part of your customer base, than again microtransactions are a great way to make money off of dumb kids with a sucker for a parent, hopefully this trend of microtransactions dies hard and brutally
