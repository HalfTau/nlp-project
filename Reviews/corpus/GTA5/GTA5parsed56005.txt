Take2 is forcing people to go into their money machine aka GTAOnline, see things they want to have and then go have them buy shark cards with real money to pad their pockets.Singleplayer mods were not stealing business from them and addressed a major critique of the game they abandoned singleplayer. All the new content is multiplayer only and extremely overpriced. Even ammo can bankrupt people in the online.This game is nothing but a cash grab now.
