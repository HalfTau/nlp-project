At first this game was awesome, but after it became obvious that rockstar only wants to get SharkCard money, it is You cant get anything in the Online mode without crazy grinding or buying their Sharkcards. F rockstars moneygrabbing hands.Also Take two recently fed over the modding scene for single player so there is no reason to ever buy this. I would recommend any other game, before i would ever recommend this trash.
