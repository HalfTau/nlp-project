I have a ton of hours on this game, mostly online. I enjoyed it immesely. The cheaters ruin most of the fun for everyone though with their money, experience and teleportaiton hacks but thats not why Im neg reviewing this game. Im neg revieing this game because TakeTwo, the games publisher sent a legal cease and desist order to the modding scene of GTAIV and GTAV online. I am a modder myself, though Ive never modded any GTA game but I do understand that modding is a persuit of passion and an art done by people in their free time as a labour of love. For TakeTwo to use the legal system to shut down these modders they do not deserve another penny.
