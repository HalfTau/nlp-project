It was a great game until RS started their cheat war.  Now they are punishing legit players that fall victim to modders.  When I login and a modder starts dumping money bags on my character, how is that MY fault?!?  Now when I earn money through heists, missions, etc. I sometimes login to find my account corrected by RS and all my earnings gone!  Total BS and certainly not a good way to treat your longtime customers!  No chance in hell that Im going to buy a shark card when my GTA account is so completely unstable.  Good luck with your POS buisness model.  GFYRS
