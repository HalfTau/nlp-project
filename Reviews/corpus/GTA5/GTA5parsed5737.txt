To start off this game is incredibly fun, but it is going down a hole i dont think rockstar will dig itself out of. The game tries to be everything at once, A Jack of All Trades if you will but that makes itat Everything. The gameplay is fun the design and seasons are fun, the graphics are woderful, the cities are immersive and the radio is realistic. Though it is fun and has good things, it is horrible. Lately the game has started to raise the prices of everything incredibly, the community is absolutely horrid through toxicity and greifing. There is so much this game could become, but Rockstar and 2K are too worried about making money to make it that way. The missions dont pay enough and the only way to get anything from new updates is to grind for days, yes days or open your wallet and drop 49.99 for 1.25 million in game dollars.Overall this game is wonderful and terrible, the problem comes from the Publisher and Developer they care more about money than the gamers that play their games. They want to get every coin they can from us and we need to stop or watch the gaming industry become a massive cash grab.
