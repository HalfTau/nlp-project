The game has been completely overrun by hackers. Its nothing but mod menus in every single server. People who teleport to you, completely immune ot all damage and kill you over and over. They have cars that shoot hundreds of rockets a minute, cars that take no damage, they spawn massive buildings out of nowhere and flood the map with discarded cars they just spawn on peoples heads.The online mode is a complete failure, and rockstar dont give a single  either.You either play on a private server, or youre ed. Simple as that.OH I should mention that everything is impossible to afford and youll spend 100 hours grinding just to get 1 nice car.
