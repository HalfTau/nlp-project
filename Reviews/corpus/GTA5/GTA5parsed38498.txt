Grand Theft Auto Online has devolved into a microtransaction/grinding borefest. It was marginally enjoyable at the start but no more. 2Ks decision to remove GTA5s modding capabilities has removed any longlasting appeal of this game, Online mode does NOT suffice. Avoid this game if mods are still not allowed or until Online gets a muchneeded change of priorities.
