The game itself is pretty fun but theyve recently destroyed the modding community for both online and offline play. The new content they add is only accessible online which wouldnt be the worst thing ever but it is locked behind insane prices that would require hours of tedious grinding if you wanted to gather up enough funds....or you know you can buy Sharkcards and get a fraction of the content that they put out. For 100 you would get 8 million ingame currency which wont even get you very far. You might be able to get a few of the vehicles or the special facilities that they seem to keep locking content behind. To put things into perspective 8 million ingame currency isnt even enough to buy the most expensive yacht in the game and the yachts dont really even do that much for you. So Rockstar seems to think that their virtual yacht you cant even drive it is worth over 100 dollars.
