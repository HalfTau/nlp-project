While the game used to initially be fun....now it most certainly is not. The developers Take Two destroyed the possibility of modders making this game potentially better than it was and that has ruined the fanbase. The singleplayer? Yes, that IS fun, and yes, it is a decent game to play in singleplayer. HOWEVER....once you finish everything there is to do in singleplayer, you are pretty much forced to go online to experience more of the story, and this is the point where everything turns into an allout freakshow. Now, yes, you are going too deal with jerks online who kill you for no reason whatsoever and there is a possibility of joining a single queue and doing things by yourself if you glitch the game, but still the gameplay is frustrating and annoying when you have people who join missions simply for the thrill of trolling. Do the devs care if people do this and ruin the fun? NO.What do they care about instead? The possibility that someone might make mods that could make outshine their precious baby project. THAT IS WHERE THEY WENT WRONG.Welcome to the future, game devs. You let people mod your game to enhance it so more people play it. SIMPLE LOGIC.If you lock out modding youre locking out potential fans. This was a horrifically stupid idea by Take Two.Congrats. GTA5 is dead.
