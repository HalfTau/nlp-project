Join a online session, get hacked. Join another session, get hacked. Must be fun for them, but not for us. The offline story mode is great but GTA Online is just full of hackers  toxic people who will chase you as long as you go and kill you for no reason. Recently, Rockstar has announced that there will be no single player DLC for GTA V so what ever new content you see will be exclusive to GTA online only. ingame micro transactions are highly overpriced. I recommend this game for offline story mode only but not GTA online.
