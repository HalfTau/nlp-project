You know, I bought GTA V for the single player, believe it or not. Then Take 2 in their almighty wisdom decided it would be in their interests to release no single player dlc, restricting everything to the , microtransaction filled online mode.I was like, okay, thats really ing annoying because Im not playing thatfor more then a few laughs with my friends, but Ill still be able to have have fun in single player mode via the use of game enhancing mods, right?Nope, thats gone now too. Eatand die, Take 2, you literally removed the only reason I had to keep playing this game.
