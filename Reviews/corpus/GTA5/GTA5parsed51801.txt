Mods are an interwoven part of GTAs DNA. When Take Two decided to force OpenIV to cease and desist, they literally damaged a part of their own product. Yes, multiplayer online without mods can be fun, and single player without mods can be fun. But neither of those is as fun and enjoyable as being able to use mods in single player. Mods expand the scope of the game infinitely, limited only by the imaginations of the mod community. Take Two just eliminated that option from GTA V this week. If you still want to buy this game, be prepared to miss out on the VAST majority of what used to be possible.
