A really fantastic game if you have good graphics for it. There can be  players that will  you up and spawn kill you. And there can be modders that can drop you good amount of money so you can buy everything you want. and there can be  modders that will insta kill the whole session and troll you for fun. But otherwise this is a realy fantastic open world game with the best cars and a big map. its more fun when you have friends to play with because you giys will be able to do bunker, facillity and biker missions toghether. Or you can be a normal gta player and  with everyone Your welcome bud
