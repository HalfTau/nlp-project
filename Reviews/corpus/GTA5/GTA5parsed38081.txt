You devs know that OpenIV was the foundation of mods for GTA games, yet you took it down, and for what? There are still hackers roaming GTA Online and we cant mod singleplayer anymore. Why do we have to move mountians for you to just now look into a way to bring back modding for singleplayer? Now Rockstar is pinning all this on TakeTwo and trying to let themselves off the hook, nice try.GTA Online was a horrible experience. Ive been instakilled from people who dont know where I am, I have people risking my account by pouring millions of bucks on me, and I have teleporting jackasses all aorund me. Worst of all, it drove everyone away, no one to play with, empty sessions and gamemode. Its a wasteland.Its like having a tumor hackers on your heart, but instead of the devs doctors taking time to assess and carefully remove this tumor, the heart was just hacked off.Didnt helpRip modsDont buy
