GTA V is definitely a game for playing with friends, and one not to be taken too seriously. Modders are rather common, so youll be hard pressed to always experience the game normally. Playing alone is okay at times, but the game is so much better when youre playing in a group.If youre just starting out, your first goal is to get a cheap office for VIP work, and then focus on getting a bunker by grinding the missions being a VIP allows you to do.Stay in third person perspective, as first person is kinda garbage most of the time.
