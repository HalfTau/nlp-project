Rating 8/10This game is one of the best sandbox online games out there. The singleplayer story is very well made and the online is always active with plenty of things to keep you busy! The economy online is alot more pricey though then playing in singleplayer so it is hard to afford things if you arent doing heist or jobs. I do think there rockstars security is a big issue with playing online as you are likely to be in a lobby with a hacker or a troll. But there is massive collection of clotheing and customization you can choose from with your character and the vehicles you play with as well. All of the Dlcs that come out with the game are free which is really awesome!
