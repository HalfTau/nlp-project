I got this a long time ago only for mods and really I havent got around to it yet. and ban mods for gta online, sure I get that really I think mods online would actually be really nice as long as its not negatively affeccting other players or giving anyone money or rp, but I guess that would be too hard to control, but at least let me continue to mod my story mode experience. And Im thinking in response to this, Rockstar will probably just make their own mod tool like the way bo3 did, Id think even that wouldnt be good enough for me, but thats probably what they will do, and of course it will have certain restrictions that openIV probably wouldnt have. Of course my main intenion being to mod story mode, I have to now negatively review this. And also I really wouldnt mind a linux port of the game, but even I know that most likely wont happen especially with Rockstar
