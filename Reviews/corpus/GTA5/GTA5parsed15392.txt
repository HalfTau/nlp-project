Only be prepared to enjoy GTA Online if youre ready to spend hundreds of dollars on their  microtransactions. Grinding is impossible since 80 of the playerbase is full of s who only play to screw up other peoples work, so dont bother with that. Even if it was possible, there are about three things you could do that actually earn money, each one as tedious and antifun as the last.Ignoring that, GTA Online isnt GTA anymore. Its Just Cause with worse physics, worse AI, worse tools, and the best part is that you have to pay real money to use any of those things.The promo images are also extremely misleading. Those are exceedingly hires compared to what the majority of players will be able to use, and the textures have been scaled up. In the actual game, many textures Mostly clothing, with some concrete and buildings are compressed toand look terrible from just about any distance.Single player could be worse. Not realistic in the slightest and characters motives make no sense, but its a decent amount of fun. Your best bet is to just stick with GTA IV.
