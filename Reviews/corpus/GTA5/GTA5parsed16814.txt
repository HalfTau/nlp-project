Great game, loads of fun online and a great way to have some fun with freinds.However R have taken a hamfisted approach to dealing with illegitimate money, they took 1000000 from my account without any reason what so ever, I have spent over 100 of real money on shark cards and put a lot of time into this game to earn  just to have a chunk of money taken from me, I was looking forward to getting a hanger to try out the new content but i guess they want me to spend more money on shark cards to access new content. haha no way just to have it taken again?I have tried to contact their support about this but they have taken down their phone lines and resorted to replying to everyone with automated emails.Avoid this game until they start respecting the loyal playerbase!
