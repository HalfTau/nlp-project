I have purchased this game on both xbox 360 and PS4 and have played extensively. I purchased this once for my pc but it couldnt quite run it well so i refunded it. Im here to show my support for the modding community and people who want to play online on pc.This has no business being released on PC if people cant play online and now that that they are banning single player mods, in addition to the terrible overall model of online play on all consoles and pc, i cannot recommend this game. Do not buy it.
