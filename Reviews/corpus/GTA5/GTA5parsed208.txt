This review is based off Online. Storys good I guess.This game is amazing if you have a spare 300 for shark cards, patients for autistic 14yearold modders and preferably tolerance for all kinds of ADHD kids.You know what else youll love! ?Probably the feeling of a razor going up your arm.Dont buy it for the online mode. Youll regret it.
