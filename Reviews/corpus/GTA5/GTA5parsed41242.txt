The game is fantastic. Story is good and you have plenty to do in online. At around 25.. well you can get 4 pints in a pub? I have over 500 hours in this game and still i love to and listen to Whiskey River D Id really like to see it in percents, how many people actually do install mods? I do, i think some games need at least 150 or so mods to be playable.. DI agree, it would be great to have a supported modding scene for GTA5. So many talented modders, who are able to do more than a wheelcart to carry your cash around. Id think that the obvious reason for nomoddingwegamemake, is because they are making money with the current way how you can obtain items.BUT! I have enjoyed this game a lot. Its fantastic. Storyline kept me on it the whole time. I love to ride on those mountains with my dirtbike and then make some mayhem, where ever it may surprise you! The ones who use every glitch, just to ruin the fun for everyone else.. Well you can find them everywhere!Did they say that GTA5 will be have modsupport? Did they give you less than what you were originally sold? Or are you pulling your opinion outta your nose, just because you have a Bummer! stuck on your finger and now you found a place to stick it. Anonymously, at at online site. The game looks gorgeous. It has a lot to offer. Some of the first posters i read, had played about 3050 hours. Really.. D  I bet you cant write a format c bat in that time and get your PC up again! DOk, i went a bit overboard there, but it is very stupid to blame a game for something it never had! Play ARK, Conan Exiles, Minecraft, pick one and learn it! I really cant remember there been any mods for Mario Bros.. Or have i missed an extra 15 seconds of content?! oRockstar, i willl never forgive you, for not giving Red Dead Redemtion for PCs. What, what, Rstar has what in the ?
