I am going to give my honest opinion. I never really cared for really any kind of modding in this game singleplayer or rp servers. I know that take two has messed up if that wasnt obvious from all the other 99 of reviews. I know its not because of taking Opev VI was asked to stop, its the reason, from what I know there wasnt any reason to make Open VI stop. However you should not be getting mad about something that is not even really meant to be in the game in the first place. This does make me want to try an RP server or mod in singleplayer a bit more. I just wish all these reviews were about the base game, which they should be.About the base game The start is always the hardest part about most games, especially this one. All you have to do is grind and find ways to make money and have fun at the same time.Modders in multiplayer are a problem, but you can just find a new session.I find this game to be somewhat addictive when you are always making objectives for yourself about what thing you want next car, tank, office building, etc.Trolls in multiplayer can sometimes give you a laugh, but the ones who just shoot you out of your car for no reason kinda ruin the fun sometimes.This is my honest opinion so far about this game and what has happened in the GTA V Modding community
