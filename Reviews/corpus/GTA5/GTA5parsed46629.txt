This review is for the people who are curious about the game and thinking of buying this game.For singleplayer purposesPros Great Story nice character depth,funny and twisted plot Good graphics Long story around 1020 hours of story and more if you roam aroundCons Some objectives can be boringThats all i can think of.Now lets talk about Online experience.For starters,i dont really care about modding.so i wont be talking about how stopping mod support decision changed the game.Pros Nice plot on heists Good coop or online teaming experience PvP available To earn money you can do heists,you can do businessthat contains stealing and selling or motorclub business Mediocre character building optionsCons HACKERS.Im not talking about some guy with infinite ammo.Hackers in this game have GOD MODE.Yes you read it right.You can find out hackers almost in any serverhappens a lot.They can teleport you to somewhere and kill you.They dont get hurt,they have infinite ammo,they have infinite money.I mean come on wtf is this crp... You will see people begging for money in servers INFINITE LOADING TIME.Seriously it takes more than 10 minutes to connect to a server.Then it takes like 25 minutes more to find a suitable server or find your friend.If somehow your game crashes,it will take the same process again.Result You can play it with your friends but be aware,hackers can find you or you may wanna kill yourself for fun while waiting for the loading screens
