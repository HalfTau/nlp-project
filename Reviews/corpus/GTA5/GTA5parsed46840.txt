Mods make this game great, and it brings new life to the game with out them you get an ok story mode but ive replayed it so many times now i dont care for it and a micro transaction hell of a multiplayer what isnt worth playing unless you want to pump alot of money and time into it, i do not recommend it unless you want to waste your money.If they stop trying to stop modders and mods then i will recommend the game but with out mods its not worth the money.
