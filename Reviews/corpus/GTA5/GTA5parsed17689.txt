DO NOT BUY!!!! !Rockstar treats their loyal customers like crap and will punish you for actions of other players. Seriously a joke of a company, all they care about is taking your money. The only way to get anywhere in the game without blowing 20 dollars on in game currency is to completely waste your life and do nothing but play the game. I thought this game was finally getting better in 2017 but I can confirm it hasnt! I have over 400 hours played trust me do not support this joke of a developer.Pros NothingCons Players dont cooperateRockstar does nothing to stop modders but punishes players when modders give them cashIncredibly long loading screens serversEverything is overpriced
