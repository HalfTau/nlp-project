After 3 years of playing GTA V on both PS4 and PC, and putting in hundreds of hours into the game, Rockstar unfairly banned my account and reset all of my character progress. I had to grind and grind to make money because Rockstar wants players to buy their vastly overpriced Shark Cards, and I, along with other people with high cash balances, was unjustly banned and lost it all.Support tickets I submitted were ignored and met with the same copyandpaste responses repeating their ban policy. After this ordeal I am never going to buy another Rockstaraffiliated product. They dont care about their players or customers. They only want to make money.
