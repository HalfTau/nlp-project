Online would be fun if it wasnt such a goddamn grind to get money. Dont even get me started on SharkCards. Lets put it this way, they released a free dlc where you could buy a yacht for about 8,000,000. A shark card of that price is 99.99, thats ridiculous. Thats basicly a 100 dlc. A 100! Thats just one example. If a 8mil SharkCard was like 20 I wouldnt be complaining but this is just insane. Now I know you dont have to buy shark cards but they make it such a time sink and grind to earn any money.
