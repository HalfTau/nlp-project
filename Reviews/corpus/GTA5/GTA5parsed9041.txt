I originally bought this on the Xbox 360, when it was initially released. One of the players who got extra money becuase we all had to deal with the initial problems on release. I bought it for the Xbox One when I finally got one, and now have it for PC because I have one that runs it.That being said, its a damn good game. Microtransactions arent necessary, so people should quit complaining and find a few people to do missions / heists with if they dont wanna play, its not too difficult. Single Player is quite good, the characters are pretty awesome although Im not a huge fan of Michael, and there are a lot of cool little things to find throughout the vast world.If you want a great single player game, get GTA V.  If you can handle some people being unfair on multiplayer, get GTA V.  If you cant handle that, youre probably not old enough for the MATURE rating.
