I dont really use mods. I mean, Ive tried a few, theyre alright, sometimes. I mostly just dont feel like messing with something that MIGHT be really buggy, even if it is funny or cool or whatever.But! And this is a MASSIVE but! OpenIV sounds like it was, honestly, doing TakeTwo a FAVOR, by keeping the offline portion of this game alive. Seriously. Why would you remove something that just generally improves your game? Something Im sure some people ONLY got the PC version for? Something that a lot of people ONLY get PC versions for. Mods are amazing, even if I never like to use them. It keeps a game fresh, relevant, and entertaining.TakeTwo. Dont be Just dont.
