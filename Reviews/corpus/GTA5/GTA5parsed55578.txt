This game was revolutionary. The amount of detail in it was amazing. The openended modding community made it full of life.One of those things, is no longer in existance. I have spent over 3000 hours on this game between the PC and Xbox 360 versions. On the PC I would have lost interest in it a lot sooner if it werent for that same open ended Modding community that I mentioned above.Yesterday, Take Two interactive issued a Cease and Desist to the OpenIV team, citing the fact that they violated the Russian Civil Code. I can as a Russian, say that they did no such thing.And so, as OpenIV was issued a take down, I am issuing a Take Down on my copy of GTA V. I will not be playing this game anymore until Take Two undoes this situation and makes things right.Yours,Mikhail
