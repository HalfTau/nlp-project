The game has been a great experience and fun as hell but the fact that my favorite part about this game has died will make me no longer play it. I am a programmer and I loved creating mods and new items for the game. OpenIV made that all possible. Now that OpenIV is no longer available, I will not be playing this game or supporting it.
