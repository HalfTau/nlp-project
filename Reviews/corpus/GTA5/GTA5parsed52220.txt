Bottom line Do not pay more than 50 retail price. Around 20, 22, 26  I dont really know the specific prices and this from the retail price as of 22 August 2017Why you ask? Well thats because only singleplayer is really worth it. Multiplayer is fun for some time, but then you have to grind for hours on the same mission with random people who are completely unreliable  you will rarely find a good team by chance. You may also have friends, but chances are they arent around to play all the time. In addition, multiplayer is riddled with microtransactions that are designed around the vehicles and such. So if you seriously want to play GTA online, then youll probably end up paying more money if you dont want to spend hours grinding on the same missions for hours.So it can be said that the reason behind the no more than 50 buying price advice is that only 50 of the game is worth it. To be honest, half the game isnt even the singleplayer. Multiplayer locks off so much content which you simply cant get in the singleplayer without modding  this clearly will ruin immersion too and sense of accomplishment too. If you have friends to play it with, you can go ahead and get it but youll get bored soon without dishing out hundreds of dollars into microtransactions.I wouldnt recommend this game at full price, but if someone were to want to buy it at half price they might as well  hopefully then they will see that it wouldnt have been worth the full price.
