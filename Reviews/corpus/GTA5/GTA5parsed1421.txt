The base game is not very fun. The only reason I have any hours in this game is because of Mods. LSPDFR is great, and gta rp is extremely fun. Would recommend if you dont mind spending some time installing mods.Worth my 29.99 bought on sale . Base game  4/10 its okay but gets very stale fast. Modded game  9/10
