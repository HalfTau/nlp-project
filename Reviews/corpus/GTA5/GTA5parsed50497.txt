Amazing Game yes. BUT... If you have it already there is no point in the PC Version. You can no longer mod to the extent that was once possible, because take two have banned the famous and widely used modding tool called Open IV. Open IV was a modding tool originally made for modifying GTA IVs game files to replace or add modifications. Since its move to GTA V it has been the base for almost all mods, Take Two and sent a Cease and Desist letter to the Open IV team, and theres no other widely known alternative. Unless Open IV makes a return I would not recommend buying this game anymore.
