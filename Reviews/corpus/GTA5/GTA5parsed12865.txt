Great game in the GTA series, have many more hours on the PS4 version than I do on Steam but still a good game.Tons to do whether its the storyline or just driving on the sidewalks and seeing how many people you can take out before you get taken out.Or maybe youre at the point where you just want to be a normal person and obey traffic laws and be civilized.
