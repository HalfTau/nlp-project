lspdfr is the best mod for this game and only for him i bought dat game. anyway, im recommended gta v, but im complited story mode on pastgen. 7/10 is a good rate, cuz story not doesnt reach for iv, or sa, btw plots. trevor as a scoolboys character, not good. good graphics, not so bad optimization and fortunate son on ls rock radio make me love this game
