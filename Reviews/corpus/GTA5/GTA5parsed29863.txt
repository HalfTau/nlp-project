Rockstar, you disapoointed me so much. I looked up to your guys company when i first played gta sa as a kid, it was a blast! But when I bought Gta 5 on the xbox 360, IT WAS EXCITING! so i bought it on ps4 and it was accuallty worse online because of constant disconnecting, but the graphics were better and some more grass, yeah!!. then, i was gonna buy it on pc cause i thought to myself, OH YA, GTA SINGLEPLAYER CAN BE MODDED! IVE SEEN SO MANY MODS THAT MADE THE GAME EVEN BETTER! but when i heard of the news about mods being shutdown, i laughed to myself thinking,  Rockstar wont do that! theve shoved Shark Cards down our throats, but they wont shutdownthe only fun thing left in gta. i didnt think it was a big deal at first. i thought you could mod it still, but just differently. NOPE! you cant, and even if you managed to make the game a tiny little bit extra fun, BAN!!! there is no excuss or reason for you to do that. you just want ppl to buy the cars online for microtrans. dont even bother with defending yourself. i recomend you change yourso you can revive your franchise and fans respect, or ill never play this game again. and forget red dead redemtion 2, your just gonna do the exact same thing. goodbye rockstar, not nice knowing you. your an embarrasment!
