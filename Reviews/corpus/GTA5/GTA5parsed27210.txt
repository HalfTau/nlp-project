Personally I never got into modding never did it to GTA V always thought it would ruin the experience. So for all the people being a bit sour about the modding well all i have to say for you is you should have just enjoyed the game as it is. Its a fantastic game for what it is and doesnt need mods to fulfill the fun times. But i do understand why it would suck that you cant use your mods in single player mode, it is a bit over the top but i would like to see alot less online modders in future. I do think everyone should be working for their money and cars on gta v.
