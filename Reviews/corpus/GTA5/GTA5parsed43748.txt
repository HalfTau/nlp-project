First of all I got to preface this review by saying this is a great game and I wish that I could have left this review under better circumstances. That being said I urge those of you who are planning on buying this game over the steam sales DONT. Sadly the game developers took one of the most backward decisions in regards to the handling of its modding community by sending a cease and desist letter to the developers of OpenIV and an insult to the people that go out of their way to make FREE content for your game for more players to enjoy it in different ways. I genuinely hope Rockstar realizes that the players in their servers and the modding comunity itself are a part of the game content. And that dead servers are not the most engaging place for online players to interact in. That modding counts as a new way to interact with what makes your product so great and that it should be encouraged. As much as some people spend a bunch of hours just driving around or making mayhem in your games, players should find ways to tweak game code and its mechanics to find new ways to play around.
