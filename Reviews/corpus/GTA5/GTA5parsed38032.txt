Antimodding practices by TakeTwo butchered the reason why most of us play this game years after release. Rockstar/TakeTwo let this happen with poor anticheat services running with hackers all over the online experience, freely punishing innocent players that can do nothing about it. A kneejerk reaction because they werent, and still arent capable of providing a cheatfree/reduced online experience. Just another example of them running a bulldozer through a building in an effort to tap in a nail. Keep punishing  pushing the player base, and they will eventually push back.
