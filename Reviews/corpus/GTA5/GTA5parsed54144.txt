First it took two ing years for GTA V to finally come to PCThen you could get banned for using mods in SingleplayerNow TakeTwo takes down OpenIV, one of the main modding tools for not only GTA V but other games as well...TakeTwo clearly doesnt give a sht about the PC community.Edit Open IV is back in business, but Ill keep the review as a reminder. This wasnt their first time and probably wont be their last.
