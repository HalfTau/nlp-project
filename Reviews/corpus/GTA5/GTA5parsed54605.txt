Singleplayer is good but multiplayer can  off because of microtransaction and just how unfriendly it is.When I bought this I was hoping to mod the singleplayer to keep it playable. Also it seems that alot of updates for cars, planes and lots of other stuff need more info on all that and for most the only way for them to get that stuff in singleplayer was by modding but I guess poeple need to be forced to play their stupid gta online.Either play for 20 years to buy a car or pay them to get the money. They have banned mods on their games as I see a way to keep people out of single and spending money instead. Funny how they are doing this before E3 as like a way of staying out of sight but we people like nerd3 and Im sure others will not let them walk on us as if we OWE them more money.I do love the singleplayer and might even keep playing but Im not touching the online anymore after such a kick in the balls to the community.Also who the  sells a game 3 times and thinks that they need more from us after almost doing better than minecraftedit just want to make sure that people dont just take my word for it heres a link to a video that should helphope that clears up what Ive saidedit edit also just so you know dont blame R yet because as far as we know that take2 is the reason we are losing mods.
