Following the information from Jimpquisition 15 June 2017 regarding Take Two Interactive owner of rockstar games has issued a cease and decist order to Open IV the popular modding tool. It was known not to put mods and use them for the GTA online portion of the game for the sake of cheaters the like... makes sense so far.The crux is Open IV had strict tennants on their mods to name one specifically, they can only be created and designed for the single player portion so they were creating mods within the terms of service. They bent over backwards to ensure this and that all mod creators were also working within the legalaties to ensure no terms of service were breached. This went on for YEARS in which Rockstar Games not only publicly stated they had no issue with this form of modding on their games and actively promoted some of the mods available on Open IV on their own official blog! For the Take Two to suddenly do a switch threatening legal action?! I thought EA Ubi and Activision were bad with the antics they pull. But this if effectively telling a party they are fine doing what they are with their IP, to then suddenly change their stance and threaten legal action?! that is insane. Livelyhoods could have been created on the back of this. Its aboslutely disgusting what they have done.
