To all the narrow minded people in the positive reviews section, we are not downvoting the game, but Take two. The singleplayer of this game does not last very long and mods was the answer to all of the extra time we wanted to spend in this game. The choice to ban openiv is stupid and anyone talking about console and pc equality can go fk themselves because how many times have you seen someone create a professional piece of graphic design on a fking Xbox, Yeah.
