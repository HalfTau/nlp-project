The singleplayer is pretty good, maybe 2025 hours of stuff to do. I would only recommend the multiplayer to people with a couple of friends to play with. Also, it can get very grindy in online, so I would recommend talking to friends or listening to music while you play. Lastly, the online mode is updated fairly often, which means theres always something else to save up for or new missions to play. Singleplayer 9/10 Online 8.5/10
