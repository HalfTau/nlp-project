GTA 5 as a single player games shines brighter than anything else that tries to catch up with its standards. From character development to the story arch that ends in a satisfying manner depending on which ending you choose, theres not much you can say is bad about the campaign.Unfortunately though, GTA online is not quite so postive. Starting off in a successful way, Rockstar set out in 2013 to give us possibly the BEST mmo to date. With the flood of DLCs over the past few years though, it has only become more and more of a grind which, to be fair, is only fun if you tear into your mums bank account.
