This game seems pretty lackluster and I cant recommend it for full price. Maybe at 20 but thats still pushing it.Pros fairly well built world good number of little details for world building large open world decent story and charactersNeutral little detail in the world most weapons feel extremely similar most vehicles feel very similar physics arent very goodNegative progression is slow very little depth to characters or world similar reactions from everyone, AI is pretty bad the grind is fairly bad loading times are absolutely horrible, even loading from an SSD ONLINEThe online portion of the game which is being pushed heavily right now, is horrible. There are long loading screens everywhere, trolls who want to do nothing but kill you repeatedly are the main players in lobbies, and hackers are rampant. All of the interesting things theyve added in the online mode arent made available in singleplayer either. The final nail in the coffin for online is that the grind is insane. For example, to gain access to CEO jobs, you need about 3 million dollars. To get that much, you can do heists or jobs which net you very little money and often rely on the good nature of other players for you to succeed. Its a simple case where those whove played more and have better equipment can just stop you from progressing at any sort of meaningful pace. Of course you can just pay huge amounts in the form of microtransactions in order to skip some of the grind.Something that I bought this game for, which I had hoped would massively improve the quality of the game, was modding. However, with Take Twos current stance on any sort of modding this isnt likely at all. If you want a fun openworld game, Id recommend any of the Saints Row series or even WatchDogs instead. This falls far short of what Id consider a well made game.
