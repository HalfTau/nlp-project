After hearing about the ban on modding. I was very disappointed. I had this game for the ps4 before I bought the the pc version because I heard that you could do more things with the game and expanded the way you play the game your way.  After playing online and grinding for all the money it just got boring but modding really kept the game alive for me. But now they are taking that away. I might as well invest my money some where else.
