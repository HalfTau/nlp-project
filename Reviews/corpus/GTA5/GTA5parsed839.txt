I have 637 hours on this game. Thats 26.5 days!!!!!! I absolutely love this game. I totally recommend it, BUT I need to share this warning. This game is very grindy. You will never get anywhere unless you spend hours and hours and HOURS like 100 doing the same missions over and over again. Time is money in this game. If you arent doing something that earns you money, your wasting your time. I love this game so much i dont mind the slow progress but Im just letting the new comers know that you have to spend a lot of your time just doing the same missions over and over again. Then again its your time so why do I care. Consider yourself lucky you saw this reveiw because Im giving it to you straight up. The game is really fun, dont get me wrong but it takes aload of effort to get barely anywhere. There are a lot of things that I dont agree with but thats just my opinion. People who say you can just buy shark cards are wrong. Unless you want to spend 500us your not getting anywhere. 100 dollars will probably get you 4 MAYBE 5 good things. Not worth it. Thats all I have to say. Thanks for reading and have a great rest of your day, dear viewer.
