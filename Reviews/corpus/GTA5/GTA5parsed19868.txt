Ok, my names is Zedd, im a gamer, currently age 15, I sit at home some days and play games, but thats not the point of this review, I was banned, a month and 2 days ago, my charcter I have had since intial release from consoleps3and I transfered the character, Now, I have to say I did mod, Was not the best idea, But yet, Everything in the game is overpriced by a truck size meaning you want money, either waste a fulltime job worth of time to earn basicly around a total guess, But many would agree, 4.5 mill or small X amount of money, And yes in real life that is a lot, But in the GtaV world its like 20 bucks, Yes you may be able to buy something ranging in lowrider/Zentorno/T20 but what the time it took to grind and not buy the games cheap disgusting way for microtransactions SharkCards is what they call them, you really dont have as much fun, And yes I know you dont need cars/planes/boats/helicopters ect. vehicles or weapons of that matter to have fun in online freemode, with or without friends, or family, if you have that type of family, even then the online mode is kinda boring, Without these extra vehicles and other stuff it just gets boring I have noticed, And played with/been like all along, A summary is that GtaV Online, As many would like it to be fun not exasuting like IRL, The truth is it takes more time really grinding then it would IRL, yet again this is my personal experince with GtaV Online since its release, Anything after the High Life Dlc is just overpriced, And a waste of time and IRL money, This has been Zedds most indepth as a 15 yr old can do with his type of attention span, so, Have fun, Remember that GtaV Online is for some, And for people like me, It is not fun it is just a waste of time, I consider it as, Peace. Also as of now I do not recomend buying this no matter what, till they have fixed this issue, which at current times, seems that it is not ganna be fixed. Zedd
