So, Ive played GTA Online on the PS4 and now on the PC, on a very high end system. The game itself is pretty fun whenever youre allowed to play it. However, the loading screens are still horrendous and it literally takes their matchmaking system 30 seconds to a minute and sometimes more to figure out who is around the same level and who they should set you up with. So basically, 50 of the time you spend in GTA0 is sitting staring at the clouds, nothing else, just clouds, and Im so sick of it. Every other game on the planet can update their matchmaking algorithms and network code to lower the amount of time it takes to find a game down to 10 seconds or less. You guys need to do something to fix this because I wont play it again until you do. Get someone to look at your databases and or reprogram the fackin algorithm to speed the matchmaker up. Its been like this for years now and youll take our money but not even provide a decent service in return? Oh, and on top of that, once youve been matched, youre going to also get the network error half of the time on that as well dropping you out of the match you waited so long for. Fix your fckin code or get someone who knows about databases to streamline them for you.
