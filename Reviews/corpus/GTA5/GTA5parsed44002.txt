I dont see why people are all up against TakeTwo and Rockstar for closing out OpenIV. I will still play the game and enjoy it just how it is and should be. I can breath easy know that i wont somewho fall into a modded room again. If you dont like GTA for GTA dont buy the game. Stop being babies and play how its supposed to be played. Hell if anything hope that they perfect it and make such mods official and know that no one will cheat.
