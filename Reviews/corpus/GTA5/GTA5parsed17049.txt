So first of all since the new update its really hard to make money the fair way, Before you could get up to 160k for selling a top range car, now you can roughly get 50k. It takes a long time for the mc businesses and bunker to fil up to sell, and servers are full of hackers and rockstar do nothing about it. However a friend of mine which is a legit player had 30 million taken out of his acoount because apparently it was hacked money . They keep making it harder and harder to make money to force players to buy their shark cards. Do not buy it, and for Gods sake dont fill these greedy s s pockets. Its a huge waste of time
