Its incredible how some lawyers make everything worseFck you Take Two, stop trying to milk the game dryI paid for this game twice. Once on the xbox 360 and once for the PC specifically for the mods. Remove those mods and what do you have? You have a game that became stale for me three years ago.I know I am not the only person with the same story. When I buy a game for one specific reason, I expect that reason to stay around for a while.Do not buy.I only bought GTA 5 on PC for moding... Now its Illegal.3I wasnt even gonna make a review for this game. Already had the PS3 version and got bored with the PC too quickly to make a good impression on the port.But with the news that they basically butchered any and all forms of mod support made me change my mind. Game devs take note you DO NOT under ANY circumstance shut down the modding community for a game.Got banned when I joined a hacked server and lost all of my stuff ,unreversible rockstar support.Also ending support for open iv is stupid.Very fun game, love the online and the story is preatty fun too.Rockstars best seller GTAV is a great game for a short time. If you realy want to play online in a Good way you need to pay aton of money like over 200 to get everything. This is realyand i just hacked the game for a good time. Got banned for a good reason and i started playing FiveM Online but offline This is much better as it has a great RP community and i have racing games to play instead of GTAV racing. A few days ago T2 R parrent company shutdown OpenIV. This is sad for me as GTAIV was a great game if you mod the game. But T2 needs its gready money and i dont blame them. But this is just to stupid for me so i wont reccomend this game as it is boring to play without mods.
