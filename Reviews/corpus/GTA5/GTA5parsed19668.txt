A fantastic open world single player game with a great story, many features and stellar visuals that are well optimized. The multiplayer has great amounts of content but limits the amount that can be done in coop, making you grind increasingly to try and push up sales of sharkcard ingame currency. Connection issues and still to this day many hackers can make online a poor experience. Despite this you can still have fun with the large amount of things that can be done, the game is worth it for the single player alone and hightly recommened, the online has too many problems to be worth purchasing the game alone for though.
