I doubt that open IV did anything bad and malicious your just preventing fun for us in single player and as much as  i enjoy the game i hate the online and its based on InApp Purchases which i hate a lot,you are just making players play the online and the only way you can make it in the online without grinding for hours,days and maybe weeks is to buy in game money and that is too expensive anyways besides your a too rich company anyways you dont even need any money
