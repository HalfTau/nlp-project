First actual intense game was GTAIV, then it moved on to GTA5 which was an ASTOUNDING change to the whole game. But, throughout the years of this game, there is a lot of cheaters and hackers in online servers. Which made almost the whole GTA community leave this game, besides the single players, hackers, trollers, and the squeemish 5 year olds who attract the trollers making this game unplayable. But if you play single player, you can cheat in many things. As well as the comfort of no hackers and annoying 5 year olds, trying to fit in. So i reccomend only single players, and trollers. Have fun raging and losing all your sht in online .
