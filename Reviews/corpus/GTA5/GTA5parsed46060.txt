For a while I did enjoy the game it had a lot of fun moments especially when with friends. The story is interesting, I didnt really enjoy the 3 man dynamic but at same time I tought it was really different and cool. However the biggest part of the game and the one R is focusing on, multiplayer, is pretty bland when analysed. There isnt really anything you can do other then races, PvP and CoOp missions.They added a lot of new vehicles and other kind of missions but in the end they still follow the same categories and it the fact that everything they is 10000x more expensive that all the money you could ever make just so youll buy their shark cards. Mods like OPEN IV were trying to allow a better experience in multiplayer. Where roleplay actually played a role and the world itself had a lot more to offer.This wasnt the first that R went after but it seems to be the one that people have rallied up the most about.So thats why Im writing this. So that I can let people be aware that R is killing their game and will continue to do so with their other franchises.Now I know it may seem counter intuitive seeing that I did buy it but if you still havent bought GTA V I recommend you dig in to everything the games has to offer before making your choice so youll know how little you are actually getting and maybe reconsider.
