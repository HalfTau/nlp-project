The amount of hate this game is getting is ridiculous. GTA online was getting ruined by cheaters, so rockstar tried to stop the people who ruined it for everyone. Theres no war on mods. Dont wanna get banned in GTA online? Dont use mods in GTA online. Simply remove them before you get online. Nods in single player are welcomed by rockstar. GTA 5 is a fantastic game, which you will spend hours and hours in.
