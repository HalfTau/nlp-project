GTA is alot of fun expcept for the fact that rockstar basically created a game designed for microtransactions. Ive put almost 100 hours into the game and im basically no where. you have to constantly buy ingame currency for the  game to be fun. Some of the mission are also designed just toyou off to try and get you to buy more ingame currency. The mission will be far too hard for what you are able to do, resulting in immense frustration. this game to its core, and  you rockstar for being so lame.
