This game stank of bad omens from the very beginning. This game had microtransactions from the start and it was built into the games design to actively encourage the purchase of these since there werent any effective means to earn money besides heists, which wasnt even in the game from the beginning. Now that take two has put their foot down on modding, it has effectively soiled the reputation of Rockstar and themselves for many players, just so they could sell more shark cards.You cant give stuff away for free in perpetuity theres no business model in that, but were not trying to optimize the monetization of everything we do to the nth degree.
