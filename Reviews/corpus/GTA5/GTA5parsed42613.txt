no support for accounts wrongly banned due to in game features glitching, no community support for OFFLINE modding, and just bad ethics from Take2 and Rockstar in general.Also for its age and the in game money grabbing methods used and the cost incured by these methods to Pay To Win it is well and truely overpriced for its age and the consumer support it provides near to none.Recommendation Do NOT purchase this product until they sort the above issues, especially at the iflated price it carries! This should clearly be a 1020 game!SUPPORT YOUR COMMUNITY
