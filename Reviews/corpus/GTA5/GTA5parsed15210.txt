Still one of the best games ever made.Graphics  still looks great maxed out at 4k next to more modern games, with loads of customisation options to get it running really well on any pc with a 2Gb or greater card, albeit at lower resolutions.   8.8/10 next to modern titlesAudio  sound track is as expected with GTA nowadays, nice variety and apt!    a solid 9/10Gameplay  enough free roam to keep you going in circles for a loooong time, and, enough mini games etc to keep it fresh for a long time.  another solid 9/10 no real pushing of boundaries on this oneStory and characters  10 in my opinion,  entertaining, hillarious trevor vs the fence!!, the main story arc is a real page turner and you get to pick how it plays out.Recommended to everyone!!!!Compulsory Warning  If you are male, female, undecided, young, old, living, deceased, alien, terrestrial, red, blue, black, white, grey or some or all of the above then at least some of this game will definately either offend or tickle you!!!
