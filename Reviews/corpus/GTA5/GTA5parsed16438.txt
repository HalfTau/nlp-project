Every public lobby has hackers, every time. Only way to grind to have the money to play the game is in an online solo session just so you can have a chance to grind without losing progress to cheaters. I wouldnt recommend this game to any new players unless you want to spend hundreds of dollars on shark cards or depend on hacker cash. All new content requires multiple millions of ingame currancy and huge ammounts of grinding are required for experience/cash for properties to access most of the rewarding missions and even basic gameplay features. Been playing since release on ps3 but if youre new, wait for gta6 online.
