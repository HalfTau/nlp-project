This game is amazing with all of its content and various outlandish antics, but at the same time, for a game to be out since 2015 and the cheating being this out of control... Its sad. Almost EVERY game that i enter online has 1 or more people using cheats like god mode, money hacks, pulling you out of your car and spawning police with tasers, blowing you up constantly so you cant leave the session, and much, much more. It almot makes the game unplayable.To make money online so you can get more content is something almost unattainable because of this. Nothing like having to deliver your 100k worth of stolen goods to a destination only to be stopped by a modder that can ruin your day with a touch of a key press.Rockstar, save your game. i enjoy playing this game but you dont do a damn thing about all the cheaters in this game and that reflects on you as a company. Introduce battle eye, something! its not hard to find out what program people are using and making an anti cheat system around that.I think when someone spawns a train on my head while navagating through my phone might set off some red flags.... but they continue to play and ruin it for others.
