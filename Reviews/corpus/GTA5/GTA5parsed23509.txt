This game was fun for the first couple of months when it was released, but now its a heaping pile ofand Rockstar expects you to shell out money for their t shark cards to progress online. It is impossible to play online if you havent been on for months, everything costs way to much money to buy, you want that new sports car? good luck youre going to have to grind out t missions for a upgrade that costs 1 million dollars.  you rockstar ive been playing GTA since 3 was released back in the day. Sadends me to see a good game go tobecause of corporate greed.
