Online gaming is really unfair. Random cars running in you during jobs just to damage your car, AI is EXTREMELY accurate, if you would stop even for a second during import/export or other misions  you die. You want to play online  wait 15min for the game to load, also be inactive for couple minutes, and you will get kicked. Every second game has hackers that will try to get you banned by dropping money bags or trap you and exploding. One time my balance was adjusted 1mil, 3 weeks later, adjusted 400k. A lot of kids screaming into mic, you need to turn the voice chat off. Single player is fine, but online experience is pure garbage.
