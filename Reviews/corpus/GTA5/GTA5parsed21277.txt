Bad Modding Community, Seriously ed up GTA Online, to the point that the only way i could play it was to Boot myself away from any other players, or play friend only.GunRunning dlc FIXED EVERYTHINGIt improved gameplay, Gave us more to do. Some people complained about prices being too high but honestly i think they are fine, if not just right.They tried to shut down OpenIV Can you honestly blame them!? Bad modding community had been destroying their game for so damn long! though they noticed the mistake and went back on the decision.yes, the game uses Microtransactions, No, it is not the only way to enjoy the game. Truth is, if you enjoy the game and take time to play it you DO earn enough ingame cash to get all the stuff you need. I played this game on 360 for about 2 years and I never once brought a sharkcard. I didnt need to the ingame cash was already plentiful!You are aware all their dlc is free right, haters? The ammount of time and effort they put to making that dlc, warrents some form of income. Ofcourse they will have microtransactions. You can buy shark cards and get instant access to the sweet dlc missions, or you can take time to play the game and earn em ingame. Its fairly managableI honestly do not have a single bad thing to say about GTA online other than perhaps that its still lacking a couple little features. Online stocks n shares still not active, doubt they ever will be, Online Casino not active, doubt it ever will bethe gameplay is rich with content, there is so much to do, so much more than most games.Seeing this game with negative reviews over people being upset over the whole modding thing...Is Tragic...This really is the best online shooter Ive ever played and as a Single player game, its got plentiful content still. Though after completion of the story it does become somewhat lacking, honestly the online is where GTA ShinesWorth every penny I paid for it.
