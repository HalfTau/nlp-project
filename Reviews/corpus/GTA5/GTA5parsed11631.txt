You can never get bored in this game, especially with friends. Good story with many hours of possible time to explore everywhere. Multiplayer is where it is the most fun, but can be the most annoying. I would recommend having a group of four so you can do most things in the multiplayer. Note if you dont like dealing with trolls in multiplayer and yet want to be able to do the same things, you can suspend the process through task managerperformanceresource monitor and suspend it for about eight seconds or have a friend tell you when you leave to resume itsometimes it might kick you out to the singleplayer, but just try again or have a friend try while your loading back in.
