Let me tell you, I got this game on release date on Xbox 360, again on PS4, and again on PC. I worked hard on my multiplayer character, I had everything I wanted and more, I was level 140 something, and then I got PERMANENTLY BANNED after their stupid broken cheater system banned me when a modder came in dropping cashThey have THE WORST support. I tried emailing AND calling them, and its like robots, they just say there are many reasons a ban can trigger, we cannot reverse it. Ive never hacked nor have I attempted to go to multiplayer without removing singleplayer mods. That brings me to another point singleplayer. After being permanently banned from GTA online, I decided to mod the crap out of singleplayer so I can still enjoy the game. Well guess what? ITS ILLEGAL NOW! There is absolutely no reason for me to play this game anymore, I cant enjoy online mode with my friends without rebuying the game first, and theres absolutely nothing to do in singleplayer UNLESS they can come out with that stupid singleplayer dlc that weve been waiting for 3 years for. All rockstar and take two want is your money, dont let them fool you. Youll be needing the 100 shark card to afford a single car from any dlc and fully upgrade it. This game went downhill real quick, and rockstar claims theyre against take two taking down OpenIV but they also lied saying it allows you to mod multiplayer, when in fact, openiv gives you a warning and will NOT allow you to go into multiplayer when you have mods installedSo they are clearly lying but trying to seem innocent, typical rockstar for you.Overall ReviewTerrible Support, if you could even call it that.Terrible anti cheat systemTerrible banning system bans innocent players over and over againNo single player dlc and probably not comingStill no jetpack, that Chiliad mystery has been on for 3 years and still nothing newNo more mod support because its illegalThey just want your money
