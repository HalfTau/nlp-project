GTA Vs movement feels bad. Its too sluggish as a shooter, and you spend a lot of time shooting. The default speed is a walk, and it takes a slow moment for the character to accelerate to a run. Even when you hold the run button, your character doesnt move that fast. There is no shoulder swap, which makes going around right corners inconvenient. The car handling feels so arcady and shallow. I was one of the people who actually enjoyed the more realistic physics of GTA IV. It wasnt just about going really fast all the time.I played this game two years ago and have still not felt like replaying it. Maybe its because I got tired of the GTA formula. But I blame Rockstar for not making significant enough improvements and sticking so close to what theyve been doing for years and years. I barely remember the story and I didnt like any of the characters. Theres no sincerity in the writing. Everyone is an , a loudmouthed caricature or a dullard.GTA Online is a time sink with little reward. It took a long, long time of playing the same missions over and over to afford an apartment with a garage and cars, the American dream, as the achievement calls it. I guess now that I have those, Im done? There are too many loading screens and lobbies in the multiplayer. Even trying to play simple deathmatch takes too long to bother, and its not much fun anyway, since the versus maps are mostly flat and open and a lot of people use softlock autoaim.
