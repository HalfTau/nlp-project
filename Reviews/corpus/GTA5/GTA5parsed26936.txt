I like how R took all 4.8 million of my hard earned in game money just before the update. I dont cheat, I dont hack. WTF. Trying to get a hold of them is extremely difficult. Please, if you havent spent money on this game yet, dont. Its full of hackers, and R will randomly remove your money without reason. I didnt even get a damn email.UpdateIve been in contact with R support. They utterly refuse to look into it, past the fact that some algorithm claimed I was cheating. Ive asked them to provide proof twice, they dont even acknowledge the request. They keep linking me to bullsht articles about how cheating will lead to bans and money grabs. Ive played this game since launch, I have over 2300 hours, but I cheated 4.5 million...  this game. Rockstar.
