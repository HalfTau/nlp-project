Great game.Online is fun with friends doing heist and messing up on them.Story mode is really good, i played it on old generation and then on PS4,now im here.Story mode with first person makes some missions more fun/interesting,like Dead Man Walking,Caida Libre etc.Theres a lot to do,collecting letter scraps for the mystery,UFO parts,underwater submarine parts or even nuclear parts that are scattered across the map.Vehicles handle better than they did in Grand Theft Auto IV,property togeneral,theres a lot to do.I recommend this game for anyone that wants to try this,they will be supporting it for some time so theres more stuff to be added.
