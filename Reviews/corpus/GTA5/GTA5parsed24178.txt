The online mode was one of the greatest and funniest game I ever played before. Many fun features, lots of things to do, cool open world PVP, cool house system and so on.So you will ask me, if you liked so much the game, why the negative review? Simple HACKERS, HACKERS everywere.Im so in mad with Rockstar because they let one of my favorite games become a mess. It is IMPOSSIBLE to play online since HACKERS can mess up with everything and the worst is that we dont see a strong policy against this kind of action.I played and I stop many times. And every came back I tried to believe that they have dealed with the HACKER problem, every time I just get more frustrated.Because of this I highly recommend you to NOT give your money to a company that disrespect the legit players.
