Still a fantastic open world game.Most of the negativity comes from normies who played the multiplayer too much.The actual single player is topknotch. I have never played a game that has such good writing and characters, whilst also being so insanely hilarious at times. Everything is a lot more seamless than gta 4, and the gameplay mechanics are beyond anything you could reasonably expect from a sequel.The only actual issues I have are the downgraded Physics and the overabundance of killing in the single player missions.Youll notice that the physics for enemies arent nearly as detailed as they were in 4.Enemies arent as reactive to getting shot at as they were in the previous game.The technological downgrades arent a huge deal, but the excessive killing can hurt the story a bit. Like, I know the trio of characters are experienced, but I dont really think they can down 30 guys in the span of 1520 minutes.However, I think thats more of an issue with video games in general, and not gta 5.Its just something that stuck out for me as I played.Everything else is great though lmao.Buy it
