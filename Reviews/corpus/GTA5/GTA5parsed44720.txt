Take two you ed up hard screwing up multiplayer by having  hacker detection and microtransactions is one thing but screwing over modders who love your games and create new content for free is just taking it to a whole new high of stupidity and from what i read from the interviews with your ceo its just dispicable as the only thing he cares about is making as much money as he can get he doesnt care about making games that reinvent how we see games he doesnt even play them he is just a greedy businesman with a suit made out of the tears, blood and sweat of other people.
