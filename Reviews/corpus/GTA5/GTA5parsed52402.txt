Game was fun when it lasted but i feel that since taketwo just thinks modding the only thing keeping gta v alive rn is not a good thing and they keep releasing these bad dlcs like people actully care about gta v online if u wanted to people to care about ur online game how about u change the 10 hour loading screen!!!!!!!!! uninstalled gta v and will never install it again and will NOT BE BUYING any taketwo game clearly dont care about the community just there wallet
