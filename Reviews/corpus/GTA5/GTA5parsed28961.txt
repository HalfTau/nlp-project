Here at Rockstar, youre only allowed to do something if you pay us for it.With the attack on OpenIV, TakeTwo essential killed single player modding for this game, claiming that it opened the door for people to cheat online. Practices like this should not be tolerated, and the backlash that TakeTwo is getting from this is very well deserved.As for my honest thoughts of the game, I was able to get 200 hours out of this game. The single player campaign is worth a playthrough, but Ive never been able to bring myself to do it again like with GTA San Andreas or GTA IV. GTA Online is an absolute trainwreck and TakeTwos cash cow. Youll grind for hours, sometimes days or weeks on end to get a new car or a bigger house. Shark Cards are a way that you can pay real world more for, in my honest opinion, disgustingly low amounts of ingame currency for what you pay and how expensive everything is in the online mode. Hackers are everywhere and innocent people are consistently banned with no option for appeal while the real hackers run free.Story mode is 7/10 Decently fun and has a pretty good story.Online is a 2/10 You may find it fun for a bit, but it quickly fades and it becomes a chore to do anything.EDIT Looks like TakeTwo has listened to the people are reversed their cease and desist of OpenIV. While this is definitely a step in the right direction, the actions of TakeTwo should not be forgotten, and they should be kept under a watchful eye.
