They completely ed why i bought this game by sending a decease and desist letter to the makers of the OpenIV mod.This mod is the backbone of GTA modding and has been for years, without it tons of mods will stop working entirely.Modding is why i bought GTA and its the reason i came back time and again to  about, but by doing this theyre ing over a community of people that mod, and especially  the modders who put their free time into making mods that without OpenIV WONT WORK.
