I really dont recommend this game because the single player is so boring and once you complete main missions rest is even more boring I would rather watch paint dry than play side missions , and multy player isnt fun at all. There are only 2 ways to get money to grind it for 1 week and spend all of it on one car, or to buy shark cards which is even worse. If you think that heists in this game are fun then let me tell you this it takes so long to find crew and when you finaly find one you will fail heist about 10 times and then someone will leave. If you want to play heists then will need good friends who want to help youits not gonna happen.
