This game has become so unenjoyable, I havent played in probably a year. You cant just play the game to enjoy the content, you either have to grind 10s of hours a week, or pay real life money which has a ridiculous return rate100 for a yacht, 30 for a single car?. The whole point of GTA, is to steal cars...yet you have to buy what you want here. Every update is a copy/paste of the last updates mission structure. So in order to enjoy the game, people have resorted to mods which was giving the game some life back...and Take Two decides to put an end to that, most likely out of spite that people are enjoying their game, but not on their accord. What a shame, as Rockstar was my one company that never did any wrong...and I tried to pretend they were still great, but theyve just pushed it to the absolute limit. Adding them to my list alongside Ubisoft and EA.
