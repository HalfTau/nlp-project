Its ironic that in a game so heavily focused on breaking the law to get what you want, the only way to truely earn any real money in GTA Online is to break Rockstars laws and rely on hacking or exploits.The only way you could possibly enjoy GTA Online without spending more than the base game price is by sitting around and praying for a rogue hacker to shower you with millions, otherwise expect to be locked out of 95 of all content unless you pony up several million in GTA.
