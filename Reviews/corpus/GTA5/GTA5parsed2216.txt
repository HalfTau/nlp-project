Well first off this game is SUBJECTIVE.With your friends or even alone you can do so many things for exemple ive got 607 h , 500 h Online and in that 500 at least 350 h i was alone so like i said you can do so many things.But there are bad things as well like Bad Modders,Community,Money requires so much grind.Etc.But like i said these are my opinions i say if you have money but this and try a bit then you can refund , sooo why not?
