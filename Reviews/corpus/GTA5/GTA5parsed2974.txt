According to my GTA favourite game for lots of people since GTA 3rd Person mode came. I cant just imagine that Rockstar Games has grew up this big. The next level of gaming and graphics is nice . Buying this game is easy in steam but difficult in retail shops I think so especially Indians, cos I am an Indian. In India buying games is not a fashion so we get pirated and cracked games to enjoy and we dont download large games from internet cos our internet providers are earning super profit XD. So I was like that till 2012 , then I too started doing those things using clever methods . So I recommend this game for everyone 3rd Person and FPS lovers. Playing online is fun but difficult to earn money. Good luckAnd I forgot to say about modding. If you want to mod and play GTA 5 try pirated dont say bad about this game.
