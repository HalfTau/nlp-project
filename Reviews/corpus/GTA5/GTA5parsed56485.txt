I honestly enjoyed GTA V very much, as is apparent by my hours logged. However, I bought the pc version with the intention to mod the game, and I did so almost immediately upon purchasing it, so I cannot recommend this game, as Take Two has just issued a cease and desist for OpenIV, which is the backbone for most of GTAs mods. If they decide to bring back mods, maybe Ill change it, but for the time being, theres no point in buying the pc version.
