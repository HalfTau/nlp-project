Just bought the Warriors on PS4 and it lags like a  in splitscreen to the point of being unplayable. Installed Manhunt recently, game crashes at the first door interaction. Vice City and San Andreas are unplayable as well on PC. A lot of wasted money and time. These guys seriously lack pride and care for their games. Figured leaving a negative review here is the best thing I could do to hurt them back.And the modding cease and desist thing too I guess.
