Dont buy Grand Theft Auto V cause both story mode and online are suck.Firstly,you wasnt able to install mods into story mode portion of the game.cause OpenIV was taken down and other applications has a similar fateSecondly,the online mode required you to grind ingame currency for hours or even days to buy items like special vehicles or a bunker.Thirdly,Rockstar tend to ban online accounts without thinking they are violating the EULA or not.For examplethey tend to ban innocent accounts while left the hackers alive.I spent over 200 hours in online mode without any modding or hacking and I received a email today that my account was banned without even mentioning any reasons.Originally Grand Theft Auto was a great game,but it was completely ruined in the past few months.
