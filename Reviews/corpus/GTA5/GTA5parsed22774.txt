Rockstar made modding illegal. SHAME on you rockstar. Screw you guys you have no idea how to make a game. You made the game unplayable. You guys suck. You have no talent or creativity. Shut down the whole game for all i care now. You already ruined it.EDIT  They gave back modding. So the game is playable again thankfully. But multiplayer is quite messed up right now. Theyre making it way too militarized. So lower level players get destroyed in gang missions. So best of luck to new players now. Still fun though.
