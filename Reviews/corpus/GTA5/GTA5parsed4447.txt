Hacking...hacking...hacking....dont waste your money on this. Great game,players that just hack and ruin most of the missions you are part of.R you need to really pull your heads in and fix the obvious hacking.How do i get my money back for GTA 5. There is so much blatant cheating in this game.... Ive had cars thrown at me, someone shot me and made me commit suicide some how with the bullet HE fired, invulnerability hacks. Its so damn obvious that I dont see how your hack detections software doesnt see people spawning 50 cars and throwing them in an instant. or teleporting etc.. Seriously I want a refund.
