 you Rockstar. Being able to mod the singleplayer is one of the main things that made GTA 5 so fun, since once you 100 the game there really isnt anything else to do. And so what do you do? Take down one of the biggest singleplayer modding platforms and then claim that it causes malicious mods to be used in the online when anyone whos played the game knows that the game doesnt let you play the Online if any of the game files are tweaked. This is clearly an attempt to try and get you to play the  online mode filled with hackers and buy their shark cards or whatever so TakeTwo and Rockstar can roll in that sweet sweet . Im sorry that you didnt rake in a total of 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS IN THE MONTH THE GAME CAME OUT.Mind you that thats only the month the game came out, Rockstars probably already raked in hundreds of billions of dollars from this game.Sigh. Until Rockstar and TakeTwo fixes their I cannot reccommend this game or any of TakeTwos products for that matter.Except Kerbal Space Program, that game rocks
