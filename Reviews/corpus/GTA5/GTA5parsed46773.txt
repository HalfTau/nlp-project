I really dont like the grinding in Online. You have to grind the same stuff over and over again for hours. If you want to buy all the stuff in the gta online it would cost you thousands of dollars. I find Gta online updates boring as all they do is add more vehicles to bait people into buying sharkcards. I think a single player dlc or a map expansion would be amazing.Ty for shutting down the librety city mod the open iv guys were working on D i kinda looked forward to that. But currently all Rockstar is doing is adding more Op vehicles so people will buy shark cards.
