Take two and Rockstar clearly dont give aabout the PC gaming community. since GTA 5 was released on PC there has been multiple bugs that have effected the performance, and connecting to servers that still exist today because the refuse to give the PC version any proper bug fix. unless it involves players cheating to get cash in GTA online, which cuts into their shark card profits now theyre going after the team behind OpenIV, and actively fighting against modding the game.Thats not even mentioning the fact that theyre not bringing Red Dead Redemption 2 to PC.that last one was a joke.... sort of.
