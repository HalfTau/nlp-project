Moving to ban moddingopeniv and inturn driving offline players online for new content to bolster their own macrotransactions, I absolutely will not stand for this.  Unreasonable prices online for cash 144.48 CDN for 8 mill  the time of this review, absolutely insane given the hackers that are online giving millions away for free in a few seconds.  I think TakeTwo should treat the modding community with a little respect given quite a few features in GTAV were features that were blatent ripoffs of GTAIV mods.Now you too can play in the buggy, hackerladen community that is GTAV.  I cant count how many times in a play session everyone blows up due to some hacker or people are given 50 mill by anonymous players, but I guess they cant really be hackers since they are all banned right?Update September 25th 2017OPENiv negotiations took place which is what should have happend to begin with.  Tried the online experience again 2 days ago after a long hiatus.  The first instance had a hacker that threw everyone around and killed them as well as removed all of your guns causing loss of profits from missions.  I changed instances and the second instance had a more vulgar hacker threw cars and people around endlessly until my game crashed couldnt even report player.Long story shortif you like the single player, it might be worth a look.Online experience  isnt.  Just DONT BOTHER.  New content is published regularly to earn R money but has never fixed the giant hacking vulnarability ruining the experience for everyone.
