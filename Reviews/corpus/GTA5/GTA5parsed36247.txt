While I love a lot about this game, the issues with the online service are unforgivable. Not only do they treat the online community as cattle to be milked, they also overtly distrust them, and have now used the most hamfisted approach to crack down on piracy and cheating, without actually doing anything to address cheating. RIP OpenIV.Their disregard for the community that has helped keep the game relevant aside, the free DLC that they keep creating for GTA Online is also a doubleedged sword. While it adds a lot of cool content, it is primarily designed to pump players for cash through the Shark Cards, unless you want to grind. That sort of setup is typically found in the F2P scene, not fullpriced AAA titles, and it shouldnt be encouraged. It also precludes the possibility of any DLC for the singleplayer game, which was really solid.Sort yourself out, Take Two Interactive.
