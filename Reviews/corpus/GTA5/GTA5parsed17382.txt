Well this is the last straw, Rockstar has decided to take away money that i made legitimately through through CEO business MC businesses, car warehouse, bunker sales and working with my friends as associates and will not give it back because they are accusing me of gaining this money throw modding. They have taken about 8 million ingame dollars which translates to about 100 dollars US if i was to get a shark card. This has made me really angry, because I have been grinding really hard just to get robbed  by rockstar under the claim that this money was not earned legitimately. If they were to take the time and look at the game records they could see that this was all money earned through sales of ingame business. I suspect that they are going around and taking money from players that have over a certain amount without the procurement of a shark card and saying we are cheating. Additionally what is to stop them from doing this to me and other again in the future. This is it Im out and will not be buying, supporting any future Rockstar games and endeavors. I will not support any company that will blindly robb players and not support their game to prevent real cheaters. I will be uninstalling this game. Good luck to all that stay.I wonder if there is any lawyers  out there that would be interested in a class action lawsuit. Granted we wouldnt get any of our ingame money back but it would hit the publisher where it hurts in their profit margins.
