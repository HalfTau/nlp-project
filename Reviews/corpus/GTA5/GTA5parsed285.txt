ReviewGraphics 8/10performance 67/10Fun 7/10replayability 7/10overall 7/10CommentsThis game is extremely fun with friends and you can sink hours into it without even realising, although the game is old it still has fairly good graphics and is not that hard to run on older card as long as you compromise some of the looks of the game which at times can really take you out of the game. I have tested this game on two graphics cards a GTX 770 and a GTX 1060 the 770 to replicate a Budget pc and the 1060 to replicate a good pc, you can run The game medium settings with a 770 at around 4560 fps Vsync enabled and of course, the game on the 1060 is fine. The game seems very grindy and I would recommend against buying it if you only have the odd weekend to play as the game is hard in online you dont get money very fast and of course this is to get you to buy shark card You pay real money for ingame money I would recommend against getting this game if you are younger and cant be trusted as there are Female strippers and drug use!
