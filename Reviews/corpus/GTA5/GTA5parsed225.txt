When I try to log to securoserv it keeps saying securoserv access is currently blocked due to your recent behavior. So basically I CANT PLAY HEISTS OR CEO MISSIONS. Also when I try to move my cars between my garages IT SAYS THAT I DONT OWN THE VEHICLE. I still can ask my mechanic to deliver it to me. I also CANT SELL some of my cars. It all started when I was in a public lobby and SOME HACKER DECITED TO DUPE MY CAR. The next day I found out I CANT EVEN PLAY THE GAME ANYMORE. What happened to this game?? DO NOT BUY. EVER. 0/5! So basically HACKERS CAN AFFECT YOUR GAMEPLAY AND RUIN YOUR FUN. Please get a better anticheat or something, but dont let legit players suffer from something they havent done. ffs.
