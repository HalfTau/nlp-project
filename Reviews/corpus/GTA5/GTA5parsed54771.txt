Used to be good, if you could get a session without a hacker. Game has become a money grab and the developers and Take Two have no shame in telling us they only care about our money. They also ed the modding community, one of the only communities that was keeping their game alive.Dont support them by buying this game. If you already own it, dont buy any shark cards. They did this to themselves.
