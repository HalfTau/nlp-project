This is the end all be all for sandbox games. Really. Great game.All the complaining about how its hard to make money, yes it is a little bit of a grind, but itsdefinetly not spend 8 hours and only earn 100. They have double xp and rp weeks for certainjobs that you can play and about an hours work of winning is about 160,000 which is a goodamount.And also the Gunrunning update is nice, its just a little expensive to get into, but once youbuy a bunker and get into it, the money comes quick. Just at first there is a little grind.And also there are heists which give you 100K if you dont host them.Highly recommend this game, and also if you plan on getting this game, Multiplayer is a lotbetter with like 1  3 more friends.They just cant remove single player mods again, that was pretty bad
