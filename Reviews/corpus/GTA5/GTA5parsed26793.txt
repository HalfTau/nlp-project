The single player mode is excellent. It has very good writing.However, overall the game has been d out for money via its online mode. Incentives to play the game modes is close to none because the reward is so miniscule, that it would take ages to work up to the vehicles that most people seek to get.They make ingame money easier to get via real money transactions, because seemingly they didnt get enough money from their record sales of the game, on multiple platforms, and two console generations over 80 million copies sold.The game is centered around its online mode. What about the single player DLC promised, it could make the game so much better. GTA 4s DLC, The Ballad of Gay Tony was a complete shift of the core game and was a complete work of art in its own.I hope the developers see their mistakes.
