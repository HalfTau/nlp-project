Well, rating negative because its getting harder to mod. Hell they took down Menyoo and other Mods as well. And before I get on the Oh well play missions, wow you used modded money, complaining about mods and etc I used to love grinding missions, the developers ruined the game though. Modders kept the game alive. How do you expect someone to buy a 10mil Yacht? Your shark card prices are INSANE! 100 for  an 8mil shark card online, WTF? Thats just enough for the most expensive Yacht w/o any upgrades.Finding a mission is extremely hard. The only contact missions Ive been invited to is Methd UpI cant even find any other contact missions I only get something along the lines of Sorry we cant find any contact missions being played, would you like to host one or search for any? I press host, and it gives me host of a LTS lobby or something else extremely irrelevant. Other than that I get gunrunning missions which arent bad, but the pay isnt the best on most of em Really fun missions though!Races arent that fun to me, unless with friends, and and the other activities arent thrilling either. So its getting extremely hard to make money. Even on console I have friends with this problem. One of em got lucky though and got  Rooftop Rumble, so now he plays  that endlessly. Hell other contact missions dont even show up after you beat a mission, just more crumy races.Not doing this for OpenIV, I dont even play Single Player. I want all mods back on MP, but OpenIV will probably come back though.Fk you Take2, you killed the game.
