TakeTwo literally ed up story, this wasnt Rockstars fault, as Rockstar is owned by TakeTwo. Edit down below.Rockstar has always supported the modding community and always promoted modding, but TakeTwo had to come in and  it up. Now, dont only worry about GTA V, as TakeTwo also has full access to all the previous Rockstar titles, and the ones to come Red Dead 2, GTA VI Etc. as well as there recently bought Kerbal Space Program, which has one of the biggest modding communities Ive ever seen.If TakeTwo wants to clean up their act, they better do it now, before their games dive into the ditch.And remember, it doesnt take 1 , it TakesTwoAlso, sign this petition I didnt make it By the wayEditOn June 23rd 2017, TakeTwo pulled from their cease and desist letter to OpenIV. OpenIV will be continuing development of their software, and mods will continued to be used. Rockstar recently talked with OpenIV, and according to Pc Gamer, it went well. Quote from Pc Gamers articleThis morning, along with a new statement about its stance on singleplayer modding, Rockstar told PC Gamer that it was talking to the lead developer of OpenIV. It certainly sounds like that conversation went well and it appears that OpenIV will be continuing development, which also suggests TakeTwo has dropped its legal challenge against OpenIV.Link to articleI will now be giving this game a positive review, because it deserves it.
