This game is 100 hype. I eagerly waited two whole years for GTA V to release on PC after hearing how awesome it was for console players, and for what? Other players will methodically kill you in free mode and/or fail heists like DJT at a federally funded fuk sht up contest. Ive put 45 hours into this rage inducing waste of time, and cant say Ive enjoyed a single minute of it.The GoodThis is the largest GTA experience to date, and the graphics are excellent.The BadThe cops are overly aggressive and capable, period. The story is clich AF. The combat functions and character animations are way behind the times. Hell, you cant even crouch! All vehicles drive like a goddamed Power Wheels Land Rover in ZEROG, and that shts expensive. In fact, everything is expensive! Want a haircut? Thats 250. Need a place to live? That will be 250k. Want a bearded combat veteran to break into your house and break your wife in half? Call my friend, Sean. Dont waste your money on this longdeparted hype train.
