On PS4, Im a lvl 527 and have logged in over 2,000 hours into GTAV. I honestly dont recommend the game to buy unless youre up to grind for a year at minimum, unless youre a sweaty. Prices in GTAV have increased from update to update resulting from Rockstar becoming a bunch of greedy, moneyhungrytards that only add stuff into GTA just so people will buy shark cards to buy said addons. Id save your money for some other game. This game is pure cancer.
