Long live OpenIV!! Now my review rant.GTA V is one of the best games ever made, period. That said its not without faults, the issue with online hackers is still afoot and can lead to an adverse gaming experience but whos fault is it? Is it the gamers fault, I think not. The online modders are just a symptom of the microtransaction placed in the game through the publisher that is causing this decay. The high price of shark card prices or weeks of long grinding required to earn in game money to purchase almost anything worthwhile in the game is the root of the problem. The game would be 80 more boring if the large planes, tanks, and outrageous cars were not in it. So one could argue that the long boring grind to get large items is leaving many players who cant spend 100 on a shark card at a cross roads. Do they stop playing this game that is so enticing or do the cheat. Steam concurrent players and taketwo response would make it seem that many players are still playing and that many cheating. The cheating needs to stop yes but first taketwo needs to look at themselves and fix the microtransaction system and grind to help act as a deterrent for cheating/online modding. Make the game feel more rewarding so players dont have to feel like they need to cheat to stay engaged.
