This has got to be the worst kind of policy ive ever seen.Not only do they disable modding for the game and essentially take away a lot of the players fun and games forcing them into thesame boring repetative content,They also had a statement earlier in the user agreements where they stated explainedNever ever will i support this developer again.Not only do i not wish to participate in these kind of activities,Nor do i feel like paying them a single dime for just an account on a game where they are dependant on clients for the servers.You buy access to the game. thats it.You dont ownThey do./Rant over
