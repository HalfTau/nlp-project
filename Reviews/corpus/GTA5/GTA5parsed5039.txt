Should you get Grand Theft Auto V?The singleplayer is amazing. The characters are great, missions are well made and the world is really engaging.It took me 40 hours just to finish the main story. Its really worth 60 bucks just for the singleplayer experience.The graphics are great. With first person added to the PC version, the game looks really good.is undescribably fun especially if you play it with friends. Causing chaos in the city, griefing other players, and doing some online missions is great fun. The multiplayer has many differend mods deathmatch, races, adversary mods which are batshit fun etc.You can mod the game to some degree.The multiplayer is full of cheaters.Some things in mp are really expensive. Feels like Rockstar really wants you to buy their Shark Cards ingame currency bought only with real money.Rockstars modding policy is discutable.The game is great fun. If you are looking for a good open world single player experience, GTA V offers that.If you are looking for a great online experience and you can turn a blind eye to cheaters, GTA V is a must buy.
