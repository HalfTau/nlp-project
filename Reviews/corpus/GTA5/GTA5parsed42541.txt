I used to greatly enjoy this game, but no longer. The microtransactions and DLC were bad enough, but now the creators of the fifth highest selling game of all time have decided they werent making enough money and therefore have decided to kill the modding community because modders are naturally better than they are. I wont ever be buying a game from rockstar ever again and I encourage you to join me in spending our time in other games whose creators care about our entertainment. Rockstar can wither and die.
