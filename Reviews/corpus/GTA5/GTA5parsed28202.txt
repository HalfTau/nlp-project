I cant reccomend the multiplayer of this game. Everything is fairly repetitive, and the minigames feel like demos for a real game that would be fun, but isnt quite there. Its the mario party of shooters in every way.The single player is pretty fun though. For people who want to play a campaign at their own pace, its pretty nice.
