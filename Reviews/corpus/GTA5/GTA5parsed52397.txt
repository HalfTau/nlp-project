I hate this game. Most of my time spent on this game it thehole that is the online mode. The online is extremely infuriating. Progress is waaaay to slow to keep you interested and you need millions of ingame money to do anything that could be classed as fun. The story mode on the other hand, is fantastic! However TakeTwo ed that part up by banning mods.TLDL Dont buy this game for the online, its ahole that wants your money and doesnt give you fun in return.
