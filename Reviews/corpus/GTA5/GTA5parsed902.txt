If you like story mode go ahead and get the game, but other than that its ruined. You wanna do a prep for a mission in a filled lobby? Yeah sure, go ahead just expect someone with godemode killing you nonstop. A modder is dropping money to people in lobby that didnt even ask for it? Yeah sure, expect a ban from rockstar in the future. Gta 5 online is completely ruined for the pc. Yeah, you can probably collect a good amount of money, but you will have to get used to the nonstop modders. I mean Ive gotten used to the modders but the game just got more boring and not legit. This game isnt worth 60 or 30 its worth 15 because it has more hackers than csgo itself. So yeah horrible game filled with little kids begging for money from modders.
