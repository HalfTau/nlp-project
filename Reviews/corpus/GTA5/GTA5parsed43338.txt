OpenIV vs T2. Thats the only reason Im leaving a negative review. GTA is an amazing game, but Take Two has completely fcked over the playerbase by not allowing SP mods and by being greedy moneyhungry developers. I seriously doubt R or T2 will ever have another game as successful as GTA V because at this point ALOT of people have given up on these developers.Sign the petition to bring back OpenIV and unfck this situation
