While the single player game was phenominal the first time i played it, there have been no additions to the single player in anyway. While the online mode was fun with friends for a little bit the gameplay got a little stale with no real direction to go. If they had a littl ebit more content on teh single player instead of the cash grab cheap content of the online then i would recoment it. also Take 2 sucks
