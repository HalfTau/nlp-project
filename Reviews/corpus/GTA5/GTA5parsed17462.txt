When they cant fix their anticheat, legitimate player who grinds missions for days and never buys shark card will get banned/money reset. While braindead cheater not a moddier, modder is someone who creates mod, cheater is just pure braindead dckwad that uses mods they found online still roaming around with UFO planes and teleport abilities. Believe me, my character have been molested for years by those zombies. Only the last couple of months that I started to play on solo public sessions with IRL friends grinding ouroff to buy stuff. But Braindead Rockstar still resets my money anyway, my LEGITIMATE money. Lost 9.5 mil and only left me 50k.Dont buy this for GTA Online. Braindead Rockstar cant protect you from braindead cheaters. They cure some cancers, but also straight up kills the rest of your functional organs.
