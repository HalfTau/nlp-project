Before we start let me just say that this game is really fun. If you have a bunch of friends to play it with I think this could be a good game. HOWEVER lets talk about the bad. First off loading times in this game are actually insane. It can take anywhere from 5  15 minutes to load into the world and you have to load into anything you do in the game. EVEN TAKING A SHOWER HAS A LOADING SCREEN! Rockstar has also made sure that it will take you a long time to get money in this game. You can get 20.000  40,000 every 15  20 minutes in game modes during double money events. Another big issue is the modders. Rockstar doesnt care enough to deal with them so most servers have modders running around screwing up the server. Which wouldnt be a problem if you didnt have to be in a public server to do missions. All in all I think underneath all the garbage is a great game. 4/10 Would get chopper stomped by a modder again
