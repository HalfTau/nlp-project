 take 2 interactive. You cant just drop modding off a game 4 years after release you dumb s. Its not fair to the people that have enjoyed the mod experiance since release, and its not fair to anyone that has bought, or would buy this game after dropping mods as they are missing out on part of the game that has made this game great.
