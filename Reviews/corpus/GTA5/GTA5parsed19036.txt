I went back in the last few days and played quite a bit. Story still amazing between xbox 360  now probably have beaten it a 23 times a fun advernture each time to say the very least. The story telling is so excellent and is just such a great experiance each and every time.but multiplayer.Multiplayer is a terrible place, I very much so want to enjoy it and I did on xbox360xbox one a little  but GTA Vs good multiplayer days are over now it is just random killing more so then back in the daymissions that pay you the equivlent of Fcking food stamps and update after update adding in expensive and almost unobtainable. not to mention hackers.TLDR Single player 9.5/10Multiplayer     5.5/10Edit again, I started playing GTA V RP servers with FiveM if you want a GTA online that is actually fun I would reccomend that.
