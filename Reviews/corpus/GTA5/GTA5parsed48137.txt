EDIT TakeTwo decided to wise up and try to reverse their decision, review officially changed to positive!Ive played this game for a long time. I am sorely disappointed in your decision to shut down OpenIV which has collapsed an entire community of hardworking people. This also makes me worry about my favorite game, Kerbal Space Program, which was recently acquirred by Take Two. I am sure that its sales will now suffer because of this, and its your fault. As such I will no longer buy future titles from you, unless you somehow manage to fix this mess.
