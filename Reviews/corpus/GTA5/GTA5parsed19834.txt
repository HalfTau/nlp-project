The latest update is top fun. My only gripe is that they finally added tools for any one who cant pvp to actually have a chance apc, etcIts still fun, but pvp has lost a lot of its appeal. PC gamers tend to be sore losers and resort to either using mods or aforementioned wimp tools if you kill them more than once consecutivelyThe story mode is crap, skip itAll in all, a good game for the last however many years. Time for RDR2
