GTA V has its pros and cons like every game. The story mode is absolutely amazing. Graphics are stunning, but also requires better than potato specs. The Online game is more mixed. There are so many DLCs now and content keeps getting more and more expensive in game currency, which makes New players lag behind. Theres still a lot of fun things to do in this online sandbox world, especially if you play it with a friend or 4.If you have no friends though, the price of this game is worth it for the single player story alone.9/10
