Actually I was gonna play some GTA 5 finally after sometime when I thought that I could mod, it was all fun and all until my friend starts talking about OpenIV getting shutdown because of T2 moments after I downloaded it again. Pure t from T2 right there.I had fun T2 but this time you fcked up 4real.
