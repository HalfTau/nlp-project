This game is... pretty divided.When you buy this, youre essentially getting two games at once. Its really important to differentiate between singleplayer and mutliplayer.Single player is fun, but only once since rockstar/taketwo/whoever decided not to release ANY additions whatsoever to single player.Multiplayer is... waaaay too expensive and grind heavy. Either, grind heavily, or pay lots and lots of bucks for all the fun stuff ingame. Essentially, microtransactions ruined the online game, at least for me.Which is also the reason why sooo many people use a trainer or mod menu. Seriously. In about a third of the lobbies you join into are going to have at least one modder, who can do anything inbetween being a benelovent god, which means giving you money, or straight up take your money away, prevent you from going into any cars, moving around, even drawing out your weapons. Theyd rather risk getting banned, than play normally.
