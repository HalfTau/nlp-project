Awesome single player story 9/10Good Multiplayer 5/10Stability 3/10Loading times 5/10Even tho this game is awesome, single player and multiplayer, rockstar didnt think of having made TOO MUCH content, so the games loading times are growing for every update. In 1/3rd of loading screens I get thrown out of multiplayer and into Single Player, which means I have to load another 10 minutes multiplayer to start a lobby which takes another 5 minutes to load.This is insane and not enjoyable anymore... It could be so good.
