Bring back singleplayer mods you moneygrubbing hacks!If you dont know what im talking about, Rockstars parent company is issuing cease and desist letters to creators of singleplayer mods in an effort to force people to play online so they can boost thier profit through microtransactions. This is removing mods that allow updated content that is only normally acessible in online play to be acessed in singleplayer, such as new weapons and vehicles. Its t and it needs to stop now
