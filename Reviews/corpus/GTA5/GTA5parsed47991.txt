Modding is a key reason I play on a computer, it enhances the experience and is a great way for the community to contribute to an amazing game.GTA V is a game that is great on its own and becomes infinitely better with mods, similar to Skyrim. Instead of praising the mod authors for creating revenue for the game they sued them. Boo.
