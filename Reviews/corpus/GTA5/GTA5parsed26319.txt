After seeing Rockstar recently take a step back from their cease  desist to Open IV I thought I might purchase the game to play.So as GTA V went on sale during the Steam Summer Sale I picked up myself a copy of the game. Downloaded the 70GB of game files and then started it up to check that it all runs smoothly. Played single player for about an hour, played online for about an hour then turned it all off.Pick it up again 2 days later, playing through the story mode note at this point the game appeared to be running no issues until my friend comes home to play online. I log out for 10 mins. When I log back in I have a 30 day Ban from playing online. Im sure you can understand my frustration.So what do I do? I jump online to see that FalseBans are serious problem with Rockstar in the past. Now Im really feeling like crap. I call up Rockstar support, the first guy just hangs up after I give him my name, guess he couldnt really be bothered working today. I ring again, explain I just brought the game, installed, logged in and got banned, this second guy Ryan just start blurting out about banned account, nothing he can do, etc. So I ask to speak to his supervisor... he just hangs up on me. Ring again, Katrina this time, I just explain I cant even log in to play game, she starts the same spiel about banned accounts. So I say Youre telling me you just sold me a Banned copy of the game? Because as soon as I started it up its been banned. Hangs up. Some customer service that is.Ive seen a few posts on FalseBans but they are all from last year sometime. It appears they are still doing it. Are there others out there experiencing the same issues? Or is there anything new we can do to fix this?To be honest this is right ed up and essentially theft, Ive paid for a service and Rockstar have not delivered. I have in no way broken any of their policies or terms of use etc.TLDR purchased game, installed, run game, banned. Something dodgy is going on here. DO NOT BUY.
