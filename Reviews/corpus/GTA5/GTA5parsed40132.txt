This game is very fun. Near perfect in fact. Rockstar is amazing for what they have done with this game, so this review is in no way damning Rockstar.Take Two on the other hand sees their customers only as cows to be milked. Their stance on the modding within this game, as well as the gross use of microtransactions leaves me in no way able to reccomend this game to anyone. It is upsetting that this is the only outlet that seems to even get on publishers radar that this new way to delivering content to their consumers is an outright insult to the people who love and wish to support the game.It is outrageous that this is the route mainstream games are now taking, and I am worried of its future.
