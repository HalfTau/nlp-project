I have played this game since 360 I have liked this game for a while and putting in around 1k on xbox 360 to around 800 on PC, this game has a awesome single player story, about a washed up hiester to about the new blood hiester and the crazed manic hiester. Its well done and the replay ability is there, since this is the PC verson you have the ability to mod the game singleplayer whitch gives it more replay ability. i just love trying to 100 the game from time to time, its really fun to do and worth the grind. now my views on the online part of the game went to getting real board of the game, things kept getting more expensive and grinding the same thing made me just not care for it anymore, But there is free DLC and this is beacuse of the mircotransactions in the game. you have access to everything and if you are a new player you will not have to worry about the grind as much do to you playing all the missions for the first time and if you save all of it till your hiesting missions and do all the challages, you could get around 14 million to spend on what ever you want. the game online gets stale real quick when you become max rank and own all the OVERPOWED stuff. just going around to kill other players is fun for like 1 hour then its not that fun and gets stale. The game modes are fun for like 30 mins and the freemode jobs get boring quick aswell, and even could make a player mad if he/she is not good at PVP do to the fact that you need to be in a public online game to do the CEO or MC work. To be real the game is Fun to new players, but if you just got a PC and already had Gta for Xbox 1/ PS4 then its only worth for the mods and the Five M stuff if you want more of the New kinda fun, apart from that its a good game online gets stale if you already had the game but if you are new you will like it.
