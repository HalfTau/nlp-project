I absolutely love this game! Very addicting!  Ive played all the Grand theft auto games and this is by far the most entertaining and fun! Yes, its Grand Theft Auto, so there is lots of swearing, killing, violence, illegal activities, but it is a game and one of the best ones!  Story mode is a lot of fun, but it is the online mode that gets you hooked!  So much to do, and Rockstar is constantly adding new missions, vehicles, weapons all the time.  I highly recommend this game!
