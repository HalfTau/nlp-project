Im not saying this game is bad, I love it. Its amazing. But... when you play this game 9/10 of you have had a gta account. and/or played this on the console. You cannot character transfer anymore. Which is the stupidest thing in the world. I was over rank 80 and well setup and I got ed over. Well being made to start over has been really fun but very challenging being that you cannot do jack ing But its still fun. If your prepared to restart, I say take it. But if you have an account and you want it just dont ing get it.
