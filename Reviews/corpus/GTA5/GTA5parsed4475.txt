One of the best games of all time but has the worst anti cheat of all time as well. Hackers wil plague your game with constant toxicity. Truly dont uderstand what they get out of script killing players as soon as they spawn over and over again but the script kiddies love doing it so be prepared for it. There is still hope though. If Rockstar gets stricter on hackers the game will be saved but if they continue to sit back and do next to nothing this poblem will keep getting worse and chase off more and more players.
