Rockstar why is your anti cheat such garbage step it up a notch will you goofs? Rockstar is such trash taking legitimate money from people who earned it and lets the hackers modders run rampent. They sent out a survey of what we would like to see maybe some proper anti cheat, not just banning and taking money away from everyone you have to have evidence to take away legitimate money fools. Garbage devs but barely decent game due to their negligance. Nice to have new DLC but maybe fix old problems first ??? no that doesnt make sense now does it. Whoever conceived the idea of shark cards is satan, GTA was always about starting from the bottom and working way up not paying your way to the top. Maybe time to look into your roots EA cough cough i mean rockstar
