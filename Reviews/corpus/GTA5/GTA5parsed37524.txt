GTA V just ruined half the fun in their own game by destroying the progress of the OpenIV team, people who are actively benefiting the game for free. Nothing could have ruined this game for me more. Its all kind of ironic being a company thats always pushing boundaries, now youre putting them up. Hope your back up soon OpenIV otherwise im never playing again... no reason too.
