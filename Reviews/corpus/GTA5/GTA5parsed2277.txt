This is the first Grand Theft Auto game of the franchise I have played, but I certainly enjoyed it. The game has amazing graphics if you have a decent graphics card. The attentiontodetail is amazing, for example, in back alleys and under bridges there is graffiti and shadows. The singleplayer mode storylines are amazing and you can play as four different characters, and each of them interact throughout the storyline which is cool. Moreover, the online setting allows you to do missions, explore, mess around, or just cause mayhem. The criticisms however are apparent The game as a very long load time, even with an SSD hard drive, and can lag or cause microstuttering given the number of textures to load. And as always, there are plenty of hackers in the online setting, so when they come out to play it can be better to just log off. It comes with a hefty price tag, but I believe it is worth it given how many hours you get out of the game, both in online, and in story mode.
