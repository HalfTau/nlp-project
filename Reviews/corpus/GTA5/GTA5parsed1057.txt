I recommend the game only for the single player, it is a solid port from consoleOnline multiplayer in its current state is broken. It can take up to 10 minutes to join online, many failed launches, joining matches take loading screen after loading screen. I spent 20 of the game waiting its unbearable for me.To add insult to injury, just found out from not following the game that I cannot transfer my character from console onto PC, which I put 100s of hours on when it initially launched on console.Also no modding support is a HUGE shame, lots of lost potentialDisappointing, regret purchasing on PC at retail price. Not worth.
