This game should be worth reccomending for the singleplayer alone, however I feel we are all aware that this is the best GTA game so far  off San Andreas s, that game was great, but saying its better than this or Vice City is some gayhipster talk. However most people are buying this game for the online, which can be summed up as  getting banned for having a single player mod, or spending your entire paycheck on shark cards because despite how fun and easy heists are to complete  they never reward enough money, and everything on the ingame market is ing expensive, need I add that shark cards are too expensive? Kinda like how cocaine was too expensive during the 1980s so we just all bought crack instead and ruined the ghettos with it  lol, and that is somehow Reagans fault because me and my home diggity dawgs dont like taking responsibility for our own communitys faults  twas the evil white man!  This game is a 10/10 based on single player, and the online is a 9/10 for what it used to be, but now easy a 4/10 for what it has become  kinda like my wife after I beat her ing face into the cold concrete pavement after she thought it would be a good idea to buy me a boxset of Friends for my birthday, Im not a white 16 year old girl who wuvz buzzfeed, I can acknowledge that Friends is a terrible show, if you enjoy it, then die. This has been a public service announcement brought to you by your good friend, Austin Jones. Goodbye.Dont buy GTA V.
