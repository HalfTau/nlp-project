Ive been playing gta 5 since release on ps3/xbox360. The only thing that kept the game alive was mods. But its so frustrating to see people getting perm ban me from having mods in singleplayer, and now they are basically completely removing mods from the game.They are money hungry company that dont give a crap about how the community feels. Its been 5 years since release and the price still hasnt dropped, and the items in gta online are getting more expensive so people have to buy more shark cards to afford it.
