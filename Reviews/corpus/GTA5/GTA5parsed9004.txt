This game is honestly an achievement of immeasurable proportions. Graphics are so far ahead of its time. Gameplay has so many directions. And yet people still could find a reason to complain. Mods dont define a game. The game defines the game. Yes, online play is plagued with countless 12 year olds installing mod scripts, but that doesnt take from the joy of riding around in a rhino tank or Hydra jet and destroying everything in sight in freemode. Story is fantastic and has great replay value. But I have to say online is a million times better. Grab some friends, this game is a blast to play with others.
