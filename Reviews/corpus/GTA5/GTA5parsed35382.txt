This game has given me hours of fun, but take two and rockstar have proven time and time again that theyre only in it for the money. Ive always thought that shark cards would be the death of this game, and it seems theyve only proven me correct. Shutting down OpenIV was a greedy move as the mods that made it into online likely only provided a small amount of ridiculous situations. The reason ultimately that they would have shut down OpenIV over a few mods made BY PEOPLE OTHER THAN THE OPENIV TEAM that may have been able to add funds into their accounts. That is a massive no no because rockstar and take two are deadset on selling their severely overpriced moneymaking scheme known as shart cards.Now the game itself is indeed loads of fun but the reality of the situation is that it is a great game placed in the hands of a trainwreck company, and the games ability to uphold my interest despite thecompanies behind it is finally starting to wear thin.At one point I may have given this game a great review, and Ive recommended it to friends before, but now its just a shadow of what it once was. Forget this game and find something else to fill your openworld desires. its just not worth providing money to these money hungry scumbags.
