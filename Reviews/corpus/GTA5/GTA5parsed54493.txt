Cant recommend. Rockstar is so obsessed with trying to force people into buying shark cards for GTA Online that theyve literally removed mods for singleplayer to make people more likely to play multiplayer and buy them. There is no way to make a suitable amount of money in online without either buying a shark card or taking money from a hacker which can get you banned. Over the course of this games existence, its slowly become obscenely paytowin, and in some cases, paytoplay, on top of the money you originally spent to buy the game. TripleA title corporate greed at its worst.
