Honestly, Im dissapointed to have to write this review, Ive played this game since launch, with over 300 hours on PC and god knows how many on console. And the problems now are just too much to make the game any fun anymore.For starters, Every. Single. Lobby. has hackers in it, I dont just mean that you see them everyone once in a while, or they kill you once or twice, No, I mean you litterally cannot walk more than 2 feet without being randomly blown up by a hacker. Its a huge problem. Almost every lobby, not even kidding.Second, its just the way they cram shark cards down your throat. I understand that games like this, games with free updates, need some kind of sustain so they can keep paying people to keep producing updates, but its honestly rediculous, you pretty much have 2 options, grind for hours trying to get the one thing you want, or buy it with real money, now I dont mind expensive things, and money being that hard to get, what good is having expensive items if anybody can do a couple missions and get them? It just seems like rockstar is doing it intentionally to get you to buy cards. Its absolutely rediculous. Its at a point where I cant reccomend this game anymore.I hope to one day change this review.
