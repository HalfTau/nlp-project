Okay So OpenIV is Back But my review still wont change,Online Now everything is pay to win, DLC Cars from older DLCs were only about 100300 now there around 1.3M to 3M meaning you have to by shark cards to get any at all or grind for days just to get enough for one car Filled with agressive players. Before you could join a lobby and not be shot straight away after joining Filled with online Hakcers Not related to OpenIV over all its a horrid experince now.Single Player Modding is back meaning you have stuff to do after completing the game This wouldnt be the cause if openIV was gone theres not really anything to do after you complete the game. There not much back story to franklin at all.Over all I still wont recomend
