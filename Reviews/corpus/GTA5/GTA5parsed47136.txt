Actively shutting down 100 legal singleplayer modding tools after refusing to develop pretty much anything for singleplayer postlaunch should not be encouraged.EDIT Open IV had a successful petition and were able to keep the program running, so besides my before stated point. The game is fantastic and I recommend it for anyone with a need to blowup.
