So when I bought GTA V, it was when it had declined a bit. At the time I bought it, modders were rampant in Online, griefing or dropping money on people without consent Rockstars systems seemingly only ban the innocent due to this. The singleplayer had nothing of the Online ported to it, making it seem way worse, on top of the grind that is required in the Online to get anything.Though there was a constant fear of getting banned due to a rogue modder, or getting my account with all of its effort reset, the fallback to this was being able to mod the singleplayer if anything went wrong so yeah, thats gone now.Around E3, where little would notice, Take Two ordered a cease and desist for a SINGLEPLAYER ONLY MOD, a mod that is the staple like SKSE for skyrim of all mods in the Singleplayer.They later claimed that it enables recent malicious mods to be used in the multiplayer, which is naturally wrong as the devs of Open IV put effort into not affecting the Online in any way.Though moves like this to get people to play the Online has been done before, this is a step too far as many, including me, bought the game on PC, perhaps after owning console copies, JUST for mods.BTW if you also disagree with this, post a negative review yourself it may seem like a flash in a pan, but it is the most effective chance of Rockstar acting as the negative review score is really what they care about.
