game on ps4 was amazing, best game i ever played, but this PC is horrible, the gun mechanics feel terrible, the driving is clunky, the controls for flying planes are just awful and the online experience is ruined by people dropping stickies on you every time you try to do a CEo/Smuggler run mission in free mode, the game should not be played on PC sadly
