Got this on the Holiday Sale because I had the patience to not spend on the game for 60. The game at this time during the Holiday sale was 24. Which honestly is the price it is currently worth right now in general without sales.GTA 5 Singleplayer is a complete blast, so much fun and so many things to do. The game just goes your way and you have a nice and smooth storyline. A lot of sidequests and tasks to complete outside of the main storyline. Honestly what more can you want? Well that is why we have GTA Online.GTA Online, well this is no where near GTA 5 Singleplayer besides the fact that you get more and more things to do which keeps you entertained. In some aspects of course. GTA Online has become horrible due to very very very long loading times. Not only that, random connection drops and having somebody disconnect because of GTA Online servers ing up which cancels the heist missions.Another view is modders and cheaters that either purposely attempt to get others banned from the server by dropping a lot of money and cases on players.Another experience I had was when I had a group of players to do a mission with me from my Clubhouse and I was the President. Then a few moments into the mission, I get a dude in a tank with his friend spawn right on me and kill everyone in the mission from my group. Which is not fair at all...Another thing is using the Orbital Strike, that is just ing stupid. It is one of the most cheapest ways to kill players and groups of players.GTA 5 Is an outstanding game itself, thank god Rockstar hasnt touched or altered the singleplayer from this point because there would be even more negative reviews. But Rockstar is now only focused on GTA online to hoard a lot of money from players who buy Shark cards. Because grinding is so much harder than before.GTA Singeplayer  10/10GTA Online 4/10If this game was 24 dollars then It would be decent because of the singeplayer but since its still 60 ing dollars since its release, it is a no for me...
