If you hate the company behind it, then i wouldnt recommend the game.However if you like high quality games with a pretty good story and fantastic visuals then I highly recommend it.The gameplay hours Ive sank into this game will only increaseOnline is a hit or miss.Sometimes Im spending hours having a great time, other times Im teleported, set on fire, blown up and locked in a cage all by one player for his lulz and quit 5 mins in.If you like mods and single player things are looking good again for you, but any of youwho use them in multiplayer should  off.
