I bought this game the day it was released on Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC. I absolutely love this game along with all of the others. Mods are what kept the fun coming for me. They are why I still loved playing GTA every chance I got long after beating the story. However, T2 has now decided to take that away from me and the enormous community who love single player modding. Undoubtedly, as a pathetic attempt to sell more Shark cards. I guess the 180 dollars from all of the people who bought the game three times wasnt enough. Had I written this review a few days ago I would have recommended this game. I cant bring myself to do that now that they have shut down OpenIV. Shame on T2 for doing this and R for allowing it to happen. They just shot themselves in the foot big time.
