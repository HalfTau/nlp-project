It saddens me to write a negative review on a game that I considered as one of the few masterpieces id recommand to anyone.Bethesda going for paid mods, and now GTA V blocking mods to have people buy microtransactions for a game that has not been updated since forever on single player.The saddest part is that this is in no way made in the players interest  its really just about forcing players to buy their shark t whatever, they dont even care if they remove the fun for all legit modders that didnt go online with it, this is a step taken towards profit, and NOT AT ALL for the players.And that mentality alone should stop anyone from buying this game, and any other upcoming games from Rockstar really. Either make games for the players, or dont make games at all.
