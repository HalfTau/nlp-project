This game is so glitched and rockstar only fixes bugs that make you get money, because they only want you to buy sharkcards for ING MUCH RL MONEY and when you do a mission that will give you lots of money then there will just come this glitch and destroy the vechicles that you use, or disconnect you and about ing 100k will me lost or more, This game wants you to buy Sharkcards to waste your money and make them gain a lot.. then dont give aabout any glitches, all they care about is modders, moneyglitches and ing money... and they add new dlc just to make you spend more.. they dont give aabout their community. they just want money, they dont want you to be happy, they want you to play only this game and waste your money.. rockstar is nothing but moneyhungry bunch of d!cks. dont buy this game. all that will happen is your money get wasted. and if you wont buy money, u wont enjoy the game.. gta is 100 pay to play. so please, think twice before buying this thing that they dare to call a game.
