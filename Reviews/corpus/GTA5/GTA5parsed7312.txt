A 5 year old game that takes years to load just to be greated by a bunch of moders and hackers in almost every gamemode.Slow grinding by which I mean doing the same heist over and over again. Looking forward to the new heists, but I still hate this game for how hard and frustrating it is to actually get into a normal game and play.Most of the game is loading screens and if you dare alttab, watch a video and be idle for longer than 1 second after an hour of loading screen time sometimes when leaving a session it gets bugged and the game never loads it kicks you of the server and you have to load all this crap all over again.The game just crashed as I am writing this.I would only recommend this for 15 or perhaps even less.  30 loading, 30 trying to get into a lobby with all your friend as THERE IS NO PARTY SYSTEM, 30 finding another lobby because the one you were just in was a modder and his friends having loads of fun taking a ps at you and at last 10 of some gameplay.
