I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such moments, big and small, that make San Andreas  the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas  feel like a living world where anything can happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly wellrealised world and tells a story thats gripping, thrilling, and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series, and theres no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasnt been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. Its immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the autoaim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road, though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last, Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons, mission checkpointing, ensuring that you never have to do a long, tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again.
