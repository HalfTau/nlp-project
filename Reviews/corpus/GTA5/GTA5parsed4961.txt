Gta is a great game especially with your friends, theres hours worth of content and lots of fun to be had. My issue is the support, I accidentally linked my steam account to my old social club account and the process of getting it unlinked is painfully bad, the support took 2 days to respond to my request and when they did respond i didnt even get my account unlinked instead they wanted me to send them the same exact info i had just sent them to get it unlinked and that wouldve probably took a whole nother two days, but luckily i found my cd key so all is good.
