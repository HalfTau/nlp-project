After downloading GTA V, it took two weeks and many frustrating attempts to actually activate the game due to the Social Clubs lack of support from Rockstar and connectivity of their servers. After I finally got it activated, I learned I could no longer transfer my character from my old console. The entire reason I bought the game. Hundreds of dollars spent on shark cards over the years and thousands of hours building up my character all wasted. Thanks, Rockstar. Apparently they dont care about their longtime customers anymore.
