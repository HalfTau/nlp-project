The game has lost its touch from when it first came out. This use to be a game where the joy and fun came from player interaction with friends. It was a giant sandbox where you could just mess around, and updates were actually looked up to. Now the game has been warped into this PaytoWin game where all the new DLCs need you to be afluent up to your eyes to experience them. This isnt even on top of the horrible service that Rockstar gives to their player base. Dont get me wrong, the game is good, but I can no longer stand by with a positive review. The Multiplayer isnt what it use to be singleplayer only can last so long with mods before thats burned out too. GTA 5 is seeing the end of its days if Rockstar follows down their money grab road
