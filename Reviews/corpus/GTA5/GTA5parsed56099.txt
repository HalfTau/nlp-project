TakeTwo Interactive screws the modding scene, hurts the PC community, all while NOT being able to fix the important stuff cheaters in GTAOStomping modding tools like OpenIV into the ground forever will not change the cheating issue, and everyone knows that. Meanwhile DRM makes it basically impossible to store and keep an old copy of the game for SPmodding purposes.EDITAs of 23.06.2017, TakeTwo has revoked the Cease and Desist Letter against the OpenIV team. My negative review will be changed back to a positive one.EDITSteam Sale Badge!
