This game is slowly spirally into a deep pit of despair. At first when it came out on the Xbox 360 and PS3, it was quite the nice game, everyone wanted it because its the next GTA game. I personally enjoyed it so much that the hype continued throughout to the next gen consoles and bought it there. The only reason I bought this game for PC though, was for modding. And now, thanks to Take Two and their greedy selves for money because they arent making enough money when the game is roughly 2 selling they decide to shutdown OpenIV because it disrupted the online community. Well, jeez sorry we dont like having to pay 100 everytime you release DLC just to buy everything and that wed rather use mods to enjoy singleplayer. Hope you enjoy your negative reviews Take Two, because thats all youre going to be getting for quite a while.
