Single Player is amazing. The story, characters, map. Even after playing over and over again its still entertaining.However, GTA V online is incredibly disapointing as you come acrossed modders too often who ruined this game E.g. Teleports to your location while invincible and kills you and repeats the process, also the overpriced Vehicles which you have to put in many ours sometimes over 24hours just to get 1 vehicle that you may want to Purchase which i am also disapointed with. Other than them two complaints i am happy with the game.Also i would recommend you stay away from buying shark cards as they are not worth it E.g.Great white shark card 12.50 in real money for 1,250,000 in game money is not worth it as most vehicles/items in the game are way over priced.Not a good deal.Reccomend Buying the game for Single Player.
