6/10. Its fun for a couple weeks then it gets old. Earning money takes too damn long as usually consists of 2030 minutes of filler driving. Heists are just boring. Honestly if you want to have any fun you need to buy a shark card. Ive been grinding for weeks and still cant afford a bunker and helicopter. The guns suck compared to gta IV. Im done with this game.
