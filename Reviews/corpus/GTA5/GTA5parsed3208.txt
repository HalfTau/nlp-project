Welp, as a fellow player of Gta V i did enjoy it when i could get on the online portion of the game, but it seems the Retared ing morons at R and Take/Two thought it would be funny if they all of a sudden Drop their server claming they are Up but every single time i have tried to get on for the past two months all i got was an error stating Timed out loading Player data and i have looked at the support website and tried everything there yet no profit, maybe i will just keep it in my library as a collectable and leave it there until the devs cant slip their fat wide asses through the problems and community and FIX IT!!!!!!0/10 would not waste money on this again!!!!!SAVEYOURMONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
