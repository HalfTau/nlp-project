The game itself is alright GTA V is a great game worth purchasing, but GTA Online has been subject to many,missteps by Rockstar. The prices for most everything in Online are ridiculous for everyone except for whales or people who spend an excessive amount of time farming, but Rockstar does not give a single flying flip and keeps adding more and more ridiculously expensive content.Recently, with the Cease and Desist sent to the developers of OpenIV, a modding tool keeping alive large parts of the modding community, in the name of fighting against cheating, Ive been forced to change my review to negative. It was Take Twos decision to send the CD letter, but with Rockstars dismissive attitude towards the community and general mistreatment of GTA Online I feel sufficiently justified.In short GTA V  GoodGTA Online  BadRockstars business practices  Terrible
