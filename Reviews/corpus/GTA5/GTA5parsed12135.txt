Singleplayer is alright. If you have no intention on playing GTAO then the game is fine.GTAO on the other hand is completely terrible. Rockstar does not care in the slightest about the player experience and only wants to sell as much shark cards as possible. The grind is completely designed for that. One or two missions may be fun the first two or so times you do them but after that it all blends into the same monotonous mush.The game is also completely saturated with cheaters that Rockstar will do nothing about because blowing up every player in a session, trapping players in cages or teleporting players into the middle of the sea is fine with Rockstar. The only cheats they might on occassion do something about are money cheats because if youre cheated money then you dont need to buy a Shark Card.Too much effort is needed to have some bit of fun in this game and nine times out of ten it will be ruined because someone decides it will be funny to spam explosions on you with their cheat menu.
