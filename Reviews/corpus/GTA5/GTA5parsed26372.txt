First of singleplayer is great story wise new stuff jada jada is great from the older games from the ip.,but the company has frankly stopped developing the game to attempt to dry out every player out of their money in multiplayer. Instead of making modders/indie devs make the game better they bash out these people so they can earn more. Just look at GTASAs multiplayer, why cant this happen with gta 5?
