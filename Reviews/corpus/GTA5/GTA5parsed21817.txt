GTA Online is just getting worst. The only way to have fun with these new DLC is to buy shark cards or meet a hacker. Grinding out 5 million for one thing gets old real fast when heist only give you around 300k. Ive been playing this game since release day and am very disappointed in what it has become. I thought 500k was alot for a car but all they are doing is raising the price.
