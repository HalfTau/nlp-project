GTA V is a fun game, the campaign is amazing, the gameplay is solid, the map is huge and diverse in settings. I have enjoyed every minute of playing the GTA V campaign. My issues with the game are in the multiplayer. GTA Online would be fun if it wasnt such a grind fest to do anything in it. Payouts for missions, games and heists are nothing. It takes forever to get enough money to buy even the most basic items like clothing, guns and ammo. If you want to play with any of the cool new vehicles they keep releasing, youll either need to playing nonstop for hours just to buy one thing, or you pay real money for in game money. I also keep running into problems with hackers on servers. Want to drive your nice new car out of your garage? Well too bad someone put a massive windmill in the road in front of your apartment that smacks you the second you pull out. Or youre teleported to the top of a mountain, instantly given a 5 star wanted level and shot by 30 officers and helicopter while you cant move. It feels like Rockstar only caares about selling you shark cards, and not the expierence of their game.
