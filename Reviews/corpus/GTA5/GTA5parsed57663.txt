I do not support Take Twos recent threats in any way. The modding community is one of the many things that keeps this game alive. If you were to not just remove these mods, but sue the people behind them, you will have one of the angriest fanbases of any game on Steam. I hope you  at Take Two and Rockstar understand you are basically deleting your game from existence. Have fun you bloody pillocks.
