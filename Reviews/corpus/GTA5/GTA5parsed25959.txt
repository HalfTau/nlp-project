Dont buy this diarrhea doodoo of a game for it has been ruined by a freedomhating tyrant TakeTwo Interactive. TakeTwo Interactive needs to consume a variety of batteries in the hopes that they will bust with contact of stomach acid causing the batteries to release justice in the form of sulfuric acid making them experience severe burns throughout their stomach, intestines and, if were lucky, their anal cavity. If you think otherwise id suggest eating a steaming pile of feces and placing your testicles upon a hot iron before cooking some wonderful apple, or maybe stawberry if that suits your fancy, toaster strudels in the comfort of a freshly poured bath with some exfoliating lavender bubble bath.
