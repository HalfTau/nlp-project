Single player was lots of fun, I got the time I wanted out of the game just from that.The multiplayer on the other hand could be really amazing but its just full ofusing mods to abuse the game.  Rockstar only cares about adding new content so that they incentivise people buying their cardsharks for microtransaction money. Its almost impossible to play an online session without someone in a flying car carpet bombing the map or instakilling you inside your own garage.No  you Rockstar if you were a moral company youd fix thisfirst then worry about making more money on top of the already massive number of copies youve sold.
