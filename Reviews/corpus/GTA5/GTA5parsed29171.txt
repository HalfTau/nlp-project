Garbage game.So many negative things Idk where to start.Online items cost 10x the single player items because the whole online GTA is designed to scam dumb people into paying real  for virtual .Now they shutdown openIV and all mods becuase people were able to get money without buying sharkcards and it became to the point their anticheat was getting 5 or less of the people with all the new undetectable money haxNow people spawning  became undetected, this is their final stand because they cannot defeat people bypassing the need to buy sharkcards anymore so they sent CD letters to all the modding communities..Other than that its a grind game that leaves you with what to do with all the  you grind for? Buy cars, upgrade, and then what? Buy ammo for a million dollars every day to defend and attack other annoying players.. Really once you have housing and cars, the game is a boring open world filled with annoying players, and run by a company looking to ban you or take your money for any reason.. If you arent buying sharks cards these devs are scheming a plan to get you too. Welcome to the new TakeTwo motto the CEO has announced all their games to follow this sht model in the future. Time to wake up players and stop giving into this nonsense, dont buy their games, dont buy their DLC/Fake
