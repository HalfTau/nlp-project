My favourite IP ever... destroyed by the developers and publishers who created it.Why would you destroy such a good and beneficial project as OpenIV that HELPS and BENEFITS your series?? All for Shark Cards. So much greed.It wasnt Piracy, it wasnt anything but people purchasing your games to mod them for their own and others pleasure. You should be THANKFUL that people want to do this, you should be PROUD!Seriously, screw Take Two and Rockstar from now on. Ive been a fan since GTA London, I own posters all across my gaming room of your once was fantastic IPs but not no more. Youre just money grabbing greedy douches with zero care for your fanbase who bare in mind get paid NOTHING to mod, all for further promoting your games and making them more fun and enjoyable.Perhaps you should take a look at other developers and how they actively PROMOTE modding, as it is super beneficial to IPs in general.The real problem is R and T2 not implementing a good anticheat, with all of their money and talent. So, lets instead take it out on the SINGLEPLAYER MODDING. OpenIV didnt even allow you online with mods activated! How pathetic can you all be? ?Pathetic, absolutely pathetic.
