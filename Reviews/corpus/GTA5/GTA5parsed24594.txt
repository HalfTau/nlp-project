GTA V is one of my favorite games of all time. The map was beautifully designed, the characters, the story, and the voice acting is all amazing. The driving mechanics and car customization is better than most racing genre games Ive played. I just wish they would have come out with some singleplayer DLC because I cant get enough of this game. The multiplayer is fun too, but it waters down the features that bring the openworld to life.
