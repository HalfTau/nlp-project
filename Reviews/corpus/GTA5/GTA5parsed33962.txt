Fork Take Two for shutting down OpenIV, if Rockstar and them want MP Modding to stop, then maybe they can get off their lazy asses and do something where you cant join MP if you have a modded game, but NO, lets just completely forking ANNIHILATE modding alltogether. Now singleplayer modders like me cant enjoy the game anymore. Thanks Rockstar.
