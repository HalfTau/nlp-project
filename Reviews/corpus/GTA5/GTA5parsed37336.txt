I am very disappointed with the way rockstar and taketwo s descisions to not only not create any new single player content but move more towards the paid dlcs. the online is almost possible to get into due to the ridiculous high cost of everything. you have to buy shark cards if you hope to have any fun. they are also making it impossible to mod even the single player why take that away from people for no reason at all. rockstar is going in a horrible direction and im very worried about the future of their games.
