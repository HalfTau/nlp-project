Playing this game right after GTA four and others in the series before it were great! I got to understand more about the world, and small easter eggs within the game. The story was prety good youre bound to like one of the three main characters.If you enjoyed a GTA game before this one, it is very safe to say you will like this one too.Its pretty much plays like every other GTA, but with improvements.But Im guessing more then a few folks got this game for grand theft auto online.I was in the boat too a friend picked this game up for me, and 500 hours and some change later I tried the story and completed it.Dont do what I did play the story first.GTA online I wont get into the dirt about there are more then enough reviews for that.Ill simply make a small suggestion.Get your pals and play every now and then. Plan out what you want to buy in game, and you should never need to by those shark cards, Unless you just have to have everything, Moe often then not one of your pals will have enough cash to start the next update for all of you.My recommend this game for the story and single player alone.The online. is a mixed bag If all the online stuff bugs you get it on sale, and maybe a copy for friend or two.Cheers and happy playing.
