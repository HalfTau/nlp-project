Since Rockstar resolved the issue with OpenIV Ive removed the part about the single player mods being removed.The single player campaign is probably one of the only aspects I still like about the game, if you want to use the game for single player I strongly recommend it.MultiplayerThough Rockstar recently brought back single player mod support to the game and more or less made peace with OpenIV my review still remains negative.Heres whyAlmost the entirety of recent multiplayer DLC is the same thing with new textures CEO, MC, Bunkers and now Hangars which as much as they look interesting they in the end offer the same thing over and over againMy reason for saying this is because they all just feel like the same mini games with a small change in it where in a Company you may be carrying crates to a warehouse and in a Motorcycle Club you can carry counterfeit money to a ware house in a Bunker you can carry weapons to a warehouse, and with the newest DLC for multiplayer you can now smuggle goods in planes which is probably the only unique or interesting DLC since CEOs were added.All of these special collection of minigames for their prices usually between 14mil in game dollars Just feel the like the same repetitive game.The community is not regulated at all and hackers in public games are everywhere making the game unusable people can still put an object on top of you repeatedly killing you, force you to blow up personal vehicles making you into a bad sport or just simply give you a bunch of money that gets you banned even if you didnt use or want the money.Usually theres someone in a jet trolling everyone else for no reason in public lobbies and nobody can do anything about itYou cant do special missions for your CEO, MC or Bunker in a closed session making it nearly impossible to progress with them outside of the odd mini game they offer.There are so many needlessly overpriced items in the game which almost force you to buy shark cards micro transactions to get, for example 3,000,000 motorcycles or 5,000,000 special vehicles you can only get if youre a CEO or some other special memberEverything about the online game has turned into a grind fest for money because you cant do anything without huge amounts of fundsEven though most people ask for a singleplayer DLC Rockstar doesnt make one and never will because singleplayer makes no money.GTA V is one of the top selling games in the last 10 years and Rockstar is still beating micro transactions out of this dead horse.UPDATEHonestly overall Id only recommend this game for 90 off or better so then you have the extra money for the P2W which is this game.
