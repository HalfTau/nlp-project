Singleplayer hasnt been updated due to it not making enough money and they killed mods for it. Multiplayer has turned into every new dlc costs 60 just to start playing. After that each vehicle is another 4060 or over 12 hours of grinding the same 3 mind numbing missions over and over. The game used to be fun and something you could enjoy doing with friends. Now its just grinding or spending money on shark cards.My recommendation is avoid any game owned by TakeTwo, because like most of their games, they turn into macrotransations or dlc fest.
