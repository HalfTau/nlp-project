Always been a fan of the GTA series but this game just killed the interest honestly.Single player is good however playing online is absolute garbageGetting banned  for a month after doing some legitimate solo missions.No help from rockstar supportOverpriced vehicles, properties, clothing and weapons. pretty oxymoronic since its a grand theft auto gamehackers ruining gameplayRockstar didnt even make any dlcs for single playerBesides gta v is too bloody  expensive for a few years old game.Dont waste your time and moneyGive me a sgame, i give you a s review rockstar.
