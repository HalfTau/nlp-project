Grand Theft Auto V was one of the greatest starts for the franchise. Bundling a moreorless full multiplayer experience, as had been desired since the days of GTA 3. I have sadly yet to explore the main story, as Im sure most have as well, but as I understand it, it was fairly true to the genre, and was enjoyed by hardcore fans.This game also had one of the greatest falls from grace, due nearly entirely to greed by the developers. A Pay to Win system was introduced, and was widely disregarded, as most players had no trouble enjoying a game balanced for a non PaytoWin model. The developers soon realized this issue, and quietly set to work devising a way to increase ingame sales.An incredibly popular update came out at first which included heists and a number of luxury items and properties to purchase. The heists gave enough money to buy the new features. This was the last balanced update.From this point on, the ability to give a friend some of your hardearned cash was removed, supposedly to stop hackers. Along with this, new updates came out adding minimal features, a few really cool new toys, and a huge ingame pricetag to pay in order to enjoy them.The game becomes a grind at this point, running the same 3 or 4 missions over and over, to make tiny amounts of cash. Every new feature costs more and more money, and the options for making money become fewer and fewer.At this point, the multiplayer experience is an expensive one, spending hundreds of reallife dollars in order to try a single new feature ingame. All that is left is the relatively solid Single Player game.The modding community had been hard at work since release making the singleplayer more chaotic or interesting or showing off technical examples that would be later used to create fairly sophisticated mods.This avenue of enjoyment has been ended as well.This game went from an exceptional multiplayer experience to a fairly average singleplayer experence. They axed 2/3rds of the game.
