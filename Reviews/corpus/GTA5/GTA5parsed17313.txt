Truly one of the greatest games of all time.Splendid story mode with hundreds of potential game time combined with the sublime GTA Online.Lots of free content constantly being added to the online part of the game, with no additional cost.The game is still worth sticker price even after all these years, it is the best Grand Theft Auto game basing by content alone.Heists are great and are fun to farm, constant new interesting game modes are being added pretty much all the time alongside special new vehicles and weapons.You cant give this a bad review even if youreat online and too lazy to acquire the money. Story mode is really good even after playing it twice or 3 times you can find different maneuvers to each mission and if not you can always hunt for easter eggs and achievements.just my 0.02 CAD
