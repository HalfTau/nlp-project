Take Two can shove it. I had already decided to never buy one of their games again over a year ago when they actively sought out and banned moderators on modding forums from GTA Online...moderators who had not even developed mods nor used mods in multiplayer. This most recent transgression just further highlights T2s despicable corporate culture. Lads, take a note or two from Valves playbook.
