EDIT Changed review to positive after Rockstar acted as a mediator between their parent company and screwed over modders. Take Two remains a crap stain of a company, but at least R itself still has at least one foot planted in reality.The online portion of GTA V is infested with cheaters, and always has been. Yet it is Open IVa yearsold modding tool whose demise will do nothing to address the cheating problemthat take Take Two Interactive finally threatens with a ceaseanddesist letter. And this happens after Rockstar itself has previously encouraged and promoted mods made with Open IV on its official blog and social media accounts.Take Two Interactive is an anticonsumer company that bullies customers and longtime fans.
