Shark Cards ruined this game. It was great back in the day but now it seems like Take2 and R just dont want any of their customers to enjoy the game without forking over a ton of cash for the microtransactions. They hiked up the prices on pretty much everything and it takes weeks of grinding just to get a few cars... Or you could buy a 20 Shark Card and get it now!!! Removing mods is the straw that broke the camels back. Completely taking away the last bastion of hope we had for this game. I cannot recommend this game to anyone at all.
