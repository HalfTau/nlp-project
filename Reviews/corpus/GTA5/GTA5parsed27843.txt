Hello, I am very BIG fan of GTAV. I have over 750 hours of this game. I know this game in and out. Rockstar has done some shaddy things in their life of this game. The modding incedient is its hit new low. I being a fellow modder on both singleplayer and online and very dissapointed in Rockstar and Take 2. Being a modder online is frowned upon. But personally I had a great run. Most people think that Rockstar hasnt done anything to fix their online modding situation and has instead focused more on the singleplayer modding community. I am here to say that is not only true, but its wrong. My mods for online were expensive and quite functional. But, they actually took the steps to figure out the injection method of this modification. They did infact successfully figure it out, and I was banned, PERMANATLY. But they havnt spoken about that much because they dont want modders to know about their plans. Though they have worked on the singleplayer issue more that the online one, its still being done. This game is extremely fun, both online and singleplayer. Though its not the most communal game. Its still great.
