Late review, but it still stands.Ive played GTA III, GTA San Andreas, GTA IV, and of course the most recent installment  GTA V, and I have to say its just.. not as good as the others. Infact, its not even close to as good as any of the others. Its not a terrible game, but it doesnt do much for me.. The single player along with its three main characters are extremely boring. Theyre not interesting at all, and I feel nothing for them. I dont care that Michaels family is falling apart, I dont care about Franklin at all I genuinely forgot his name because he was that boring, and had to look it up, really, and Trevors physcho/crazy/evil character has been done so many times before. The missions are boring and repetitive, and arent really motivating. There wasnt anything pushing me to keep playing. Mods are pretty much the only reason I know that people play singleplayer . Might I also add that you can go in aboutoutside of a mission. The whole game is outside with hardly any indoor segments aside from the heists and some other missions.Now you might be thinking the multiplayer surely makes it atleast a bit better. That is only the case if you have a friend to play the game with, and I myself enjoying messing around in Los Santos with my friends, but I only do that in an invite only lobby because GTA ONLINE IS RIDDLED WITH HACKERS. It completely ruins the expierience when some retard comes along and drops you money, and you get banned because Rockstar doesnt know how to handle hackers, so they just say ah, screw it ban him. One good thing is they do update GTA Online a bit, and they sometimes even make the expierience a tiny little incywincy tad bit better.This game is absolutelycompared to previous titles. I would actually prefer to play GTA IV with my friends, and I would have 1000x more fun than in this. PC Gamers had to wait nearly 2 YEARS for this.SUMMARY
