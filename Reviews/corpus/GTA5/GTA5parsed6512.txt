I disliked how i was banned because a hacker used my name in online mode and now i cant play gta online anymore and Rockstar North or Rockstar Games didnt help me with getting back my privliges and didnt listen to what i had to say.But it is a very fun game when you are allowed to play online with your friends.Rockstar please fix your hacking problem it ruined my gta online experience and you were oblivious to what happened, sometimes you can be a very bad company and mistake things that you shou have payed attentio to.
