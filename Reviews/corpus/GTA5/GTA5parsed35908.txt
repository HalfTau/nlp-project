The single player campaign is one of the most fun, engaging, and memorable experiences EVER.GTA Online however has gone from a welcome and unexpected add on to a ludicrous cash grab on a scale never before seen. Its always been completely overrun with out of control Modder/Hackers, and their anti cheat software doesnt seem to catch them. Lots of false positives though. I caught a 30 day ban and my character was completely reset for using an overlay for my streaming software Xsplit.The newest move by the publisher to go after the modding community was absolutely beyond the pale. Eat Take 2. I was going to buy Red Dead 2 on day one, but that aint happening now. Fix this.
