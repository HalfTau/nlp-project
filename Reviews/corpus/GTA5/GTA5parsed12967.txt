I love the game, I hate the developer. Rockstar are blantantly just in it to make the money, and I can respect that theyre a business and have to turn a profit, but its getting to the point where it feels like they really dont give a rats about the actual players. Everything to do with the new updates costs a ludicrous amount of money, money that will eaither cost you 10s of hours of boring ingame grinding, or real life money. The game is awesome, but you only really get to experience more than half of what it has on offer if youre prepared to fork out some major cash.
