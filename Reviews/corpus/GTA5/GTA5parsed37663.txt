What is wrong with the people ? Earlier most people complained about modding ,your accounts gets banned , your money gets drained out by modders.  Now when ROCKSTAR answered your complaints you people are calling them greedy? WTF?HECK with OpenIV team. These modders cant even play the game fairly like it was meant for? Im happy that Rockstar banned modding  Now modders will get a slam on their faces and we will be able to play fairly
