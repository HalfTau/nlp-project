I preordered this game on PS3 and bought it on PC once I could run it, and now the multiplayer is a microtransaction, and cheater laden hell hole, the entiremodding community has just been killed in an attempt to force them to play GTAO and buy overpriced shark cards on top of their 70 dollar, 4 year old game, do not buy this game.
