I bought this on the XBox 360 at release, then again on the Xbox One at its release. I purposely bought this on PC to play through heavily modded. The entire reason I bought it was for mods.Take Two have taken two ing steps back by essentially outlawing mods in single player with a underhanded and quite frankly scummy tactic with their cease and desist. They do not deserve your money, nor time.This is a ing outstanding game, and I think most people own it by this point, but for any people like myself buying it again on another platform or even just first time buyers, DO NOT BUY IT. DO NOT SUPPORT SCUMBAG TACTICS AND ATTITUDES TO CUSTOMERS FROM COMPANIES LIKE TAKE TWO.
