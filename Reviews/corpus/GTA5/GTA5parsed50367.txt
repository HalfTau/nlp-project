Ive put many hours in Grand Theft Auto 5, with only about 50 of those hours being purely vanilla.  I wouldve abandoned this game long ago if it werent for the extremely active and surprisingly very high quality modding community surrounding it.  Take Twos decision to cease and desist the most popular modding utitlity for the rage games has absolutely neutered their audience.  This action will not only hurt Take Twos and unfortunately Rockstars appearance, but will absolutely destroy revenue generated by people purchasing these games with only the intent to mod them.If youre one of the few that has yet to purchase Grand Theft Auto 5, I would hold off purely to send a message to Take Two that this arbitrary stance on software modification is unacceptable.FYI everyone and their grandmother that has this game downloaded has a copy of OpenIV installed.  Ask around and youre sure to find a copy.
