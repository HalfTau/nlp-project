59.99 Is crazy for a game this old.Its decent and quite fun. but only in short amount of time per playthroughs.The story mode will be fun for the first half of it, but... then it will get kinda boring and bland since it feels the same in the game play department and the story gets blander with its cookie cutter  vibe as of GTA4 and GTASA with the having to work with le coppies. stuff.I would only get this game at 75 off.
