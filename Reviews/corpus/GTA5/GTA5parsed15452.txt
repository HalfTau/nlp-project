Im gonna keep this short and simple.If you are here for the single player part of the game, then I whole heartdley recomend this game. The world is amazing. The cars are amazing. The characters are just brilliant. Even though not many would agree, I found the story to be really entertaining. The story is gonna get you 1525 hours of missions depending on what you do between missions. However not that the game would become useless after that, you could always screw around after all the map is huge.However, if you are here for the online part of the game. Listen to me now, walk away. Its is NOT fun. In the old days maybe it was, when all we did was screw around with friends and starngers. But now, everything is overpriced, and everything simply becomes repetitive. It has somply become a grinding game for money so you can afford to buy one nice car out of maybe a 100 expensive cars. Repeatong the same kind of mission for 10 hours striaght just to get a 1 million dollar car is NOT fun in any means. Unless you plan on buying the online hack cheat menu, dont bother with the online portion of the game.At the end do this, install mods and enjoy the multiplayer content offline with mod menus and good mods.
