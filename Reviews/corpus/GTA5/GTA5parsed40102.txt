This was one of my favorite games to play.Then Rockstar, along with Take Two totally screwed up multiplayer.Instead of doing missions and robbing stores to be able to afford things in the game, you have to spend real world money to buy shark cards. If it was a free to play game  or even if it was a 20 game, I could see the reasoning  they have to make money. But this is Rockstar. One of the most popular developers on PC and console. Plus, its a 60 game,Then, Take Two ed over the people who put hundreds of hours into modding LSPDFR, and other mods come to mind by ossuing a CD for Open IV.Sign this petition to help the creators of Open IV
