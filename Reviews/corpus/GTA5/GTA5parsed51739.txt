Threatened a mod tool developer over something that can ONLY be used in SINGLE PLAYER and does NOTHING to help anyone cheat online. Instead of dealing with the toxic environment on GTAO and stopping the cheaters, they decide to threaten people who want to play single player. Shame on T2 and R.  Neither entity will get another penny out of me.
