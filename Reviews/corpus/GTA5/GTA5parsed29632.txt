The open world is unmatched by any other game. The detail is absolutely astonishing. This game also has a great story.HoweverThe load times are longer than myand even though that doesnt say much they are insane. I have an ssd and it takes a few minutes every time I try to get on gta.There are aton of modders online. Like aton. Not just any runofthemill no. This is after you go out to Taco Bell and waste the rest of your weekend on the toilet.Some of these modders are actually pretty cool. They have ways to give you a few million to get that yacht that is insanely overpriced or that car that looks dope but you cant be bothered to spend 500 hours on gta to get it.Then there are the bad modders. The modders that keep blowing you up over and over and over again, so fast after you respawn that you cant even exit the mothering game or move to a different server. The modders that get you in a cage, or drop you out over the ocean with the rest of the server to die. This is the cancer of GTA Online.If you get dropped money, dont freak out. I found a statement by rockstar cant remember where it is where they said that you might as well spend the money because even if you send them a support ticket with proof and ask them to remove the money, they wont. As long as you werent the modder, you wont get banned.There arent as manyonline as you might think. In my experiences, people have been really chill. Cruising around in armored vehicles shooting at police is a great experience, and was worth the money for me.This is a great game other than the amount of modders that keep firebombing you until you turn off your pc because you cant close the game!
