The single player, as most GTA games went was very nice and entertaining with a decent amout of content, not extraorinary replay value but if you liked it you will probably play through it twice.As for the multiplayer I have a checklist. The more boxes you tick the more you should buy this game. You love getting extraordinarily wrecked by paying users You love hackers craping all over your experience You love being constantly under threat of being banned you will probably get banned for grouping with a hacker and not knowing it You love getting exploded by hackers and not being able to do anything about that since pause screen gets cleared on death You love inflation You love constant and incessant disconnects You love 20 minute sessions with 10 seconds of gameplay and 19 minutes and 50 seconds of loading screen You love getting kicked out of stuff you spent hours planning for apparently no good reason You love suddenly being placed in a separate session than the friends you were doing a mission with You love grinding lots of time for small sums just to see megalodon shark buying players explode everything you have on a flying jet bikeIf this list fits you, go for it, buy the game.If not, I suggest maybe trying Payday 2
