GTA Online has been a grindfesty hell ever since it came out, but the single player mode stayed open and fun. Until recently. Take Two took one more thing, OpenIV.While the single player does have a good story, and lots of side content, I cant in good faith recommend a game published by this awful of a developer.Take Two, enjoy the reviews
