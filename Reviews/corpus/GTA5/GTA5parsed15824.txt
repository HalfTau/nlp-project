i been playing it since it was released in 2013 and its too fun and i beat the story mode 4 times and level 330 on online and still too fun i defitenly give this game 10/10 and the game is supported by the devs because they give it dlcs every 1 to 2 months and its just enjoyable and hard to be bored of because all the gamemodes in the game but the community isnt too well in freemode tbh but its still awesome.
