This could be one of the best games youve ever played in years.INSTEAD Taketwo have ruined the modding community and taken players hostage in exchange for Microtransactions.Vehicles added to the game arent accesible in single player. Theyre available online but for a price. A price they want you to pay with microtransactions...If you wanted to buy everything in online you would need to spend well over 70 million in game dollars Trust me I have but not with microtransactions  That is equivalent in rockstars eyes to a smooth 1400Its ridiculousOnly buy if modding comes back. Taketwo deserve nothing until then. This whole thing is so so stupid.
