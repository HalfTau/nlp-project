9/10Really Fun, Lots to do, story mode shows lots of good aspects of the game and is fun as you progress through the story, Online will make you annoyed when you cant afford that 2.5 million dollar car that you really want, and when you get that money you wonder if you should spend that money on that car, online is fun espcially with friends, even through those annoying grindsI will play this game for a while
