Never buying a Take 2 or Rockstar game again. Been playing GTA V since it released on 360 and eageraly waited for it to launch and guess maybe theyre trying to make their games console only cause almost every modding site for GTA V is getting CDs so just  you Take 2. The day you witch hunt like this you alienate your pc playerbase.
