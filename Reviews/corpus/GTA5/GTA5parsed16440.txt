Rockstar took legal action against OpenIV, a group who gave mod creators the tools to install and release them to the public for free, for Rockstars customers. Even after Rockstar made tens of millions on this game, they are too greedy to allow consumers to play offline with mods.Maybe theyll listen to negative reviews, and stop playing dictator. They need to relinquish control over how their customers are using their product.
