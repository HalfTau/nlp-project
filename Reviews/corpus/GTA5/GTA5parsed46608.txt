Due to rockstars efforts to get Take Two to back off, I will be reversing my negative review of GTA V.This will not change the fact that I ABSOLUTELY DESPISE TakeTwo Interactive now since it took rating bombings to force them to come to their senses... What Im basically saying is that I will never forget the actions made against OpenIV, and this will make me question whether or not I will purchase one of their products in the future, even if the developer is Rockstar.
