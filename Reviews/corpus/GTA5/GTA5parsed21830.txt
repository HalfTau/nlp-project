So i only have 9.2 hours on pc however i have many days loged on xbox. Let me start off by saying that this is a fantastic game. Its a beautifule open world that is full of life. Saddly rockstar has destroyed it. With every updat things cost more and more money however you dont make money fast enought to be able to afford it without buying the sharkcards. This runins the game for everyone who cant afford to spend real money or fake money or just refuses to give into microtransactions. 99.99 for 8mill wont even last you 5 min.
