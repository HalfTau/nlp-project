I still dont forgive Rockstar and Take Two for the whole modding incident, even though they have now backtracked their cease and desist.Everything in the game is far too expensive, the grind just to play multiplayer is ridiculous. I was dropped tons of money by a hacker and then thats when the game was interesting, once I had money to do something. They have since then taken all my money and assets off me so now I have nothing again. It just isnt fun to have to grind boring missions just to be able to afford a car. I wished for more single player content but the only way to make that interesting was to use mods.Money grabbers.
