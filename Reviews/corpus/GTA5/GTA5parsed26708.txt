The single player is great for the story, though the sandbox aspect leaves a bit to be desired since you dont really have convenient means of making money after the story while still having tons to spend it on.  Collecting vehicles doesnt work that well since if you lose a vehicle its gone for good.  Its also slightly disappointing that all every female character in the game is either basically insignificant or totally unlikable.  Not sure if that says more about gender roles in general than the writers in particular though considering how much Rockstar loves their satire.   The multiplayer is great when its not being completely destroyed by the rampant modders, which happens about a third of the time, and when you have trustworthy people to play with.  The microtransactions have never really felt neccesary, though the fact that theyre even there is kinda crappy.  Overall its a pretty good game with some notable and possibly highly subjective flaws.Take Two The Publisher recently did some really  stuff to the single player modding scene but it seems Rockstar The Developer managed to talk them into pulling back on it so I feel like its worth giving a reccomendation right now.  This will of course change if Take Two tries to pull some t again.
