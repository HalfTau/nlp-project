OpenIV fiasco aside...modding aside... cause we all know you guys fed up with that..But, what really bothers me and alot of people is the unrealistic and downright criminal prices you expect people to pay for your Shark Cards. 100 real money for 8Million ingame cash.When every new DLC costs 25Million40Million if you want all the vehicles, upgrades, unlocks..etc..etc WTF good is 8Million?? Your price structure on everything from Shark Cards to Merch is bizarre and unbalanced  if you wonder why people mod and manipulate your game, its because nobody enjoys being blatantly ripped off.Irony here, when the ripping off got to much for you guys, you threatened the very same people that mod your game to enhance it and who, at the same time, put food on your table and keep you with a job.STOP ripping off your customers and instead of fighting, why not listen to the community  expand the single player experience with some kind of worthwhile DLC, like people have been begging for. Why not make servers that welcome modders and people that enjoy enhancing the game and getting even more value for money.and..for gods sake..STOP charging criminalesqe, exorbitant prices for your poor value Shark Cards... ugh.. just STOP, we are all embarrassed for you over the shameful greed youve shown...and continue to show
