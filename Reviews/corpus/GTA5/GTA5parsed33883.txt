Ive enjoyed this game immensely, but I dont like Rockstars cavalier and hamhanded attitude about griefers and modders. Shutting down the mod tools for Open games is welcomed, but forcing that same ban on singleplayer and friendsonly games is mean and unnecessary.I have a friend who uses a mod which allows him to 1. adjust his FOV so he doesnt get motionsickness on his wideformat monitor, and 2. use his driving wheel and pedals for driving cars. He only plays in FriendsOnly mode and never in Open. And now hes screwed. Thanks, Rockstar!So Im going to give it a thumbsdown until Rockstar starts making better choices.
