The devs are banning the use of mods entirely, and shutting down all modders. Yes the game is good, but the devs hate fun. The only thing they like is money and therefore the multiplayer component of this game is full of microtransactions. Also, the physics and vehicle damage are massively downgraded from what we had in GTA IV. Multiplayer is full of hackers too btw. Oh, and the mods they are banning are not only online mods to prevent modders from messing up the multiplayer, its banned in singleplayer as well. One more thing, they fired Leslie Benzies, one of the bosses, the one that had all the great ideas, so the future of GTA is looking like we wont get any more good and creative game updates. Dont give these people your money, they dont deserve it. Lets fight back together! join the good fight!
