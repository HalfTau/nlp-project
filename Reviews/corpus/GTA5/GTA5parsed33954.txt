As of recent Grand theft Auto Online is no longer a fun, fair, and enjoyable experience like it once was in 2013. Take Two/ Rockstar Games have realized profit comes from microtransactions shark cards and have cancelled anticpated story DLC in favor for milking you dry. The game is an absolute grind fest and filled with hackers that Rockstar never fix. They release DLC, fix small hacks, new ones come out, rinse and repeat. because with those new DLCs it intices you to buy more shark cards and so they temporally fix hacks to stop from gaining more cash so you cant spend it for real.Not to mention issues with Rocksatr Social Club not working or sigining in and REMOVAL OF SP MODS.
