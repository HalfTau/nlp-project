Lets say we turned a blind eye to shark cards, the extremely low paid missios,  infinite grind to get stuff in game and the tons of hackers doing what they want. Having mods banned its the last straw. In my opinion the way taketwo handles buisiness is downright horrible. And lets not take in the fact that this game still costs 60 euro after almost 4 years. I get it, always more content, but more doesnt mean better... The core gameplay gets boring and the new missions are fun for a few weeks then no one plays them. You really need to shift your focus..And some calculations a yacht costs 8mil a shark card for 8mil costs 74.99You are paing for a damn boat in a game you bought more than the game itself. Its horrible.And the biggest paying mission in game is 300k per player Standard Pacific Job and it takes, including setups, more than one hour for sure maybe two or even 3, i forgot. And that is if you manage to take all the money. You will have to repeat the same mission at least 27 times to manage to buy just the yach.
