If you are getting this For GTA Single player, the game is okay, but the mods a hastle, and the GTAOnline content isnt in the single player game. If you want it for GTAOnline,tThe balance broken, Communication with other players will just get you killed, and youll probobly find the game to grindy because they realy want you to buy the Microtransactions for a 60 game that will leave you disapointed, and driving aimlessly around the world before being blown up by one of the many thing that can just kill you that you cant fight back in any effective manner. At least thats what happened to me.
