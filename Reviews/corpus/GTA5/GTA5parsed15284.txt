Was a great game. Story was pretty good, and the online was impressive. But this was released to the PC so late, that by the time it got here, the game was pretty much dead. Even with their new content, its not enough to revive the game itself. After seeing how big of a step the online multiplayer was to GTA 4, I cannot wait to see what comes in the inevitable GTA 6.
