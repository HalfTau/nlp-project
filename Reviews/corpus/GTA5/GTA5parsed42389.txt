Really Rockstar? I bought this game THREE FCKING TIMES and only bought PC version to use the mods! Dont bother playing online cuz well.. there are a bunch of hackers which are DIFFERENT than modders. The modders that made these mods made an already great game into something even better! But yeah screw them right? Now what else can I do with this game? Would love to get my money back but screw me right?
