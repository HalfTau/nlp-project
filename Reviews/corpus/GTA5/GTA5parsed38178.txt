Confused about this one.On one hand this is one of the greatest games Ive played both campaign, and multiplayer wise.On the other hand the way they handle online progression that push for some of the most boring, and risky grinding makes me hate the game. All it does is incentivize people to hack.Its another case of amazing game ruined by horrible management.
