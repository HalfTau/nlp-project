Meh. The single player is good, adding LSPDFR is fun for a while, but the online is trash unless you actually have a tight group of friends to play with. Playing with PUGS is frought with frustruation, then add on the players that have nothing better to do than follow you around killing you and blowing up your rides and the online becomes tedious to actually accomplish anyting. Its s shame, because when it all works together as intended, it is a whole lot of fun.
