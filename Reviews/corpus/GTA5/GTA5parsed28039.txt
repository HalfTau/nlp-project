This game use to be amazing. Rockstar use to listen to their fans. I was of the many that had money dumped on them. I log in after they fixed it and reduced all assets to 250k. Nothing in this game is cheap and spending hundreds of hours does not net the trouble of what you want. 100 for in game money that may only get your a few things is just insane. New content is just adding insanity to the mix.
