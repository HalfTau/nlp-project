One of the worst things a game company can do is  over their public relations. If they kill the user fanbase, and specifically mods, you kill off one of the main things to keep people coming back to it. This is complete t. Take Two is trying to squeeze every last cent out of their player base, and by ing over OpenIV, they have just ing choked the modding scene to death. This is not something you can do and expect there not to be consequences.
