I bought this game for single player only. Now youre limiting my options to play it as Id like. This game could have eternal playtime with mods. But if you guys just threaten the devs the mod community will die quickly. I get that you dont want cheats in the online game, but well, I paid for this game twice on PS3 and then on PC and I feel cheated too.
