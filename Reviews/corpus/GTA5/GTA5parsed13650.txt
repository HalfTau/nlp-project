Times when I look at San Andreas and I say who would be crazy enough to build a landscape that that? But as a thought I went to Los Angeles 3 years ago myself and its a wonderful city. In other cases GTA 5 is totally different from the real world or just even a complete opposite to reality, Rockstar have created a master piece and is one of the most sophicated game you will ever visit. I look at it and go wild and reminds me at the time when I used to play the GTA series religiously all the time and it has come along way since, I admire on its amazing sunsets, its nightlife atomsphere and the altered colour balance of the world. As a rockstar games fan myself its worth exploring its beautiful distance of Los Santos!To also add Multiplayer is easily unremarkable due to poor lack performance and other users cheating which doesnt make it fun to play online at all...
