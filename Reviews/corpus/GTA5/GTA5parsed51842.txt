Greedy, gredy devs. 60 Micro transactions in a 60 game. Cutted the modding community apart by issueing a cease and desist on the most popular tool for solo mods. They lied about it aiding hack development yet it only aids single player mods, the only reason they did this is to funnel more of the playerbase to online to be able to get more money from SHARK cards.
