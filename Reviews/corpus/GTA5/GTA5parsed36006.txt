Despite what many other people say, I still think GTA is a good game. Now lets be honest though, youre not going to earn enough money to buy a super yacht without hacking. Many players hack. Its extremely rare to see a server without a hacker. However, Rockstar and Take two interactive just shot themselves in the foot with the new anti hack systems in the game. They for the most part got rid of hackers by permanently banning them. Not to mention that the system doesnt always work correctly and it permanently bans people who didnt even hack. GTA, modding is a big part of the game, dont get rid of it like that. Or just make people earn money a lot easier.
