If your ethinking of buying this game now, dont.I cant believe theyre getting rid of mods for single player where there are no microtransactions to impedeThe multiplayer is a grindy piece of garbage unless you pay out of the nose for GTA funbucks and now the single player, the only saving grace of what rightly deserved to be one of the best selling games of all time, cant be modded.How long until we need to pay for micro transactions for a game Ive already payed 50 for? Is my money not good enough?
