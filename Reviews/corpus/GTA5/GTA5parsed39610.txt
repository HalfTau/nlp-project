Bought this game for the mods, but these greedy s have effectively banned mods so that you will be more inclined to play online and purchase Shark Cards. Jokes on them because I now feel more inclined to play Sleeping Dogs and the Saints Row series. If you really want to show them that thisis unacceptable then dont play online at all for as long as you can and lets see how illegal they think modding offline is!
