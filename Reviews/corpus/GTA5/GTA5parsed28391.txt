Take two decided to shut down a modding tool which an entire community of fans used. Many People relied on Open IV to make videos, specifically Youtubers, and without the software, the future of modding for the GTA series look bad, as  the best tool to make videos is now offline, and being online is the whole point.We are working to figure out how we can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players.This response is misleading, as Open IV was used by the Creative Community to make their own creations which is superior to the rockstar editor, which does not include custom textures.Open IV officially does not include hacking, as it actually forces your game to disable the online feature, so it does not affect GTA Online in any way. The ones responsible are the hackers. This is the same as how Greece banned all GAMES to fight online gambling Greece Law 3037/2002. To fight hacking in GTA Online, they banned ALL mods.This proves Take Two is incapable of distinguishing offline modders and ACTUAL online hackers who actually use hack tools. What they should be doing is actually working with the Open IV team to improve the software and restrict the code so that it cannot be used for hacking, or integrate it into all of the supported games. Most hackers use external software, so should Open IV be part of the game, hackers cannot utilize the software to hack, thus removing a reason for shutting down Open IV.Seriously. This is outrageous.
