Ive put a lot of hours into this game as you can tell. A lot of fun was had offline because I was banned form online from the getgo because I had Native TRianer running. That being said, I wasted a lot of time offline trying out all of the mods seeing as I hjave beaten this game twice on console.Needless to say because everyone else here,  I cannot give this game a good rating. Sure. It works. But theres no fun to be had in single player if you cant play with the mods out there. Mods are GTA Vs life support. Hacking online has been an issue across all platforms not just PC. Blaming OpenIV for that is abscentminded and stupid. Theres obviously some sort of bottom line here that TakeTwo wants to meet. It just doesnt make any sense to blame OpenIV, an OFFLINE tool, for the hacking online. Not just that, but over two years inot the games life on PC.At the end of the day, TakeTwo is the same TakeTwo they always have been, only now people are finally aware of it. I cant support a company that makes up false excuses in a pathetic attemntp to draw more audience to their online mode amd subsequently attmept to generate more revenue via Shark cards.TakeTwo, youre just as bad as Ubisoft, Activision, and Konami. At least EA is making strides to improve. All you publishers care about is money which is what makes me hate this industry more and more every day the more and more I read about it and the nonsense that goes on, and also how you people essentially treat your studios and employees like work horses.Its a shame we have people who identify as gamers who mindlessly buy everything thats thrown at them no matter how miserable these publishers treat their clientel. Like an abusive relationship. You can forget about Borderlands 3. You guys arent getting another ccent from me until you fix this.
