Load times are stupidly long, as a dad with kids I cant wait 1015 min just to start a game. I have a dozen other games I can start playing in under 1min. Plus I cant make money playing 13 times a week, you need to be able to dedicate some heavy time to this game.Also I had planned on playing with my friends and using mods like there were for previous versions. Can do hardly any modding, and definitely not multiplayer. a waste of money.
