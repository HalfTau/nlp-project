the story is ing fantastic. thats the only good thing i can say about it now unfortunately, i bought the pc version solely for modding as i already own the ps3 and ps4 versions and got bored after playing through the story multiple times. modding kept the game fresh, if it wasnt for mods my 195 hours of playtime would probably be sitting at around 6, only having played the story and online for a few hours each... unfortunately the main thing that drew me to this game for so long has been stopped so i cannot recommend this game until mods get reinstaded.
