I bought the PC version solely because of the modding scene. I love mods like REDUX and real life cars mostly which now I cant use and theres almost no point to playing this game anymore because now its so boring. I bought specific PC parts just to be able to make it looks as good as it did with those mods and now it doesnt matter. Utter BS that the modding commuity for this game had to have been shut down in the form of a massive lawsuit. This game and its developers deserve the Overwhelmingly Negative reviews.Formally,Fck You Rockstar and Take Two Interactive.
