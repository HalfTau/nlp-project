This is the last RS / T2 game I will have bought. These companies are literally only interested in your money, and dont give damn about any fun that you might have with their game. In fact, they actively work towards preventing you having fun while playing their game and start threatening you with legal action if youre having too much fun modding. this Stuff your dollars up your arses, T2! See if that makes you happy!
