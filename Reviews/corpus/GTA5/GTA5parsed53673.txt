The game itself is great, Or at least it was until Rockstar and TakeTwo  Interactive stripped most of the free modded content from the single player game in an effort to force more people into the multiplayer part of the game where Rockstar and TakeTwo interactive have such wonderful PAID content for everyone to enjoy. YOU Rockstar, and  YOU TakeTwo Interactive. If I could get a refund on a two year old game, I would. But I cant, so Ill just resolve to NEVER buy a product either company is ever connected to from this day forward. You have lost a customer of over 10 years this day.GAME 10/10DEVELOPER/PUBLISHER 0/10
