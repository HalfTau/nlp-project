Out of all the time spent playing GTA V, I spent more time in single player making my own mods and liveries. As a whole, GTA V is an awesome game.The single player has a great story to it and is fun to play.You play as three main characters Michael De Santa, Franklin Clinton  Trevor Philips.All of which have their own abilities and personalities.The map of San Andreas is huge with a butt load of stuff to do.If you wanna play Golf, Go for it.If you wanna rob stores, You can do that too.Take to the skies and engage in dog fights if you wish.The possibilities are almost endless.The amount of customizable stuff in GTA V is massive. From Clothes to cars to guns.The graphics are pretty good and can upgraded using mods.The soundtrack is awesome too. With the PC version you can add your own custom music and have it as an ingame radio station.As for the Multiplaer, this game gose down hill fast.Back in my XBox 360 days, the multiplayer was awesome. I had so much fun playing it until they reset my rank for no reason. This was my back on my 360 when I had no clue about modsAll the multiplayer is about is stupid stunt racing now. And you cant buy anything without buying Shark Cards.Its become a pay to win game. You cant beat anyone in a race unless you buy upgrades for your car with the Shark Card money.Grinding has become a huge part of multiplayer now and its sucked all the fun right out of it.As for Take Two  R shuting down Open IV Used for single player mods only I dont really see any point playing GTA V anymore.The mods made this game fantastic and much more fun to play. Without Open IV, I would never have bought GTA for PC.RIP GTA  The modding community.
