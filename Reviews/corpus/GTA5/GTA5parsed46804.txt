No, i do not recommend this game.Ive played every single gta since i was a kid, and loved every single one of them.Even this one, which i own and played in 3 different consoles. BUT, being a single player kind of guy, when i bought this game on PC, it was for the fantastic mods the community worked so hard on for those who hate being forced to play the unplayable online mode you guys apparantly care and milk so much.Now? The game is useless, once again, thanks to you guys. So yeah. My opinion might not matter at all, but nontheless, you lost a fan.And by the looks of things, you are gonna keep loosing fans.
