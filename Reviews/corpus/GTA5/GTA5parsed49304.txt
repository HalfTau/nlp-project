Theyre trying to take modding away from us. The ONLY reason I and many others purchased this game in the first place is because GTA is great for modding. This company is extremely anticonsumer and they obviously do not care for PC gamers at all, so I say it right back to them.Do not support this company. They hate you and want to stick you for all your money. If I was still within the refund window, I would do that immediately.
