This game is what modern 20172018 AAA titles should look up to. The single player is extremely fun and the multiplayer is just as fun.Yes the online side of the game is quite grindy, but the grind doesnt seem to bore me. Which makes this game a gem.There are hackers and there are plenty of modders but please dont make that influence your decision as you can create a private online session.I give this game a 9.5/10
