After pulling finds from players,  not fixing any bugs, and making it impossible to play the heists without getting aimbotted by the AI, I had to write a review. Didnt work at launch, Doesnt work now. Just a sad, broken console port that no love went into developing. Just a money grab on a former beloved franchise. R.I.P Grand Theft Auto, I will always hold your former games in my heart. Do not waste your money.
