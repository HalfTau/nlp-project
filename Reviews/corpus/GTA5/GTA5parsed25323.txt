Modding brought a lot of fun into gta5 singleplayer and brought some hilarious youtube videos. but by banning it after letting the program grow that the gta5 staff knew existed, why not just make a patch that scans the game before letting the player onto the gta5 online world.Thanks TakeTwo. Thank you very much. best choice.OLD review aboveSo mods are back on singleplayer, but a few sites died because of the cease and desist action.there is still a few cheaters online that somehow are under the radar.
