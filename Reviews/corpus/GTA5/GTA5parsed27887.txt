gta is a joke. Rockstar and take two are aweful companies. They never listen to their consumers and apparently sales numbers. How long does it take to make a sequel to rdr which was one of their highest selling games. Now they are trying to limit modding for gtav because a few online money hackers... boo fricken hooo. Now you dont get to micro transaction people for virtual money. Lame. Apparently in this day and age, if you bought it you dont own it.
