I mean if you have a lot of friends willing to play with you this game is great but if you playing on your own then you will have no money and have no fun in this game unless you likegetting killed by the people who have put 60 into this game so hey can get a virtualbike that shoots rockets.If You like pay to win games then whatever.I dont really care for the story it would do better as a movie not a game theyres to many cutscenes.I like to just free roam with my friend soooo whatever floats your boat
