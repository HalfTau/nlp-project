You know, I remember when they announced this game. I was hyped, I thought it would be like San Andreas again. Instead we got a lackluster main story that does a total 360 and ends with nothing having changed for any of the characters and boring or just poorlywritten plotlines. Then GTA Online happened. Instead of being like GTA IV Online with more to do and fun game modes and being able to  around, it follows an awful MMOstyled design method where the work is repetitive and boring, the pay is awful, and everything is insanely expensive so you are forced to either grind the same highpaying work over and over, or pay real life money for ingame cash so you can actually enjoy your 60 game.And thats not even including Take Twos absolutely  stance on modding. Instead of keeping their policy of keeping mods in singleplayer, they have issued a completely unfounded and unlawful Cease and Desist to the OpenIV team, who have designed and maintained the key modding tool for the game. Without it, mods are nigh impossible to make/install/update. So on top of the game itself being lackluster and designed to sap money from its playerbase, now modding is essentially banned so that players are unable to get new, fresh content and gameplay in their singleplayer experience, and instead are forced to wait for content updates to come that they must grind/pay real money for.This game is the embodiment of everything that is wrong with the game industry today. Basically zero focus on singleplayer experiences, multiplayer designed with microtransactions in mind, and absolutely backwards views and stances towards modding. Do not waste your money, just get San Andreas and install Multi Theft Auto or San Andreas Multiplayer.
