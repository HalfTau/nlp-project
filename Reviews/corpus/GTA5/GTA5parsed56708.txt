I greatly enjoyed playing the singleplayer campaign however the multiplayer is a mess of hackers, over expensive weapons and vehicles, jobs paying little in the way of ingame cash, and an unfair advantage to those that choose to buy ingame currency with real world cash.Every game update is focused on multiplayer and in a twist of sheer dickery, none of the new multiplayer content  vehicles, weapons, etc, is available in singleplayer and the game actively removes such vehicles and items when spawned in via mods players where able to get round this with an additional mod and just lately TakeTwo have completely shut down that mod even after the developers have repeated stated for years that singleplayer mods where OK.So the modding scene is now completely dead, multiplayer a complete waste of time unless your willing to invest more money on top of the purchase of the game and even then your are the mercy of hackers who are practically untouchable, and singleplayer has been left alone since its first release with no new dlc at all.
