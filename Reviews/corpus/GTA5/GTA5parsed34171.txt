I bought GTA 5 on xbox and beat it. It is my favorite single player game of all time.  I bought the PC version with the intention of modding it to access the incredible content developed later, but which was deprived to us solo players.  By removing modding support from their title, Take2 has retroactively thrown my money down the drain.  Community based mods are, and always have been, the primary reason for the supremacy of PC gaming.  I personally never downloaded OpenIV, but action against a benign third party mod is an action against all benign community mods.
