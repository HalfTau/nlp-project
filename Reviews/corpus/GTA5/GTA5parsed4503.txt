GTA started on pc... now its this. What happened to GTA? Online I would assume ed it all up. I just want to play single player to be honest. How hard would it be to include these missions and new added content for solo? NPCs are smart enough to fight... why are they not good enough for me to build a crew with and try the heists? Give choices as to who you want to hire, each with different stats and pay outs for their service. Maybe I need a guy who can specialize in explosives, but out of my options there is only one who can be hired Which costs more.Its just and idea.Take away the t option to buy money and maybe us old schoolers would find interest online again. The whole point of games is to earn your place High Scores. We play games to feel the pride or ego of accomplishing things we might not be able to do in real life Commit murder under complete stealth. Give me the option to pretty much cheat online and the reason turns into chaos alot sooner than if only a few people had the time put in and the higher levels to cause such chaos we see rampant on the servers I know, I know. Theres those damn Hackers. But personally RockStr, Your greed is costing you my personal interest in the franchise... and I have been with you since day one... I guess theres plenty of young dumb generations to come that will make my opinion seem stupid.... Wheres my Sega Genisis...All in all I will always be a pc gamer, and ultimately I will just have to deal with it. But I can complain on my little box every once in a while. So yea... and stuff like that.P.S. I recommend this game because, well. I dont hate the game, just the practice of seeing how much they can pull us for.
