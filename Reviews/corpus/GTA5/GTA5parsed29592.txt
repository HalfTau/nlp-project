Rockstar went from the best developers to even worse than Ubisoft and EA in just 1 game. Not only have they gone money hungry, focusing on microtransactions, as such ignoring the single player, but now they even banned a single player only mod tool, making 99 of mods incompatible. As such, this game is truly dead for me. I play this for singleplayer, not multiplayer. I even bought this game on the PC had it for the PS3 for the mods, making this game truly useless and bad purchase now.
