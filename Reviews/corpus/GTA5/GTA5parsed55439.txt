Taketwo have there heads so far up their own asses over antimodding policys thats they have sent a cease and desist order to openiv. The backbone of the modding community. After all thethat they have been doing to gta behind the scenes, i can say that i will no longer support ANYTHING owned by TakeTwo. Witch is a shame as RDR2 comes out soon
