Honest opinion, Rockstar is money hungry. Simple, but ill go indepth why im giving this game a bad review I make scripts for gta, and in my own stupid fault, i forgot to take my scripts out of my Mods folder before i loaded Gta Online. As why i am banned. Partly my fault, but then if Rockstar didnt worry about making DLCs to profit off, they could fix their anticheat so thatdoesnt happen, and get rid of all the hackers and make the game better. But the latest DLC for me was Ill Gotten Gains part 2 I think as a Yacht costed 8,000,000 Bucks, And the new cars costed 1,000,000 minus a few, so i farmed GTA for a day straight just to get that Progen T20, i could have made a script and spawned billions, but then what fun is that, i can only drive that car, theres no goal. Ill stop rambling and  off now, but be careful buying gta nowadays, as every lobby will emphasis on WILL have a hacker in it, whether hes blatant, or trys to hide it, there will be a hacker that ruins your fun, and youre going to need to have ing doctors wages to be able to afford every DLC.
