ive played the game so much and i really like it a lot of updates and so many ways you can play so many modes.. in other words this game is complete fun, but actually i have one issue and its the bad connection i know it may be my connection but why rockstar dont upgrade it servers how many people would experience better gameplay when having a better ping or even be able to connect to the server, all of these problems and still cant say no so anyway please rockstar upgrade your servers or add new ones or idk just fix it..
