I loved this game. One of my most played games of all time. I bought it for the 360, xbone, and on pc. I even put another 20 into it because I love the game. Countless hours spent having fun doing randomwith friends. It still is a wonderful game, aside from the grinding to get anything of course. A lot of people blame this game for bringing microtransactions to the gaming industry, but I disagree. The microstranactions in this game are different and are present to allow them to release content for free. At least when you buy a shark card you know exactly what you are getting and exactly what you can get for it in game unlike every other game with microtransactions. Even behind all the grinding and other players being s, it is still a fun game to go back to toaround with friends on.
