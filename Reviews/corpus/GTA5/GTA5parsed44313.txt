Since the og San Andreas it was fun for me to mod GTA, now theyve shown they dont like the community creating their own content if theyre not profiting from it.Screw you TakeTwo I hope R can lit a fire under yourand tell you to allow mods.Espically since 99 of them were for SINGLE PLAYER ONLY. The actual hackers had their own seperate tools, OpenIV is/was not one of them.
