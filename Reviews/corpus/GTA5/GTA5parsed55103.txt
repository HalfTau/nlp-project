Take 2 have decided to remove modding from single player in an effort to kill online modding. What they did not consider, however, is that single player modding and online modding are two separate techniques entirely, and by shutting down OpenIV they have done nothing but remove single player modding fun. Where once they promised to allow modding on the PC version of the game, they have now completely and utterly ed their fanbase out of sheer incompetence and ignorance. For shame. Im sure they will continue their moneygrubbing, anticonsumer practices for years to come, and RDR2 which will get a PC release after consoles have made money will be plagued with the same nonsense.
