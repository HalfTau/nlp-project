The online version of this game is a really great game with heaps to do but is completely ruined by a phone that keeps popping up on the screen and constantly ringing and it doesnt shut up EVER.  While you can stop the sound, the phone continually pops up onto the screen and while it is on the screen you cant select weapons or aim weapons and after twenty hours of playing the game I now regret my descision to buy the game as I dont want to play it anymore simply because the phone wont stop ringing and it continually interrupts the gameplay and is literally driving me ing crazy.  I play games to get away from annoying phone calls, idiot people who I dont want to talk to and work.  The last thing I want in a game is a phone that I cant get rid of, or turn off that literally interrupts the gameplay every fifteen to thirty seconds or so.  Now I remember why I didnt buy this game years ago, when it first came out, because the ing phone just wont stop ringing and interrupting gameplay.  Why they put this phone in that stops you aiming, stops you selecting weapons and that wont stop annoying the  out of you and completely ruining the gameplay, I have no idea, I will never buy a GTA game ever again and will go back to playing GTA3 San Andreas, if I want an open world do whatever the  you want game.  They have made a great game with great graphics and heaps of missions and then just completely destroyed it all with a poxy phone that never stops ringing and interrupting gameplay and driving the player crazy.  The offline version of the game doesnt do this as much and its the only part of the game I can play without wanting to put my fist though the poxy phone on the screen.  After two hours of the poxy phone ringing and ringing and driving me nuts I just cant play the online version of this game.  Also, THERE IS STILL NO SUPPORT FOR JOYSTICK OR WHEEL AND THIS GAME HAS PLANES AND CARS IN IT.  LIKE, WHAT THE ING ?
