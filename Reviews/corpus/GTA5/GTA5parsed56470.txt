Very recently Take two banned an integral mod allowing most other GTA mods to work meaning that the PC single player is now less fun and the multiplayer is a microtransaction laden hellhole of which i would rather burn my arms off thean play unless they alow mods back into the single player this game is a 60 waste of money.
