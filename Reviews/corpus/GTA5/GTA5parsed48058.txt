Take Two interactive have gone after modding teams that only allow singleplayer mods and doesnt touch the online at all. This is aimed at making people stop playing singleplayer and play the online mode where they keep forcing microtransactinos down everyones throats. It is a sad day when they send a cease and desist for a mod tool that wont effect anyone else and significantly improves the singleplayer experience. The whole point of the PC platform is that its more open than a locked down console and you can experiment more with your games. Do not support this company as their stance on modding is entirely in the wrong. Please purchase other games.
