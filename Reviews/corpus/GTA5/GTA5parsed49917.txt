Its a good game, dont get me wrong. Just  publisher who wants to make more money off of microtransactions cough, shark cards And is trying to force more people into Online. Now I cant even have fun in single player anymore. Also already had this game before steam, had the disc install version so I have many more hours than the current 1 on record.
