Even though Rockstar wrongfully banned my GTA Online account zAHerobrineAz, I have enjoyed the game and especially with Rockstar allowing mods, I can play the game better.I recommend this game as GTA V is very enjoyable, has very good graphics, gameplay and there are TONS of things to do Online as well as on Story Mode that doesnt have so much to do then 100 completion.
