Definitely one of my favorite games of all times.ProsHas impressive graphics for the time if was released you can also download graphics mods for singleplayer.Has a multiplayer that is easy to play with friends.Has incredible replayability.Has a great open world with several things to do in it.Is open to modding.Has an incredibly accurate map of Los Angelas.ConsRockstar patches out glitches that arent really breaking the game. For instance, rockstar patched out several wall breaches around the map of Los Santos.It is hard to get lots of money to buy the dlc vehicles/whatever they release without grinding missions or heists for days.The game still has some bugs, such as the Purchase all ammo bug in GTA Online.In conclusion, if you have a friend to play with, this is a must have game in your library. If you dont have a friend to play with, but you enjoy a good, long story, this is a good game to have for the singleplayer. If you want to have incredible graphics and/or mod the game definitely buy this game, as, in my opinion, this game is the perfect game to mod.This is a perfect 10/10 for me
