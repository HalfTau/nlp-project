Singleplayer Decent angry man simulator. Some pretty cool missions.MultiplayerAlmost unplayable. Hackers will go out of their way to ruin the expierience everyones expirience in the session. I just got police cars spawned on me, sometimes they jsut spawn explosions and kill everyone and their vehicles even if they are in passive mode.Heists are unplayable with randoms, guess an  simulator doesnt really lend itself well to highly coordinated teamplay.Almost every mission is instanced so in order to do something you have to load into a lobby.If you have like 3 other people you want to play with in voicechat get it and play private mode only but otherwise jsut dont get it for the multiplayer not worth it.Rockstar has apparently no interest in actually fixing the hacker problem which als odirectly affects their microtransaction sales shark cards. If someone can simply cheat money and give it to everyone on the server as if that ever happens then guess what, they wont buy your overpriced items Rockstar.One the plus side the Multiplayer gets regularily updated if new stuff that you have to have a certain amount of cash to even use so its usually jsut grinding and grinding.There is also no real feel of a community to this game because well its an  simulator so thats what most people are, hacking, griefing, running through the streets with a tank or ruining your heist missions you spend half an hour setting up because they just start trolling.IF you want to play heists and rob stuff seriously buy Payday 2. Its a lot better game in that regard and most people will actually try to work toward the goal. Its also not filled with stupid isntant fail missions that require someone to stay in the air for 30min jsut flying around doing nothing while 2 people have to clear out an entire prison by themselves.TL/DRGet it if you are only interested in the single player but wait for a sale or if you have friends to play wit hand only play private.Otherwise dont.
