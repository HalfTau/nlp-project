Taking legal action against mod creators that have supported the game more than the actual company themselves and effectively destroying the mod community completely is questionable.The story is good, but I suggest instead you go watch an entire story driven movie version of it on youtube instead, as the combat is unintuitive and hasnt changed since GTA 3 anyways.Online play is completely riddled with hackers which Rockstar nor Take Two have done anything about in any way whatsoever  but for some reason they go after single player only mods instead. Not to mention Take Two recently stating that they feel as if they arent taking enough of our money.Its a fantastic game, but you shouldnt support it and I wish I could refund it.
