Is this game fun? Yes. Do I believe I got my moneys worth? Yes.However, this doesnt excuse what T2 has done. They sent cease and desists to singleplayer modders in order to stop MP cheaters. Guess what? 2 days after this new update, with mods being stopped, I encountered 2 cheaters in the span of 2 hours. Both were randomly killing and/or teleporting people. And I lost 14mil because some amount of it was received from a money dropper before the update. So good job, Take Two. Punish innocent players while the cheaters still run rampant. Why? Because the cheaters have to pay another 60 for the game. And Take Two only cares about their margins. Dont buy this until T2 fixes what theyve done.
