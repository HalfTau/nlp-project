So it seems TakeTwo finally backed down from their witchhunt on singleplayer mods and thereforeis available again. In Conclusion, this leads me to give the game its wellearned recommendation now. Although that just refers to the singleplayer experience, because I still dont care for the online part.Video games publisher TakeTwo Interactive has forced the highly popular and perfectly legal modding toolto close down development and distribution.If you care about GTA V and its mods or just for the freedom of PC gaming in general Speak with your wallet dont buy this game!And if you already own GTA V Dont touch it! Leave it alone let it rest in your Steam library. Because for greedy game companies like TakeTwo Interactive the number of concurrent users ccu, how many people play their sht, is much more important than just Steam reviews.If you like, you can also sign this partitionBtw GTA V singleplayer is great I personally dont care for online, its a terrible experience anyway hint thats not OpenIVs fault
