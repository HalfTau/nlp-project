Great storyline and epic missions, vast open world, but GTA Online full of cheaters, hackers and bullies yeah, you could get ban because those cheaters. If you buy this game for offline mode, thats ok. If you buy this game for online mode and you doesnt have any friend, oh boy, you fcked ! The server freaking bad !!! The time it takes to join a session, you could built another paramid in Egypt.
