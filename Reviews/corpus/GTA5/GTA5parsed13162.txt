The single player is pretty good. Standard GTA fair. Now I must rant about online.Rockstar has the gall to keep this game at retail price, 4 years after the games release, and charge microtransactions to such an extent that there is no way to keep up with all the cool stuff in the game.Every 3 months or so, a big update happens where in order to use any of the stuff, you need to buy in a couple million dollars, or around 5 months of your life constantly grinding. Then, it makes using the cool stuff you bought tedious by using bunkers, garages and pegasus vehicles which operate on a timer.The worst part is the hacking. Rockstar does less than nothing to monitor people spawning in tanks and teleporting all over the map to troll you while you grind away to get a car that isnt very good. Then they spawn a guitar shoved directly up your  that launches you into space. Guess what? That one follows you to other sessions. Meaning you have to completely leave and reenter online a 10 minute process due to abysmal load times only to get in a server with another hacker.
