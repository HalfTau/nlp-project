I really enjoyed the single player with its story line and overall atmosphere, which was a great refresh after GTA IV.However, the online aspect of the game is terrible in my opinion.Incredibly long waiting times, which means no fast games to kill some little timeRequires a long time of grinding to get a bit decent, or youll have to spend plenty of real moneyDevelopment is apparently only focused on online, with single player not receiving some of the stuff.Furthermore, the publisher has shown a hostile stance against the modding and overall gaming community which in my opinion does not deserve the 60 euros this game costs. Rather spend your money on something that doesnt disappoint you, like booze.
