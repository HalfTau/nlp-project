Ive had this game for sooooo long and it used to be fun... BUT JESUS CHRIST, thein this game is expensive and the shark card dont even give you enough for very much of the things you can buy.. IDK if ill ever even play again because now my game crashes apon loading the world up. even in single player. If you dont want people to mod, lower the damn prices! its already a 60 game!
