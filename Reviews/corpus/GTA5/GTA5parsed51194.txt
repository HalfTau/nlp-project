modding was the primary reason i bought this game. and i think i can say this for a lot of people And when Take Two makes the the OpenIV team their tool down, which is a tool for modding SINGLEPLAYER. it makes me not want to play gta v anymore. to be honest i really do not care about online, because it is is filled with people who kill you everytime you spawn, also you cant progress in the game with out paying for a shark card. Take Two did this because they do not make any money from people who play singleplayer, so they make the developers at open iv team take their tool down so people had no choice but to play online, but all Take Two is doing is losing people.
