This game is quite fairly good for the price other than the fact that Rockstar hasnt lifted their fatass and fix the modding community. Rockstar is like mineplex a minecraft server that I use to play on. Mineplexs antichat wasand all they did to fix it was pick up a coder that knew basic code and made him works hours daily. Thats a decently comparable to what Rockstar is doing at the moment to the modding community.
