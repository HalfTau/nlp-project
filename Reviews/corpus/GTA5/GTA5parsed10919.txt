One of the best games Ive played in my life but, there are too many cheaters that are called as modder and Rockstar is doing nothing. Thats why I left the game months ago. Rockstar should be more strict while banning those people but, I think they are not checking the people even. Same think happened also in the late times of Grand Theft Auto IV. Rockstar doesnt care about the game after 2 years of releasing time.
