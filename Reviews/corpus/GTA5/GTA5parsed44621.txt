This game is fun only when you play with friend. The rest of this game except singleplayer is just bad. When you meet a player in public session he immediately starts shooting you with no reason. Most gta players are just unfriendly jerks.. The biggest reason why I dont reccomend this game is rokstar games  sorry i need to censore vulgarisms. I hate them so much!! Theyre capitalistic idiots with no feelings. Every month they release new gta online update which includes new cars for 414466564  why???? Money in gta are extremely rare and how am I supposed to buy one of these vehicles?? You can do fun jobs like races but you wont get much money or you will spend 6 hours playing heist which gives you only circa half a million. So if you want to buy one of these vehicles you have to buy expensive shark cards. Some of you maybe heard about that rckstar games prohibited OpenIV which is software that allows you to mod in singleplayer, why? Im really sad and upset. Modding in SP didnt even affect buying shark cards. BRIEF I DONT RECCOMEND THIS GAME!!! YOU SHOULDNT BUY IT
