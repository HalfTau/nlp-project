The state of GTAV right now is extremly poor. The negative backlash from the attempted banning of OpenIV has cost Rockstar a large amount of customers and resulting in an Overwhelmingly Negative review state. Surely thats not what GTAV, one of the biggest and best open world games deserves right? Well when you centralise your game around making money, it will innevitably be badly recieved by your customers. They dont want to spend anymore than what they paid initially to be able to access the in game content in a reasonable amount of time. And why should they? What the updates of GTAV have become are boring, slow, uninspired and repetitive missions that dont give you nearly as much money as they should. In my opinion even if the money in GTAV was tripled, it would still result in a game with an incredibly large amount of grinding. Im honestly suprised at this point that Rockstar didnt charge us for these DLCs. However the new vehicles are very fun to mess around with but they are incredibly expensive. In the end, Rockstar just wants to make you spend money on their awful shark cards and suprise suprise, even they are overpriced. The most expensive is 60 for 8 mill and that isnt even enough to buy all the new vehicles or even a fully upgraded yacht but who would want that anyway because they are beyond useless.In conclusion, if you want to mess around in an open world game with friends, go for it. But if you want a good vehicle or house or garage or just about anything, be prepared to do heist after heist or delivery mission after delivery mission for what will pretty much be something that you can play around with for a few hours at most. What an incredibly unsatisfying game this is.   Actual Rockstar headquaters
