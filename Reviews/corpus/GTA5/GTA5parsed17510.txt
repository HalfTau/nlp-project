I spent the entire weekend downloading this game. And the first thing I get is a wall of obnoxious controls.There are 3 buttons for 3 similar things, stealth, crouch and take cover. I spent 10 minutes configuring the game and the next 20 trying to tolerate the controls.In the end Ive requested a refund and had more fun with LEDs and batteries on my desk in 5 minutes than I did with this game in 20
